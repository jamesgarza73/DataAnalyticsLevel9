Baraca finds Mendieta, who immediately releases Aimar into space with only Barthez to beat from an angle, but he shoots well wide of the far post 28 Baraca lobs the ball over the top to Carew in space on the far right side of the United area; Silvestre comes sliding in to disposess. 30 Aimar very unlucky to be caught offside when he would have been away on goal. 33 Butt gives away a free-kick 35 yards out; Valencia immediately win another 25 yards out and square-on to goal but Mendieta fails to to hit the target. 36 Beckham momentarily distracted wide on the right when he spots the linesman's stupendous moustache. 38 Sheringham floored by a knee in the back from Ayala; bizarrely, Sheringham is penalised. 39 United show signs of sitting back - bags of space opening up on the left for the home team but no one too willing to use it. Doesn't help having Giggs off the field. 40 Kily plays it out left from the edge of the area for Carboni to cross; wins a corner. Comes to nothing. Continued Valencia pressure before United break through the middle. Ends with Butt having a go from distance - straight at Canizares. 43 Valencia free-kick just outside the United area. Aimar thumps it and Barthez claims on the half-volley. 45 Another free-kick for Valencia in United's half; comes to nothing. Lots of movement from Valencia in response to United giving the ball away too much. Half-time. 46 Valencia get the second half underway. Scholes and Cole work the ball down the left before Cole is caught offside. 48 Silvestre starts to push up on the left in an attempt to fill the hole left by Giggs. 49 Booking Butt for chopping down Mendieta. 50 Kily does well to get past Beckham and Keane to the left of the United area. He plays a one-two and shoots for Barthez to save. 51 Keane pulls the ball back for Butt to shoot from 20 yards out; deflected clear. 53 Carboni plays a one-two with Aimar deep on the left for Valencia, but his great cross across the face of goal finds no one. 54 Valencia corner. Mendieta takes, Pellegrino heads down for Butt to clear; played back in for Barthez to claim. 59 Sweeping move involving Sheringham and Keane in the middle of the park allows Silvestre to get away and cross from near the by-line. 62 Stam gets in a cross from the by-line but Valencia clear. 63 Booking / substitution Beckham / Solskjaer on for Sheringham. 65 Substitution Sanchez on for Angulo. 66 United now effectively playing with only one up front and a five-man midfield. 68 Keane slices at a shot from a Solskjaer cross on the left. 69 Solskjaer burgles Angloma in the middle of the pitch; United get the edge of the area but the pitch lets them down and Valencia clear. Lots of huff and puff this half but nothing to raise the blood pressure. 71 Solskjaer races down the left, gets away from Angloma and crosses across the face of goal after Cole fails to get a touch. 74 Booking Baraca after he has a go at Beckham for a challenge in which the United player in fact got a foot on the ball, despite going in heavily. Lots of nattering at the ref from Valencia players, so the ref feels obliged to have a word with Beckham. 76 Substitution Vicente on for Kily. 78 Beckham avoids rising to the challenge after Carboni hacked him down and earned himself a booking. 80 Neville does well to get the better of Vicente near the by-line and cross through the six-yard box; Cole unable to get a touch. 86 Baraca denied an equaliser when he gets his head to a cross and Scholes clears off the line. 87 OWN GOAL: Manchester United 1 - 1 Valencia Bummer for United; Wes Brown deflected in from a Vicente close-range effort. 89 Abelda on for Aimar. 90 Not a lot to play for now as both teams try to make sure they don't lose. Pretty dull stuff for the entire match in fact, but full credit to Valencia for plugging away and forcing a point in a game that never really took off. Full-time: Manchester United 1 - 1 Valencia.",

      "body": "<p>Three British tourists were among four people killed when a bus taking holiday-makers on a nocturnal wildlife trip in Tasmania plunged off a narrow dirt track and rolled down an embankment. </p> <p>Two of the dead were a couple from Scotland. The third British victim was Judith Franklin, 63, from Little Abington, near Cambridge. Her 67-year-old husband, Colin, was treated in hospital for minor injuries. </p> <p>All 14 others in the minibus, including the guide and 23-year-old driver, were injured in the crash on Sunday night in the Cradle Mountain national park, north west Tasmania. Hobart police said three Australians and three Britons remained in hospital last night. One British woman was in a critical condition. </p> <p>The party, including tourists from the US and New Zealand, was on a guided search for Tasmanian devils, Bennett's wallabies and wombats that make up the region's unique nocturnal wildlife. </p> <p>Their bus pulled to one side of the road to let a national parks vehicle pass. </p> <p>Colin and Judith Franklin's son, Stephen, spoke to his father on the telephone after the accident. \"He remembers the bus pulling over and then the front wheel just started to slide,\" he said. </p> <p>Inspector Matthew Richman of Hobart police said: \"The bus appears to have toppled from the road and rolled down some 33 metres, coming to rest upside down against a tree.\" </p> <p>Parks and wildlife spokesman Hank Schinkel said the ranger in the other vehicle noticed the Mazda minibus had disappeared from view, and raised the alarm when he returned to find it crashed. </p> <p>Inspector Richman said police had yet to determine the precise cause of the accident, which happened on a dry road in clear weather, but confirmed there was no collision involved and no mechanical failure. </p> <p>Rod Stendrup, general manager of Cradle Mountain lodge, which organised the evening tour of the world heritage-listed national park, said the accident was \"very distressing\". </p> <p>He said the night tours were a long-established attraction and his staff knew the roads well. \"Unfortunately something went wrong last night. It's quite a narrow section of road and it drops off very sharply.

      "bodyText": "Three British tourists were among four people killed when a bus taking holiday-makers on a nocturnal wildlife trip in Tasmania plunged off a narrow dirt track and rolled down an embankment. Two of the dead were a couple from Scotland. The third British victim was Judith Franklin, 63, from Little Abington, near Cambridge. Her 67-year-old husband, Colin, was treated in hospital for minor injuries. All 14 others in the minibus, including the guide and 23-year-old driver, were injured in the crash on Sunday night in the Cradle Mountain national park, north west Tasmania. Hobart police said three Australians and three Britons remained in hospital last night. One British woman was in a critical condition. The party, including tourists from the US and New Zealand, was on a guided search for Tasmanian devils, Bennett's wallabies and wombats that make up the region's unique nocturnal wildlife. Their bus pulled to one side of the road to let a national parks vehicle pass. Colin and Judith Franklin's son, Stephen, spoke to his father on the telephone after the accident. \"He remembers the bus pulling over and then the front wheel just started to slide,\" he said. Inspector Matthew Richman of Hobart police said: \"The bus appears to have toppled from the road and rolled down some 33 metres, coming to rest upside down against a tree.\" Parks and wildlife spokesman Hank Schinkel said the ranger in the other vehicle noticed the Mazda minibus had disappeared from view, and raised the alarm when he returned to find it crashed. Inspector Richman said police had yet to determine the precise cause of the accident, which happened on a dry road in clear weather, but confirmed there was no collision involved and no mechanical failure. Rod Stendrup, general manager of Cradle Mountain lodge, which organised the evening tour of the world heritage-listed national park, said the accident was \"very distressing\". He said the night tours were a long-established attraction and his staff knew the roads well. \"Unfortunately something went wrong last night. It's quite a narrow section of road and it drops off very sharply. The bus, from what I understand, stopped to let a car go the other way and the edge of the road just crumbled and it rolled over.\" Mr Stendrup said the dirt road was wide enough for two vehicles to pass slowly. Inspector Richman said it was too early to say whether the edge of the dirt road had collapsed, causing the bus to overturn. The busy tourist track was shut for most of yesterday as police accident investigators and a coroner examined the site of the accident, three miles from the Cradle Mountain visitor centre. Police admitted the rescue effort was hampered by a lack of light on the remote road until a generator arrived several hours after rescue crews reached the bus. Tour operators claimed that some of the national park's narrow gravel roads were inadequate for the 140,000 holidaymakers who visit the region each year and said more needed to be done to protect the safety of the growing number of wilderness tourists. \"There have certainly been increased numbers in the [Cradle Mountain national] park in the last couple of years and because of that there's a lot more traffic,\" said Chris Purtell of Tasmanian Expeditions. \"Unfortunately, sometimes it takes something as tragic as this for action to be taken.\"",

      "bodyText": "Charities are set to suffer financially after several major US charitable foundations reported a downturn in asset income - the first decline in 10 years - caused by a collapse in hi-tech share prices. The foundations are expected to wind down the level of grants and awards in the wake of the downturn. Fifty-five per cent of the 142 foundations in the study, to be published in the Chronicle of Philanthropy this week, said they expected their giving to stay static or drop this year. A similar percentage said their assets had shrunk in the past 12 months. The Chronicle says: \"Large grants and new long-term awards could be the first to be jettisoned as foundations adjust their spending to slower growth or losses in asset values.\" This is seen as a worrying sign for the US charitable sector as foundations are usually considered a bedrock of support in times of economic downturn because of their steady asset base. However, some high profile foundations have themselves lost income in the fallout from dot.com failures. The assets of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation dropped by 25% last year - most of its investments were in Hewlett-Packard, the business and home computer hardware company, and its subsidiary, technology firm Agilent. The Paul G Allen Foundation - set up by billionaire Microsoft founder Paul Allen - also saw its assets drop by 39%. The overall decline of the biggest foundations' assets was 0.3% but this figure is skewed by the success of the two largest foundations, William H Gates and the Lilly Endowment. The William H Gates Foundation set up by chairman of Microsoft, Bill Gates, donated $34m in cash and $200m in software last year.",

      "body": "<p>Labour's lead over the Conservatives has leapt to 15 points - an increase of five points in the last month - according to the February Guardian/ICM poll published today, placing new pressure on Tony Blair to consider calling an early general election on April 5.</p> <p>Although the smart money in Downing Street will remain on May 3, the strong lead gives added impetus to go to the polls sooner rather than later. Results in line with the poll would deliver a second land slide victory for Mr Blair almost on the scale of the 1997 historic win - if he can get the potential Labour vote to the polling stations on the day.</p> <p>The detailed results of the ICM poll neatly encapsulate the dilemma facing the prime minister. While the Labour lead is at its highest level for more than a year, it also shows that the numbers of those who say they are certain to vote has dropped three points since last month.</p> <p>The poll underlines Labour fears that it is \"stay-at-homes\" who pose the main threat to the scale of its second-term victory, on the basis that the more likely a landslide appears, the fewer people will bother to take part in what they see as a foregone conclusion. Ministers must also privately doubt if this political momentum can be sustained for a further 10 weeks in the run-up to a May 3 election.</p> <p>The poll shows that despite a month of indifferent headlines for Mr Blair, including the Mandelson resignation and the dome sale, Labour is actually up three points to 47% and the Tories are down two points to 32%, suggesting that the formidable economic feel good factor is responsible more than anything for fuelling this renewed resurgence in the government's fortunes. Labour's dominance on the economy is underscored by the poll finding that 33% regard it as the best party to manage the economy, double the 16% who believe the Tories would be more competent on an issue that was traditionally one of their strengths.</p> <p>The 15-point lead, which is larger than the margin by which Labour won the 1997 general election, is all the more impressive because ICM customarily records a lower share of the vote for Labour than other opinion polls, as it adjusts for a \"shy Tory\" factor.</p> <p>The poll also shows that the overwhelming majority, 64%, believe that Mr Blair was right to ask for the resignation of Mr Mandelson. Only 14% of voters say he was wrong.</p> <p>It reveals that the government has firmly nailed any lingering reputation Labour had as the party of public spending. The voters regard both main parties as equally likely to raise taxes. In February 1997, when the question was last asked, 49% said they expected that Labour would spend more than the Tories if elected. That figure has now fallen to only 24% of voters and in fact a slightly higher proportion, 29%, believe that the Tories would spend more than Labour if they won. A further 25% believe public spending will be at roughly the same level whichever party gets in.</p> <p>The main switch in opinion has been the growth of scepticism about Labour's future spending plans, with the \"don't knows\" growing from 6% in February 1997 to 22% now. This indicates how' expectations of a big boost in public spending during a second-term Labour government have receded. As for the Tories, 38% expect them to increase public spending if elected and only 23% to cut current levels. On tax Labour is now seen as little different from the Conservatives. Both parties are expected to raise taxes if they are elected, with only 20% saying they believe the Tories would cut the overall tax burden.</p> <p>\u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults by telephone from February 16-18. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour's lead over the Conservatives has leapt to 15 points - an increase of five points in the last month - according to the February Guardian/ICM poll published today, placing new pressure on Tony Blair to consider calling an early general election on April 5. Although the smart money in Downing Street will remain on May 3, the strong lead gives added impetus to go to the polls sooner rather than later. Results in line with the poll would deliver a second land slide victory for Mr Blair almost on the scale of the 1997 historic win - if he can get the potential Labour vote to the polling stations on the day. The detailed results of the ICM poll neatly encapsulate the dilemma facing the prime minister. While the Labour lead is at its highest level for more than a year, it also shows that the numbers of those who say they are certain to vote has dropped three points since last month. The poll underlines Labour fears that it is \"stay-at-homes\" who pose the main threat to the scale of its second-term victory, on the basis that the more likely a landslide appears, the fewer people will bother to take part in what they see as a foregone conclusion. Ministers must also privately doubt if this political momentum can be sustained for a further 10 weeks in the run-up to a May 3 election. The poll shows that despite a month of indifferent headlines for Mr Blair, including the Mandelson resignation and the dome sale, Labour is actually up three points to 47% and the Tories are down two points to 32%, suggesting that the formidable economic feel good factor is responsible more than anything for fuelling this renewed resurgence in the government's fortunes. Labour's dominance on the economy is underscored by the poll finding that 33% regard it as the best party to manage the economy, double the 16% who believe the Tories would be more competent on an issue that was traditionally one of their strengths. The 15-point lead, which is larger than the margin by which Labour won the 1997 general election, is all the more impressive because ICM customarily records a lower share of the vote for Labour than other opinion polls, as it adjusts for a \"shy Tory\" factor. The poll also shows that the overwhelming majority, 64%, believe that Mr Blair was right to ask for the resignation of Mr Mandelson. Only 14% of voters say he was wrong. It reveals that the government has firmly nailed any lingering reputation Labour had as the party of public spending. The voters regard both main parties as equally likely to raise taxes. In February 1997, when the question was last asked, 49% said they expected that Labour would spend more than the Tories if elected. That figure has now fallen to only 24% of voters and in fact a slightly higher proportion, 29%, believe that the Tories would spend more than Labour if they won. A further 25% believe public spending will be at roughly the same level whichever party gets in. The main switch in opinion has been the growth of scepticism about Labour's future spending plans, with the \"don't knows\" growing from 6% in February 1997 to 22% now. This indicates how' expectations of a big boost in public spending during a second-term Labour government have receded. As for the Tories, 38% expect them to increase public spending if elected and only 23% to cut current levels. On tax Labour is now seen as little different from the Conservatives. Both parties are expected to raise taxes if they are elected, with only 20% saying they believe the Tories would cut the overall tax burden. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,000 adults by telephone from February 16-18. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair last night rejected \"with contempt\" Conservative calls for the resignation of the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, for his role in sending a fund-raising letter to lawyers on behalf of the Labour party. But pressure mounted from critics in the Labour and Liberal Democrat ranks - along with the Law Society and other supporters of legal modernisation - who seized on the controversy to argue for reform of the lord chancellor's dual role as a politician who also heads the judicial system and appoints QCs and judges. Robert Stevens, master of Pembroke College, Oxford, said that the affair underlined \"the fact that you can't have the same person as head of the judiciary, a cabinet minister and responsible for all preferments\". A member of a committee of legal peers and academics which has called for a independent body to oversee appointments, Mr Stevens added: \"If Tony Blair is committed to modernisation he needs to have a head of the judiciary who is not a politician and he needs to have a judicial appointments committee. \"Then if your minister of justice wants to have a party and shake people down for money, that's fine.\" Lord Lester, a human rights QC and Liberal Democrat peer, called Lord Irvine's letter \"politically naive.\" He said: \"As the Book of Matthew teaches us, no man should serve two masters and Derry [Irvine] serves at least two masters if not three or four. \"His politically naive decision may be important in highlighting the need to reform his domain when he's been busy reforming everybody else's.\" But he dismissed Conservative calls for the lord chancellor's resignation and accused the Tories of \"making capital out of his unwisdom\". In the hope of reviving the sleaze issue ahead of the general election with what they dubbed the \"cash for wigs\" affair, the Tories demanded the names of all lawyers attending the controversial free dinner. They also wrote to Lord Neill, the chairman of the committee on standards in public life, seeking an investigation. When it emerged last week that Lord Irvine had solicited \"at least \u00a3200\" donations from lawyers attending the fundraising dinner with Cherie Booth QC, senior Tory lawyers privately joined the widespread condemnation: the action was foolish, but not warranting his resignation from the cabinet, they agreed. But yesterday they performed a u-turn, ostensibly because Downing Street had given what Tory chairman, Michael Ancram, himself a barrister, called \"a contemptuous brush-off\" to concerns voiced about Lord Irvine's patronage powers to appoint the very lawyers at the dinner to be QCs or judges. Lord Lester branded \"constitutionally illiterate\" a statement from the prime minister's spokesman that there was no difference between the lord chancellor hosting a fundraising dinner and the prime minister acting as host. Attempts to raise the issue in the Lords yesterday were rebuffed. And Mr Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, accused the media and the Tories of using the row to \"avoid real debate on policy and the issues that matter to people\". The resignation call would be treated by Mr Blair \"with the contempt it deserves\", he said. Undeterred, Mr Ancram issued a direct challenge to Mr Blair, once a pupil in Lord Irvine's chambers. He wrote: \"I believe that Lord Irvine's actions in soliciting money from lawyers have breached the trust placed in him and brought the integrity of the lord chancellor's office into question. \"As you have failed to provide any satisfactory reply to the allegations and failed to acknowledge any appearance of impropriety on the lord chancellor's part, I am now calling on you now to consider Lord Irvine's position as head of the judiciary.\" The Scottish National party backed the Tories. Lord Lester voiced concerns, also expressed by Labour QCs such as Bob Marshall-Andrews, about Lord Irvine's dual functions as a powerful cabinet policy maker and arbitrator (he played a key role in Peter Mandelson's fall) as well as impartial head of the judiciary. The roles should be separated into a justice department and an appointments panel, reformers say. Talk about it Should Lord Irvine resign?

But other responses were impressive: some institutions could list a glittering array of alumni who became pop stars in the 70s, 80s and 90s, as well as up and coming bands making waves in the current music scene. The survey also uncovered an intriguing trend for musicologists: more and more bands appear to be forming during university rather than as an alternative to higher education. So, in the spirit of performance indicators and league tables, we constructed the Guardian's first ever ranking of the hippest academic institutions in the country - based on the numbers of past students who have gone on to make fame and fortune in the music world.

While male academics earned on average \u00a3669 gross a week in 2000, female academics earned \u00a3113 a week less. David Triesman, general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, said that in the past decade the gender pay gap in higher education had narrowed by 10 percentage points. \"But the continued gulf in earnings is a serious impediment to achieving equality.\" Today details of the Equality Challenge initiative mounted by university heads will be outlined at a conference in London by Professor Janet Finch, Vice-Chancellor of Keele University, who chairs the initiative. Professor Finch said: \"Equality for staff in the sector is vital for the staff and the students, the new Equality Framework is a hugely important development for higher education's progress towards equal opportunities,\" she said. But Mr Triesman commented: \"Although the pay gap has closed during the last decade on average male academic staff earn \u00a3113 per week more than female counterparts, enough money to pay the rent or feed a family. It is difficult to see how universities can discuss equality without first tackling this fundamental barrier.\" Diana Warwick, chief executive of Universities UK, formerly the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, said today's conference would bring together leading experts in the UK and demonstrate vice-chancellors' commitment to equal opportunities.

      "body": "<p>Dr Robert Jones knew his time was up two years ago. It was no surprise when the 56-year-old lecturer was eventually asked to meet the university's dean of research and head of department. There were no questions or explanations. Jones (not his real name) was told that he would not be included in the department's submission to the Research Assessment Exercise, and was urged to move on to a teaching only contract. </p> <p>\"I knew it was coming,\" he says. \"I had spent a considerable time on two articles for a book, but the book fell through.\" At first he worked frenetically trying to recover something from the situation, trying to produce redrafts. But it quickly became apparent that he could not produce the quota of four published articles in the two remaining years left before the deadline for the assessment. </p> <p>\"Come the day, come the hour, you are faced with nemesis,\" he says. \"If you don't make it into the RAE you are dead in the water - academic life is essentially over.\" He says he is being punished for taking risks with his research, when he could have quite easily trotted out four \"tedious, predictable articles\". Over an entire lifetime, an academic might produce two or three highly original research papers, he says, but to be entered into the RAE a researcher must produce a paper every year. </p> <p>\"It is not as if, crudely put, I am a nobody in the area,\" he says. \"I found the whole experience thoroughly demoralising and demotivating. For all the moralising of these places, they don't mind giving you a mugging if they can get away with it. Of course, it is all done in the best possible taste but a mugging is a mugging, however politely the boot goes in.\" </p> <p>Jones is just one of countless victims of the RAE. For five years since the last assessment, university managers have been focusing on one date on their academic planners: 31 March 2001. This is the deadline for submissions to RAE 2001. This is the date by which research reputations will be won or lost. And often individual academics find themselves -sacrificed as universities manoeuvre to maximise their chances of high research ratings, and classify the highest possible proportion of academics as \"research active\". </p> <p>Even publishing the full quota of four articles in the five years before the deadline is no guarantee that an academic has a place in a department's prestigious submission to the exercise. As Dr Jane Brown found out, much to her distress, sometimes your research just doesn't fit into the university's plans. </p> <p>After a year of protracted discussions Brown, a 50-year-old lecturer, finally won her battle for a permanent academic position - something she was entitled to after six years on fixed-term contracts. The university appointments committee first turned down the request, then acquiesced. </p> <p>But with the decision came a nasty surprise. \"One person [on the committee] said I would damage the university's RAE submission, which I found deeply insulting and very distressing,\" says Brown. \"Although I had the right number of publications I was told I didn't fit into the package of the RAE submission. \"I found the whole experience undermining to my confidence and belief - even though I know I am good at what I do. It is very undermining having an institution questioning your worth.\" </p> <p>The two stories could have been told by any number of academics. They may have failed to produce the right number of papers; their research area may have been judged out of bounds; they may have concentrated on teaching duties; or they may be approaching retirement. But the humiliation is always the same: they are told that they cannot take part in the RAE, and pressurised to retire or transfer to non-research contracts. </p> <p>Local representatives of the Association of University Teachers call it the \"gatekeeping\" problem. Complaints have come from staff at universities as far afield as Stirling, Lancaster, Edinburgh, Keele, Exeter, Cardiff, Reading, and Liverpool. For all the government's vows to raise the status of teaching in academia, the RAE victims reveal that the harsh reality is that research still rules the university world. And despite talk of better staff management, institutions still seem stuck in the middle ages when it comes to dealing with their academic employees. </p> <p>Determining the allocation of \u00a31bn of grants a year, the RAE wields an enormous influence over the sector. A five-star, top rating in the exercise represents the ultimate sign of academic kudos - and is used to secure other research grants, and fee-paying international students. Departments also strive to classify the highest possible proportion of staff as \"research active\" to prove the depth of their research strengths. </p> <p>A typical example is Lancaster University, which announced that it aims only to have departments with ratings of 4 and above. A plan was developed to identify staff likely to be included, and examine what could be done about the rest of the staff, with a view to removing them from the total figure to be declared for the assessment. </p> <p>\"Over the past year a succession of members have come for advice,\" says John Wakeford, secretary of the local AUT branch. \"Many are women academics who have worked for several years on annual renewable contracts. They seem to have been offered permanency if they accept appointments on the inferior, \"other related\" scale, losing their right to sabbatical leave. </p> <p>\"Others are senior people in their 50s and 60s who have devoted themselves to teaching and writing textbooks as well as research - or have published in areas that just didn't fit into the particular theme a department was putting forward. Various things were raised with them - ill-health retirement, premature retirement, teaching only contracts.\" </p> <p>According to Wakeford, most were devastated. They felt they were being told that their life's work had been defined as second-rate: \"The actual assessment process is carried out meticulously by the funding council, and based on decisions by groups of academic peers. But our main concern is the damage done to the careers and self-respect of many dedicated academics by some universities' short-sighted and insensitive response.\" </p> <p>Lecturers' names have been changed</p>",

      "bodyText": "Dr Robert Jones knew his time was up two years ago. It was no surprise when the 56-year-old lecturer was eventually asked to meet the university's dean of research and head of department. There were no questions or explanations. Jones (not his real name) was told that he would not be included in the department's submission to the Research Assessment Exercise, and was urged to move on to a teaching only contract. \"I knew it was coming,\" he says. \"I had spent a considerable time on two articles for a book, but the book fell through.\" At first he worked frenetically trying to recover something from the situation, trying to produce redrafts. But it quickly became apparent that he could not produce the quota of four published articles in the two remaining years left before the deadline for the assessment. \"Come the day, come the hour, you are faced with nemesis,\" he says. \"If you don't make it into the RAE you are dead in the water - academic life is essentially over.\" He says he is being punished for taking risks with his research, when he could have quite easily trotted out four \"tedious, predictable articles\". Over an entire lifetime, an academic might produce two or three highly original research papers, he says, but to be entered into the RAE a researcher must produce a paper every year. \"It is not as if, crudely put, I am a nobody in the area,\" he says. \"I found the whole experience thoroughly demoralising and demotivating. For all the moralising of these places, they don't mind giving you a mugging if they can get away with it. Of course, it is all done in the best possible taste but a mugging is a mugging, however politely the boot goes in.\" Jones is just one of countless victims of the RAE. For five years since the last assessment, university managers have been focusing on one date on their academic planners: 31 March 2001. This is the deadline for submissions to RAE 2001. This is the date by which research reputations will be won or lost. And often individual academics find themselves -sacrificed as universities manoeuvre to maximise their chances of high research ratings, and classify the highest possible proportion of academics as \"research active\". Even publishing the full quota of four articles in the five years before the deadline is no guarantee that an academic has a place in a department's prestigious submission to the exercise. As Dr Jane Brown found out, much to her distress, sometimes your research just doesn't fit into the university's plans. After a year of protracted discussions Brown, a 50-year-old lecturer, finally won her battle for a permanent academic position - something she was entitled to after six years on fixed-term contracts. The university appointments committee first turned down the request, then acquiesced. But with the decision came a nasty surprise. \"One person [on the committee] said I would damage the university's RAE submission, which I found deeply insulting and very distressing,\" says Brown. \"Although I had the right number of publications I was told I didn't fit into the package of the RAE submission. \"I found the whole experience undermining to my confidence and belief - even though I know I am good at what I do. It is very undermining having an institution questioning your worth.\" The two stories could have been told by any number of academics. They may have failed to produce the right number of papers; their research area may have been judged out of bounds; they may have concentrated on teaching duties; or they may be approaching retirement. But the humiliation is always the same: they are told that they cannot take part in the RAE, and pressurised to retire or transfer to non-research contracts. Local representatives of the Association of University Teachers call it the \"gatekeeping\" problem. Complaints have come from staff at universities as far afield as Stirling, Lancaster, Edinburgh, Keele, Exeter, Cardiff, Reading, and Liverpool. For all the government's vows to raise the status of teaching in academia, the RAE victims reveal that the harsh reality is that research still rules the university world. And despite talk of better staff management, institutions still seem stuck in the middle ages when it comes to dealing with their academic employees. Determining the allocation of \u00a31bn of grants a year, the RAE wields an enormous influence over the sector. A five-star, top rating in the exercise represents the ultimate sign of academic kudos - and is used to secure other research grants, and fee-paying international students. Departments also strive to classify the highest possible proportion of staff as \"research active\" to prove the depth of their research strengths. A typical example is Lancaster University, which announced that it aims only to have departments with ratings of 4 and above. A plan was developed to identify staff likely to be included, and examine what could be done about the rest of the staff, with a view to removing them from the total figure to be declared for the assessment. \"Over the past year a succession of members have come for advice,\" says John Wakeford, secretary of the local AUT branch. \"Many are women academics who have worked for several years on annual renewable contracts. They seem to have been offered permanency if they accept appointments on the inferior, \"other related\" scale, losing their right to sabbatical leave. \"Others are senior people in their 50s and 60s who have devoted themselves to teaching and writing textbooks as well as research - or have published in areas that just didn't fit into the particular theme a department was putting forward. Various things were raised with them - ill-health retirement, premature retirement, teaching only contracts.\" According to Wakeford, most were devastated. They felt they were being told that their life's work had been defined as second-rate: \"The actual assessment process is carried out meticulously by the funding council, and based on decisions by groups of academic peers. But our main concern is the damage done to the careers and self-respect of many dedicated academics by some universities' short-sighted and insensitive response.\" Lecturers' names have been changed",

      "body": "<p>It was student band acoustic night at a Manchester beer hall. A duo called Little Plato stood on a stage by the gents' toilets. The guitarist swung his fringe and hit a chord. The singer sang \"I'll always be a fool, but that's cool with me . . . yah.\" The amp screeched, stray dogs outside started yelping and someone in the audience blew a fart on their harmonica. Nine acts later, a drunk would wander in off the street and sing Wonderwall. The audience loved it. </p> <p>Manchester, according to record companies and pop music lecturers, is the place student musicians are making for. Its student exports include the Chemical Brothers, James and D:ream. Now heading for big record deals are Gecko Levy, Embryonic, Spybase and Shatner. </p> <p>Manchester reflects the changes in Britain's student band scene. Computer students are downloading illegal music software, making it easier for bands to record for next to nothing. The entrepreneurial streak among skint undergraduates means most are teaming up with marketing students, setting up gig websites, releasing singles on the net and raking in cash from their bands. </p> <p>Across venues in the city, most student bands say they specifically applied to universities in Manchester to network on the music scene. But other locations are producing good acts which formed as students, including Necessary Elvis from Leeds, Portobello from Sheffield and a list of bands from Bath, Liverpool and London heading for the finals of Live and Uncut's national unsigned band competition later this year. </p> <p>According to the record industry, around 10% of student bands nationwide will make the big time. But the greatest change on the student scene is that successful bands, espe cially hip-hop and dance acts, are not just emerging from the bedrooms of classics students. Students on new rock music and technology courses at further education colleges and universities like Salford, which specialises in pop, are making it in large numbers. These are often highly talented students who have already sessioned on albums but who come to college specifically to form bands. </p> <p>In Manchester, the pop students run in parallel to the part-time biology or English student bands - they gig the same circuit but they hardly interact. A trawl of venues reveals from both sides just what it takes to make it as a student band. </p> <p>First, there's the management issue. With the proliferation of flyers and promotional websites, unless band members want to spend all day leafleting and flunk their degrees, they may need help. </p> <p>Alex MacHorton, 22, a third-year economics undergraduate at Manchester University, has never picked up an instrument but manages Madee, an alternative indie band made up of maths and physics undergraduates. \"With an economics background, I bring in a business approach. The band are great at what they do, but they are not always organised. I take the bureaucracy off them, so they have more time to write,\" he says. </p> <p>MacHorton, like John Dang, the band's singer, has his own e-business. Dang, in his third year, just turned down a \u00a342,000 banking job because he thinks the band can really make it. \"The next six months are crucial, it's make or break,\" he says. What about finals? \"That's just study. I'll knock off a 2:1.\" </p> <p>On the London circuit, the highly rated The Glass Heroes, made up of City University business students and recent Oxford graduates, recruited a friend who had just started a management consultancy job to manage them. Bernie Smith, 26, said: \"The band are 22 and 23. They were not getting as much notice as they wanted from record companies so they brought me in to promote them.\" The singer, Julian Ridgway, said he wished the band had recruited a manager earlier. </p> <p>One thing a manager can do is keep a tab on costs. For students who aren't doing a music course at a specialist college, the cost of playing in a band is around \u00a32,800 a year. CD home copying and promotional demos can cost \u00a3500 over three terms, flyers can reach \u00a3150. Recording in a studio costs \u00a3300 a day, plus \u00a3500 a year for instrument repairs and maintenance and \u00a3100 on the all-important entry to competitions. </p> <p>The band Madee estimate they will make \u00a31,200 this year through music. Planned gigs will bring in \u00a3800 and 200 bottles of beer and they plan to sell their EP at \u00a33 a go, making \u00a3400. Profits are split six ways to include the manager. Other Manchester University bands, like Loose Canon, run band nights and produce their own singles for 50p and sell them for \u00a31, without a manager. They make friends in other bands, and wear promotional stickers of their gig nights as they perform across the city. \"It's all about branding ourselves and our night,\" Marc Davies, the guitarist, said. </p> <p>Quite a few others, including the Manchester band, Extinguish Her, are financed by parents. Matt Collins, a Manchester student band reviewer, plays in a band back home in Belfast and spends all his loans on flights. </p> <p>The advice across the spit and sawdust of the clubs is that if being in a band is the only thing you want to do in the long term, get a pop qualification. Dawn Maskrey, 30, has just graduated as a mature student from North Trafford College in Manchester with a BTech in music performance. Her band, Embryonic, one of the best student bands in Manchester, has played Manchester's crucial In the City unsigned bands festival - deemed \"Urban Glastonbury\". They have a CD and DVD out. </p> <p>\"I was a singer, I had done vocals on The Smiths' Big Mouth Strikes Again and I was doing quite a lot of dance tracks, but I didn't want to be a lone singer. I wanted a band behind me so I came to college to meet them. I also felt I needed a qualification, so I could fall back on teaching if music didn't work out,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The course changed me. It made me less into myself and more giving to others. I know enough about music now to make it in any area of the industry without having to turn to teaching.\" She devotes five days a week to the band. At night, she leaflets other gigs with the band's flyers. </p> <p>North Trafford College is one of 23 colleges in the country that run contemporary music courses as part of the Access to Music organisation. The course requirement is to form a band. Session musicians teach; record bosses, promoters, reviewers and DJs come to lecture. The course is at Beehive Mill recording studios in the heart of clubland, among other professional artists and musicians. Two of North Trafford's hip-hop students, Akosua Mensah and Serina Wain, were nominated for best unsigned act at this year's Mobo awards. </p> <p>On the other side of Manchester, Salford University is the centre of pop degrees in Britain. It is in its 12th year of a BA honours in popular music and recording, and its graduates - including a drummer for Gomez and two of Pete Waterman's co-producers for Steps - have fed the Manchester music scene. Sheila Whitely, Britain's first professor of pop, said the course has 550 applicants for 50 places each year. They learn acoustics, performance, theory, recording and the technology of mixing and mastering. \"Our course is also vital for networking. With 12 years' worth of graduates in the music industry, we provide a very effective network for student bands.\" </p> <p>Advice that emerges from all the bands is that the scene is just as full of hope and insecurity as student acting or journalism. Most student bands feel over the hill. It takes until the age of 24 or 25 to begin to stand a chance of emerging professionally after you have devoted three years to a degree, while other teen bands with a foot in the door can make it much faster. \"I'm getting older too . . . ooh,\" crones one student singer at the acoustic night. </p> <p><strong> Where the top bands come from...</strong></p> <p>The Guardian pop music rankings table all started with a boast from University College London. The university's head publicist said that the band, Coldplay, had met as undergraduate students at UCL and were tipped as likely winners at the Brits Awards. He claimed that this was the latest in a long tradition of student band successes including Elastica, Suede and Basement Jaxx. </p> <p>How did other universities compare? Some were clearly themselves clutching at straws (\"Brad Pitt once practised guitar here\" came the reply from Thames Valley University, while in clear desperation Oxford listed the rock combo, Ugly Rumours (led by a former student called Tony Blair). </p> <p>But other responses were impressive, too. So, in the spirit of performance indicators and league tables, we constructed the Guardian's first ever ranking of the hippest academic institutions in the country - based on the numbers of past students who have gone on to make fame and fortune in the music world. </p> <p>Universities score 10 points for every pop star alumnus, and 20 points for bands formed while at university.

      "bodyText": "It was student band acoustic night at a Manchester beer hall. A duo called Little Plato stood on a stage by the gents' toilets. The guitarist swung his fringe and hit a chord. The singer sang \"I'll always be a fool, but that's cool with me . . . yah.\" The amp screeched, stray dogs outside started yelping and someone in the audience blew a fart on their harmonica. Nine acts later, a drunk would wander in off the street and sing Wonderwall. The audience loved it. Manchester, according to record companies and pop music lecturers, is the place student musicians are making for. Its student exports include the Chemical Brothers, James and D:ream. Now heading for big record deals are Gecko Levy, Embryonic, Spybase and Shatner. Manchester reflects the changes in Britain's student band scene. Computer students are downloading illegal music software, making it easier for bands to record for next to nothing. The entrepreneurial streak among skint undergraduates means most are teaming up with marketing students, setting up gig websites, releasing singles on the net and raking in cash from their bands. Across venues in the city, most student bands say they specifically applied to universities in Manchester to network on the music scene. But other locations are producing good acts which formed as students, including Necessary Elvis from Leeds, Portobello from Sheffield and a list of bands from Bath, Liverpool and London heading for the finals of Live and Uncut's national unsigned band competition later this year. According to the record industry, around 10% of student bands nationwide will make the big time. But the greatest change on the student scene is that successful bands, espe cially hip-hop and dance acts, are not just emerging from the bedrooms of classics students. Students on new rock music and technology courses at further education colleges and universities like Salford, which specialises in pop, are making it in large numbers. These are often highly talented students who have already sessioned on albums but who come to college specifically to form bands. In Manchester, the pop students run in parallel to the part-time biology or English student bands - they gig the same circuit but they hardly interact. A trawl of venues reveals from both sides just what it takes to make it as a student band. First, there's the management issue. With the proliferation of flyers and promotional websites, unless band members want to spend all day leafleting and flunk their degrees, they may need help. Alex MacHorton, 22, a third-year economics undergraduate at Manchester University, has never picked up an instrument but manages Madee, an alternative indie band made up of maths and physics undergraduates. \"With an economics background, I bring in a business approach. The band are great at what they do, but they are not always organised. I take the bureaucracy off them, so they have more time to write,\" he says. MacHorton, like John Dang, the band's singer, has his own e-business. Dang, in his third year, just turned down a \u00a342,000 banking job because he thinks the band can really make it. \"The next six months are crucial, it's make or break,\" he says. What about finals? \"That's just study. I'll knock off a 2:1.\" On the London circuit, the highly rated The Glass Heroes, made up of City University business students and recent Oxford graduates, recruited a friend who had just started a management consultancy job to manage them. Bernie Smith, 26, said: \"The band are 22 and 23. They were not getting as much notice as they wanted from record companies so they brought me in to promote them.\" The singer, Julian Ridgway, said he wished the band had recruited a manager earlier. One thing a manager can do is keep a tab on costs. For students who aren't doing a music course at a specialist college, the cost of playing in a band is around \u00a32,800 a year. CD home copying and promotional demos can cost \u00a3500 over three terms, flyers can reach \u00a3150. Recording in a studio costs \u00a3300 a day, plus \u00a3500 a year for instrument repairs and maintenance and \u00a3100 on the all-important entry to competitions. The band Madee estimate they will make \u00a31,200 this year through music. Planned gigs will bring in \u00a3800 and 200 bottles of beer and they plan to sell their EP at \u00a33 a go, making \u00a3400. Profits are split six ways to include the manager. Other Manchester University bands, like Loose Canon, run band nights and produce their own singles for 50p and sell them for \u00a31, without a manager. They make friends in other bands, and wear promotional stickers of their gig nights as they perform across the city. \"It's all about branding ourselves and our night,\" Marc Davies, the guitarist, said. Quite a few others, including the Manchester band, Extinguish Her, are financed by parents. Matt Collins, a Manchester student band reviewer, plays in a band back home in Belfast and spends all his loans on flights. The advice across the spit and sawdust of the clubs is that if being in a band is the only thing you want to do in the long term, get a pop qualification. Dawn Maskrey, 30, has just graduated as a mature student from North Trafford College in Manchester with a BTech in music performance. Her band, Embryonic, one of the best student bands in Manchester, has played Manchester's crucial In the City unsigned bands festival - deemed \"Urban Glastonbury\". They have a CD and DVD out. \"I was a singer, I had done vocals on The Smiths' Big Mouth Strikes Again and I was doing quite a lot of dance tracks, but I didn't want to be a lone singer. I wanted a band behind me so I came to college to meet them. I also felt I needed a qualification, so I could fall back on teaching if music didn't work out,\" she said. \"The course changed me. It made me less into myself and more giving to others. I know enough about music now to make it in any area of the industry without having to turn to teaching.\" She devotes five days a week to the band. At night, she leaflets other gigs with the band's flyers. North Trafford College is one of 23 colleges in the country that run contemporary music courses as part of the Access to Music organisation. The course requirement is to form a band. Session musicians teach; record bosses, promoters, reviewers and DJs come to lecture. The course is at Beehive Mill recording studios in the heart of clubland, among other professional artists and musicians. Two of North Trafford's hip-hop students, Akosua Mensah and Serina Wain, were nominated for best unsigned act at this year's Mobo awards. On the other side of Manchester, Salford University is the centre of pop degrees in Britain. It is in its 12th year of a BA honours in popular music and recording, and its graduates - including a drummer for Gomez and two of Pete Waterman's co-producers for Steps - have fed the Manchester music scene. Sheila Whitely, Britain's first professor of pop, said the course has 550 applicants for 50 places each year. They learn acoustics, performance, theory, recording and the technology of mixing and mastering. \"Our course is also vital for networking. With 12 years' worth of graduates in the music industry, we provide a very effective network for student bands.\" Advice that emerges from all the bands is that the scene is just as full of hope and insecurity as student acting or journalism. Most student bands feel over the hill. It takes until the age of 24 or 25 to begin to stand a chance of emerging professionally after you have devoted three years to a degree, while other teen bands with a foot in the door can make it much faster. \"I'm getting older too . . . ooh,\" crones one student singer at the acoustic night. Where the top bands come from... The Guardian pop music rankings table all started with a boast from University College London. The university's head publicist said that the band, Coldplay, had met as undergraduate students at UCL and were tipped as likely winners at the Brits Awards. He claimed that this was the latest in a long tradition of student band successes including Elastica, Suede and Basement Jaxx. How did other universities compare? Some were clearly themselves clutching at straws (\"Brad Pitt once practised guitar here\" came the reply from Thames Valley University, while in clear desperation Oxford listed the rock combo, Ugly Rumours (led by a former student called Tony Blair). But other responses were impressive, too. So, in the spirit of performance indicators and league tables, we constructed the Guardian's first ever ranking of the hippest academic institutions in the country - based on the numbers of past students who have gone on to make fame and fortune in the music world. Universities score 10 points for every pop star alumnus, and 20 points for bands formed while at university. Embarrassingly unhip acts attracted penalty points but Cardiff was awarded extra points for producing Richey Edwards - the missing member of Manic Street Preachers. Stars who failed to complete degrees also attracted extra arbitrary points. London Guildhall shows the most consistent performance, producing 60s pop icon Ray Davies, 80s star Adam Ant, and the 90s indie band, Echobelly. With a sad trium-virate of Kris Kristoffersen, Paul Gambacinni, and Ugly Rumours, Oxford meanwhile lies, for once, at the bottom of an academic league table.

We are standing in the frozen meals section of Marks &amp; Spencer's food hall, shooting furtive glances at a tall, attractive young girl in heavy make-up. \"What do you reckon?\" someone asks. \"Only one way to find out.\" We troop across to the girl, who is shopping with her mother. \"Excuse me, but can I ask - are you still at school?\" </p> <p>It is 11am on a wintry Friday in Islington, north London, and the shops are surprisingly busy. Older women pull baskets behind them, home-makers stock up on the weekly shop. And everywhere there are children: babies in pushchairs, 10-year-olds kicking along the street behind their grandparents, young girls who at first glance look 14 but who might easily be five years older. </p> <p>It is the most difficult part of the job, says PC Jim Dodd from the schools and community office at Islington police. \"Quite often we stop people who are 19 or 20. I just say to them, you'll be glad you look so young when you are older.\" He's much better on boys, he says. With girls he often gets it wrong. </p> <p>Dodd and Sandra Rose, an educational welfare officer for the council, are familiar figures in this part of the borough. Every few weeks they patrol the market, checking for children who should be at school but are not. The shopkeepers and stall-holders know them, as do a good number of the kids they come across. All children who look of school age, whether on their own or with their parents, are stopped and asked why they are not in class. </p> <p>It's a non-confrontational approach: their names and details are taken, and they are told that a call will be put into the school \"just to check that everything is all right\". But the presence of the uniformed officer lends an air of authority to the patrol, says Dodd. \"I usually say to people when we stop them, 'don't worry, you're not in any trouble', though that's not necessarily true.\" </p> <p>Every day of the year, 50,000 children skip school. It is a problem that has preoccupied politicians and educationists for decades, the faceless menace of \"truanting\", blamed for low educational achievement and anti-social behaviour, and for nurturing a generation of petty criminals. </p> <p>This assumption is far from incorrect. Jack Straw recently remarked that he had never met a young offender who hadn't been involved in truanting, and one survey found that three-quarters of truants admitted to having committed at least one offence. Several councils have seen petty crime rates drop markedly with the introduction of proactive anti-truanting measures, notably Newham in east London, where car crime fell by 70% in the north of the borough on the days when the streets were being patrolled. </p> <p>But as councils and police forces have become more coordinated in tackling the problem, particularly in organising \"sweeps\" to pick up truants, a more complicated picture of non-attendance has emerged than the cliched image of gangs of disaffected teenagers roaming the streets, bent on crime. In particular, it has become clear that many children bunk off school with the full knowledge of their parents. Almost two-thirds of the children stopped by a recent patrol in Salford were accompanied by parents or other carers. \"The extent of parentally condoned truancy we would not have seen without the truancy sweeps,\" says Phil Hamerton, head of social inclusion for the education department at Manchester City Council. \"We were quite surprised if not shocked by that, and that's a very important learning point. It's affected our strategy - our campaigning is now aimed partly at the parents.\" The council now runs sweeps once a week in some parts of the city. </p> <p>Sure enough, most of the children stopped by Dodd and Rose are with a mother or a brother or a grandparent. \"She's not playing truant, I can assure you of that,\" says the mother of one 13-year-old girl. \"She knows better than that.\" She says her daughter wasn't feeling well during the night, though the girl is wearing short trousers and sandals and is laden with shopping bags from Iceland. \"If she's not well enough to be at school, she's not well enough to be out shopping,\" says Rose, trotting out a well-worn phrase. They'll call the school, she says later, and check whether the girl is missing school regularly. </p> <p>If the girl has been given a sick note, however, her absence may not be particularly remarked. \"This year the overall figure for non-attendance was 11%, of which only 2% was unauthorised,\" says Ian Norman-Bruce, principal education welfare officer at Islington. Sweeps have exposed how much of the authorised absence is legitimate. \"Any of the young people we come across are likely to be given a note to say they were sick. The school are not likely to know that they were out and about shopping until we tell them. And because the authorisation of absence is a matter for individual headteachers and individual schools, it is very difficult sometimes to detect what should be authorised and what shouldn't.\" </p> <p>The apparent striking success of truancy sweeps in limiting youth crime - at least on patrol days - has led to them being adopted widely throughout the country; all local authorities are now required to carry out more patrols as part of a renewed crackdown announced by the government in October. An extra \u00a343m has been found to help tackle the problem, which David Blunkett hopes to reduce by a third by 2002, and the courts have been given stronger powers to sentence parents who persist in letting their children bunk off. </p> <p>But as the decision to launch that initiative jointly between the DfEE and the Home Office implied, non-attendance at school is a more complicated problem than can be addressed by a single tactic. \"If you are of primary school age, or are a teenager and it's a first occurrence, then being stopped by the patrol can be effective,\" says Norman Bruce. \"But if they are long-term offenders, just stopping them in the street will not be enough.\" It will take a coordinated assault on the problem by schools, police forces and councils, he says, backed up by social workers and other professionals where appropriate, to really address the problem. </p> <p>Schools will also need to address the way they deal with returning truants, adds Hamerton. \"We need to look at the problem in the longer term by looking at the reasons why in each case, not just trying to deal with the immediate fact that they are not in school. We can't lose sight of the fact that children in many cases are absenting themselves from something rather than choosing to do something else, and that's the challenge.\" </p> <p>Inside Sainsbury's, Dodd and Rose come across a stroppy 14-year-old pushing a trolley and almost pulling her mother down an aisle. \"It's my lunch hour, innit?\" she challenges, despite the fact that it is only noon. They take her name anyway. Outside the shop, two other children are hanging around. They turn out to be the brother and sister of the stroppy girl, from a family well known to Rose's department. The sister claims to be too old to be at school, the brother says he fell down the stairs and hit his head, which is why he's not at school. </p> <p>\"We've already taken that family to court,\" says Rose. \"That's why the mum didn't flinch. Looks like this one will be a bit more intractable.\" And they head off again before the school gates open for lunch and the streets fill up with teenagers.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's not easy being a 12- to 14-year-old - and teaching young people of that age is harder still. Something happens to teenagers once the thrill of going to big school wears off, and the government doesn't like it. The Department for Education's green paper, Building on Success, published last week, says that \"Pupils make far too little progress during these years. Attitudinal surveys show motivation falling and disaffection rising.\" </p> <p>The seeds of later failure (especially in boys) are sown in these years, warns the government, so teaching standards and expectations for this age group must be raised. </p> <p>Perhaps there is a limited armoury at the education department, but it has gone for the key stage 3 exam as its main weapon. To focus the minds of pupils and teachers, it proposes moving the exam from the age of 14 to 13 (from year 9 to 8). </p> <p>The department suggests \"catch-up\" lessons for children who fall behind in English and maths, and offering some children accelerated progress to GCSEs. Convinced that numeracy and literacy strategies in primary schools have been successful, the government is already piloting their use in 205 secondary schools in 17 different local education authorities. The message is clear. All those 12- to 14-year-olds who thought the first three years of secondary school were about jostling for peer group position, struggling with their adolescence and having their imaginations fired by new subjects must think again. On the chaos of early adolescence the government wants to impose academic order. </p> <p>The phenomenon of underachieving in the 12-14 age group is too well documented for the government to ignore. The Ofsted report published this month was emphatic that commitment and academic achievement falls away in years 8 and 9. More disturbingly, it noted the rise in bad behaviour and disaffection. </p> <p>But is it possible to raise standards with primary school methods and a Sats exam for 13-year-olds? Is it simplistic to suppose that increasing the pace of learning will suddenly engage teenagers? Could it be that early adolescence is when social as much as school pressures affect academic achievement? A time when biology, emotional maturity and a tenuous hold on self-esteem are competing demands on the young person's attention span? </p> <p>\"There's an amazing mismatch between what children of this age are supposed to be doing according to the national curriculum and what their natural inclination would have them do,\" says Reva Klein, author of Defying Disaffection: How schools are winning the hearts and minds of reluctant learners (Trentham Books, \u00a319.95). \"They don't want to be sitting down and talked at, they want to be doing and discovering things.\" </p> <p>Emotionally these are difficult ages, says Klein. \"They have a lot going on in their minds, and it's hard for them to concentrate, to feel secure and able to communicate on different levels and to use the appropriate decorum that a school expects. </p> <p>\"They feel terribly singular and isolated, that they are the only people who feel things. They are at an age when they want to separate from their parents but feel anxious about it. They don't want to follow authority. They bring the bad stuff from home to school and the bad stuff from school back to home. It's a horrible time.\" </p> <p>Klein believes the reactions to this terrible time vary between genders. \"Whereas boys tend to act out their disaffection by playing the clown or truanting, girls drop out in their minds. I know I did when I was a teenager. I hated school. Girls keep their heads down and pretend they are invisible. Although there is a trend now for girls to act out in worrying ways.\" </p> <p>Adrienne Katz is director of Young Voice, an organisation formed to listen and respond to the needs of young people, and the author of a report called The Leading Lads. She, too, doubts that any government plans to further regulate these years through academic programmes will tackle the problem. \"It's social and to do with relationships - teenagers have a sense that no one listens to them, that no one knows them as people. School exaggerates this.\" </p> <p>Her report found that truancy was often linked to teenagers feeling vulnerable at school, particularly from bullying. \"Girls suffer because they are being treated like babies when they want more adult rights,\" says Katz. \"Adults are slow to catch up with this need. Education seems out of kilter with the rate at which girls develop. There is a sharp increase in girls saying they need to be treated less like children between the ages of 13 and 14. Boys can have a big increase in suicidal feelings at this time. In adjusting to a new environment, it can be 18 months before they can attend to learning. They are so caught up in which group they should join or whether they're being made to look an idiot.\" </p> <p>Dr Madeleine Portwood, senior educational psychologist at Durham LEA, says there is good evidence that disaffection with school at the age of 13 makes children more vulnerable to truancy. \"Instead of being shown up for not doing good work, some children would rather be shown up for not behaving - they are more likely to get adulation from their peer group. There is a notion that we have problems because there's a culture that it's not cool to be good at school, but this seems far too simplistic.\" </p> <p>Portwood does not believe that bringing the key stage 3 exams forward is a solution. \"It's not the measurement that's the problem: it is what schools are doing to motivate children. At key stage 3 disaffected children benefit from being offered subjects they feel they can be good at - you want to be sure that an earlier exam doesn't compromise access to other subjects. Lots of children who drop out like games - it improves social skills and teaches team play in a secure environment.\" </p> <p>Andrew Nixon, head of Fortismere School, a comprehensive in Muswell Hill, London, thinks the government is too narrow in its focus: \"There's an unhealthy preoccupation with this narrow range of English, maths and science. You have to encourage children at this age to feel they are good at something, so we teach drama and put lots of emphasis on sport and creative arts, so that all children have that chance.\" </p> <p>The lack of key stage exams in the first few years of secondary means teachers can be more creative. \"Some of the best teaching takes place in these years because they are not overregulated,\" Nixon says. \"All children respond to imaginative teaching. Most of our youngsters have no difficulty being on task and responding well. </p> <p>\"Children do regress in year 7 com pared with year 6 at top junior, but we are talking about a narrow range of competencies, in English, science and maths. But that is because they have been exposed to technology workshops, specialist teaching . . . lots of new things.\" </p> <p>Patrick Lawton, a 14-year-old at Fortismere School, enjoys the wider curriculum. \"I like the practical subjects where you're not just sitting down and writing. I enjoy technology where you're making something that you can take home and be proud of.\" </p> <p>He is not convinced that Sats would be a motivational force in year 8. \"We spent quite a bit of last year [year 9] preparing for Sats, and we didn't learn that much in the second part of the year because we were just revising. It's much easier to be motivated by enjoying something than by being set exams.\" </p> <p>He likes secondary school because it brings more freedom and the teachers treat him as an adult. \"Rather than shout at you, they will tell you that if you don't work you are the one that will lose out at the end of the day.\" But isn't it uncool to study? \"It's cool to do well but not that well. It depends on who you are and how other people see you.\" </p> <p>At Aldenham School, a public school for boys in Hertfordshire, the head, Richard Harman, also believes that to motivate teenagers you must treat them as individuals. </p> <p>\"You have to treat each child with respect. Because we are a small school it's easier for us to make our children feel they each have a talent. Boys are competitive, particularly in the short term, and if you handle it well you can turn it to your advantage. We have a short-term reward system that is easily understandable - we give 'golds' that reward good behaviour almost instantly. Motivating and keeping in place a firm structure, with clear discipline as well, is what can turn a boy around.\" </p> <p>Promoting citizenship in schools - giving children a say in how things are run, may be another way of making teenagers feel involved and motivated. David Christy, senior lecturer in educational studies at the University of Strathclyde, says that in Scotland headteachers must now indicate in their school development plans how they will consult children. Some secondary schools have programmes in which all new children are consulted on setting standards of how they would like to be treated by peers and teachers. \"Scottish schools are also looking at reducing the number of specialist lessons by combining some subjects and teaching, for example, broader topics such as environmental studies,\" says Christy. </p> <p>Some teachers would argue that middle schools addressed the problems of this age group much more clearly than ordinary secondaries. Introduced in the 1970s and with children from 9-13 or 8-12, they were meant to iron out the problems of being a young teenager. \"Middle schools were a good idea,\" says Brian Schram, the headteacher of Southwood Middle School in Milton Keynes. \"The ages of 8-13 are a time when children go from more concrete to abstract thought and become more streetwise. We try to develop their independence but also their interactivity with other children.\" </p> <p>Consultation on the government's proposals is likely to be heated. Dr Portwood is clear on who should be most consulted: \"We need to listen to adolescents rather than prescribe what's good for them.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Some government schemes are focus-group proof. They have so much riding on them that their presentation could suddenly cause entire front loungefuls of middle Englanders to snort their Rich Tea bickies up their noses and they wouldn't be changed. </p> <p>The government's post-16 reforms now have that unstoppable momentum. Whatever else may happen in this pre-election phony war, it is a dead cert that on April 2 there will be a big Learning and Skills Council and 47 mini clones. </p> <p>The Institute of Public Policy Research is no mere focus group. Even so, this thinktank which snuggles closest to the ear of government cannot expect the critical debate it is hosting today on the post-16 landscape to get any shrift at all from ministers. </p> <p>The seminar hosted by the IPPR at its offices off the Strand promises to throw up robust proposals on what should happen to higher and further education. Important as the issues are, it does look to be cutting things comically fine to be suggesting, in effect, a return to the drawing board just two months before the new \u00a36bn system is unveiled. </p> <p>But, as Professor Howard Glennister of the London School of Economics, and a key speaker said, there are no illusions about getting into the manifesto this time around. </p> <p>\"I'd like to go back to the drawing board, but that's the academic view.\" </p> <p>His fellow lead-speaker and LSE colleague, Dr Nicholas Barr, shrugs with scholarly sang-froid at the notion that the debate might be incongruously timed. That is not the academic's concern, even for one used to pitching in with policy advice at the highest level. He's currently advising the Hungarian government on a proposed student loans system. </p> <p>And he's certainly used to telling the highest circles at home what they don't want to hear. He advised a recent seminar at 11 Downing Street that it is not possible with any precision to measure the connection between education and economic growth. In other words it is not possible to find a scientific measure for the spillover benefits to society of educating individuals. </p> <p>The corollary is that no one can calculate what share of the cost of an individual's tertiary education the taxpayer should stump up for. </p> <p>And yet in its post-16 reforms, government does appear to insist that the spillover fruits of education can be measured. Time and again ministers talk about Britain suffering a skills deficit which can be measured. Furthermore our national economic game can be substantially raised if only that gap can be filled by further education. This underpins the drive for widening participation and all the targets to which education ministers are now apparently addicted. </p> <p>More than one voice today will give an opinion that these targets and their premise, if not plucked out of the air, are dodgy; not least Peter Robinson, the IPPR's senior economist and co-organiser of this series of post-16 seminars. According to those who share Robinson's views, the targets are arbitrary: 60% of 21-year-olds and 50% of adults to have level 3 qualifications by 2002 etc. </p> <p>He says bluntly that the National Skills Taskforce's assertion that by the end of the decade two-thirds of employment will be at level 3 is wrong. This illustrates the failure of planners to understand the economy. </p> <p>Ministers like to cite the level 3 deficit between Britain and its EU partners, France and Germany. </p> <p>Switzerland, Austria and Denmark, says Robinson, share with Germany a similar apprenticeship-based training system and relatively high proportions of the workforce with intermediate qualifications. Switzerland, Austria and Denmark, however, show productivity levels no higher than those in Britain. </p> <p>Today's seminar, entitled Discerning Consumers in a Learning Market, will debate the proposal that the whole of post-compulsory school age education, including higher education, should operate as a market. </p> <p>\"Can we really have post-secondary school education in these separate watertight compartments?\" asks Howard Glennister. </p> <p>\"Does it make sense to have two separate funding regimes. I don't think it does make sense.\" </p> <p>Glennister believes that in the separation of the sectors clear opportunities are not available to people to make the best decisions. </p> <p>The boundary between sectors is getting increasingly fuzzy on the ground. Ministers hope that foundation degrees can only melt the barrier down further.

      "bodyText": "Some government schemes are focus-group proof. They have so much riding on them that their presentation could suddenly cause entire front loungefuls of middle Englanders to snort their Rich Tea bickies up their noses and they wouldn't be changed. The government's post-16 reforms now have that unstoppable momentum. Whatever else may happen in this pre-election phony war, it is a dead cert that on April 2 there will be a big Learning and Skills Council and 47 mini clones. The Institute of Public Policy Research is no mere focus group. Even so, this thinktank which snuggles closest to the ear of government cannot expect the critical debate it is hosting today on the post-16 landscape to get any shrift at all from ministers. The seminar hosted by the IPPR at its offices off the Strand promises to throw up robust proposals on what should happen to higher and further education. Important as the issues are, it does look to be cutting things comically fine to be suggesting, in effect, a return to the drawing board just two months before the new \u00a36bn system is unveiled. But, as Professor Howard Glennister of the London School of Economics, and a key speaker said, there are no illusions about getting into the manifesto this time around. \"I'd like to go back to the drawing board, but that's the academic view.\" His fellow lead-speaker and LSE colleague, Dr Nicholas Barr, shrugs with scholarly sang-froid at the notion that the debate might be incongruously timed. That is not the academic's concern, even for one used to pitching in with policy advice at the highest level. He's currently advising the Hungarian government on a proposed student loans system. And he's certainly used to telling the highest circles at home what they don't want to hear. He advised a recent seminar at 11 Downing Street that it is not possible with any precision to measure the connection between education and economic growth. In other words it is not possible to find a scientific measure for the spillover benefits to society of educating individuals. The corollary is that no one can calculate what share of the cost of an individual's tertiary education the taxpayer should stump up for. And yet in its post-16 reforms, government does appear to insist that the spillover fruits of education can be measured. Time and again ministers talk about Britain suffering a skills deficit which can be measured. Furthermore our national economic game can be substantially raised if only that gap can be filled by further education. This underpins the drive for widening participation and all the targets to which education ministers are now apparently addicted. More than one voice today will give an opinion that these targets and their premise, if not plucked out of the air, are dodgy; not least Peter Robinson, the IPPR's senior economist and co-organiser of this series of post-16 seminars. According to those who share Robinson's views, the targets are arbitrary: 60% of 21-year-olds and 50% of adults to have level 3 qualifications by 2002 etc. He says bluntly that the National Skills Taskforce's assertion that by the end of the decade two-thirds of employment will be at level 3 is wrong. This illustrates the failure of planners to understand the economy. Ministers like to cite the level 3 deficit between Britain and its EU partners, France and Germany. Switzerland, Austria and Denmark, says Robinson, share with Germany a similar apprenticeship-based training system and relatively high proportions of the workforce with intermediate qualifications. Switzerland, Austria and Denmark, however, show productivity levels no higher than those in Britain. Today's seminar, entitled Discerning Consumers in a Learning Market, will debate the proposal that the whole of post-compulsory school age education, including higher education, should operate as a market. \"Can we really have post-secondary school education in these separate watertight compartments?\" asks Howard Glennister. \"Does it make sense to have two separate funding regimes. I don't think it does make sense.\" Glennister believes that in the separation of the sectors clear opportunities are not available to people to make the best decisions. The boundary between sectors is getting increasingly fuzzy on the ground. Ministers hope that foundation degrees can only melt the barrier down further. Glennister argues, though, that real choice for everyone cannot be possible without two basic conditions: equal information and equal funding. Despite the bulging web data on higher education institutions, many working class young people, he says, just don't have the information, at least not in an effective mode, to consider university. \"Some people may go into further education because they know about it and don't go into higher education because they don't.\" He argues not just for a level playing field where all institutions can charge fees, and there is an income-contingent student loan system. Why not give all 18-, or 21- year-olds, a capital sum which could be used for education or for starting up a business. Years of scrutinising markets have led Barr to conclude that information is paramount in deciding the relative roles they and the state should play in service provision. The state should have the lead role in schools, as it should with health care, because the punters in each case can't get or use the necessary information to make good choices. Tertiary education is more akin to food, where consumers can be relied on to make choices. In Barr's view post-16 education should be left to the market, with the state insuring that all consumers have the means to participate. \"The difference between food and health care has bugger all to do with ideology. Food conforms with the conditions you need for a market to work efficiently and health doesn't.\" Labour has been embracing markets, too warmly for some supporters. In the 1999 white paper Learning to Succeed there was a clearly expressed desire for a learning market driven by the needs of the learner. But how does this square with the triple layers of planning in the new system?",

Since winning the prime ministerial election on February 6, Sharon and his leading lieutenants in the rightwing Likud bloc have been locked in endless, acrimonious coalition discussions with the Labour party. After two weeks of public backbiting, the political crisis is now reaching a head, with Sharon threatening to break off discussions with the Labour party unless a deal is done by Monday. Labour leader Ehud Barak is trying to reconcile his ambition to become defence minister in Sharon's administration, with the promise he made after losing the prime ministership that he would withdraw from politics. Even more bizarrely, Barak remains prime minister until Sharon can somehow assemble a majority in the chronically fractious Knesset (parliament). Should he fail to do so, the country faces yet more elections, for parliament and prime minister. The new deadline has so far done little to concentrate minds on either side. Barak, according to political commentators, is making more rather than fewer demands. He is insisting that the coalition must not include small, far-right Knesset factions, and that he and other putative Labour ministers must have unfettered control over their departments. With Barak as defence minister and former prime minister Shimon Peres almost certain to become foreign minister, such an implied veto would severely restrict Sharon's scope for imposing radical change on Israel's diplomatic and security policies. In the latest Byzantine manoeuvre, Barak has apparently done a deal with his own Labour faction. He has promised his likely successor as party chairman, Knesset speaker Avraham Burg, that if he becomes defence minister, he will not mount any future challenge for the leadership. What makes the picture murkier, is Burg's unpopularity in the Knesset Labour caucus. They see the formation of a national unity government as a means of delaying a leadership race, and thus denying Burg the job. Adding to Sharon's difficulties, according to knowledgeable observers, is the lurking presence of former Likud leader and prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu, who was comprehensively defeated by Barak in the 1999 prime ministerial election, is itching to make a comeback. Israeli commentators say he'd love a Sharon coalition to fall apart, provoking fresh elections in which he could challenge for the Likud nomination. Meanwhile, as Sharon struggles to fill the vacuum in Israeli politics, another and in some ways more worrying hiatus is appearing in the Palestinian territories, where Yasser Arafat's authority and his rag-tag apparatus of government - the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) - are both crumbling. During the eight years of the Oslo peace process, Arafat was firmly in the driving seat of Palestinian politics. He was able to sideline or simply ignore the alternative power structures that had grown up during his long years of exile. Now, with Oslo dead and buried, the various arms of the Palestine Liberation Organisation of which Arafat is titular head, are finding new independent vigour.

We are disgusted by our chairman's response to criticism - likening groups such as the Black Lawyers Association or the Black Police Officers Association to all white, supremacy groups. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately this lazy piece of journalism would make people who read it antagonistic to the whole club and they would probably think it would be fitting for the club to go down.

The biggest compliment you can pay to him is that he looks totally at home around the likes of Figo, Ra\u00fal and Roberto Carlos and the Real fans recognise that - I have witnessed several standing ovations in honour of him! \"When you compare him to the other players in line for this position there is no competition - especially in a game against Spain, where he will know his opponents very well. He simply must start!\" York City fans: we're not racists Finally, many York fans are unhappy with David Hopps's match report about their game against Exeter. \"I was angered to read that David Hopps thinks that it would be a fitting end for York to go down after failing to join the kick out racism campaign,\" says Craig Smallbone. \"Our chairman Douglas Craig received countless letters and calls from City fans saying the club should back the campaign. \"Despite our terrible form and mismanagement at board level, City fans have continued to back the team. Why is it that Hopps chose to blame the club for the bigotry of our chairman?\" he adds. Craig's view is shared by Tom Dyson, who says: \"The majority of fans of York wanted Craig to sign up and tried in vain to get Mr Craig OBE to sign up. We are disgusted by our chairman's response to criticism - likening groups such as the Black Lawyers Association or the Black Police Officers Association to all white, supremacy groups. \"Unfortunately this lazy piece of journalism would make people who read it antagonistic to the whole club and they would probably think it would be fitting for the club to go down. Why could the journalist not have researched a little further into this matter and highlighted how our club is on the edge of oblivion due to negligent management at both board and coach level?\"",

      "bodyText": "BSkyB has launched a radical digital TV initiative with several London boroughs, in a bid to ensure all its customers haveupgraded for the proposed analogue switch-off deadline of 2006. The satellite broadcaster has teamed up with authorities in Enfield and Newham to replace communal aerials in housing blocks with state-of-the-art equipment that can pick up digital broadcasts. \"There are around 3m UK homes owned by local authorities and housing associations that need an upgrade to get digital TV,\" said a spokesman for BSkyB. The culture select committee last week raised the issue of making digital TV available to all UK homes before switching off the analogue signal around 2006. The signal is used to provide BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 programmes to the majority of the population. \"There was a lot of discussion about making digital TV available to every home in the UK but we need to know how to deal with homes with communal aerials. \"BSkyB believes a system like this is the best option,\" added the spokesman. The 80,000 residents who benefit from the free upgrade will not be obliged to subscribe to pay-TV services. However, the spokesman said the company was \"confident\" the customers would sign up to Sky Digital, which has more than 4m subscribers. BSkyB confirmed it is in negotiations with other local authorities and housing associations across the country, although the installation work will take up to three years.",

      "body": "<p>We grow what we need to survive - a crop of wheat, smaller crops of oats, rye, or barley in rotation, and a row of flax in the vegetable garden. My brother keeps an orchard of trees that produce many fruits of his own invention - strange, succulent things of rare colors, which require his constant gentle care and provide one of our chief pleasures. We preserve what we can for the dark days of the year. We give some to the Archduke's <a href=\"#four\">(4)</a> household and bring the rest to market, where the townspeople buy the goods to feed their families. </p> <p>When the horse could bear little weight, we loaded some of the fruits of the land onto our one-wheeled carts, carried the rest in our wood slings, and prayed each minute of the five-mile journey to town. Thankfully, we went to market only once a week, each of us bearing the choicest of his produce, peas, parsnips, or pears. If such a one as Gerald Desvres, who owned a great tract of meadow, had surplus hay, he would bring that to feed the town horses. Ydlbert, who is, after all, a sap, sometimes loaded his cart with wildflowers - then he could load it high, because they weigh almost nothing. His brother Yorik, who bordered the forest, sometimes brought a load of firewood. As the sun rose we began to lead our horses up the road. Mandrik has the best voice among us, clearer than the first birdsong of spring, and so he often accompanied us singing ballads of events in the times of our miraculous grandmother <a href=\"#five\">(5)</a> sprung from the sea; and when we were lucky, he sang to us from the repertory of his many adventures in Indo-China <a href=\"#six\">(6)</a>.Those tales, weird and fantastical, filled us with wonder and delight. </p> <p>The journey to market was gruelling, despite that the terrain was smooth and gently sloped. Many a man could be heard saying spells for safe drayage under his breath, especially at the crossroads. Horses always managed to slip free of their burdens - not my Hammadi, mind you, even before she had her name - or lose their shoes. And when finally we arrived at the city, we had to pass single-file through the gate and the fetid streets, which were closed to the sunlight, full of the odors of refuse and garlic. If a townswoman had hung her laundry in the street, the passing horses would knock it down, but it hardly mattered - even on the line, the linens were far from clean, and their descent to the gutter seemed, sadly, a return to their natural state. The younger sons, Ydlbert's and Desvres's especially, covered their noses in disgust. We wove between crumbling buildings until we arrived, quite abruptly, at the church steps, where we spread our wares. The horses and carts blocked off most access to the tight, oddly shaped apron of stone, even crammed as they were nearly atop one another, and the residents of the town always cursed us, spilling their slop buckets on us, kicking our horses in the shins as they struggled past. </p> <p>The townspeople were niggardly with their pennies, but they needed everything we brought them; if we could have produced twice as much, they would gladly have bought it to feed their families. Still, in those days it might take six months before a farmer could save enough money for a new earthenware jug or a hundred well-made nails. </p> <p>But that all happened in the past, which with impunity I can tell you ended on a spring Saturday, when I stumbled upon the miracle that changed our lives. On that April day the present as we know it began. </p> <p>Can you imagine the changes this single innovation has already wrought? At first it merely staved off the death of my horse, which was in itself a miracle. But after I showed Ydlbert my invention that fateful Sabbath, we retired to the barn to make a harness for his Thea - a black horse, not as proud of stature as my Hammadi, but nearly her equal in intelligence, and with a similar spot upon the forehead. The next morning was Monday, and we hitched our horses to our carts, loaded them fuller than any carts had ever been loaded before, and began our walk to town on our way to the city. Before we had reached the shrine, all our countrymen were abuzz. Wido Jungfrau was shaking his balding head, his thin lips pursed in disapproval, as ever. Jude Dithyramb simply stood with his mouth agape. My brother Mandrik, who in his haste had forgotten his shoes, ran up beside Hammadi on the road and tried to look into her eyes. \"Halt!\" he commanded her. \"I pray you, sister horse, halt!\" Hammadi, who had always been obedient, quit walking. \"Why do you not expire under your heavy load?\" </p> <p>\"I made her a harness, Mandrik!\" I shouted. \"She bears the burden with ease!\" </p> <p>\"Hush, my brother. I have asked your beast a question; I await her reply.\" Mandrik bowed his head respectfully while Hammadi flicked her face to the side twice, shooing off bugs, and worked her black lips together as if in speech. Then my brother, unshod but steady on his long, bare feet, made a slow circuit of inspection around the horse and cart, testing the strength of the harness at all its junctures. Mandrik smiled so wide he showed his strong yellow teeth down to the roots and turned up the corners of his soft blue eyes. \"What a miraculous thing you have made, Yves. We must offer thanksgiving.\" </p> <p>I bowed my head to him; since earliest childhood he had manifested his superiority in matters of the spirit. \"I have offered it moment by moment since.\" </p> <p>\"But we must all thank Providence, for now that you and Brother von Iggislau have this wondrous - what did you call it?\" </p> <p>\"A harness,\" I said. \"This harness is a boon, but may also sow the seeds of unrest in our midst. You must provide them for all your brethren, lest the fabric of the community be rent. And you must thank our grandmother, in case any of this was her influence.\" </p> <p>\"That old witch,\" said Wido Jungfrau. \"Hold, Wido,\" I warned him. </p> <p>Ydlbert's Dirk, who hadn't eaten since breakfast and already was growing cranky, said, \"Mandrik, why can't you go about shod, like other people?\" </p> <p>My brother, who had perhaps not yet remarked upon the nakedness of his toes, looked down. </p> <p>Ydlbert swatted his son's arm. \"You'll learn to respect visionaries and holy men.\" </p> <p>He flicked his curly hair out of his eyes. \"As you say, Father. I was but asking after his shoes.\" </p> <p>Wido Jungfrau said, \"I don't know why we need this thing. We always got on fine before.\" </p> <p>\"Then suit yourself,\" said tall Jepho Martin, nodding vigorously to his own elder brother, Heinrik, \"because I want one.\" </p> <p>Said Heinrik, with reverence, \"It is one of the loveliest things I have ever beheld.\" </p> <p>\"We are all equals when we are born from our mothers' wombs and when we return to God's dark earth,\" said Mandrik, \"and we must strive always to maintain our balance in between. To market with you, for the nonce, and Godspeed.\" </p> <p>The two harnesses created quite a stir among the townsmen, who as a result were more willing to pay a fair price for our goods. We were all pleased with the outcome of the day. After market, then, I traveled to the edge of my northern fields with barley ale and a bunch of flowers to offer up at my grandmother's cairn. The story went that when she was a young woman, my grandmother Iulia washed up in the tide with sea vegetables and fish, naked as the day God made her, with her dark auburn hair in a salty tangle behind. Some fisherman, his name long since lost, brought her the long journey inland to our village - which I am told sits in the very center of our island, a single verdant dip in the surrounding mountains - during which time she would nor speak to him nor eat. As it happened she spoke English, but in a strange, harsh voice, which made everyone think her a changeling or at best a thing of the sea; yet old Matthias Gansev\u00f6ort took pity upon the poor wretch, and accepted her into his crowded house as daughter. There she surprised him with her industrious weaving and her knack for concocting dishes more varied than porridge <a href=\"#seven\">(7)</a>; and soon enough, she began to compose music, bending the syntax of our tired old language to her will to make the sad, syncopated songs which eventually she passedon to my brother, and with which talent my wife was also blessed <a href=\"#eight\">(8)</a>. Iulia never lost her memory of the sea, nor quit telling tales of a great land beyond it, nor rid herself of the peculiar frankness of demeanor that marked her when she was first dredged up, and so was always somewhat feared among the villagers, who would not have her buried in the churchyard. There she was then, looming large above my land. I thought she would be glad for ale and flowers, though wildflowers grew all around; and I asked her to bless my invention. The next day Ydlbert and I brought our neighbors to my barn and instructed them in the manufacture of harnesses, and of long reins that we might stand in the carts behind the horses. Gerald Desvres brought a jug of fermented barley to share around the threshing floor, and recited the briefest blessing: </p> <p>All saints! All saints! All saints, hear! <br> Bless this measure of barley beer! </p> <p>It having thus been rendered safe, by nightfall our horses were all be-harnessed and our heads wobbly with liquor. We decided to meet thus every month on the new moon, if not to discuss inventions, then for the drink. </p> <p>At next market, my whole village - even those I disliked - had harnesses, and it became clear that our carts were now insufficient. Previously we had chosen among our weekly crops and loaded the carts tamely; now we loaded them to breaking with vegetables and fruits, and even then the horses, though tired, seemed little troubled by the journey. The carts needed to be different somehow, but every cart I had ever seen had been exactly like the one Hammadi now pulled; how was I to imagine a different way? One man cannot change everything in his lifetime. </p> <p>My brother, however, has an ability I do not understand to see things anew; this is, he tells me, a result of his wide journeys and of his lapsing into his states, and also perhaps explains why he has such gifts in singing and in grafting new trees but no real ability to work the soil. Mandrik retreated to a high-up crook in an oak tree for a day, taking with him only a gourd full of water, a slate, and a chalk rock, and when he returned, he brought me a drawing of the new cart. It had, as no cart had before, two wheels, one on either side of the axle log in the middle of the cart. With two wheels for balance we could make the carts longer, wider, and able to bear more than twice as much weight. Mandrik's design, which he explained to me again and again as I cut wood and assembled the contraption with nails, also called for higher sides, to keep stray carrots from spilling over. </p> <p>Mandrik and I loaded all my goods onto my new cart the next Market Day, and still it was not full; and when we drove Hammadi through our town, imagine the astonishment this new invention aroused. \"Crikes,\" Jepho Martin said, the only man tall enough to peer well over the high sides and into the marvelous machine. \"I'll give you five rounds of cheese if you'll help me and my brother make carts like this one. I can only imagine how happy it'd make old Heinrik. We could let the children sleep in them, in good weather.\" Within two weeks, every man in the village had a Two-Wheeled Cart to accompany his harness, and our meager incomes began to seem less bleak besides. The townspeople had surely been hungry all the years of their lives, because as much food as we brought them, they were able to eat. </p> <p>But since Adam's fall it has been our lot for circumstances to try our intelligence and faith. And look you: we had been satisfied until that time, but as soon as the prospect of a better fortune became manifest, we pursued it with all our hearts and minds. Over the summer and fall we built larger, stronger carts, capable of increasing our material wealth; and their increased size did not make them unkind to our precious beasts, all of whom now bore names. When at last we perfected our new carts - when they were as big as we desired them, and as sturdy - we had had our fill of inventing. One Market Day that winter we arrived at the gates of the city as the Prime bells began to ring in the dark morning. </p> <p>Ydlbert was at the front of the line, leading the proud black Thea by her reins. We heard a thump, then Thea's whinnying complaint. She stamped her feet for punctuation. </p> <p>\"Ydlbert?\" I called to him, leaving Hammadi's reins in Mandrik's idle hands. \"Brother von Iggislau, what ails you?\" My breath left me in a chill cloud. </p> <p>Jungfrau said, \"Bad news, I'll wager. It's about time the Devil caught up with us.\" I had lately noticed that small children kept their distance from him. </p> <p>As I approached the gate, I could see only the rear of the cart, protruding. Ydlbert and his horse appeared to be already somewhere inside. The cart began to shake, and first Ydlbert's hands, then his whole head and torso appeared atop his carrots and turnips. \"The blasted thing's stuck. It's stuck in the bloody gate.\" </p> <p>Jungfrau let out a hoot, and good Ion Gansev\u00f6ort hushed him. Some of the boys were giggling, though. </p> <p>I said, \"That can't be.\" </p> <p>Ydlbert tumbled over the vegetables and landed solidly on the ground. \"Look, then.\" He wiped himself clean, then blew into his hands, as he led me to the front of the cart. Indeed, the cart had caught both sides of the narrow gate. At least two hands' width of cart would not fit through. </p> <p>We backed the horses up and led them to the side of the road while we conferred - the townsmen treated us bitterly when we left horses near the church, so we did not want to block their ingress and egress through the Great West Gate. It was a bitter chill, though thankfully without snow, and every moment's delay made us more impatient. We had brought our tarpaulins to cover the ground before the church; now each of us lay his on the hard ground, filled it with as many vegetables as he could hoist, and carried the load into town, just as it was in the days of our grandfathers' grandfathers, who knew not how horses could be made to do a man's labor. The Martin brothers, Heinrik and Jepho, were bent so far under the weight of their burdens that their spectacular height was reduced to that of ordinary men. The sun was well up when finally we set our goods out to market; the townsfolk quibbled over the freshness of the food, and we left with numb fingers, half our goods still in the carts, and light pockets. </p> <p>A while past dark, I reached Ydlbert's home. The middle boys, who'd come with us, ran to the warm hearth; the smallest were strung up dreaming in their hammocks; and the elder two were not to be seen, though likely out lifting the skirts of Heinrik Martin's and Desvres's nubile daughters. Anya, weary-eyed, plunked bowls of porridge onto the table, then retired to her fireside chair, where she wound yarn from her distaff into a ball. At her feet an infant cat unwound yarn from another ball, but Anya worked more quickly, ensuring that the progress of the yarn was overall for the good. </p> <p>\"Was it a good day at market?\" she asked. Her thin lips scarcely moved when she spoke, so tired was she from her days of rearing sons. </p> <p>Ydlbert poured us milk from the bucket. \"The new carts are too wide to fit through the city gates, and we had to carry the vegetables on our backs.\" </p> <p>\"Monkeys, all,\" Anya said, though we knew monkeys only from my brother's stories of abroad. </p> <p>\"It was dreadful, wife.\" \"Now you know what it's like to trudge about with seven bairns inside you,\" she said, and stood up to check the smaller children's placement in their hammocks. </p> <p>Ydlbert ladled more porridge into our wooden bowls. \"We have to do something about that gate, is all,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Cast a spell?\" </p> <p>\"Talk to the Archduke.\" </p> <p>When I arose the next morning at sunup, Ydlbert was crouched on my stoop, holding a baked potato, that miraculous and most nourishing food my brother so providentially brought back with him from the Beyond, for warmth. The dog eyed his provisions greedily. </p> <p>\"For the sake of the Lord God,\" I said, \"you can come in, man.\" \"No time,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We've got hot porridge, and some fine pickles.\" </p> <p>\"And no time to eat it. This matter cannot wait.\" I wrapped myself up in my warmest garments, and we detoured up the side path to fetch my brother from his simple hut. We found him cutting back the dead vines in his winter arbor. Mandrik was the only man in the village besides myself and Father Stanislaus who could write, and had a fairer hand than I for drafting a petition. Besides, if nothing else, good luck followed him like the stink follows a stuffed cabbage; and he brought along his psaltery, and sang a song of his own devising to while away the walking time and to ease our restless spirits. </p> <p>We can't fit our carts <br> Through the city gates. <br> No, we can't fit our carts <br> Through the city gates. <br> But we gone petition the Archduke <br> Before it gets too late.</p> <p> Now, Ydlbert and Yves, <br> They don't believe in what I write. </p> <p>\"Yes, we do, brother,\" I interjected, to which Ydlbert appended, \"Amen.\" </p> <p>Yes, they doubt me like Thomas, <br> They don't think I'm all right. <br> Just wait until we reach the castle <br> And everything's gonna be out of sight. </p> <p>Despite Mandrik's optimism, we knew we had no chance of being admitted to his Urbanity's presence. What was he to do - accept petitions from every bumpkin farmer who came urgently to seek his counsel? No, we would leave our letter, beautifully penned in fine black ink by my brother, with our humble entreaties for kindness and mercy. </p> <p>The Archduke's castle stood sentinel over the southern half of the town. As we approached from the west, its crenellated towers loomed over the walls, theoretically protecting them from barbarian invaders, though, for one thing, Nnms had never been invaded, and, for another, if I were a barbarian, a place with good masonry would be my choicest choice for attack. None of us had ever been to the castle - the Archduke sent his red - liveried men around the village whenever he needed anything - though its towers were all we could see, except the steeple of the church, over the walls. </p> <p>Once inside we did not turn, as was our custom, toward the sanctuary, but south, toward the Archduke's castle. As soon as we left our familiar path, however, we became disoriented. This was an ordinary occurrence in the city; the streets were so narrow and wound so tight that it was impossible to know where one stood, and since they shifted every time someone burnt down his forge or added a new room to his home, they were never the same two weeks in a row. At least in the winter the stench was less pronounced. Ordinarily I carried my south-pointer, but in the hurry to get to my brother and to town, I had forgotten it. At each turn we were thwarted by walls, laundry lines, slop piles, archways, and dark stairs rising toward invisible heights. Before long we were lost utterly. Mandrik handed Ydlbert the psaltery and turned in a slow, patient circle, snapping his middle fingers against his thumbs. </p> <p>\"What are you doing?\" Ydlbert asked, stomping his feet in his worn shoes. Not having grown up in the same household, he had less tolerance, I suppose, for my brother's divining tricks. </p> <p>Long way to go, <br> Can't see the towers from here. <br> Lost our way, Lord, <br> Can't see the towers from here. <br> But one itty-bitty sign, Lord, <br> Makes the True Pathway clear. </p> <p>He stopped snapping and held his arms at his sides. Then he turned back the way we'd come, saying, \"It's that way.\" </p> <p>Ydlbert rolled his eyes. \"How do you know?\" </p> <p>Mandrik shrugged. \"Give me back my psaltery before I lose my temper.\" </p> <p>Ydlbert handed it to him and cast me a sidelong glance. </p> <p>Mandrik hummed to himself and led us down a few blind alleys, but before long brought us to the Archduke's gate, narrower than the town's, and the only opening in the sloping granite wall surrounding his demesne. The guards, identical in height and accent, and shivering in their silken livery of ruby hue, were surprisingly courteous once we showed them our petition, and they summoned us across the vast courtyard to the door. </p> <p>As we had imagined, we were not to be admitted to the presence of the Archduke, but we were shown to the impatient attach\u00e9, who was clad in flowing black silks and stood tapping his narrow-toed shoes and fingering his shiny mustache. Mandrik smiled, bowed, and so charmed the attach\u00e9 that, despite his nervousness, he allowed us to present the skeleton of our case aloud, and with feeling. Mandrik sang this petty functionary only a short snippet of song: </p> <p>We love the Archduke, <br> He's our mainest man. <br> Yes, we dig him deeply, <br> He's the mainest, mainest, mainest man. <br> (Skeet a deedly deedly doo doo doo-ah) <br> And if he'd widen up the West Gate, We'd serve him the best we can. </p> <p>By the end of the verse, the attach\u00e9 had tears in his blue eyes, and daubed at them with a black lace-edged handkerchief before applauding my brother's song. Calling out, \"Bravo! Bis! Bis!\" he accepted the petition with a show of grace. I used my walking stick to draw a diagram for a wider gate on the ground, and I explained, in the best words I could muster, that, while in our interests, the new gate would also serve the town. \"Oh, absolutely,\" said the attach\u00e9 really quite overcome with feeling. \"I have never received a petition so worthy of the Archduke's attention. Rest assured that I will relay it to his Urbanity. Do take his and my warmest wishes back to your countrymen.\" He gave us a skin of wine to ease our journey home. </p> <p>Ydlbert and I drank the wine on the road, and arrived at Mandrik's but stone-drunk. All three of us slept around the fire on his bare dirt floor, but when Ydlbert and I returned to our families in the morning, we were more flush with the good news than with the morning chill and the previous night's debauchery. </p> <p>The next Market Day, when we headed back with our awkward carts and our tarpaulins, we saw hazy dark smoke on the horizon; it was clear, even from a distance, that something was afire. When we reached the city, we saw that the gate had been widened by twice the length of a man's arm. The squalid row of tenements which had previously intervened between the gate and the church square had fallen into heaps, razed. Two old men with buckets were dumping dirt on some of the smoldering remains, and three or four bands of children climbed and slid in the rubble, searching for spoons and bits of colored tile and glass. One woman picked dourly through the remains of what once had surely been her hovel, clutching a wailing infant to her breast. This part of the city had never before seen the full light of day, and suddenly it was flooded with light, as healthful and clean as one of our own fields; and yet to see this misery exposed seemed untoward, as if we should avert our eyes. But we could not avert them. \"Looks like something's happened,\" said Ydlbert's brother, Yorik, who had perhaps never been the brightest star in Mandragora's firmament. Ydlbert slapped him, but it seemed in jest. </p> <p>We processed through to the center of town, and there set up shop around the kettle fires the townsmen had lit. Around us they walked with their hands shielding their eyes, both from the smoke and from the uncustomary brightness in the square. Even the space before the church was clearer now - the Archduke had, without our prompting, razed the filthiest habitations, so that we could display our produce in better view. The next week, aware of how much space had gone unused, we brought even more of our goods to sell, and the week after that, some of the local tradesmen began bringing their wares, to take advantage of the milling people and the light. A potter sold jars and crockery; the tanner draped hides over a sawhorse; the smith stood at one corner of the empty space, calling for horses to be shod. Each week the market grew bigger, and each week more debris was removed, until finally, that spring, there was a fine, clear path to the sanctuary, a processional wide and grand enough for princes and kings. The road within the city gates was surfaced with broad, flat stones, smooth underfoot and to the carts' wheels. \"It's Paving,\" Mandrik told me, the first time we drove our wary horses over them. \"I have seen it in Indo-China, though there it was all of hammered brass, making the roads sparkle brighter than a courtesan's eyes.\" I had never seen a courtesan nor heard of paving - I knew only that what I saw was beautiful. But Mandrik knew that something momentous had happened, even if I did not have the knowledge to understand his explanation fully. </p> <p>Each week we brought more and more of our crop to market, until it seemed our land could no longer stand the burden of such production. That spring was balmy, with soft rains and a strong sun, but we dripped our sweat into the ground every hour of the daylight, and still could not sate the townspeople or exhaust our soil. One day as I worked on my farthest strip - near my grandmother's cairn - wishing I were my brother that I might have a song to sing, bathed in sweat, toiling in the heat of the midday sun, pulling a wooden plow so old and worn that I would soon need to replace its coulter and share, the next great thought insinuated itself into my mind like a whisper: Hammadi could pull the plow for me, and I could simply walk behind, to guide it. Hammadi could pull a much bigger plow than can I. I gave up the rest of the day to tinkering, and by nightfall had constructed a new harness for plowing; the next day I attached handles to the plow so that I could guide it from behind. Ydlbert stopped over the next morning - from his adjacent strip he had seen me leave mine two days since, and wanted to make certain I had not taken ill. I led him to my barn, hitched up Hammadi, and set her to work. She performed the work of three farmers with only a fraction of the effort and none of the grumbling. Ydlbert shook his broad, balding head, and crouched down as if exhausted in the good dirt that marked the border between our two fields. \"Yves,\" he said, \"think of it. Think what you've done. The horses will do all the work - we'll finish at noon and lie about the rest of the day.\" </p> <p>I followed Hammadi to the end of the row. She wasn't going straight, exactly, but she pulled the plow with ease; I could certainly make it larger. I then returned to my friend and sat down in the dirt beside him, and we talked of the idyllic life to come. Ydlbert was right - we would have time now to patch the holes in our roofs and our children's shoes, to dig wells, perhaps even to help our wives tend the herb gardens and spin wool. Ydlbert wanted to go to the glassmaker to learn to blow vessels. All my life Mandrik had pestered me to write down tales, but I had never the time nor the inclination, particularly as he was no help with quotidian labors. Now, who knew what I might find time for? I did not know then that I would find myself writing this history, but I knew that my world had changed such that something might get written. Hammadi stood gently munching the grass at the end of the row, for she did not know to turn around and work the next piece of land. It hardly mattered. She could be trained. </p> <p>I admit that at this moment a small stone of doubt lodged in the bottom of my stomach, for I realized that this vast plot - these twenty acres, as big as any plot of land had ever needed to be - this land to which my father and his forebears had given their lives dutifully and without complaint, these strips of land they had leveled stone by stone and tended until they were among the finest in the valley, would no longer suffice. </p> <p>***</p> <p>The harness in its various forms has changed our lives in many ways for the better. We grow more food than our families can eat, more than we can sell to the town. Our soil is rich, and our farming advanced each generation has made some improvement in the methods of husbandry, but none so remarkable as ours. We have money as we never did before, and our city, which was a stinking gutter, now glitters like the stars in the great dome of the sky. That first paved path was only the beginning - now the city has long, wide roads stretching toward the four cardinal points of the horizon, all paved in gray stones, so that even Andras Drck, the horse dealer at the far northern edge of town, is as easy to reach as my nearest neighbors. Suddenly, where there once was squalor, there is light, air, and free passage. The Archduke soon issued an edict to name these paved passageways as one would name a child or a place - they won't be knocked down, these paths, they won't shift with the rain. The roads will then be like our horses - once so temporary we hardly thought about them, they will now endure. </p> <p>Finding our way in the city is different with these roads. In my youth we navigated as do, my brother says, the sailors at sea - we fixed the positions of the sun, towers, and steeple, and hoped to find our destination. Later we had my south-pointer, but it told only if one was facing south. Going anywhere in town was trouble - it made the breath come short and the eyes sting. Now everything is flooded with light, and we go straight from one place to another, knowing our location at all the places in between. The city is half as large as once I thought. It only took so long to get anywhere because one had to circumvent so many buildings, gardens, and walls.</p> <p> I have built already a storeroom onto my home, and rethatched the roof, and I would like to buy a second cow next spring. I bought Adela\u00efda eight yards of pale blue linen, like a noblewoman's, and a vast array of spices. Because of one invention, the city, my city, is outgrowing its walls. </p> <p>All of this change is wondrous, no doubt; and yet I must admit that when I invented the harness, I did not imagine that it would bring hardship along with all this bounty. I did not know that the whole world would change when I made Hammadi her first harness. I did not know that I might someday want the old world, or some of its ways, back. </p> <p>If this one tiny bit of human ingenuity, the contribution of a man with no title, hardly a name - if so little can change so much, then I fear for our future. I fear the things our children will know, the things of which we can only dream. My prayer, my ardent prayer, is that we are moving forward, and toward the path of God. </p> <p>*** </p> <p>(4) Urbis of Nnms</p> <p>(5) The aforementioned Iulia</p> <p>(6) Mandrik reported to his countrymen that during a three-year absence he travelled to Indo-China via India and the great Silk Road</p> <p>(7) None of these alleged recipes has survived</p> <p>(8) Man tell a woman lies <br> 'Spect her kiss his feet. <br>Yes, a man tell a woman lies <br> 'Spect her kiss his feet. <br> But when Judgement Day acomin', man <br> You be sorry you's so indiscreet</p>",

      "bodyText": "We grow what we need to survive - a crop of wheat, smaller crops of oats, rye, or barley in rotation, and a row of flax in the vegetable garden. My brother keeps an orchard of trees that produce many fruits of his own invention - strange, succulent things of rare colors, which require his constant gentle care and provide one of our chief pleasures. We preserve what we can for the dark days of the year. We give some to the Archduke's (4) household and bring the rest to market, where the townspeople buy the goods to feed their families. When the horse could bear little weight, we loaded some of the fruits of the land onto our one-wheeled carts, carried the rest in our wood slings, and prayed each minute of the five-mile journey to town. Thankfully, we went to market only once a week, each of us bearing the choicest of his produce, peas, parsnips, or pears. If such a one as Gerald Desvres, who owned a great tract of meadow, had surplus hay, he would bring that to feed the town horses. Ydlbert, who is, after all, a sap, sometimes loaded his cart with wildflowers - then he could load it high, because they weigh almost nothing. His brother Yorik, who bordered the forest, sometimes brought a load of firewood. As the sun rose we began to lead our horses up the road. Mandrik has the best voice among us, clearer than the first birdsong of spring, and so he often accompanied us singing ballads of events in the times of our miraculous grandmother (5) sprung from the sea; and when we were lucky, he sang to us from the repertory of his many adventures in Indo-China (6).Those tales, weird and fantastical, filled us with wonder and delight. The journey to market was gruelling, despite that the terrain was smooth and gently sloped. Many a man could be heard saying spells for safe drayage under his breath, especially at the crossroads. Horses always managed to slip free of their burdens - not my Hammadi, mind you, even before she had her name - or lose their shoes. And when finally we arrived at the city, we had to pass single-file through the gate and the fetid streets, which were closed to the sunlight, full of the odors of refuse and garlic. If a townswoman had hung her laundry in the street, the passing horses would knock it down, but it hardly mattered - even on the line, the linens were far from clean, and their descent to the gutter seemed, sadly, a return to their natural state. The younger sons, Ydlbert's and Desvres's especially, covered their noses in disgust. We wove between crumbling buildings until we arrived, quite abruptly, at the church steps, where we spread our wares. The horses and carts blocked off most access to the tight, oddly shaped apron of stone, even crammed as they were nearly atop one another, and the residents of the town always cursed us, spilling their slop buckets on us, kicking our horses in the shins as they struggled past. The townspeople were niggardly with their pennies, but they needed everything we brought them; if we could have produced twice as much, they would gladly have bought it to feed their families. Still, in those days it might take six months before a farmer could save enough money for a new earthenware jug or a hundred well-made nails. But that all happened in the past, which with impunity I can tell you ended on a spring Saturday, when I stumbled upon the miracle that changed our lives. On that April day the present as we know it began. Can you imagine the changes this single innovation has already wrought? At first it merely staved off the death of my horse, which was in itself a miracle. But after I showed Ydlbert my invention that fateful Sabbath, we retired to the barn to make a harness for his Thea - a black horse, not as proud of stature as my Hammadi, but nearly her equal in intelligence, and with a similar spot upon the forehead. The next morning was Monday, and we hitched our horses to our carts, loaded them fuller than any carts had ever been loaded before, and began our walk to town on our way to the city. Before we had reached the shrine, all our countrymen were abuzz. Wido Jungfrau was shaking his balding head, his thin lips pursed in disapproval, as ever. Jude Dithyramb simply stood with his mouth agape. My brother Mandrik, who in his haste had forgotten his shoes, ran up beside Hammadi on the road and tried to look into her eyes. \"Halt!\" he commanded her. \"I pray you, sister horse, halt!\" Hammadi, who had always been obedient, quit walking. \"Why do you not expire under your heavy load?\" \"I made her a harness, Mandrik!\" I shouted. \"She bears the burden with ease!\" \"Hush, my brother. I have asked your beast a question; I await her reply.\" Mandrik bowed his head respectfully while Hammadi flicked her face to the side twice, shooing off bugs, and worked her black lips together as if in speech. Then my brother, unshod but steady on his long, bare feet, made a slow circuit of inspection around the horse and cart, testing the strength of the harness at all its junctures. Mandrik smiled so wide he showed his strong yellow teeth down to the roots and turned up the corners of his soft blue eyes. \"What a miraculous thing you have made, Yves. We must offer thanksgiving.\" I bowed my head to him; since earliest childhood he had manifested his superiority in matters of the spirit. \"I have offered it moment by moment since.\" \"But we must all thank Providence, for now that you and Brother von Iggislau have this wondrous - what did you call it?\" \"A harness,\" I said. \"This harness is a boon, but may also sow the seeds of unrest in our midst. You must provide them for all your brethren, lest the fabric of the community be rent. And you must thank our grandmother, in case any of this was her influence.\" \"That old witch,\" said Wido Jungfrau. \"Hold, Wido,\" I warned him. Ydlbert's Dirk, who hadn't eaten since breakfast and already was growing cranky, said, \"Mandrik, why can't you go about shod, like other people?\" My brother, who had perhaps not yet remarked upon the nakedness of his toes, looked down. Ydlbert swatted his son's arm. \"You'll learn to respect visionaries and holy men.\" He flicked his curly hair out of his eyes. \"As you say, Father. I was but asking after his shoes.\" Wido Jungfrau said, \"I don't know why we need this thing. We always got on fine before.\" \"Then suit yourself,\" said tall Jepho Martin, nodding vigorously to his own elder brother, Heinrik, \"because I want one.\" Said Heinrik, with reverence, \"It is one of the loveliest things I have ever beheld.\" \"We are all equals when we are born from our mothers' wombs and when we return to God's dark earth,\" said Mandrik, \"and we must strive always to maintain our balance in between. To market with you, for the nonce, and Godspeed.\" The two harnesses created quite a stir among the townsmen, who as a result were more willing to pay a fair price for our goods. We were all pleased with the outcome of the day. After market, then, I traveled to the edge of my northern fields with barley ale and a bunch of flowers to offer up at my grandmother's cairn. The story went that when she was a young woman, my grandmother Iulia washed up in the tide with sea vegetables and fish, naked as the day God made her, with her dark auburn hair in a salty tangle behind. Some fisherman, his name long since lost, brought her the long journey inland to our village - which I am told sits in the very center of our island, a single verdant dip in the surrounding mountains - during which time she would nor speak to him nor eat. As it happened she spoke English, but in a strange, harsh voice, which made everyone think her a changeling or at best a thing of the sea; yet old Matthias Gansev\u00f6ort took pity upon the poor wretch, and accepted her into his crowded house as daughter. There she surprised him with her industrious weaving and her knack for concocting dishes more varied than porridge (7); and soon enough, she began to compose music, bending the syntax of our tired old language to her will to make the sad, syncopated songs which eventually she passedon to my brother, and with which talent my wife was also blessed (8). Iulia never lost her memory of the sea, nor quit telling tales of a great land beyond it, nor rid herself of the peculiar frankness of demeanor that marked her when she was first dredged up, and so was always somewhat feared among the villagers, who would not have her buried in the churchyard. There she was then, looming large above my land. I thought she would be glad for ale and flowers, though wildflowers grew all around; and I asked her to bless my invention. The next day Ydlbert and I brought our neighbors to my barn and instructed them in the manufacture of harnesses, and of long reins that we might stand in the carts behind the horses. Gerald Desvres brought a jug of fermented barley to share around the threshing floor, and recited the briefest blessing: All saints! All saints! All saints, hear! Bless this measure of barley beer! It having thus been rendered safe, by nightfall our horses were all be-harnessed and our heads wobbly with liquor. We decided to meet thus every month on the new moon, if not to discuss inventions, then for the drink. At next market, my whole village - even those I disliked - had harnesses, and it became clear that our carts were now insufficient. Previously we had chosen among our weekly crops and loaded the carts tamely; now we loaded them to breaking with vegetables and fruits, and even then the horses, though tired, seemed little troubled by the journey. The carts needed to be different somehow, but every cart I had ever seen had been exactly like the one Hammadi now pulled; how was I to imagine a different way? One man cannot change everything in his lifetime. My brother, however, has an ability I do not understand to see things anew; this is, he tells me, a result of his wide journeys and of his lapsing into his states, and also perhaps explains why he has such gifts in singing and in grafting new trees but no real ability to work the soil. Mandrik retreated to a high-up crook in an oak tree for a day, taking with him only a gourd full of water, a slate, and a chalk rock, and when he returned, he brought me a drawing of the new cart. It had, as no cart had before, two wheels, one on either side of the axle log in the middle of the cart. With two wheels for balance we could make the carts longer, wider, and able to bear more than twice as much weight. Mandrik's design, which he explained to me again and again as I cut wood and assembled the contraption with nails, also called for higher sides, to keep stray carrots from spilling over. Mandrik and I loaded all my goods onto my new cart the next Market Day, and still it was not full; and when we drove Hammadi through our town, imagine the astonishment this new invention aroused. \"Crikes,\" Jepho Martin said, the only man tall enough to peer well over the high sides and into the marvelous machine. \"I'll give you five rounds of cheese if you'll help me and my brother make carts like this one. I can only imagine how happy it'd make old Heinrik. We could let the children sleep in them, in good weather.\" Within two weeks, every man in the village had a Two-Wheeled Cart to accompany his harness, and our meager incomes began to seem less bleak besides. The townspeople had surely been hungry all the years of their lives, because as much food as we brought them, they were able to eat. But since Adam's fall it has been our lot for circumstances to try our intelligence and faith. And look you: we had been satisfied until that time, but as soon as the prospect of a better fortune became manifest, we pursued it with all our hearts and minds. Over the summer and fall we built larger, stronger carts, capable of increasing our material wealth; and their increased size did not make them unkind to our precious beasts, all of whom now bore names. When at last we perfected our new carts - when they were as big as we desired them, and as sturdy - we had had our fill of inventing. One Market Day that winter we arrived at the gates of the city as the Prime bells began to ring in the dark morning. Ydlbert was at the front of the line, leading the proud black Thea by her reins. We heard a thump, then Thea's whinnying complaint. She stamped her feet for punctuation. \"Ydlbert?\" I called to him, leaving Hammadi's reins in Mandrik's idle hands. \"Brother von Iggislau, what ails you?\" My breath left me in a chill cloud. Jungfrau said, \"Bad news, I'll wager. It's about time the Devil caught up with us.\" I had lately noticed that small children kept their distance from him. As I approached the gate, I could see only the rear of the cart, protruding. Ydlbert and his horse appeared to be already somewhere inside. The cart began to shake, and first Ydlbert's hands, then his whole head and torso appeared atop his carrots and turnips. \"The blasted thing's stuck. It's stuck in the bloody gate.\" Jungfrau let out a hoot, and good Ion Gansev\u00f6ort hushed him. Some of the boys were giggling, though. I said, \"That can't be.\" Ydlbert tumbled over the vegetables and landed solidly on the ground. \"Look, then.\" He wiped himself clean, then blew into his hands, as he led me to the front of the cart. Indeed, the cart had caught both sides of the narrow gate. At least two hands' width of cart would not fit through. We backed the horses up and led them to the side of the road while we conferred - the townsmen treated us bitterly when we left horses near the church, so we did not want to block their ingress and egress through the Great West Gate. It was a bitter chill, though thankfully without snow, and every moment's delay made us more impatient. We had brought our tarpaulins to cover the ground before the church; now each of us lay his on the hard ground, filled it with as many vegetables as he could hoist, and carried the load into town, just as it was in the days of our grandfathers' grandfathers, who knew not how horses could be made to do a man's labor. The Martin brothers, Heinrik and Jepho, were bent so far under the weight of their burdens that their spectacular height was reduced to that of ordinary men. The sun was well up when finally we set our goods out to market; the townsfolk quibbled over the freshness of the food, and we left with numb fingers, half our goods still in the carts, and light pockets. A while past dark, I reached Ydlbert's home. The middle boys, who'd come with us, ran to the warm hearth; the smallest were strung up dreaming in their hammocks; and the elder two were not to be seen, though likely out lifting the skirts of Heinrik Martin's and Desvres's nubile daughters. Anya, weary-eyed, plunked bowls of porridge onto the table, then retired to her fireside chair, where she wound yarn from her distaff into a ball. At her feet an infant cat unwound yarn from another ball, but Anya worked more quickly, ensuring that the progress of the yarn was overall for the good. \"Was it a good day at market?\" she asked. Her thin lips scarcely moved when she spoke, so tired was she from her days of rearing sons. Ydlbert poured us milk from the bucket. \"The new carts are too wide to fit through the city gates, and we had to carry the vegetables on our backs.\" \"Monkeys, all,\" Anya said, though we knew monkeys only from my brother's stories of abroad. \"It was dreadful, wife.\" \"Now you know what it's like to trudge about with seven bairns inside you,\" she said, and stood up to check the smaller children's placement in their hammocks. Ydlbert ladled more porridge into our wooden bowls. \"We have to do something about that gate, is all,\" he said. \"Cast a spell?\" \"Talk to the Archduke.\" When I arose the next morning at sunup, Ydlbert was crouched on my stoop, holding a baked potato, that miraculous and most nourishing food my brother so providentially brought back with him from the Beyond, for warmth. The dog eyed his provisions greedily. \"For the sake of the Lord God,\" I said, \"you can come in, man.\" \"No time,\" he said. \"We've got hot porridge, and some fine pickles.\" \"And no time to eat it. This matter cannot wait.\" I wrapped myself up in my warmest garments, and we detoured up the side path to fetch my brother from his simple hut. We found him cutting back the dead vines in his winter arbor. Mandrik was the only man in the village besides myself and Father Stanislaus who could write, and had a fairer hand than I for drafting a petition. Besides, if nothing else, good luck followed him like the stink follows a stuffed cabbage; and he brought along his psaltery, and sang a song of his own devising to while away the walking time and to ease our restless spirits. We can't fit our carts Through the city gates. No, we can't fit our carts Through the city gates. But we gone petition the Archduke Before it gets too late. Now, Ydlbert and Yves, They don't believe in what I write. \"Yes, we do, brother,\" I interjected, to which Ydlbert appended, \"Amen.\" Yes, they doubt me like Thomas, They don't think I'm all right. Just wait until we reach the castle And everything's gonna be out of sight. Despite Mandrik's optimism, we knew we had no chance of being admitted to his Urbanity's presence. What was he to do - accept petitions from every bumpkin farmer who came urgently to seek his counsel? No, we would leave our letter, beautifully penned in fine black ink by my brother, with our humble entreaties for kindness and mercy. The Archduke's castle stood sentinel over the southern half of the town. As we approached from the west, its crenellated towers loomed over the walls, theoretically protecting them from barbarian invaders, though, for one thing, Nnms had never been invaded, and, for another, if I were a barbarian, a place with good masonry would be my choicest choice for attack. None of us had ever been to the castle - the Archduke sent his red - liveried men around the village whenever he needed anything - though its towers were all we could see, except the steeple of the church, over the walls. Once inside we did not turn, as was our custom, toward the sanctuary, but south, toward the Archduke's castle. As soon as we left our familiar path, however, we became disoriented. This was an ordinary occurrence in the city; the streets were so narrow and wound so tight that it was impossible to know where one stood, and since they shifted every time someone burnt down his forge or added a new room to his home, they were never the same two weeks in a row. At least in the winter the stench was less pronounced. Ordinarily I carried my south-pointer, but in the hurry to get to my brother and to town, I had forgotten it. At each turn we were thwarted by walls, laundry lines, slop piles, archways, and dark stairs rising toward invisible heights. Before long we were lost utterly. Mandrik handed Ydlbert the psaltery and turned in a slow, patient circle, snapping his middle fingers against his thumbs. \"What are you doing?\" Ydlbert asked, stomping his feet in his worn shoes. Not having grown up in the same household, he had less tolerance, I suppose, for my brother's divining tricks. Long way to go, Can't see the towers from here. Lost our way, Lord, Can't see the towers from here. But one itty-bitty sign, Lord, Makes the True Pathway clear. He stopped snapping and held his arms at his sides. Then he turned back the way we'd come, saying, \"It's that way.\" Ydlbert rolled his eyes. \"How do you know?\" Mandrik shrugged. \"Give me back my psaltery before I lose my temper.\" Ydlbert handed it to him and cast me a sidelong glance. Mandrik hummed to himself and led us down a few blind alleys, but before long brought us to the Archduke's gate, narrower than the town's, and the only opening in the sloping granite wall surrounding his demesne. The guards, identical in height and accent, and shivering in their silken livery of ruby hue, were surprisingly courteous once we showed them our petition, and they summoned us across the vast courtyard to the door. As we had imagined, we were not to be admitted to the presence of the Archduke, but we were shown to the impatient attach\u00e9, who was clad in flowing black silks and stood tapping his narrow-toed shoes and fingering his shiny mustache. Mandrik smiled, bowed, and so charmed the attach\u00e9 that, despite his nervousness, he allowed us to present the skeleton of our case aloud, and with feeling. Mandrik sang this petty functionary only a short snippet of song: We love the Archduke, He's our mainest man. Yes, we dig him deeply, He's the mainest, mainest, mainest man. (Skeet a deedly deedly doo doo doo-ah) And if he'd widen up the West Gate, We'd serve him the best we can. By the end of the verse, the attach\u00e9 had tears in his blue eyes, and daubed at them with a black lace-edged handkerchief before applauding my brother's song. Calling out, \"Bravo! Bis! Bis!\" he accepted the petition with a show of grace. I used my walking stick to draw a diagram for a wider gate on the ground, and I explained, in the best words I could muster, that, while in our interests, the new gate would also serve the town. \"Oh, absolutely,\" said the attach\u00e9 really quite overcome with feeling. \"I have never received a petition so worthy of the Archduke's attention. Rest assured that I will relay it to his Urbanity. Do take his and my warmest wishes back to your countrymen.\" He gave us a skin of wine to ease our journey home. Ydlbert and I drank the wine on the road, and arrived at Mandrik's but stone-drunk. All three of us slept around the fire on his bare dirt floor, but when Ydlbert and I returned to our families in the morning, we were more flush with the good news than with the morning chill and the previous night's debauchery. The next Market Day, when we headed back with our awkward carts and our tarpaulins, we saw hazy dark smoke on the horizon; it was clear, even from a distance, that something was afire. When we reached the city, we saw that the gate had been widened by twice the length of a man's arm. The squalid row of tenements which had previously intervened between the gate and the church square had fallen into heaps, razed. Two old men with buckets were dumping dirt on some of the smoldering remains, and three or four bands of children climbed and slid in the rubble, searching for spoons and bits of colored tile and glass. One woman picked dourly through the remains of what once had surely been her hovel, clutching a wailing infant to her breast. This part of the city had never before seen the full light of day, and suddenly it was flooded with light, as healthful and clean as one of our own fields; and yet to see this misery exposed seemed untoward, as if we should avert our eyes. But we could not avert them. \"Looks like something's happened,\" said Ydlbert's brother, Yorik, who had perhaps never been the brightest star in Mandragora's firmament. Ydlbert slapped him, but it seemed in jest. We processed through to the center of town, and there set up shop around the kettle fires the townsmen had lit. Around us they walked with their hands shielding their eyes, both from the smoke and from the uncustomary brightness in the square. Even the space before the church was clearer now - the Archduke had, without our prompting, razed the filthiest habitations, so that we could display our produce in better view. The next week, aware of how much space had gone unused, we brought even more of our goods to sell, and the week after that, some of the local tradesmen began bringing their wares, to take advantage of the milling people and the light. A potter sold jars and crockery; the tanner draped hides over a sawhorse; the smith stood at one corner of the empty space, calling for horses to be shod. Each week the market grew bigger, and each week more debris was removed, until finally, that spring, there was a fine, clear path to the sanctuary, a processional wide and grand enough for princes and kings. The road within the city gates was surfaced with broad, flat stones, smooth underfoot and to the carts' wheels. \"It's Paving,\" Mandrik told me, the first time we drove our wary horses over them. \"I have seen it in Indo-China, though there it was all of hammered brass, making the roads sparkle brighter than a courtesan's eyes.\" I had never seen a courtesan nor heard of paving - I knew only that what I saw was beautiful. But Mandrik knew that something momentous had happened, even if I did not have the knowledge to understand his explanation fully. Each week we brought more and more of our crop to market, until it seemed our land could no longer stand the burden of such production. That spring was balmy, with soft rains and a strong sun, but we dripped our sweat into the ground every hour of the daylight, and still could not sate the townspeople or exhaust our soil. One day as I worked on my farthest strip - near my grandmother's cairn - wishing I were my brother that I might have a song to sing, bathed in sweat, toiling in the heat of the midday sun, pulling a wooden plow so old and worn that I would soon need to replace its coulter and share, the next great thought insinuated itself into my mind like a whisper: Hammadi could pull the plow for me, and I could simply walk behind, to guide it. Hammadi could pull a much bigger plow than can I. I gave up the rest of the day to tinkering, and by nightfall had constructed a new harness for plowing; the next day I attached handles to the plow so that I could guide it from behind. Ydlbert stopped over the next morning - from his adjacent strip he had seen me leave mine two days since, and wanted to make certain I had not taken ill. I led him to my barn, hitched up Hammadi, and set her to work. She performed the work of three farmers with only a fraction of the effort and none of the grumbling. Ydlbert shook his broad, balding head, and crouched down as if exhausted in the good dirt that marked the border between our two fields. \"Yves,\" he said, \"think of it. Think what you've done. The horses will do all the work - we'll finish at noon and lie about the rest of the day.\" I followed Hammadi to the end of the row. She wasn't going straight, exactly, but she pulled the plow with ease; I could certainly make it larger. I then returned to my friend and sat down in the dirt beside him, and we talked of the idyllic life to come. Ydlbert was right - we would have time now to patch the holes in our roofs and our children's shoes, to dig wells, perhaps even to help our wives tend the herb gardens and spin wool. Ydlbert wanted to go to the glassmaker to learn to blow vessels. All my life Mandrik had pestered me to write down tales, but I had never the time nor the inclination, particularly as he was no help with quotidian labors. Now, who knew what I might find time for? I did not know then that I would find myself writing this history, but I knew that my world had changed such that something might get written. Hammadi stood gently munching the grass at the end of the row, for she did not know to turn around and work the next piece of land. It hardly mattered. She could be trained. I admit that at this moment a small stone of doubt lodged in the bottom of my stomach, for I realized that this vast plot - these twenty acres, as big as any plot of land had ever needed to be - this land to which my father and his forebears had given their lives dutifully and without complaint, these strips of land they had leveled stone by stone and tended until they were among the finest in the valley, would no longer suffice. *** The harness in its various forms has changed our lives in many ways for the better. We grow more food than our families can eat, more than we can sell to the town. Our soil is rich, and our farming advanced each generation has made some improvement in the methods of husbandry, but none so remarkable as ours. We have money as we never did before, and our city, which was a stinking gutter, now glitters like the stars in the great dome of the sky. That first paved path was only the beginning - now the city has long, wide roads stretching toward the four cardinal points of the horizon, all paved in gray stones, so that even Andras Drck, the horse dealer at the far northern edge of town, is as easy to reach as my nearest neighbors. Suddenly, where there once was squalor, there is light, air, and free passage. The Archduke soon issued an edict to name these paved passageways as one would name a child or a place - they won't be knocked down, these paths, they won't shift with the rain. The roads will then be like our horses - once so temporary we hardly thought about them, they will now endure. Finding our way in the city is different with these roads. In my youth we navigated as do, my brother says, the sailors at sea - we fixed the positions of the sun, towers, and steeple, and hoped to find our destination. Later we had my south-pointer, but it told only if one was facing south. Going anywhere in town was trouble - it made the breath come short and the eyes sting. Now everything is flooded with light, and we go straight from one place to another, knowing our location at all the places in between. The city is half as large as once I thought. It only took so long to get anywhere because one had to circumvent so many buildings, gardens, and walls. I have built already a storeroom onto my home, and rethatched the roof, and I would like to buy a second cow next spring. I bought Adela\u00efda eight yards of pale blue linen, like a noblewoman's, and a vast array of spices. Because of one invention, the city, my city, is outgrowing its walls. All of this change is wondrous, no doubt; and yet I must admit that when I invented the harness, I did not imagine that it would bring hardship along with all this bounty. I did not know that the whole world would change when I made Hammadi her first harness. I did not know that I might someday want the old world, or some of its ways, back. If this one tiny bit of human ingenuity, the contribution of a man with no title, hardly a name - if so little can change so much, then I fear for our future. I fear the things our children will know, the things of which we can only dream. My prayer, my ardent prayer, is that we are moving forward, and toward the path of God. *** (4) Urbis of Nnms (5) The aforementioned Iulia (6) Mandrik reported to his countrymen that during a three-year absence he travelled to Indo-China via India and the great Silk Road (7) None of these alleged recipes has survived (8) Man tell a woman lies 'Spect her kiss his feet.

      "bodyText": "Programmes on some of the most high-profile digital TV channels are being watched by so few people they hardly register on ratings charts. ITV2 and BBC Choice, which screen repeats of some of the nation's most popular programmes, are proving to be of mixed benefit for TV chiefs desperate to maintain a presence in digital homes. And E4, the Channel 4 pay-TV entertainment service that launched just over a month ago, has also had its fair share of ratings turkeys. Its youth programming between 4pm and 7pm is faring particularly badly. Last night's repeat of Coronation Street on ITV2 got a zero rating. BBC Choice's Liquid News managed just 500 viewers at 11.30pm, according to unofficial overnights obtained by MediaGuardian.co.uk. But an EastEnders repeat that aired on BBC Choice at 10pm last night fared better, pulling in 130,000 viewers. A repeat of the Michelle Collins drama Daylight Robbery on ITV2 got just 2,800 viewers, between 10pm and 11pm. It was beaten by a repeat of the Fast Show on Play UK at 11.30pm, which had 6,100 viewers. Liquid News - the BBC Choice showbiz news bulletin regarded as one of the channel's programming successes - had just 7,000 viewers at 8.30pm when it was first screened by the channel. And a BBC Choice repeat of BBC2 drama Attachments managed an audience of only 9,000 at 9pm. In the past week, music news and chart show Popworld, E4 teen drama As If and repeated Channel 4 teen soap Hollyoaks have all registered zero ratings. Last night, Shipwrecked 2 gained just 8,300 viewers on E4 from 8pm. But a Channel 4 spokesman said that with a 1.1% audience share during the time it is on air - 4pm-4am - \"E4 is already the third most watched basic tier multi-channel service, after Sky One and UK Gold\". E4's best rating shows in the past month have been Friends with 821,000 viewers; ER with 473,000 and Trigger Happy TV with 207,000. The Channel 4 pay-TV service is available in around 5.4m cable, satellite and digital terrestrial homes; while BBC Choice is distributed to 6.6m. But ITV2 is only available in 2.8m multi-channel homes because of ITV's decision to stay off the Sky Digital platform, which now has around 4.6m digital TV customers.",

      "bodyText": "Early intervention is needed to stop children trying drugs and alcohol, according to a leading drug and alcohol charity. Rosie Brocklehurst, of Addaction, said urgent action is needed before children start secondary school to prevent drug and alcohol addiction in teenagers. She said: \"For too long people have turned their back on drug and alcohol problems as it is not a cuddly subject. Communities and funders need to wake up to the need to address and resolve this issue.\" Today a survey has revealed that British teenagers are more likely to have taken drugs, drunk alcohol or smoked than most of their European counterparts.The findings, from the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs, found that nearly 30% of the sample of 15- and 16-year-olds said they had been drunk at least 20 times in their life - a quarter said they had been intoxicated three or more times in the past month. There has been a slight decline in illicit drug use since the last survey of this kind in 1995, but UK teenagers are still more likely than most Europeans to have taken a variety of illicit substances. Ms Brocklehurst believes that there are complex social reasons why the UK has a poorer performance in the league table. \"The UK took the lead on dance culture which is associated with drug use and we are now seeing the consequences. Availability of drugs and peer pressure in the playground are other key factors,\" she said, More than 35% of 15- to 16-year-olds said they had tried cannabis, which was the most popular drug by far. Ms Brocklehurst said her charity which offers drug and alcohol treatment is increasingly seeing people in their early 20s when the effects of childhood substance abuse have taken hold.

More girls than boys admitted smoking, and in total, 34% of children said they had smoked during the past month. The report's author Dr Martin Plant, said: \"I would like to see a sensible approach to this because it is the legal drugs such as cigarettes and alcohol which lead to the most deaths and illnesses with young people in this country. \"If the government wants to crack down on drugs dealers it should be looking at the shop keepers who are selling the drink and cigarettes to the children.\" The survey questioned 15 and 16-year-olds from schools in 30 European countries. In Britain 223 schools participated out of a random sample of 302. Other countries where a high number of teenagers admitted taking drugs were the Republic of Ireland, France and the Czech Republic. Countries with low levels of drug use included Finland, Sweden, Malta and Cyprus. The report come just a day after a World Health Organisation (WHO) report said that 33,000 people a year in England and Wales alone are dying from drink-induced causes. And in a European conference on young people and alcohol, WHO director general Gro Harlem Brundtland yesterday attacked alcohol companies for aggressively marketing products such as alcopops to young people with advertising that focuses on youth lifestyle, sex, sports and fun. Ms Brocklehurst added: \"Everyone can be affected by drug abuse and people need to accept that day centres are needed within communities - there is too much nimbyism.\" Addaction is holding a conference on 7 June with the Home Office and Department of Health to look at how to address issues of drug and alcohol addicted teenagers.",

The previous Monda,y Silent Witness restricted the blockbuster ITV gameshow to 9m viewers. Elsewhere last night it was Channel 4's turn to catch a ride on coat-tails of the publicity surrounding Hannibal. It screened a repeat of the movie Manhunter - the human flesh-eating Dr Lecter's first screen outing - between 10pm and 12.15am.

      "bodyText": "China has admitted making extensive use of a much-criticised form of imprisonment without trial in its efforts to suppress the banned Falun Gong spiritual sect. The practice of sending people to labour camps for \"re-education\" has been condemned by human rights groups abroad. They say Beijing may also be employing it to clear the streets of undesirables during its bid to stage the 2008 Olympic Games. A team from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) visits the city today to assess the bid. The police are on heightened alert against demonstrations, after another alleged Falun Gong supporter committed suicide in public on Friday. A thousand women followers of Falun Gong have been \"successfully re-educated\" at a \"re-education through labour institute\" in Liaoning province, the official People's Daily reported at the weekend. It said the \"tutors\" at the Masanjia camp provided \"loving care\", helping the inmates to overcome their resistance to reform. Claims by the Falun Gong organisation abroad that many members had been tortured by Masanjia were denied. The figures quoted for one camp in one province give an idea of the magnitude of the operation against the Falun Gong. The People's Daily said more than 300 inmates had returned home from Masanjia after finishing their \"re-education terms\". Another 300 had their terms reduced or were serving them \"outside the facility\". The process of labour re-education appears similar to the \"thought reform\" methods used in Chinese labour camps during the Mao Zedong era. In a typical case in Masanjia, a \"former cult leader\", Li Lina, says the prison \"even provided the latest articles of Li Hongzhi and organised former practitioners to debate them\". The use of repentant inmates to persuade more stubborn prisoners to change their beliefs was a characteristic feature of the \"thought reform\" process. Mr Li, the Falun Gong's spiritual \"master\", who issues his pronouncements from the US, has denounced unnamed Falun Gong members for working for the authorities after being persuaded to recant. The Human Rights in China group in the US calculates that up to 2m people are picked up under some form of \"administrative custody\" every year, at least 5% of them children. The system, used in the past mainly against marginalised groups - typically those without jobs or papers or fixed abode - allows detention of up to two years without trial. In a letter to the IOC, the co-chairman of Human Rights in China, Robert Bernstein, says that it \"cannot risk further shame by abetting Beijing's abuse of citizens.\" He urges the IOC to \"insist that China pledge not to use these camps to make Beijing more presentable for the games\". Falun Gong sources abroad have published claims of alleged torture in the detention camps leading to more than 140 deaths since the Falun Gong was banned in July 1999. Beijing routinely denies that torture occurs, while admitting that Falun Gong members have died in detention. \"You have to ask how they died,\" a Chinese diplomat, Zhang Yuanyuan, told the BBC last week. \"So there are some who are old, sick and they commit suicide. \"They throw themselves against the wall and got themselves fatally injured, and they refused to eat, refused to take medicine, refused medical attention, and people also died of natural causes.\" Falun Gong confirms that members frequently resort to hunger strike as a form of protest, and say that this is dealt with brutality. It publicised the case of Li Mei who died in Hefei detention centre on February 1 after going on hunger strike. Her family were allegedly not allowed to examine her body. An Amnesty International report says the crackdown fits a pattern in which the government demands quick results from local officials who then use torture to obtain recantations or confessions. It says that out of the 120 alleged Falun Gong deaths it has looked at, 17 \"jumped\" to their death, according to official reports, and 15 \"fell\" while in detention. It says there is evidence that force feeding was carried out by people with no medical training, resulting in damage to the windpipe and other reportedly fatal complications. China rejected the report as based on \"rumours and hearsay\".",

      "bodyText": "The lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, will respond tomorrow to criticism of his role as a fundraiser for Labour by personally answering a question on the issue in the House of Lords. The response tomorrow to the question tabled by Liberal Democrat peer Lord McNally will be Lord Irvine's first public comment on the outcry over a letter he wrote to Labour-supporting lawyers, asking them to donate at least \u00a3200 each to the party. It comes amid growing pressure for reform of the lord chancellor's position, removing the power to appoint judges and QCs from someone with a key political role. It had been expected that the lord chancellor would avoid putting himself open to direct questioning on the party fundraising issue by having the question answered by the attorney general, Lord Williams, or the leader of the house, Baroness Jay. But his department today confirmed that he would respond himself when Lord McNally asks \"whether the role of lord chancellor is compatible with that of a party fundraiser\". Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Mo Mowlam claimed that splits were emerging in the Tory party over chairman Michael Ancram's call for Lord Irvine to resign over the so-called \"cash for wigs\" affair. She pointed to comments made by the shadow lord chancellor, Lord Kingsland, who declined to add his voice to Mr Ancram's demand for Lord Irvine's head. Lord Kingsland defended the Labour peer's record in appointing judges and QCs, saying he had always acted with \"absolute probity\". But by allowing himself to be drawn into party politics and not replying to his critics, Lord Irvine had forced the Conservatives to demand his resignation, he said. Ms Mowlam said: \"Lord Kingsland made it clear ... that he didn't see this as a resigning matter. He said that Lord Irvine 'has behaved with the utmost probity in selecting judges'.\" Lord Kingsland also rejected proposals - backed by the influential Law Society - to split the lord chancellor's judicial and political roles. The Law Society has proposed a new independent judicial appointments commission, to ensure that \"fears of patronage cease to be an issue\", and the suggestion has won the backing of the left-leaning Institute of Public Policy Research thinktank. The lord chancellor's department said today that Lord Irvine had already advertised the position of first commissioner for judicial appointments, who will provide independent monitoring of the selection procedure for new judges. However, this falls short of the Law Society's preferred option - reported to have won some support within the government - of removing the power to appoint judges from Lord Irvine altogether. Talk about it Should Lord Irvine resign?

      "bodyText": "If you thought the Tamagotchi virtual pet craze was dead, you were mistaken. The idea of virtual pets is alive and well and coming to a mobile phone near you. Motorola is to offer its mobile phone users pets that live on their handsets. In a deal with games developer Creature Labs, Motorola will market games that are played on web-enabled mobile phones connected to GPRS and third generation networks. The first game available will be called Sea-Monkey. The game begins with the birth of the creature, then the mobile phone user must nurture it through various stages of life, ensuring its happiness and health. Each player has a virtual tank in which the Sea-Monkey lives. The mobile phone user must care for the environmental condition of the tank, for example, by providing different plants for the Sea-Monkey to play with. The pet must also be fed. The more interaction a player has with their pets, the more bonuses are accredited. Bonuses can be swapped for plants or machinery to keep the tank clean. Motorola considers the wireless games market to be a major area for development. If mobile phone users can be persuaded to connect to their phone networks more often, revenues for the companies involved grow. The games will reside on a server connected to the mobile phone operator's network and not to the individual handset. This means players have to connect to the network to check on their pet. The new generation of phone networks will allow an \"always on\" connection to the internet, allowing instant interactivity with the pets. At the moment, users have to log on every time they use WAP services. Creature Labs chief executive Chris McKee said: \"We're really pleased to have formed a partnership with Motorola to exploit the exciting games opportunities represented by next generation wireless devices.\"",

For years, westerners have supported a protest party called Reform that championed their interests and became the official opposition after the 1997 federal election. But last year, Reform changed its name to the Canadian Alliance and watered down its conservative policies in an effort to appeal to voters in the rest of the country. It didn't work. The Canadian Alliance was all but locked out of eastern Canada in the fall election, but dominated in the west. Once again, the House of Commons is fractured along the east-west divide. It didn't help that prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien insulted westerners during the campaign, joking that he was more comfortable with eastern Canadians, or that he mused in a recent interview about using \"tough love\" on the region. One of his cabinet ministers criticized the Canadian Alliance as being racist and bigoted, an attack that many westerners took personally. The truth is, while a separate nation of westerners is as likely as pigs learning to fly, the resentment and unhappiness of the radical few is shared by many, especially in Alberta. \"This western alienation talk is real and we had better pay attention to what's being said. It is being talked about at kitchen tables and in coffee shops,\" Canadian Alliance MP Myron Thompson told the Globe and Mail, Canada's oldest national newspaper. Even if they don't want separation, Mr Thompson says many westerners want more autonomy from Ottawa, much as Quebeckers do. Prominent western intellectuals recently called on Alberta premier Ralph Klein to opt out of the national health care program and pension plan. The growing anger in the west comes as the Quebec separatist movement appears to be entering a period of dormancy. Polls show support for independence is low, so low that Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard, the man who came close to winning the 1995 referendum on sovereignty, has decided to quit to work in the private sector.

      "bodyText": "Germany's main Jewish group plans to take internet service providers to court if they provide German citizens with access to Nazi and far-right websites. The vice-president of the Central Council for Jews, Michel Friedman, said yesterday he wants to see the German government act to enforce laws that prohibit the publication of anti-semitic and racist content, even if the sites concerned are hosted outside Germany. Mr Friedman hopes a lawsuit from the Central Council for Jews will prompt the German government to take the kind of action that the French government did when it took the US internet company Yahoo! to court over a site that auctioned Nazi memorabilia. The French government argued that as French citizens had access to a site, Yahoo! was breaching national law even though the site was hosted in the US and was not specifically directed at French users. Yahoo! complied with the French ruling, but has filed a suit in a California court to challenge the jurisdiction of the French court. The existence of hate groups online is protected under US freedom of speech laws. German courts ruled in December that a foreign internet service provider is subject to German law if its sites can be accessed within the country. \"This is difficult to defend on the subject matter; no one wants to support Nazi sites,\" said Mike Pullen, an internet lawyer with London firm DLA. \"But this is a worrying principle. Who's next?

While US ISPs await the final outcome of the Yahoo! case, Mr Pullen feels that European internet companies may be able to stem the tide of rulings by using article 10 of the European convention on human rights. \"It's not as broad as the US freedom of speech, but it does provide for freedom of expression and may offer some protection,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "The explosion in mobile phone text messaging has sparked a competition enquiry from telecoms watchdog Oftel. Oftel is investigating the price controls it set in 1998 to prevent the excessive \"termination charges\" levied on customers who phoned the BT Wireless and Vodafone networks. For example, on a standard BT Wireless contract, a call to a rival network would cost 50p a minute at peak times compared with 18p a minute for a call to a BT phone. With text messages, no distinction is made between networks, with BT charging a flat rate of 12p per message irrespective of the receiving network. The regulator today said text messages are seen as a far cheaper alternative to phone calls, and it will decide if this is encouraging competitive pricing in termination charges. \"If people think it is too expensive to call other mobiles, they might get round it by sending a text message because it might be cheaper,\" said a spokeswoman for Oftel. Text messaging is now the preferred method of communication of teenagers trying to beat excessive phone charges. But it is also a hugely popular mode of communication with busy executives. In December, a record 750m text messages were sent in the UK alone, with 6bn messages exchanged during the whole of last year. \"We will look at short messaging services to see whether this is having an impact on the way people are using mobile phones. \"It may be putting a competitive pressure on termination charges because people are choosing a different way of communicating,\" added the Oftel spokeswoman. Oftel will remove the price controls on BT and Vodafone if it finds the mobile phone market is competitive enough to keep prices down without the regulator's intervention.",

Pure has launched a CD-Rom-based magazine called Enter, edited by former Later deputy Sam Delaney, which it is describing as \"a TFI men's lifestyle Edinburgh Nights\". The magazine centres around a \"virtual city\" that users access from their CD-Rom. It apes the familiar lads' mag format, featuring interviews with Charlie Seiga, and the inevitable totty slot in the shape of Grimleys star Amanda Holden. But more oddly, the first issue features an interview with Gerry Adams on what he likes about Britishness, from PG Wodehouse to Enid Blyton. Mr Delaney said the magazine aimed to be \"like going to a great party and not quite knowing which room to visit first\". He continued: \"You can see celebrities, play games, watch classic comedy and even go shopping.\" Enter, which will be sold on newsstands from Thursday February 22, is aimed at men aged 18-35. The launch follows a dismal set of ABCs for the men's lifestyle magazine sector. Esquire's circulation fell by 39% year on year, Emap's Sky plunged 35.2% year on year while Later lost 22% of its circulation.",

Whatever your feelings about sports utility vehicles, you would rather have been in the Shogun than on the horse. </p> <p>In a couple of respects, the Pinin may be thought to be suffering from a big-brother complex.

And it has a vast door-pull on the boot, as if this was a meat locker you were opening rather than a standard Japanese back door. These touches feel like the equivalent of elevator shoes - as if the car can't quite resign itself to being the kid. </p> <p>Publicity photographs for the Pinin imagine it functioning across a fetchingly broad spectrum of uses, and with women at the wheel. Mitsubishi claim they have designed the Pinin with women in mind. Not just any women - \"women who know what they want\". But cornering the market may not be as simple as that. What if it turns out that what some of these women know they want is a Toyota Rav 4? </p> <p>Whatever, in one photo, we see a woman in shiny shoes, standing by a bruisingly ostentatious gold Pinin outside Harrods, as a green-liveried flunky ferries a hamper in the direction of her boot; in another, we see a woman in black boots, loading into a silver Pinin the contents of a Tesco's trolley; and in another, a driver, who may be a man or a woman in any kind of footwear, tilting a blue Pinin through approximately 70 degrees in what appears to be a torrential mudslide in the middle of a thicket. </p> <p>These lives could be yours in a Pinin.

      "bodyText": "It has been the biggest sensation in the history of children's publishing. And now the biggest drink brand in the world is set to cash in on the success of Harry Potter with a record-breaking deal to launch the movie. Coca-Cola has signed a \u00a3103m, multi-year deal to be the sole global marketing partner of the Harry Potter film when it opens. The scale of the deal has staggered the industry. The marketing budget is almost enough to pay for the movie and it would certainly be enough to make 30 Billy Elliott films. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone will launch in November and cost Warner Bros \u00a3110m to make. Coca-Cola and Warner Bros hope the joint marketing push will create the blockbuster sales both companies need. Despite the size of the deal, Harry Potter will not be turned into a spokesman for Coca-Cola. Author JK Rowling is insistent she does not want to taint the stories' magic and innocence with aggressive commercialisation. Usually children's and family movies are accompanied by huge ad pushes in fast-food outlets such as McDonald's and Burger King. Films such as Pokemon and The Grinch were involved with huge toy giveaways. Similarly, the Harry Potter film will be accompanied by joint promotions with supermarkets and an advertising blitz. But the main focus of the global marketing push will be the promotion of literacy programmes around the world. The marketing plans will run across the flagship Coca-Cola brand and US brands owned by the Minute Maid Company, including the Hi-C and Minute Maid juice drinks. \"This important partnership with Warner Bros and the release of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone marks one of the largest global entertainment initiatives ever undertaken by the Coca-Cola Company,\" said Steve Jones, Coca-Cola Company senior vice-president and chief marketing officer. \"Both Harry Potter and Coca-Cola reach deep into the heart of local communities around the world to add a little bit of magic to people's everyday lives. \"Bringing the two together creates a opportunity for us to develop programmes that will not only touch people emotionally, but allow us to affect their lives in a tangible, meaningful way,\" said Mr Jones. Warner Bros Pictures president of international marketing Sue Kroll said: \"This strategic relationship represents the first time a marketing alliance of this magnitude, with such global impact and significance, will be employed by Warner Bros.\" The film is being directed by Chris Columbus, of Mrs Doubtfire fame. Harry Potter will be played by Daniel Radcliffe, who starred in the BBC's David Copperfield.",

The World Professional Billiard and Snooker Association has appointed Media Content to help it through a looming clash with the Sportsmasters Network. The latter is forming a rival professional snooker tour and has already recruited several top players. The new tour could threaten the WPBSA's stranglehold on media coverage of the event. The body hopes the recruitment of Media Content will increase snooker coverage in Europe and Asia. \"With the appointment of Media Content, World Snooker is clearly demonstrating it is building the right team to put its strategic vision into practice,\" said Jim McKenzie, chief executive of World Snooker. TSN set up the rival body because it believed snooker is a global money-spinner that has not achieved its commercial potential under the WPBSA. The company intends to make snooker a huge hit over the internet, with pay-as-you-play online snooker games and webcasts of major tournaments. But Media Content is a seasoned professional in the broadcasting rights world. It has brokered deals with sports giants such Manchester United and the New Zealand All Blacks. \"We are delighted to be appointed by the official body for World Snooker. \"We look forward to assisting it in the development and implementation of a media strategy that will provide long-term benefits to all snooker players worldwide,\" said Jean-Paul de la Fuente, chief executive of Media Content.",

The minimum award for rape victims will be increased from \u00a37,500 to \u00a311,000 and people who suffer multiple injuries will receive higher sums.

The German government has agreed to an EU scheme to buy and slaughter 400,000 head of cattle to prop up beef prices. The sale of beef fell sharply after it was discovered at the end of last year that mad cow disease had entered German herds. Meat from the cull will be tested for BSE before being approved for export. Since BSE tests are not 100% reliable the beef intended for North Korea will carry a higher risk of infection than meat from countries unaffected by the disease. Pyongyang's willingness to have it was conveyed in a letter from its diplomatic mission in Berlin congratulating Ms K\u00fcnast on her appointment. Ms K\u00fcnast, a Green, joined the cabinet last month after her predecessor resigned after being criticised for his handling of the BSE crisis.

Amores Perros, roughly translated as Love's A Bitch, has made the first-time Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu the hottest property since Quentin Tarantino. The film has won plaudits and prizes all over the world - 24 in all since it cleared the board at the Critics' Week at Cannes last May. Last week it won an Oscar nomination for best foreign film. But despite predictions that it could match its Oscar rival Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as a mainstream hit here, it is highly unlikely to be passed uncut by the censor because one of its three intertwining stories involves dog fighting. An obscure British law dating from the 1930s has put the British board of film classification in the \"impossible position\" of having to decide whether the film's pivotal scene can be legally shown. Stephen Frears, the British director of The Grifters and High Fidelity, who was bowled over by the film at last year's San Sebastian film festival, where he chaired the jury, claimed it would be a \"national disgrace\" if it is not released here. \"This is freshest, most forceful film I have seen in ages.

But the strict provisions of the Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act, 1937, means British distributors have been very slow about picking it up despite its triumph at the Edinburgh and London film festivals. What worries them is 21 seconds of footage in the first and most powerful story, which revolves around an illegal dog-fighting den in Mexico City. Pit bull terriers, alsatians and rottweilers appear to fight to the death in a graphic demonstration of what the director calls the \"bestial values\" that have infected their owners. \"The dog that is the tragic anti-hero of the film is a pet who fights for his owner out of love for him but which itself turns into a killer,\" he said, \"just as his owner becomes a killer out of a thwarted love for his brother's wife.

      "body": "<p>Contrary to widespread belief Lord Irvine of Lairg does not owe his position to the fact that he employed young Tony Blair and his future wife, Cherie Booth, and brought them together in his self-styled role as \"Cupid QC\".</p> <p>Long before he was \"Tony's crony\", the future lord chancellor was a loyal ally of Neil Kinnock, playing a crucial behind-the-scenes role in guiding the legal moves that resulted in Militant's expulsion from Labour in the late 1980s.</p> <p>Much earlier than that he was a close university friend of John Smith's. It is perfectly possible that Smith or Mr Kinnock would have made him lord chancellor had they won power first. But it was certain that the Blairs, who are both fond of their Cupid, would do so. As a joke Lord Irvine still occasionally refers to his protege as \"Young Blair\".</p> <p>Derry Irvine settled down after his boozy student days with John Smith (both were serious drinkers, unlike their friend Donald Dewar, whose ex-wife, Alison, Irvine later married). The ambitious only child of an Inverness roofer, and fierce socialist, he made his way up the English legal profession.</p> <p>As a civil lawyer - solid rather than brilliant, other lawyers say - he built up a formidable practice, worth the best part of \u00a31m a year, it was said. He loved good living, fine wines and fine paintings (an impressive private collection), but was always solidly Labour, a poor boy who made good but did not forget his roots.</p> <p>Not even his friends say he has the common touch, although his overbearing manner (\"a bully and a braggart\" one Labour lawyer said yesterday) reflects an underlying shyness. Some even claim his pomposity is partly self-parody. As with the \u00a360,000 wallpaper bill remark - \"we are not talking about something at the DIY store\" - or the joke about being another Cardinal Wolsey, it is hard to tell.</p> <p>He is determined to go down in history as a reforming lord chancellor, the man who cut back on legal aid millionaires, who put through the Human Rights Act which enshrines the European convention in British law, who backed freedom of information but was outwitted by the wily Jack Straw, even less of a civil libertarian.</p> <p>That is Lord Irvine's problem, as it is with Lord Falconer, another of Mr Blair's lawyer friends. Both work ferociously hard but, coming late to politics, lack guile.

      "bodyText": "Contrary to widespread belief Lord Irvine of Lairg does not owe his position to the fact that he employed young Tony Blair and his future wife, Cherie Booth, and brought them together in his self-styled role as \"Cupid QC\". Long before he was \"Tony's crony\", the future lord chancellor was a loyal ally of Neil Kinnock, playing a crucial behind-the-scenes role in guiding the legal moves that resulted in Militant's expulsion from Labour in the late 1980s. Much earlier than that he was a close university friend of John Smith's. It is perfectly possible that Smith or Mr Kinnock would have made him lord chancellor had they won power first. But it was certain that the Blairs, who are both fond of their Cupid, would do so. As a joke Lord Irvine still occasionally refers to his protege as \"Young Blair\". Derry Irvine settled down after his boozy student days with John Smith (both were serious drinkers, unlike their friend Donald Dewar, whose ex-wife, Alison, Irvine later married). The ambitious only child of an Inverness roofer, and fierce socialist, he made his way up the English legal profession. As a civil lawyer - solid rather than brilliant, other lawyers say - he built up a formidable practice, worth the best part of \u00a31m a year, it was said. He loved good living, fine wines and fine paintings (an impressive private collection), but was always solidly Labour, a poor boy who made good but did not forget his roots. Not even his friends say he has the common touch, although his overbearing manner (\"a bully and a braggart\" one Labour lawyer said yesterday) reflects an underlying shyness. Some even claim his pomposity is partly self-parody. As with the \u00a360,000 wallpaper bill remark - \"we are not talking about something at the DIY store\" - or the joke about being another Cardinal Wolsey, it is hard to tell. He is determined to go down in history as a reforming lord chancellor, the man who cut back on legal aid millionaires, who put through the Human Rights Act which enshrines the European convention in British law, who backed freedom of information but was outwitted by the wily Jack Straw, even less of a civil libertarian. That is Lord Irvine's problem, as it is with Lord Falconer, another of Mr Blair's lawyer friends. Both work ferociously hard but, coming late to politics, lack guile. Hence the hamfisted fundraising letter condemned by all but Lord Irvine's most loyal allies. There have been hints that he will give way to Lord Williams of Mostyn after the election. But Lord Williams will probably become leader of the Lords. Even his critics admit that, at 60, Derry Irvine can keep his job for as long as he wants it.

      "bodyText": "The first serious pre-election battle over the NHS erupted today after the health secretary, Alan Milburn, and his opposite number Liam Fox clashed over Tory proposals to divert NHS funds on private healthcare. Mr Milburn accused the Tories of abandoning the NHS after the shadow health spokesman, Dr Liam Fox, unveiled plans that would require the health service to buy more care from private providers. Dr Fox also promised to scrap Labour's waiting list initiative, and to abolish nearly \u00a3500m of tax penalties on private health insurance in a bid to persuade more individuals and firms to purchase health care. In what was trailed as a preview of the Tories' election health manifesto, Dr Fox said his approach would free the health service from top-down planning and begin \"the much-needed transformation of the NHS from a managed to a regulated service\". But Mr Milburn said: \"The Conservatives have today abandoned the basic concept of the national health service - that care should be based on need and not ability to pay. \"The Conservatives now believe that money that could be spent on NHS patients should instead by used to subsidise those who already have private health insurance.\" Dr Fox, speaking at the Society of Apothecaries, said: \"We must stop regarding the NHS as a sacred cow. It is not a capital crime to admit that the NHS desperately needs far-reaching reform.\" He said that while the NHS would continue to be free and centrally funded through taxation, the Tories would end its \"archetypal state-run monopoly\" by helping to create a thriving non-state sector. Under the Tories' scheme, health authorities and GPs would be expected to send patients to the best quality and value-for-money care providers - regardless of whether they are private or NHS. \"I believe the time has come for the NHS to worry less about providing all the care itself, and instead to focus on ensuring that the treatment which it does undertake reaches the required standards,\" said Dr Fox. He also announced proposals to give away nearly \u00a3500m in tax breaks to firms and individuals in an attempt to stimulate the private health insurance market and increase the overall amount of healthcare. \"We must increase the overall capacity of the system - in both funding and provision - by both enlarging the NHS and encouraging growth of the independent sector.\" Dr Fox said Labour's waiting list plan - which seeks to cut the overall numbers of people waiting for NHS care - distorted health priorities and would be replaced by a system which would ensure that the sickest patients are treated first. He said the Conservatives had \"absolute commitment\" to reviving the health service, was committed to its principles, had ruled out charges for NHS care and was committed to matching Labour's spending on health. But he added: \"We shall spend the money differently and better, with particular emphasis on improving the quality of treatment. \"In parallel with this, we will encourage the development of a much bigger independent sector, to supplement the work of the NHS.\" The Liberal Democrat health spokesman, Nick Harvey, said: \"Liam Fox is tinkering at the edges with targets and tax breaks. The Tories would waste money on subsidising private health care when what the NHS really needs is more doctors and nurses. \"Only the Tories are arrogant enough to believe that tax cuts and private health care will solve problems of their own making.\"",

      "body": "<p>Full text of the speech by shadow health secretary, Dr Liam Fox:</p> <p>Images of the 1970s</p> <p>Recent photographs of bodies lying unrefrigerated and piled on top of one another in a chapel of rest brought back powerful memories for many people. Images of the winter of discontent reminded us that while much of our national life has changed beyond recognition in the past 30 years, the NHS remains firmly rooted in the culture of the 1970s.</p> <p>Before the last election, Tony Blair told voters that they had 24 hours to save the NHS. Increasing numbers of voters feel that Labour has let them down on health and excuses about having failed to understand the size of the problems cut little ice.</p> <p>The problems themselves are exacerbated by Labour's centralising tendencies. Alan Milburn seems genuinely to believe that Whitehall knows best and is determined to micro-manage an organisation of 1m staff from behind his desk in Richmond House. Further, he has appointed his placemen the length and breadth of the country to do his biding. And in the Orwellian style so beloved by new Labour, he describes as 'decentralising', the new Health and Social Care Bill which brings unprecedented hiring and firing powers to the secretary of state, draconian controls over patient information and the abolition of the independent voice of patients, the community health councils.</p> <p>Putting things right</p> <p>This sorry state of affairs is unacceptable in the world's fourth largest economy. We have recently slipped to 19th in the world life expectancy league, being overtaken by Turkey. It is a symptom of serious structural flaws which go way beyond simple questions of funding. The next Conservative government will tackle these chronic failings in a way we have failed to do in the past.</p> <p>It is essential to re-affirm at the outset the Conservative Party's absolute commitment to reviving the NHS. We wholeheartedly endorse the principles underpinning the health service. We are fully committed to a comprehensive National Health Service, free at the point of use and funded from taxation - albeit with very different priorities from those applied by this government.</p> <p>I have also repeatedly made clear that we rule out charges for access to NHS care, and for any specific procedures covered by the NHS. Not that this has prevented our opponents from deliberately lying about our intentions.</p> <p>Likewise, our position on NHS spending is crystal clear. The next Conservative government will spend the same amount of money as proposed by the Labour Party. That said, we shall spend the money differently and better, with particular emphasis on improving the quality of treatment. In parallel with this, we will encourage the development of a much bigger independent sector, to supplement the work of the NHS.</p> <p>Patient's guarantee</p> <p>On our first day in office, we will abolish Tony Blair's waiting list initiative freeing some \u00a3340m for priority areas of care.</p> <p>The distortion of clinical priorities perpetrated by Tony Blair's government in pursuit of the wrong targets has reached crisis levels.</p> <p>The prime minister's election pledge to cut 100,000 from the in-patient waiting list has meant that the success of the NHS has been defined in terms of the number of patients who are treated. Hospitals are rewarded, or punished, according to how many names are taken of the waiting list.</p> <p>Astonishingly, the government has overlooked the blindingly obvious consequence of this absurd way of setting targets. Stories of clinical distortion which mean that some of the sickest patients wait longer than minor cases are legion.</p> <p>It is a sobering fact that patients who develop, for example, stomach cancer in the UK have only an 8% chance of being alive in five years. In France the figure is 24%. In Germany it is 35% and in the USA, over 40%. These figures are bad enough in themselves but when they occur in a system which is reducing the waiting times for ingrowing toenails to make the figures look better we need to question the whole ethical and moral basis of our system.</p> <p>We intend to see that the sickest patients are treated first.</p> <p>Our patient's guarantee will give a guarantee to patients, beginning in cardiac and cancer services, that they will be given a specific maximum waiting time for treatment decided by their Consultant. It will be set specifically for their individual case and not arbitrarily by politicians for the \"average\" patient. Good medicine is about seeing patients as individuals not averages. </p> <p>The right targets</p> <p>Targets will no longer be defined in terms of numbers of patients treated. Instead, we will move to new targets based on clinical outcomes and we will seek new ways to standardise the methodology for determining these outcomes. Targets will be set after consultation with the Royal Colleges as part of our drive to develop care based on quality not quantity. </p> <p>The success or failure of management will, over time, be measured against these outcomes. This fundamental change of approach will, in conjunction with real decentralisation and depoliticisation, begin the much needed transformation of the NHS from a managed to a regulated service.</p> <p>New Priorities</p> <p>By re-defining the effectiveness (or often, sadly, the ineffectiveness) of the treatment carried out by NHS hospitals in the way I have outlined, we will reveal those conditions where our standards match those of similar countries, and those where they don't. You don't need a crystal ball, however, to predict that we do particularly badly by cancer and cardiac patients.</p> <p>We must tackle these shortcomings urgently. That is why these conditions will be the first to which we apply our patient's guarantee. That is also why the next Conservative government will begin by investing heavily the extra spending we have promised in the areas of cancer care and cardiology. Both these measures will mean that we can make the necessary improvements in the standard of our care in those fields.</p> <p>But simply throwing more money at oncology and cardiology will not suffice. That investment must be soundly based. The system of care we offer must be coherent, from presentation of symptoms to completion of treatment. There is little point, for example, speeding up the waiting time to see a consultant if there is then a delay in access to diagnostic equipment, or if the treatment is not available on the NHS. The problem with Labour is that they have targets for everything and priorities for nothing. We will have fewer targets but clear priorities linked to a matching programme of investment.</p> <p>Deppoliticising and decentralising the NHS</p> <p>In the same way that we will move urgently to end the prime minister's waiting list initiative, we will begin to reverse Alan Milburn's politicisation and centralisation of the NHS from the outset.</p> <p>We will create a properly independent appointmentsbody, and ensure that the secretary of state cannot interfere in its workings. Those appointed to positions in the NHS will be there for the expertise they can bring to the system, not the political loyalty they will show to their political masters.</p> <p>As any member of the NHS staff can tell you, nobody can do anything in the NHS without first being sure that Big Brother in Richmond House will approve. The Conservatives will reverse this trend. We will end the practice of the secretary of state micro-managing every aspect of the NHS's work.</p> <p>There is an inherent and unacceptable contradiction in the role of the secretary of state as purchaser, provider and regulator that must be tackled. New checks and balances are required.</p> <p>For example, the evolution of primary care group into primary care trusts will result in purchasing bodies with ever-increasing strength and scope. If these features are combined with a genuine move to set the acute trusts free, and to allow management far greater freedom on staffing, wages, incentives and local priorities, then a new balance can be created with powerful purchasers and more autonomous providers inside the NHS which will allow the phasing out of Health Authorities altogether, reducing costs and bureaucracy.</p> <p>The NHS - unable to cope alone</p> <p>Tackling Labour's chronic mis-management of secondary care in the ways I have outlined will go some way towards restoring the NHS to a more appropriate model. But our proposals will not on their own eliminate the two main complaints that are levelled against the NHS, sadly often with ample justification. These are that the health service does not provide enough healthcare and, more importantly, that too much of what it does provide is of an unacceptably poor quality.</p> <p>Before 1997 Labour argued that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the NHS - merely a lack of funding and a lack of political will to make it work. Increasingly, people realise what a foolish analysis this was and how much time Labour wasted with sloganising and soundbites when it should have been tackling the real challenges facing our healthcare system.</p> <p>The National Health Service will stay in a state of permanent crisis until we accept this and brace ourselves for change. In particular, we must stop regarding the NHS as a sacred cow. It is not a capital crime to admit that the NHS desperately needs far-reaching reform. On the contrary, until that reform is undertaken, the health of the British people will continue to suffer.</p> <p>Changing priorities and using funding better in the ways I have outlined will help. But they will not mean that the NHS can suddenly provide all the healthcare needs of the British people. And herein lies much of the problem. Our stubborn failure, perhaps refusal is a better word, as a nation to recognise the blatantly obvious fact that the NHS alone cannot cope is above all what obliges us to endure a fundamentally inadequate healthcare system.</p> <p>The case for mixed provision</p> <p>It is inconceivable in this era of rapid advances in medicine that a healthcare system funded from taxation alone can ever bear the full strain. It cannot be coincidence that healthcare standards in countries comparable to the UK are higher than ours, and that all such countries have genuine mixed provision, that is healthcare provided by a combination of a state and a thriving non-state sector.</p> <p>Some political dinosaurs argue that creating such a thriving non-NHS sector is tantamount to privatising a national treasure. It is no such thing. I have no problem with people obtaining healthcare in the private sector if they can afford to do so and that is their choice. Conservatives must never forget that choice is in itself a good thing - and also that such extra choice in healthcare should be available to the many, not just the wealthy few. In any case, those who do choose to have their treatment in the private sector are in the process off-loading the NHS, thereby reducing waiting times there for other patients.</p> <p>A new role for the NHS</p> <p>The time has come to re-define the role of the NHS, so that it properly matches the needs arising from today's health problems.</p> <p>Since the NHS was for so long at least a partial success, it is right that the starting point for considering how best to reform it should be the relevance of the two main functions it was originally designed to perform. Those were to act as a funding mechanism designed to provide healthcare free at the point of use - which it continues to do reasonably well - and to carry out high quality treatment - which, I am afraid, the poor success rate of much of that treatment shows that it often no longer does well.</p> <p>I believe that the NHS should continue as a funding mechanism, building on the successes to which I referred above.</p> <p>In terms of the treatment which it carries out, however, I believe the time has come for the NHS to worry less about providing all the care itself, and instead to focus more on ensuring that the treatment which it does undertake reaches the required standards.</p> <p>Towards the enabling state</p> <p>In parallel with improving the standard of the treatment which it undertakes, under the next Conservative government, the NHS will significantly increase the role which it plays as part of the \"enabling state\".</p> <p>In its present form, the NHS by and large decides which of those hospitals that it runs should treat its patients. This system is geared very much to the needs of the supplier of the care, that is the hospital, rather than the recipient of the care, that is the patient. The sick are therefore at the mercy of an archetypal state-run monopoly. There is minimal incentive for the hospital to improve the standards of the care which it offers, since it knows that it will continue to receive the patients regardless.</p> <p>Working as part of an \"enabling state\", the NHS would continue to be funded centrally by taxation. However, in its new guise, its first task would be to identify all those healthcare providers which offered the requisite standard of care. Unlike under the current arrangements, these providers would include both NHS and non-NHS facilities. The \"enabling state\" NHS would then decide which facility offered the patient the best quality of care and the taxpayer the best value for money. More importantly, it would give patients and doctors greater choice than is currently allowed. We will enable this to happen by setting GPs free from the shackles imposed by Labour and allowing them far greater freedom of referral. The real horror of Labour's provision of more health information is that patients may know that they live in a health ghetto but they have been left powerless to escape.</p> <p>In considering which facility should treat NHS patients, it is imperative that decision makers break an age-old taboo hampering the development of a rational healthcare system. It shouldn't and it mustn't matter where a patient is treated. What is important is when the patient is treated and the quality of that treatment. If a member of my family were ill, I would want the best treatment as quickly as possible for them. I wouldn't care whether the provider of the treatment was an NHS-run facility or not. Nor, I am certain, would most other people.</p> <p>What matters is whether patients get better, not whether the healthcare system operates in accordance with out-moded, albeit well-intentioned principles. The sooner we get this into perspective the better.</p> <p>The arrangements I have put forward here reflect that new perspective. They would also offer patients and doctors something hitherto virtually unknown in the NHS, the notion of choice.</p> <p>Single regulation for a single system</p> <p>For the NHS to perform effectively its enhanced role as an \"enabling state\", we need to create an environment in which top quality healthcare services are available from a wide range of providers. Government can play a valuable role in such confidence-building by allowing the NHS to purchase more widely. Labour's concordat with the private sector took an important, albeit depressingly short, step down this path. We must take further, bigger steps, and do so quickly.</p> <p>First and foremost, what will matter is ensuring that any would-be provider offers services of the requisite standards. The NHS would then simply have to decide which provider offered the best value. By definition, it will be possible to operate this kind of system only if all regulation of NHS and non-NHS facilities is conducted by a single body, responsible for inspection and standards - it would be unacceptable for a single pool of money, the NHS budget, to be used to buy services with different guarantees of quality.</p> <p>The Conservatives will legislate to introduce such a system of single regulation. It is time we started regulating for the patient and not the provider.</p> <p>As for the patient, the impact of the shift of NHS focus towards work as an enabling state could be only for the better. Patients would know that, whenever the NHS paid for their treatment, they would receive prompt, high quality care - and given the widespread concern now about the inadequacy of much of the care offered in NHS hospitals, it is hard to imagine anyone objecting to that! Otherwise, patients would notice little difference. As now, they would not pay for the care they received. Again as now, that care would be made available through the NHS.</p> <p>Stand-alone units</p> <p>A practical example of how the NHS could work as part of an \"enabling state\" would be to encourage the further development of the creation of \"stand alone\" or specialist surgical units, run by independent healthcare providers - mirroring a recent trend in the most forward-thinking NHS trusts. The government's moves in this direction are welcome, if timid.</p> <p>An increasingly frequent occurrence, which causes patients at best annoyance and disruption and often considerable distress, is the last-minute cancellation of surgery because of such unforeseen events as staff illness, or the need to treat other patients whose need for treatment is more pressing.</p> <p>Since the NHS can never be only about life threatening conditions, we support the idea of \"stand alone\" surgical units for procedures such as cataract surgery or knee or hip replacements. These units, dedicated to a single type of treatment, could work more efficiently (perhaps even round the clock), enabling us to end the scandal of operations being cancelled at the last minute. Patients would continue to be funded by the NHS, but could attend such units run by the independent sector to reduce waiting times.</p> <p>The return of matron and matron's values</p> <p>Changes in how the NHS measures its performance, the introduction of new priorities, set by doctors, and the devolution of powers to the trust level will make a significant difference to patient care. But they will not be enough on their own to tackle all the NHS's problems. The quality of the care which patients receive in the acute sector is determined above all by what happens on the wards.</p> <p>Here, again, there is a chronic separation of responsibility and authority. Ward sisters are held responsible for the well-being of their patients. But they do not have authority over many of the processes which determine the effectiveness of the care they provide, notably cleaning the wards and feeding the patients.</p> <p>The next Conservative government will address this problem by requiring trusts to put in place arrangements which re-establish \"matron's values\" on hospital wards. The cleaning staff, and those responsible for feeding patients, will be answerable directly to the ward sister. If she thinks that a bed should be changed, dust swept from the floor or a patient fed, it will be done.</p> <p>I want to see the reintroduction of matron posts within the NHS to provide a clear chain of command throughout the hospital so that there is someone personally responsible for overseeing and supporting the nursing staff.</p> <p>Valuing staff</p> <p>When considering the work of nurses, we need at the same time to re-emphasise a much under-used word - vocation. It was a theme of William Hague's speech when he said that nursing, like other medical professions, is more than just a job. Policy makers must show greater respect and appreciation for those who want to help others, often at rates of pay well below their earning potential.</p> <p>Nursing now faces enormous challenges, though also considerable opportunities. Nurses must be respected for their dedication and expertise. I want to see a profession in which it is recognised that comforting the anxious is as important as operating complex equipment, where vocation is valued and family commitments accommodated, and where patient need, not political interference, determines priorities. Only thus will we see better morale among well-motivated professionals.</p> <p>We will therefore look at reforming nurse training to encourage a wide and flexible skills base where academic skills are seen as an extension of, not a substitute for basic patient care. We will also look at new ways to organise nursing rotas so that, for example, more medically trained nurses are available in the winter months when they are most needed, while surgically-trained nurses are available in greater numbers in summer when surgical activity is at its peak.</p> <p>Increased capacity will alleviate rationing</p> <p>Realists know, even if politicians refuse to admit it, that rationing exists in the NHS. However much you improve the workings of the secondary sector, rationing will continue as long as medical science is able to grow faster than our ability to fund it. So although these new arrangements I am advocating would ensure that NHS patients received the highest quality care available, the volume of such care that the NHS could provide would still be limited by the size of its budget. That is why we must increase the overall capacity of the system - in both funding and provision - by both enlarging the NHS and encouraging growth of the independent sector.</p> <p>A new role for the private sector</p> <p>Until we create enough extra capacity, the overall standards of our healthcare system will lag behind those of similar countries.</p> <p>The solution is not difficult to find. It is evident in most of our near neighbours' systems. All have flourishing private healthcare sectors, which complement their equivalents of the NHS. We must consider the approaches which they adopt, and apply here those which are suited to our needs.</p> <p>We need not only the expansion of private provision of services, but also an increase in private purchasing of services if the total capacity of our health care system is to be increased.</p> <p>This can be done in different ways. Individuals can directly purchase complete episodes of care, such as a specific surgical procedure. This is usually paid for from savings. Since 1997, 450,000 people have opted for this route (nearly four times the size of the fall in in-patient waiting lists), often for highly complex surgery because patients have despaired of receiving the treatment they need from the NHS. We need to look at ways in which this burden could be eased.</p> <p>Alternatively, purchasing of healthcare services can be done through insurance, taken out either as an individual or as part of a company scheme. We favour expansion through company based schemes because it offers the price advantages conferred by community rating. This means that benefits would be spread far more widely than if tax incentives were offered for individual policies. The choice in healthcare should not be restricted to the wealthy but made possible for a wide income range in the way home ownership became available in the 1980s.</p> <p>Research tells us that if the public believed the NHS would deal properly with cardiac and cancer care, two of the most expensive items, then they would not seek all inclusive, and expensive, private insurance products. This could reduce premiums by up to 30%, bringing them within the reach of many more people still. This would be a tangible benefit of a real public- private partnership and a direct benefit from our patient's guarantee.</p> <p>Labour subjects company schemes to heavy taxation penalties. Employers who offer such schemes pay an additional \u00a3100m in employers national insurance while individuals are taxed as a benefit in kind to the tune of \u00a3368m. We will abolish both these taxes when it is prudent to do so in order to boost this part of the private sector.</p> <p>We also intend to help the self-employed by creating a large umbrella scheme to which they can affiliate, run by the private sector and offering the same costs and benefits as large company schemes. If we are serious about wealth creation, we must give special thought to the wealth creators.</p> <p>A breathing space for general practice</p> <p>Although my focus here has tended to be on the secondary sector, we must remember that most patient contacts occur in primary care and in the community, and that there is a need to restore the correct balance between the primary and secondary sectors.</p> <p>There has been far too much structural change in primary care with disastrous results for staff. Most can no longer tell if they are at the end of the last reorganisation or the beginning of the current one. The Conservatives will not reorganise general practice. Instead, we will work with the structures we inherit from Labour. Our task will be to make them work better for the benefit of patients.</p> <p>In order to provide a much needed breathing space we will not allow any move from PCT to care trust status for a minimum of four years. This will allow for some much-needed stability.</p> <p>One of the most pressing tasks in the longer term will be to ensure that we use our skills base appropriately. For example, at the moment many GPs undertake sessions in acute hospitals as clinical assistants, usually in out-patient clinics. </p> <p>These occur in areas of specialist clinical knowledge or experience. The economy of scale offered by PCTs could enable these doctors to cross refer, in certain specialties, in their own locality. This would build upon, not substitute for their generalist role and they would rightly expect to be paid for it. It would give improved access for patients and allowing hospital out-patient clinics to be reserved for those who genuinely require a consultant level service.</p> <p>This diminution of the gap between primary and secondary care could only be achieved, however, by expanding the role of practice nurses to take on many of the tasks currently undertaken by GPs, especially in the areas of chronic disease management. Without this willingness to operate at the skill ceiling of all staff, manning constraints will limit the scope for the innovation we require.</p> <p>The conservatives will also re-introduce far greater freedom of referral, with devolution inside PCTs down to the practice and, where possible, individual doctor level. This will maximise clinical freedom without structural upheaval and the imposition of further red tape so beloved by New Labour.</p> <p>Beyond the enabling state</p> <p>All these changes would go a long way towards establishing the depoliticised, decentralised and refocused healthcare system we require. They would also contrast markedly with Labour's programme.</p> <p>Where the Conservatives want a reduced role for the secretary of state, Labour intend to extend it through the health and social care bill. Where we see decentralisation as a priority they attempt to apply a one size fits all blueprint made in Whitehall. They talk of cooperation with the private sector yet attack it through the taxation system. They collect data but deny doctors and patients the means to act upon it. And their obsession with waiting list numbers blinds them to clinical distortions and the need for proper outcome-based targets.</p> <p>Our changes will confer many advantages. They will set management free. They will allow prioritisation once again to be undertaken by doctors. They will open up a golden era for nursing with wider responsibilities than ever before.</p> <p>But I do not believe that the changes are in themselves the be all and end all. For while they will enable patients to benefit from a more flexible and expanded system, choice will still be operated on behalf of the patient rather than by the patient. The role of \"gatekeeper\" to the wider NHS will continue to be played by individual GPs or PCTs.</p> <p>Real empowerment of patients as individuals will remain restricted. Our changes, enormous though they are, should therefore not be seen as an end in themselves, but as a stop on a journey. It is a journey which will take us from a paternalistic system, however benevolent, to one where patients themselves have far greater choice about the sort of health care they receive, drawing on the information ever more accessible to the public. After all, they are paying for the healthcare. It is not charity we are receiving from the state.</p> <p>The NHS- for too long a political football</p> <p>Many people will rightly find it astonishing that the state of the NHS, and healthcare generally, should have been allowed to plummet so far before major surgery has been considered. For this, I am afraid that responsibility rests squarely at the door of politicians - unwilling to face unpalatable truths about the real state of our health services.</p> <p>The health debate has been bedeviled for years by Labour's dishonest accusation that the Conservatives want to privatise the NHS, and our timid approach to policy-making when confronted by this. This has resulted in the UK having unacceptably poor outcomes in many areas, and little of the state/private partnership from which other countries benefit.</p> <p>For the sake of the British people, we Conservatives must expose Labour's lie. We must break out of the vice-like grip of Labour scare-mongers, who shamelessly argue that anyone who utters a word against the NHS cares nothing for patients, and is motivated exclusively by profit. Until we drag the debate about healthcare out of the 1970s and into the 21st century, the British people will continue to be condemned to insufficient and inadequate healthcare.</p> <p>In many respects the public are ahead of the politicians. They, unlike Ministers, seem all too familiar with long waits in casualty, patients lying on trolleys and waiting two weeks to see their GP. They know real change is required. It is time for the politicians to wake up and catch up.</p> <p>The real political prize will surely go to those who can embrace and develop the agenda where the patient really does come first and we all get the health we deserve.</p>",

In parallel with this, we will encourage the development of a much bigger independent sector, to supplement the work of the NHS. Patient's guarantee On our first day in office, we will abolish Tony Blair's waiting list initiative freeing some \u00a3340m for priority areas of care. The distortion of clinical priorities perpetrated by Tony Blair's government in pursuit of the wrong targets has reached crisis levels. The prime minister's election pledge to cut 100,000 from the in-patient waiting list has meant that the success of the NHS has been defined in terms of the number of patients who are treated. Hospitals are rewarded, or punished, according to how many names are taken of the waiting list. Astonishingly, the government has overlooked the blindingly obvious consequence of this absurd way of setting targets. Stories of clinical distortion which mean that some of the sickest patients wait longer than minor cases are legion. It is a sobering fact that patients who develop, for example, stomach cancer in the UK have only an 8% chance of being alive in five years. In France the figure is 24%. In Germany it is 35% and in the USA, over 40%. These figures are bad enough in themselves but when they occur in a system which is reducing the waiting times for ingrowing toenails to make the figures look better we need to question the whole ethical and moral basis of our system. We intend to see that the sickest patients are treated first. Our patient's guarantee will give a guarantee to patients, beginning in cardiac and cancer services, that they will be given a specific maximum waiting time for treatment decided by their Consultant. It will be set specifically for their individual case and not arbitrarily by politicians for the \"average\" patient. Good medicine is about seeing patients as individuals not averages. The right targets Targets will no longer be defined in terms of numbers of patients treated. Instead, we will move to new targets based on clinical outcomes and we will seek new ways to standardise the methodology for determining these outcomes. Targets will be set after consultation with the Royal Colleges as part of our drive to develop care based on quality not quantity. The success or failure of management will, over time, be measured against these outcomes. This fundamental change of approach will, in conjunction with real decentralisation and depoliticisation, begin the much needed transformation of the NHS from a managed to a regulated service. New Priorities By re-defining the effectiveness (or often, sadly, the ineffectiveness) of the treatment carried out by NHS hospitals in the way I have outlined, we will reveal those conditions where our standards match those of similar countries, and those where they don't. You don't need a crystal ball, however, to predict that we do particularly badly by cancer and cardiac patients. We must tackle these shortcomings urgently. That is why these conditions will be the first to which we apply our patient's guarantee. That is also why the next Conservative government will begin by investing heavily the extra spending we have promised in the areas of cancer care and cardiology. Both these measures will mean that we can make the necessary improvements in the standard of our care in those fields. But simply throwing more money at oncology and cardiology will not suffice. That investment must be soundly based. The system of care we offer must be coherent, from presentation of symptoms to completion of treatment. There is little point, for example, speeding up the waiting time to see a consultant if there is then a delay in access to diagnostic equipment, or if the treatment is not available on the NHS. The problem with Labour is that they have targets for everything and priorities for nothing. We will have fewer targets but clear priorities linked to a matching programme of investment. Deppoliticising and decentralising the NHS In the same way that we will move urgently to end the prime minister's waiting list initiative, we will begin to reverse Alan Milburn's politicisation and centralisation of the NHS from the outset. We will create a properly independent appointmentsbody, and ensure that the secretary of state cannot interfere in its workings. Those appointed to positions in the NHS will be there for the expertise they can bring to the system, not the political loyalty they will show to their political masters. As any member of the NHS staff can tell you, nobody can do anything in the NHS without first being sure that Big Brother in Richmond House will approve. The Conservatives will reverse this trend. We will end the practice of the secretary of state micro-managing every aspect of the NHS's work. There is an inherent and unacceptable contradiction in the role of the secretary of state as purchaser, provider and regulator that must be tackled. New checks and balances are required. For example, the evolution of primary care group into primary care trusts will result in purchasing bodies with ever-increasing strength and scope. If these features are combined with a genuine move to set the acute trusts free, and to allow management far greater freedom on staffing, wages, incentives and local priorities, then a new balance can be created with powerful purchasers and more autonomous providers inside the NHS which will allow the phasing out of Health Authorities altogether, reducing costs and bureaucracy. The NHS - unable to cope alone Tackling Labour's chronic mis-management of secondary care in the ways I have outlined will go some way towards restoring the NHS to a more appropriate model. But our proposals will not on their own eliminate the two main complaints that are levelled against the NHS, sadly often with ample justification. These are that the health service does not provide enough healthcare and, more importantly, that too much of what it does provide is of an unacceptably poor quality. Before 1997 Labour argued that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the NHS - merely a lack of funding and a lack of political will to make it work. Increasingly, people realise what a foolish analysis this was and how much time Labour wasted with sloganising and soundbites when it should have been tackling the real challenges facing our healthcare system. The National Health Service will stay in a state of permanent crisis until we accept this and brace ourselves for change. In particular, we must stop regarding the NHS as a sacred cow. It is not a capital crime to admit that the NHS desperately needs far-reaching reform. On the contrary, until that reform is undertaken, the health of the British people will continue to suffer. Changing priorities and using funding better in the ways I have outlined will help. But they will not mean that the NHS can suddenly provide all the healthcare needs of the British people. And herein lies much of the problem. Our stubborn failure, perhaps refusal is a better word, as a nation to recognise the blatantly obvious fact that the NHS alone cannot cope is above all what obliges us to endure a fundamentally inadequate healthcare system. The case for mixed provision It is inconceivable in this era of rapid advances in medicine that a healthcare system funded from taxation alone can ever bear the full strain. It cannot be coincidence that healthcare standards in countries comparable to the UK are higher than ours, and that all such countries have genuine mixed provision, that is healthcare provided by a combination of a state and a thriving non-state sector. Some political dinosaurs argue that creating such a thriving non-NHS sector is tantamount to privatising a national treasure. It is no such thing. I have no problem with people obtaining healthcare in the private sector if they can afford to do so and that is their choice. Conservatives must never forget that choice is in itself a good thing - and also that such extra choice in healthcare should be available to the many, not just the wealthy few. In any case, those who do choose to have their treatment in the private sector are in the process off-loading the NHS, thereby reducing waiting times there for other patients. A new role for the NHS The time has come to re-define the role of the NHS, so that it properly matches the needs arising from today's health problems. Since the NHS was for so long at least a partial success, it is right that the starting point for considering how best to reform it should be the relevance of the two main functions it was originally designed to perform. Those were to act as a funding mechanism designed to provide healthcare free at the point of use - which it continues to do reasonably well - and to carry out high quality treatment - which, I am afraid, the poor success rate of much of that treatment shows that it often no longer does well. I believe that the NHS should continue as a funding mechanism, building on the successes to which I referred above. In terms of the treatment which it carries out, however, I believe the time has come for the NHS to worry less about providing all the care itself, and instead to focus more on ensuring that the treatment which it does undertake reaches the required standards. Towards the enabling state In parallel with improving the standard of the treatment which it undertakes, under the next Conservative government, the NHS will significantly increase the role which it plays as part of the \"enabling state\". In its present form, the NHS by and large decides which of those hospitals that it runs should treat its patients. This system is geared very much to the needs of the supplier of the care, that is the hospital, rather than the recipient of the care, that is the patient. The sick are therefore at the mercy of an archetypal state-run monopoly. There is minimal incentive for the hospital to improve the standards of the care which it offers, since it knows that it will continue to receive the patients regardless. Working as part of an \"enabling state\", the NHS would continue to be funded centrally by taxation. However, in its new guise, its first task would be to identify all those healthcare providers which offered the requisite standard of care. Unlike under the current arrangements, these providers would include both NHS and non-NHS facilities. The \"enabling state\" NHS would then decide which facility offered the patient the best quality of care and the taxpayer the best value for money. More importantly, it would give patients and doctors greater choice than is currently allowed. We will enable this to happen by setting GPs free from the shackles imposed by Labour and allowing them far greater freedom of referral. The real horror of Labour's provision of more health information is that patients may know that they live in a health ghetto but they have been left powerless to escape. In considering which facility should treat NHS patients, it is imperative that decision makers break an age-old taboo hampering the development of a rational healthcare system. It shouldn't and it mustn't matter where a patient is treated. What is important is when the patient is treated and the quality of that treatment. If a member of my family were ill, I would want the best treatment as quickly as possible for them. I wouldn't care whether the provider of the treatment was an NHS-run facility or not. Nor, I am certain, would most other people. What matters is whether patients get better, not whether the healthcare system operates in accordance with out-moded, albeit well-intentioned principles. The sooner we get this into perspective the better. The arrangements I have put forward here reflect that new perspective. They would also offer patients and doctors something hitherto virtually unknown in the NHS, the notion of choice. Single regulation for a single system For the NHS to perform effectively its enhanced role as an \"enabling state\", we need to create an environment in which top quality healthcare services are available from a wide range of providers. Government can play a valuable role in such confidence-building by allowing the NHS to purchase more widely. Labour's concordat with the private sector took an important, albeit depressingly short, step down this path. We must take further, bigger steps, and do so quickly. First and foremost, what will matter is ensuring that any would-be provider offers services of the requisite standards. The NHS would then simply have to decide which provider offered the best value. By definition, it will be possible to operate this kind of system only if all regulation of NHS and non-NHS facilities is conducted by a single body, responsible for inspection and standards - it would be unacceptable for a single pool of money, the NHS budget, to be used to buy services with different guarantees of quality. The Conservatives will legislate to introduce such a system of single regulation. It is time we started regulating for the patient and not the provider. As for the patient, the impact of the shift of NHS focus towards work as an enabling state could be only for the better. Patients would know that, whenever the NHS paid for their treatment, they would receive prompt, high quality care - and given the widespread concern now about the inadequacy of much of the care offered in NHS hospitals, it is hard to imagine anyone objecting to that! Otherwise, patients would notice little difference. As now, they would not pay for the care they received. Again as now, that care would be made available through the NHS. Stand-alone units A practical example of how the NHS could work as part of an \"enabling state\" would be to encourage the further development of the creation of \"stand alone\" or specialist surgical units, run by independent healthcare providers - mirroring a recent trend in the most forward-thinking NHS trusts. The government's moves in this direction are welcome, if timid. An increasingly frequent occurrence, which causes patients at best annoyance and disruption and often considerable distress, is the last-minute cancellation of surgery because of such unforeseen events as staff illness, or the need to treat other patients whose need for treatment is more pressing. Since the NHS can never be only about life threatening conditions, we support the idea of \"stand alone\" surgical units for procedures such as cataract surgery or knee or hip replacements. These units, dedicated to a single type of treatment, could work more efficiently (perhaps even round the clock), enabling us to end the scandal of operations being cancelled at the last minute. Patients would continue to be funded by the NHS, but could attend such units run by the independent sector to reduce waiting times. The return of matron and matron's values Changes in how the NHS measures its performance, the introduction of new priorities, set by doctors, and the devolution of powers to the trust level will make a significant difference to patient care. But they will not be enough on their own to tackle all the NHS's problems. The quality of the care which patients receive in the acute sector is determined above all by what happens on the wards. Here, again, there is a chronic separation of responsibility and authority. Ward sisters are held responsible for the well-being of their patients. But they do not have authority over many of the processes which determine the effectiveness of the care they provide, notably cleaning the wards and feeding the patients. The next Conservative government will address this problem by requiring trusts to put in place arrangements which re-establish \"matron's values\" on hospital wards. The cleaning staff, and those responsible for feeding patients, will be answerable directly to the ward sister. If she thinks that a bed should be changed, dust swept from the floor or a patient fed, it will be done. I want to see the reintroduction of matron posts within the NHS to provide a clear chain of command throughout the hospital so that there is someone personally responsible for overseeing and supporting the nursing staff. Valuing staff When considering the work of nurses, we need at the same time to re-emphasise a much under-used word - vocation. It was a theme of William Hague's speech when he said that nursing, like other medical professions, is more than just a job. Policy makers must show greater respect and appreciation for those who want to help others, often at rates of pay well below their earning potential. Nursing now faces enormous challenges, though also considerable opportunities. Nurses must be respected for their dedication and expertise. I want to see a profession in which it is recognised that comforting the anxious is as important as operating complex equipment, where vocation is valued and family commitments accommodated, and where patient need, not political interference, determines priorities. Only thus will we see better morale among well-motivated professionals. We will therefore look at reforming nurse training to encourage a wide and flexible skills base where academic skills are seen as an extension of, not a substitute for basic patient care. We will also look at new ways to organise nursing rotas so that, for example, more medically trained nurses are available in the winter months when they are most needed, while surgically-trained nurses are available in greater numbers in summer when surgical activity is at its peak. Increased capacity will alleviate rationing Realists know, even if politicians refuse to admit it, that rationing exists in the NHS. However much you improve the workings of the secondary sector, rationing will continue as long as medical science is able to grow faster than our ability to fund it. So although these new arrangements I am advocating would ensure that NHS patients received the highest quality care available, the volume of such care that the NHS could provide would still be limited by the size of its budget. That is why we must increase the overall capacity of the system - in both funding and provision - by both enlarging the NHS and encouraging growth of the independent sector. A new role for the private sector Until we create enough extra capacity, the overall standards of our healthcare system will lag behind those of similar countries. The solution is not difficult to find. It is evident in most of our near neighbours' systems. All have flourishing private healthcare sectors, which complement their equivalents of the NHS. We must consider the approaches which they adopt, and apply here those which are suited to our needs. We need not only the expansion of private provision of services, but also an increase in private purchasing of services if the total capacity of our health care system is to be increased. This can be done in different ways. Individuals can directly purchase complete episodes of care, such as a specific surgical procedure. This is usually paid for from savings. Since 1997, 450,000 people have opted for this route (nearly four times the size of the fall in in-patient waiting lists), often for highly complex surgery because patients have despaired of receiving the treatment they need from the NHS. We need to look at ways in which this burden could be eased. Alternatively, purchasing of healthcare services can be done through insurance, taken out either as an individual or as part of a company scheme. We favour expansion through company based schemes because it offers the price advantages conferred by community rating. This means that benefits would be spread far more widely than if tax incentives were offered for individual policies. The choice in healthcare should not be restricted to the wealthy but made possible for a wide income range in the way home ownership became available in the 1980s. Research tells us that if the public believed the NHS would deal properly with cardiac and cancer care, two of the most expensive items, then they would not seek all inclusive, and expensive, private insurance products. This could reduce premiums by up to 30%, bringing them within the reach of many more people still. This would be a tangible benefit of a real public- private partnership and a direct benefit from our patient's guarantee. Labour subjects company schemes to heavy taxation penalties. Employers who offer such schemes pay an additional \u00a3100m in employers national insurance while individuals are taxed as a benefit in kind to the tune of \u00a3368m. We will abolish both these taxes when it is prudent to do so in order to boost this part of the private sector. We also intend to help the self-employed by creating a large umbrella scheme to which they can affiliate, run by the private sector and offering the same costs and benefits as large company schemes. If we are serious about wealth creation, we must give special thought to the wealth creators. A breathing space for general practice Although my focus here has tended to be on the secondary sector, we must remember that most patient contacts occur in primary care and in the community, and that there is a need to restore the correct balance between the primary and secondary sectors. There has been far too much structural change in primary care with disastrous results for staff. Most can no longer tell if they are at the end of the last reorganisation or the beginning of the current one. The Conservatives will not reorganise general practice. Instead, we will work with the structures we inherit from Labour. Our task will be to make them work better for the benefit of patients. In order to provide a much needed breathing space we will not allow any move from PCT to care trust status for a minimum of four years. This will allow for some much-needed stability. One of the most pressing tasks in the longer term will be to ensure that we use our skills base appropriately. For example, at the moment many GPs undertake sessions in acute hospitals as clinical assistants, usually in out-patient clinics. These occur in areas of specialist clinical knowledge or experience. The economy of scale offered by PCTs could enable these doctors to cross refer, in certain specialties, in their own locality. This would build upon, not substitute for their generalist role and they would rightly expect to be paid for it. It would give improved access for patients and allowing hospital out-patient clinics to be reserved for those who genuinely require a consultant level service. This diminution of the gap between primary and secondary care could only be achieved, however, by expanding the role of practice nurses to take on many of the tasks currently undertaken by GPs, especially in the areas of chronic disease management. Without this willingness to operate at the skill ceiling of all staff, manning constraints will limit the scope for the innovation we require. The conservatives will also re-introduce far greater freedom of referral, with devolution inside PCTs down to the practice and, where possible, individual doctor level. This will maximise clinical freedom without structural upheaval and the imposition of further red tape so beloved by New Labour. Beyond the enabling state All these changes would go a long way towards establishing the depoliticised, decentralised and refocused healthcare system we require. They would also contrast markedly with Labour's programme. Where the Conservatives want a reduced role for the secretary of state, Labour intend to extend it through the health and social care bill. Where we see decentralisation as a priority they attempt to apply a one size fits all blueprint made in Whitehall. They talk of cooperation with the private sector yet attack it through the taxation system. They collect data but deny doctors and patients the means to act upon it. And their obsession with waiting list numbers blinds them to clinical distortions and the need for proper outcome-based targets. Our changes will confer many advantages. They will set management free. They will allow prioritisation once again to be undertaken by doctors. They will open up a golden era for nursing with wider responsibilities than ever before. But I do not believe that the changes are in themselves the be all and end all. For while they will enable patients to benefit from a more flexible and expanded system, choice will still be operated on behalf of the patient rather than by the patient. The role of \"gatekeeper\" to the wider NHS will continue to be played by individual GPs or PCTs. Real empowerment of patients as individuals will remain restricted. Our changes, enormous though they are, should therefore not be seen as an end in themselves, but as a stop on a journey. It is a journey which will take us from a paternalistic system, however benevolent, to one where patients themselves have far greater choice about the sort of health care they receive, drawing on the information ever more accessible to the public. After all, they are paying for the healthcare. It is not charity we are receiving from the state. The NHS- for too long a political football Many people will rightly find it astonishing that the state of the NHS, and healthcare generally, should have been allowed to plummet so far before major surgery has been considered. For this, I am afraid that responsibility rests squarely at the door of politicians - unwilling to face unpalatable truths about the real state of our health services. The health debate has been bedeviled for years by Labour's dishonest accusation that the Conservatives want to privatise the NHS, and our timid approach to policy-making when confronted by this. This has resulted in the UK having unacceptably poor outcomes in many areas, and little of the state/private partnership from which other countries benefit. For the sake of the British people, we Conservatives must expose Labour's lie. We must break out of the vice-like grip of Labour scare-mongers, who shamelessly argue that anyone who utters a word against the NHS cares nothing for patients, and is motivated exclusively by profit. Until we drag the debate about healthcare out of the 1970s and into the 21st century, the British people will continue to be condemned to insufficient and inadequate healthcare. In many respects the public are ahead of the politicians. They, unlike Ministers, seem all too familiar with long waits in casualty, patients lying on trolleys and waiting two weeks to see their GP. They know real change is required. It is time for the politicians to wake up and catch up. The real political prize will surely go to those who can embrace and develop the agenda where the patient really does come first and we all get the health we deserve.",

Pinochet debacle A senior law lord, Lord Steyn, warned after the Pinochet case that Lord Irvine's determination to sit as a judge could lead to a repeat of that debacle, when the court had to set aside one of its judgments because Lord Hoffmann, one of the majority in a three-two ruling, had links with a party to the case. Lord Steyn, in common with some of the other law lords, believes the lord chancellor's main role as a cabinet minister creates an obvious conflict of interest and is incompatible with the independence needed for a senior judge. In a paper written in 1999 for the constitution unit at University College London, Lord Steyn predicted that if the lord chancellor sat on a case and the judges reached a three-two decision, there could be a human rights challenge by the losing side. Lord Irvine sat in six cases between November 1997 and December 1999, including two in his specialist field at the bar, employment law. One involved two redundant meat plant operatives at a plant in Northern Ireland, the other a question about whether two part-time guides at Blyth power station could be categorised as employees. In 1998 he sat on the appeal of Peter Boddington, fined \u00a310 for smoking on a train, who unsuccessfully argued that the rail company had no power to make the bylaw under which he was convicted. His most high-profile case was brought by the athlete Diane Modahl against the British Athletic Federation, which suspended her over doping allegations which proved unfounded. Lord Irvine has been challenged off cases at least twice by lawyers who argued that the government's interests would be affected by the outcome. One was a prison case. There was some criticism in 1998 when he sat as one of five judges in a case involving rights to take part in peaceful protests in groups. He ruled in favour of the protesters. One lawyer said afterwards: \"Constitutionally, I think he should have no place there.\" Most lord chancellors have sat from time to time as judges in the Lords. Lord Mackay, Lord Irvine's predecessor, sat on a number of appeals. But he had been a law lord before he was appointed lord chancellor. Political controversy Lord Lester argues that a statement last June by Lord Bingham on behalf of the law lords makes it difficult for the lord chancellor to go on sitting as a judge. In a statement of principle to the House of Lords, Lord Bingham said the law lords did not think it appropriate \"to engage in matters where there is a strong element of party political controversy\", and bore in mind that they \"might render themselves ineligible to sit if they were to express an opinion on a matter which might later be relevant on an appeal\". Lord Lester said: \"I don't think after that he could sit as a judge. But no one has said 'what about this statement? What's the answer'?\" Talk about it Should Lord Irvine resign?

      "body": "<p>Roger Cook, the portly pioneer of doorstep journalism, has a young pretender. The BBC is pinning its hopes on a lean 34-year-old to reinvent the genre of televised crook-bashing. </p> <p>Paul Kenyon takes on conmen and fraudsters for the corporation's latest attempt to popularise its current affairs output. The four-part series, Kenyon Confronts, is already being described as the new MacIntyre Undercover - the BBC's successful but controversial investigation programme. </p> <p>The new series is part of a strategy by BBC1 controller, Lorraine Heggessey. Since Panorama was moved to Sunday night, it struggles to attract 3m viewers - two years ago an edition about mobile phone health risks, hosted by Mr Kenyon, attracted 7m. </p> <p>Mr Kenyon, who will continue to work for Panorama, said there was still a place for the BBC's flagship current affairs series: \"This is nothing to do with Panorama losing viewers. We are trying to bring current affairs to a new, younger audience.\" </p> <p>The first edition, which is shown next Monday, exposes the organisers of \"marriage-for-residency\" scams. In one memorable scene in a register office, a registrar asks the guests if they know of a reason why a couple cannot be married. Mr Kenyon stands up to say the groom wants to marry the woman simply so he can remain in Britain legally. </p> <p>Secret filming features in some of the programmes, but Mr Kenyon rejected comparisons with MacIntyre Undercover. \"I would say it is closer to the better Cook Report programmes, but moved on from there. Hopefully, we updated it: our show is pacier and more quirky. They are hard-hitting investigations.\" </p> <p>Mr Kenyon, a former researcher for the Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes, is best known for his BBC2 series Raising the Roof, which exposed dodgy building contractors. The new programme is made by the same team. </p> <p>Stewart Lansley, the executive producer, said the series tackles serious issues. \"We would describe the programmes as traditional, hard-hitting investigations. We gather the evidence and film then expose and confront the perpetrators. But we do it in a new format. The style is popular and we use lots of stunts; Paul is very witty and works on his own investigations rather than just turning up at the end.\" </p> <p>But he insisted the programme could not be accused of trivialising current affairs. \"We are not selling out: we can robustly defend our approach within a current affairs perspective.\" </p> <p>The other programmes in the series expose the bogus claims of some Harley Street doctors, the exploitation of Britons who buy property in Spain and insurance scams. </p> <p>The new series faces stiff competition. Some BBC insiders are disappointed with the scheduling of Kenyon Confronts. The series will go out in a \"graveyard slot\" of Mondays at 7.30pm, against ITV's Coronation Street. </p> <p>ITV is understood to be surprised that the BBC series has not been placed against one of the more vulnerable parts of the commercial channel's line-up, such as the regular peak-time regional slots or a potentially vulnerable drama such as Peak Practice. </p> <p><strong>Relevant stories</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/broadcast/story/0,7493,434838,00.html\">Feb 8: BBC confronts current affairs deficit</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Roger Cook, the portly pioneer of doorstep journalism, has a young pretender. The BBC is pinning its hopes on a lean 34-year-old to reinvent the genre of televised crook-bashing. Paul Kenyon takes on conmen and fraudsters for the corporation's latest attempt to popularise its current affairs output. The four-part series, Kenyon Confronts, is already being described as the new MacIntyre Undercover - the BBC's successful but controversial investigation programme. The new series is part of a strategy by BBC1 controller, Lorraine Heggessey. Since Panorama was moved to Sunday night, it struggles to attract 3m viewers - two years ago an edition about mobile phone health risks, hosted by Mr Kenyon, attracted 7m. Mr Kenyon, who will continue to work for Panorama, said there was still a place for the BBC's flagship current affairs series: \"This is nothing to do with Panorama losing viewers. We are trying to bring current affairs to a new, younger audience.\" The first edition, which is shown next Monday, exposes the organisers of \"marriage-for-residency\" scams. In one memorable scene in a register office, a registrar asks the guests if they know of a reason why a couple cannot be married. Mr Kenyon stands up to say the groom wants to marry the woman simply so he can remain in Britain legally. Secret filming features in some of the programmes, but Mr Kenyon rejected comparisons with MacIntyre Undercover. \"I would say it is closer to the better Cook Report programmes, but moved on from there. Hopefully, we updated it: our show is pacier and more quirky. They are hard-hitting investigations.\" Mr Kenyon, a former researcher for the Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes, is best known for his BBC2 series Raising the Roof, which exposed dodgy building contractors. The new programme is made by the same team. Stewart Lansley, the executive producer, said the series tackles serious issues. \"We would describe the programmes as traditional, hard-hitting investigations. We gather the evidence and film then expose and confront the perpetrators. But we do it in a new format. The style is popular and we use lots of stunts; Paul is very witty and works on his own investigations rather than just turning up at the end.\" But he insisted the programme could not be accused of trivialising current affairs. \"We are not selling out: we can robustly defend our approach within a current affairs perspective.\" The other programmes in the series expose the bogus claims of some Harley Street doctors, the exploitation of Britons who buy property in Spain and insurance scams. The new series faces stiff competition. Some BBC insiders are disappointed with the scheduling of Kenyon Confronts. The series will go out in a \"graveyard slot\" of Mondays at 7.30pm, against ITV's Coronation Street. ITV is understood to be surprised that the BBC series has not been placed against one of the more vulnerable parts of the commercial channel's line-up, such as the regular peak-time regional slots or a potentially vulnerable drama such as Peak Practice.

      "bodyText": "The backers of rogue internet site Napster are taking on the Fifa football organisation, just one week after a bruising courtroom battle with the world's biggest record companies. NetCapital, the company which founded the Napster file-sharing service, has agreed to take over a legal battle between US website footofgod.com and Fifa, the body that runs the World Cup. Fifa has slapped a court ban on the site because it shows clips of vintage World Cup goals - such as Gary Lineker's equaliser against Germany in Italia '90 - that are owned by the football organisation. Footofgod founder Kadima Lonji has sold the site to Netcapital's SportsClub.com operation, which delivers live or recorded sports action over the internet. \"It is perfect that the guys who own Napster are involved - we all know what they are good at. \"I did not get any money for the company so they will take it over and try to do the right thing,\" said Mr Lonji. Napster last week lost a court case brought by four of the world's five leading record companies. The companies successfully argued the site breached copyright laws by distributing recordings without the owners' permission. Napster was founded by Shawn Fanning and his uncle John Fanning, who is head of technology investment at NetCapital. \"Huge amounts of fans have written in, complaining that the site has gone. This situation has to be resolved,\" added Mr Lonji. However, Swiss company ISL Worldwide is weeks away from launching a Fifa-sanctioned version of the footofgod site. The sports media firm has acquired the internet rights to all World Cup footage and will launch its site, to be called fifaworldcup.com, in the next few weeks. \"As far as we are concerned, we have the rights to the next World Cup and the video archives for previous tournaments. \"Footofgod contained archive footage - which is a very sensitive area - and I doubt if the site will be able to open again,\" said an ISL spokesman. The footofgod site, which is now closed, directs all enquiries to SportsClub's offices. At the time of closure, footofgod was attracting up to 20,000 football fanatics per day. They logged on to see football classics such as Maradona's famous solo goal for Argentina against England in the 1986 World Cup. Fifa and NetCapital were not available for comment.

In a keynote policy speech, the shadow health secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said the Tories would reintroduce competition into the health service by encouraging the NHS to purchase more care in private hospitals. While the NHS would continue to be free and centrally funded through taxation, the Tories would end its \"archetypal state-run monopoly\" by helping create a thriving non-state sector. Under the Tories' scheme, health authorities and GPs would be expected to send patients to the best quality and value-for-money care providers - regardless of whether they are private or NHS. \"I believe the time has come for the NHS to worry less about providing all the care itself, and instead to focus on ensuring that the treatment which it does undertake reaches the required standards,\" said Dr Fox. He also announced proposals to give away nearly \u00a3500m in tax breaks to firms and individuals in an attempt to stimulate the private health insurance market and increase the overall amount of healthcare. The Conservatives had \"absolute commitment\" to reviving the health service, was committed to its principles, had ruled out charges for NHS care and was committed to matching Labour spending on health. But he added: \"We shall spend the money differently and better, with particular emphasis on improving the quality of treatment. \"In parallel with this, we will encourage the development of a much bigger independent sector, to supplement the work of the NHS.\"",

      "body": "<p>He inhabits a wasteland of snow, mountain cabins and churches. A wild empty space of silence on the Vucevo mountain range, where icicles two metres long hang like spiky white beards at the entrance to the mountain tunnels. It was here that the White Eagles, the last bitter fighters against Tito, survived for almost 15 years. \"Radovan,\" says his mother, Yovanka Karadzic, \"Has gone back to his own people - the people he protected.\"</p> <p>Dr Karadzic, 53, Serbian nationalist, psychiatrist and poet is the man the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague describes as number one on its list. \"There's not a day goes by when when his name doesn't come up,\" says Graham Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor. In the last six years 40 indicted war criminals have arrived at the international court in the Hague.</p> <p>Today 35 of them, mostly Bosnian Serbs, are detained at Schveningen prison facing trial or awaiting sentence, but there is still no sign of Karadzic. Without him, the Hague is Nuremburg without Rudolf Hess or Albert Speer. When it comes to the architects of Bosnia's destruction, those still alive are Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, their general, Karadzic is the only one within Nato's reach in Bosnia.</p> <p>Karadzic's Kingdom is an area between the villages and towns of Rudo, Cajnice, Visegrad and Foca. Most of the time he is in the mountains - where the Serbian Orthodox church gives shelter to their own - just as the Catholics did with the Nazi fugitives in South America.</p> <p>He is watched the old fashioned way. Spies recruited by the Allied Military Intelligence Bureau run by a US intelligence colonel at the international base at Butmir camp in Sarajevo. The American-led intelligence operation is code-named Amber Star. Two years ago the hunters went as far as sending US special operations to Germany in preparation for a swoop on Karadzic, but it was abandoned when senior US military officials found the operation too perilous.</p> <p>In his home town of Pale, his wife and daughter Sonja have moved out of the family house where a lonely, friendly doberman wanders up and down inside the gates. They are watched round the clock by Nato spies, doing their best to avoid the cameras by moving from flat to flat in the town. Radio St John and TV Astra, once owned by his daughter Sonja, are up for sale and there are rumours that they are running out of money; that the old supporters who benefit from dirty dealings in black market cigarettes, whisky and petrol won't keep the old man fed and protected in the mountains forever.</p> <p>Nature protects him. In winter, the few cars that make it up the mountains skid along the roads, perilously close to ravines. The only traffic is the trucks of the illegal loggers stripping the mountain forests. Karadzic does not have to try too hard to evade Nato soldiers: just 300 troops out of a force of 21,324 are in the area where he is hiding. \"Round here you get the impression that picking up these guys isn't the first priority,\" says Lieutenant Andreas Kerl, at the German base near Foca. \"Nobody really mentions him.\"</p> <p>The US ambassador to Sarajevo, Thomas Miller, uses the phrase \"that's operational\" a lot when asked about Karadzic and says this could be a \"very short interview\".

      "bodyText": "He inhabits a wasteland of snow, mountain cabins and churches. A wild empty space of silence on the Vucevo mountain range, where icicles two metres long hang like spiky white beards at the entrance to the mountain tunnels. It was here that the White Eagles, the last bitter fighters against Tito, survived for almost 15 years. \"Radovan,\" says his mother, Yovanka Karadzic, \"Has gone back to his own people - the people he protected.\" Dr Karadzic, 53, Serbian nationalist, psychiatrist and poet is the man the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague describes as number one on its list. \"There's not a day goes by when when his name doesn't come up,\" says Graham Blewitt, the deputy prosecutor. In the last six years 40 indicted war criminals have arrived at the international court in the Hague. Today 35 of them, mostly Bosnian Serbs, are detained at Schveningen prison facing trial or awaiting sentence, but there is still no sign of Karadzic. Without him, the Hague is Nuremburg without Rudolf Hess or Albert Speer. When it comes to the architects of Bosnia's destruction, those still alive are Slobodan Milosevic, Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, their general, Karadzic is the only one within Nato's reach in Bosnia. Karadzic's Kingdom is an area between the villages and towns of Rudo, Cajnice, Visegrad and Foca. Most of the time he is in the mountains - where the Serbian Orthodox church gives shelter to their own - just as the Catholics did with the Nazi fugitives in South America. He is watched the old fashioned way. Spies recruited by the Allied Military Intelligence Bureau run by a US intelligence colonel at the international base at Butmir camp in Sarajevo. The American-led intelligence operation is code-named Amber Star. Two years ago the hunters went as far as sending US special operations to Germany in preparation for a swoop on Karadzic, but it was abandoned when senior US military officials found the operation too perilous. In his home town of Pale, his wife and daughter Sonja have moved out of the family house where a lonely, friendly doberman wanders up and down inside the gates. They are watched round the clock by Nato spies, doing their best to avoid the cameras by moving from flat to flat in the town. Radio St John and TV Astra, once owned by his daughter Sonja, are up for sale and there are rumours that they are running out of money; that the old supporters who benefit from dirty dealings in black market cigarettes, whisky and petrol won't keep the old man fed and protected in the mountains forever. Nature protects him. In winter, the few cars that make it up the mountains skid along the roads, perilously close to ravines. The only traffic is the trucks of the illegal loggers stripping the mountain forests. Karadzic does not have to try too hard to evade Nato soldiers: just 300 troops out of a force of 21,324 are in the area where he is hiding. \"Round here you get the impression that picking up these guys isn't the first priority,\" says Lieutenant Andreas Kerl, at the German base near Foca. \"Nobody really mentions him.\" The US ambassador to Sarajevo, Thomas Miller, uses the phrase \"that's operational\" a lot when asked about Karadzic and says this could be a \"very short interview\". But he looks genuinely frustrated at the accusation that the Americans are doing nothing to catch him. \"We're working on this ... we're doing a lot. I hope sometime I can sit down over a coffee with you and explain just what we're doing.\" The problem is that Miller's coffee-drinking days in Sarajevo are coming to an end and his successor, a George W Bush appointee, is not expected to be hot on war criminals. \"We're worried about the way things are going,\" says one of Sarajevo's most experienced diplomats. \"This is going to be a good year for Radovan. I think we missed the chance to lift him and now there is no longer the political will.\" It is mostly former policemen from the old Bosnian police force who are paid to watch and photograph Karadzic skimming across the mountain tops.

At home in Niksic, in Montenegro, his 78-year-old mother is chain-smoking through a thin, brown plastic cigarette holder, her compromise following three strokes and angina.

      "body": "<p>Music journalism has always had a tendency to wrap itself in irony. But, just at the moment, the joke is on us. Just as Cameron Crowe's film Almost Famous has raised the profile of the humble music hack to hitherto unimagined heights, the British music press is in crisis. </p> <p>Just before the end of last year, two of Britain's most significant music titles, Melody Maker and Select, were suddenly discontinued (the former after 75 years). If you're looking for something to blame, try the false dawn that was Britpop. As Alexis Petridis, the last editor of Select, explains: \"The research told us that, no matter how many features we did on Destiny's Child, people still thought it was a magazine about Oasis. We were forever associated with a music in decline.\" </p> <p>Melody Maker, in turn, had tried to turn around a long, slow decline by becoming an all-colour glossy and putting a young and frothy Smash Hits-type spin on guitar bands. The result was a sales disaster. Meanwhile, sales of the New Musical Express (Melody Maker's stronger stablemate at publisher IPC) and Q (published by Select's owners Emap) are also in decline, according to current figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulation. </p> <p>The music press as a whole appears to be falling in esteem, influence and commercial appeal. Of course, there are other factors in this bleak scenario apart from the failure of Oasis and Blur to lead us all into a new golden age of pop culture. Pop is now a staple for a whole set of competing media, from tabloid expos\u00e9s and broadsheet analysis to TV gossip shows and the explosion of internet and digital radio activity. </p> <p>As Steve Sutherland of IPC points out: \"There are now more exciting ways of accessing information than just sitting down with a pile of magazines. When I was a nipper, if you wanted to find out when your favourite band was touring, you raced down to the local newsagent of a Thursday and bought the music magazines. You wouldn't find out anywhere else, and if you wanted to know more, the mags were the sexiest way of doing it. </p> <p>\"Now they're probably the least sexy way of doing it. You don't have to read a hundred words on 'sonic cathedrals', take someone's word for it and buy the album only to find out it's a pile of shit. You can read about it, get excited, go to a website, hear it, buy it and have it delivered to your door the next day. It's the fulfilment of the music fan's dream.\" </p> <p>This utopian vision of pop's multimedia future is perhaps tempered by the fact that Sutherland is the NME's brand director, overseeing the mag's spread into digital radio, television and the internet. And the view that people are no longer interested in just reading about music is challenged by one recent success story. </p> <p>Emap's Mojo, ostensibly a retro rock \"heritage\" publication, continues to steadily improve its annual sales, despite flying in the face of perceived publishing wisdom on niche marketing, our short attention spans and our supposed refusal to buy anything that doesn't have a semi-naked model or actress on the cover. And Mojo hasn't exploited the internet yet, though it is now setting up its own website. </p> <p>If anyone has been threatened by the closure of Melody Maker and Select, it is new bands, particularly those judged as too \"alternative\" for daytime radio. Julie Bland is co-owner of the independent music PR company 9PR, whose roster includes the bright young likes of Starsailor, Ed Harcourt, Zoot Woman, Lowgold, Doves and Boards of Canada - all critically acclaimed, all (with the exception of Doves and Starsailor) virtually unheard by the general public. </p> <p>For these bands, early press is vital, and the outlets are disappearing. \"With Select we've lost the bridge between the NME and the likes of Q and Mojo,\" Bland says. \"Melody Maker was important for breaking new bands, although not as important as the NME. Mags like Q, Mojo and Uncut won't generally get on board with an artist until they've had a certain amount of success. We're all relying on the NME and, increasingly, the broadsheets.\" </p> <p>But then, how much of this crisis is actually down to the bands? Mojo editor Paul Trynka, Sutherland and Petridis all bemoan the lack of rock'n'roll personalities - of decent copy, basically - in the current crop of British rock acts. Petridis is especially withering: \"Current music is so boring - or at least, the people making it are. We want the same things out of music as we used to but you have to look to the past to get it. We want proper stars, and Mojo offers you proper stars like Jimi Hendrix and the Ramones. At the moment it's like 1975 all over again. You've got big stars like Oasis and Richard Ashcroft who've gone and bought big houses in the country and made awful records about how terrible it is to be rich and famous. Who cares? Hopefully, some pissed-off 16-year-old is currently in his bedroom with a guitar doing something extraordinary.\" </p> <p>Almost Famous, in its rose-tinted, good-natured way, has also reminded today's crop of pop hacks of the naive openness of the music biz back in the 1960s and 1970s. Petridis says: \"Access to bands is controlled very, very tightly now. You don't get to go round the band's house, shoot up heroin with them and throw up on their doorstep, as Nick Kent did with Keith Richards. You could never get away with stuff like Lester Bangs's infamous interviews with Lou Reed, where the journalist tells him he's useless and they basically scream at each other for two hours. You'd just be ushered out of the room by the press officer.\" </p> <p>Sutherland, who as a 20-year veteran of music journalism was a product of the fashion for florid, highly subjective writing that was booted into touch in the late 1980s, pooh-poohs this kind of nostalgia. \"How can I put this politely? Part of my job is to go through the old NME and Maker archives. And yes, I look at them and get a bit misty-eyed. But, truth be told, the whole self-indulgent Almost Famous school of writing seems rather innocent and idealistic. To wish those days back doesn't make sense.\" </p> <p>Yet again, there are smaller success stories that challenge all this. The Wire celebrates its 20th anniversary next year after having recently been bought out by its own staff - a move, according to long-serving editor Rob Young, that involves no risk at all. How has this magazine, which rejects pop stars entirely and concentrates almost exclusively on experimental, non-mainstream global music, thrived? According to Young, \"we provide the kind of coverage you might have found in the NME or Melody Maker back in the 1970s, before it had been taken over by celebrity.\" </p> <p>A lso surviving in unlikely circumstances are the team at black music mag Echoes, which celebrated its 25th anniversary last month, and remains eclectic, opinionated and supremely unaffected by red-herring trends. However, Chris Wells, who has edited Echoes since 1994, is no nostalgist, and echoes Sutherland's pragmatic attitude to keeping the readers sweet. </p> <p>\"The days when our old contributor Stuart Cosgrove interviewed the IRA for the NME and asked them what their favourite northern soul records were are over. You have to identify the music fan and give them what they want, rather than grouping a whole bunch of cultural things together and expecting them to be interested. The idea of a general music magazine is just too wishy-washy. If you're into football, the arts, literature, how many hours are left in the day to read about music you're not necessarily interested in?\" </p> <p>In this spirit, Emap is taking the brave step of launching a new music title into this rather depressing climate. Kingsize is aimed at \"16- to 34-year-old ex-Kerrrang! readers\" who are into rock-rap bands such as the currently huge Limp Bizkit. This gives them around three dozen bands to cover, maybe a third of which actually sell in Britain. For those of us who like to be told something about the world that we don't already know, the outlook is bleak. The micro-niche is upon us. </p> <p>But, just in case things change, if you know of an angry 16-year-old doing extraordinary things in their bedroom with a word processor, tell them there's a chair out here marked \"Bangs/Kent\" waiting for them.</p>",

You can read about it, get excited, go to a website, hear it, buy it and have it delivered to your door the next day. It's the fulfilment of the music fan's dream.\" This utopian vision of pop's multimedia future is perhaps tempered by the fact that Sutherland is the NME's brand director, overseeing the mag's spread into digital radio, television and the internet. And the view that people are no longer interested in just reading about music is challenged by one recent success story. Emap's Mojo, ostensibly a retro rock \"heritage\" publication, continues to steadily improve its annual sales, despite flying in the face of perceived publishing wisdom on niche marketing, our short attention spans and our supposed refusal to buy anything that doesn't have a semi-naked model or actress on the cover. And Mojo hasn't exploited the internet yet, though it is now setting up its own website. If anyone has been threatened by the closure of Melody Maker and Select, it is new bands, particularly those judged as too \"alternative\" for daytime radio. Julie Bland is co-owner of the independent music PR company 9PR, whose roster includes the bright young likes of Starsailor, Ed Harcourt, Zoot Woman, Lowgold, Doves and Boards of Canada - all critically acclaimed, all (with the exception of Doves and Starsailor) virtually unheard by the general public. For these bands, early press is vital, and the outlets are disappearing. \"With Select we've lost the bridge between the NME and the likes of Q and Mojo,\" Bland says. \"Melody Maker was important for breaking new bands, although not as important as the NME. Mags like Q, Mojo and Uncut won't generally get on board with an artist until they've had a certain amount of success. We're all relying on the NME and, increasingly, the broadsheets.\" But then, how much of this crisis is actually down to the bands? Mojo editor Paul Trynka, Sutherland and Petridis all bemoan the lack of rock'n'roll personalities - of decent copy, basically - in the current crop of British rock acts. Petridis is especially withering: \"Current music is so boring - or at least, the people making it are. We want the same things out of music as we used to but you have to look to the past to get it. We want proper stars, and Mojo offers you proper stars like Jimi Hendrix and the Ramones. At the moment it's like 1975 all over again. You've got big stars like Oasis and Richard Ashcroft who've gone and bought big houses in the country and made awful records about how terrible it is to be rich and famous. Who cares? Hopefully, some pissed-off 16-year-old is currently in his bedroom with a guitar doing something extraordinary.\" Almost Famous, in its rose-tinted, good-natured way, has also reminded today's crop of pop hacks of the naive openness of the music biz back in the 1960s and 1970s. Petridis says: \"Access to bands is controlled very, very tightly now. You don't get to go round the band's house, shoot up heroin with them and throw up on their doorstep, as Nick Kent did with Keith Richards. You could never get away with stuff like Lester Bangs's infamous interviews with Lou Reed, where the journalist tells him he's useless and they basically scream at each other for two hours. You'd just be ushered out of the room by the press officer.\" Sutherland, who as a 20-year veteran of music journalism was a product of the fashion for florid, highly subjective writing that was booted into touch in the late 1980s, pooh-poohs this kind of nostalgia. \"How can I put this politely? Part of my job is to go through the old NME and Maker archives. And yes, I look at them and get a bit misty-eyed. But, truth be told, the whole self-indulgent Almost Famous school of writing seems rather innocent and idealistic. To wish those days back doesn't make sense.\" Yet again, there are smaller success stories that challenge all this. The Wire celebrates its 20th anniversary next year after having recently been bought out by its own staff - a move, according to long-serving editor Rob Young, that involves no risk at all. How has this magazine, which rejects pop stars entirely and concentrates almost exclusively on experimental, non-mainstream global music, thrived? According to Young, \"we provide the kind of coverage you might have found in the NME or Melody Maker back in the 1970s, before it had been taken over by celebrity.\" A lso surviving in unlikely circumstances are the team at black music mag Echoes, which celebrated its 25th anniversary last month, and remains eclectic, opinionated and supremely unaffected by red-herring trends. However, Chris Wells, who has edited Echoes since 1994, is no nostalgist, and echoes Sutherland's pragmatic attitude to keeping the readers sweet. \"The days when our old contributor Stuart Cosgrove interviewed the IRA for the NME and asked them what their favourite northern soul records were are over. You have to identify the music fan and give them what they want, rather than grouping a whole bunch of cultural things together and expecting them to be interested. The idea of a general music magazine is just too wishy-washy. If you're into football, the arts, literature, how many hours are left in the day to read about music you're not necessarily interested in?\" In this spirit, Emap is taking the brave step of launching a new music title into this rather depressing climate. Kingsize is aimed at \"16- to 34-year-old ex-Kerrrang! readers\" who are into rock-rap bands such as the currently huge Limp Bizkit. This gives them around three dozen bands to cover, maybe a third of which actually sell in Britain. For those of us who like to be told something about the world that we don't already know, the outlook is bleak. The micro-niche is upon us. But, just in case things change, if you know of an angry 16-year-old doing extraordinary things in their bedroom with a word processor, tell them there's a chair out here marked \"Bangs/Kent\" waiting for them.",

Names will include Patrick Hughes, Billy Childish, Andy Warhol, Peter Blake and Eduardo Paolozzi. Viewing figures have sunk to a low of 300,000 since Johnny Vaughan and Denise van Outen quit the show in January. Online art gallery Britart will supply the works, which will change every two weeks. Viewers can then log on to www.britart.com to buy any artwork they see on the programme. The company offers a money-back guarantee allowing buyers to try the work purchased on their walls for 14 days. If they decide they don't like it, they can send it back for a full refund. Britart signed the deal after a Josie McCoy portrait of EastEnders character Pauline Fowler was shown on the Big Breakfast last week. It generated 10,000 hits for the website after the show. \"There is a huge amount of talent out there that goes unnoticed. \"For us, the chance to showcase some of the fantastic work from the Britart site on the Big Breakfast was an opportunity not to be missed,\" said Britart marketing director Richard Murphy.",

The clothing and footwear shop on London's Carnaby Street has been trading since 1967 and prides itself on being \"a mecca of 60s chic\". It is frequented by rock stars including Liam Gallagher and ex-Stone Roses guitarist Mani.

      "bodyText": "The grovelling full-page apology made to Geri Halliwell on the front page of the Daily Star may not be enough to stop the paper having to pay out five-figure damages to the popstar. It has emerged that, in addition to the apology - the most prominent ever made in a newspaper - the former Spice Girl will also receive a \"five figure\" sum in damages. \"We're delighted, because normally newspaper editors would rather be boiled in oil than admit they are wrong,\" said Jonathan Coad of law firm Schilling and Lom, who acted on behalf of Ms Halliwell. He is still negotiating the damages with the Star but says he is delighted with the outcome as no newspaper had ever printed a full-page apology on its front page. But media lawyers branded the splash apology a \"worrying\" precedent, which could pressure newspapers to turn over their whole front pages to apologies. The Mail on Sunday published an apology to Brooke Shields in May 1998 on its front page after a reporter wrongly claimed she had been searched for drugs at an airport. The Sun also published a front-page apology to Sir Elton John after wrongly accusing him of using rent boys. However, neither tabloids handed over the entire front page. The apology followed a story on Friday, accompanied by photographs of Ms Halliwell with John Leahy, marketing and creative director at EMI. A headline above photographs of the pair hugging, read: \"So Geri much in love\". Nigel Tait, the managing partner at Peter Carter Ruck &amp; Partners, which specialises in libel, says the apology \"is consistent with the Express Group's policy of being kind to superstars. \"It always helps newspapers to have a famous person on the cover. \"It also sends out a message that Mr Desmond wants to be kind to superstars,\" he said. Mark Stephens, a partner at law firm Stephens Innocent, said: \"Front-page apologies are enormously rare. \"This sets a precedent which is worrying.\" Another top media lawyer, who did not wish to be named, said: \"One has to ask the question whether this was on the front page because of the relationship between Mr Desmond and the Spice Girls.\" The deal was arranged between Schilling &amp; Lom, acting for Geri Halliwell and John Leahy, and lawyers acting for Northern &amp; Shell.",

Today it was the turn of ZapitOver, the London-focused rapid-delivery service, which threw in the towel after failing to find further investment. In a statement on ZapitOver's website, the founders bid farewell to its customers and instigated a clearance sale, offering most items at half price. \"After months of toil in the rapid-delivery market we've finally reached the end. \"We've watched all our competitors go bust and soldiered on but, due to lack of investment, we have to close,\" said the statement. The site will eventually close at the end of the month with the loss of 10 jobs. ZapitOver was the brainchild of Will Sankey, former media planning and buying director of BMP DDB, and Elliot Ronald, a former management consultant from Ernst &amp; Young. It was originally set up as a Wap service, called WapitOver. After Wap failed to take off, it became clear it was necessary to take the service onto other channels, such as the web and the telephone. The name ZapitOver was chosen as a more generic name in December last year. ZapitOver's reinvention was short-lived, as crucial funding was required to take the business forward. The demise of competitors Urban Fetch, BagsOfTime.com and Koobuycity did nothing to aid investor confidence in ZapitOver's business model. This centred on delivering convenience goods in London within the hour. A spokesman for ZapitOver said: \"Not only did the dot.com climate go cold but investor confidence was severely dented after what happened to our competitors.\" To survive for another six months, the site was asking for just \u00a3250,000. Another problem was demand for such a latent service. ZapitOver needed at least 100 deliveries a day to break even but only managed to average around 40 a day. ZapitOver was set up at the end of August last year as a joint venture between 86 Ltd, a digital consultancy, and Deliverance, an existing London-based food delivery service. It is thought ZapitOver's assets, such as its technology platform and server, will now be bought up by 86 Ltd.",

Doubts at home have also contributed to a reassessment of the hardline policy</p> <p>To try to turn foreign and domestic opinion around, ministers are actively considering a dual track strategy.</p> <p>They are looking at plans for \"smart\" sanctions combined with a new propaganda drive highlighting the repression carried out by the Iraqi regime and insisting that its people's suffering - including infant deaths - is of the dictatorship's making.</p> <p>Even so, the government went on yesterday strongly defending last Friday's air strikes against Iraqi radar installations, and the no-fly zones imposed on Iraq by Britain and the US after the 1990-91 Gulf war. These, officials still say, will be abandoned only if President Saddam allows in United Nations weapons inspectors.</p> <p>Whitehall officials say the issue of the zones could be part of an overall agreement in which Baghdad made concessions on inspections.</p> <p>The framework of a new sanctions policy was discussed by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, during talks in Washington last week with the US secretary of state, Colin Powell. Yesterday Mr Cook held a special meeting about Iraq with his Foreign Office ministers and their senior advisers.</p> <p>General Powell is about to embark on a tour of Middle Eastern countries, including Syria, which recently opened a new oil pipeline with Iraq. Sanctions against Iraq are increasingly being flouted, and smuggling of goods and petroleum is rife.</p> <p>The plans for \"smart\" sanctions would concentrate on arms control - specifically Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical, and biological, weapons programme - and the finances and freedom of movement of leading members of his regime. Imports for rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and oil industry would be allowed.</p> <p>Such measures, London and Washington believe, would not be opposed by Iraq's Arab neighbours or by members of the UN security council.</p> <p>The British government is also planning to \"refocus the public debate\", as one official put it yesterday, pointing to the executions and other brutal practices used by Baghdad against critics and opponents. This repression, it argues, would be worse without the no-fly zones.</p> <p>Foreign Office spokesmen yesterday issued a sort of balance sheet yesterday noting that since sanctions were imposed Iraq had not used chemical weapons or invaded its neighbours. Blaming sanctions for the sufferings of the Iraqi people was \"not credible\", the paper declared. Iraq was exporting food and medicine to other countries.</p> <p>It said UN weapons inspectors had been unable to account for 4,000 tonnes of chemicals used to make weapons, and some 31,000 chemical weapons munitions.</p> <p>The air strikes by American and British planes on Iraqi air defence installations were a \"proportionate response in self defence\", the defence minister, Baroness Symons, told the Lords yesterday.

      "bodyText": "Britain and the US have agreed to rethink their policy towards Iraq in the face of mounting hostility from the Arab world inflamed by last Friday's air strikes, Whitehall officials said yesterday. Growing opposition among Nato allies, including France and Germany, to the existing attempts by Washington and London to contain Saddam Hussein has persuaded the British government that a different approach may be needed. Doubts at home have also contributed to a reassessment of the hardline policy To try to turn foreign and domestic opinion around, ministers are actively considering a dual track strategy. They are looking at plans for \"smart\" sanctions combined with a new propaganda drive highlighting the repression carried out by the Iraqi regime and insisting that its people's suffering - including infant deaths - is of the dictatorship's making. Even so, the government went on yesterday strongly defending last Friday's air strikes against Iraqi radar installations, and the no-fly zones imposed on Iraq by Britain and the US after the 1990-91 Gulf war. These, officials still say, will be abandoned only if President Saddam allows in United Nations weapons inspectors. Whitehall officials say the issue of the zones could be part of an overall agreement in which Baghdad made concessions on inspections. The framework of a new sanctions policy was discussed by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, during talks in Washington last week with the US secretary of state, Colin Powell. Yesterday Mr Cook held a special meeting about Iraq with his Foreign Office ministers and their senior advisers. General Powell is about to embark on a tour of Middle Eastern countries, including Syria, which recently opened a new oil pipeline with Iraq. Sanctions against Iraq are increasingly being flouted, and smuggling of goods and petroleum is rife. The plans for \"smart\" sanctions would concentrate on arms control - specifically Saddam Hussein's nuclear, chemical, and biological, weapons programme - and the finances and freedom of movement of leading members of his regime. Imports for rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and oil industry would be allowed. Such measures, London and Washington believe, would not be opposed by Iraq's Arab neighbours or by members of the UN security council. The British government is also planning to \"refocus the public debate\", as one official put it yesterday, pointing to the executions and other brutal practices used by Baghdad against critics and opponents. This repression, it argues, would be worse without the no-fly zones. Foreign Office spokesmen yesterday issued a sort of balance sheet yesterday noting that since sanctions were imposed Iraq had not used chemical weapons or invaded its neighbours. Blaming sanctions for the sufferings of the Iraqi people was \"not credible\", the paper declared. Iraq was exporting food and medicine to other countries. It said UN weapons inspectors had been unable to account for 4,000 tonnes of chemicals used to make weapons, and some 31,000 chemical weapons munitions. The air strikes by American and British planes on Iraqi air defence installations were a \"proportionate response in self defence\", the defence minister, Baroness Symons, told the Lords yesterday. Ministers had \"no choice but to act to protect\" allied aircrew. The bombings were in response to increasing attempts by Iraq to shoot down British and US aircraft, she said. Since January 1999, there had been over 1,200 attempts to attack them with surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery. Last month had seen more of these than the whole of 2000. She said the no-fly zones had served a \"vital humanitarian purpose\" in limiting Saddam Hussein's ability to repress the Shi'ites in the south and the Kurds in the north. Though the zones and the bombings are not specifically sanctioned by any UN security council resolutions, she described the patrols as \"justified in international law as a legitimate response to prevent a grave humanitarian crisis\". The French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, disagreed, saying there was no basis in international law for the attacks. France, which has withdrawn from aerial patrols of the no-fly zones, was not consulted before Friday's strikes, Mr V\u00e9drine. His strongly worded condemnation said France wanted an end to economic sanctions against Iraq. Meanwhile, in a stretch of desert in southern Israel, Patriot anti-missile missiles will be launched in the course of a five-day US-Israeli military exercise that began yesterday. But the Israeli army said the exercise was planned more than a year ago and was unrelated to the raids on Iraq.

In a damning assessment of Britain's retail car market, the European commission found that Britain remains the most expensive country in Europe to buy a new car by a huge margin for almost all the 71 models it examined. This comes despite a series of high profile campaigns from the government, the Consumers' Association and the competition commission to bring down prices and is certain to pile further pressure on the car industry to fulfill its promises. The report revealed for example that a new Mazda 323 cost \u00a311,106 before tax last November in Britain compared to a pre-tax price of \u00a35,307 in Denmark or \u00a36,659 in the Netherlands. That means that the pre-tax price in Britain was 99.3% more than in Denmark. Brussels found gaping price disparities right across the board for a range of popular models.

A Nissan Almera was priced at \u00a35,787 in Spain compared to almost \u00a39,000 in Britain. Brussels noted that five manufacturers - Citroen, Mercedes-Benz, Vauxhall, Volvo and Volkswagen - have reduced their British prices by between 5% and 7% since last May, but this had made only a small impact on price differences. \"The price level in the United Kingdom, where there is no extra tax on car purchase, remains very high, despite the slight depreciation of the British pound and the fact that prices in euros for 23 models sold in the UK have diminished by more than 10 percentage points,\" the commission said in a statement. It noted that many British consumers continue to buy their cars on the continent because of the big price gap but said that it still received \"many complaints\" from British bargain hunters who ran into all kinds of problems when attempting to purchase cars abroad. Unreasonable supplements for right hand drive models and long delivery times were the two most common complaints. The commission said research had shown that right-hand drive supplements were generally lower for Japanese manufacturers but highest for vehicles produced by the VW group which also includes Audi and Seat. Countries where car prices are lowest, it said, are Finland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark.

But the fertilised eggs remained on ice.</p> <p>Debbie, now with a new partner, went back to the hospital and had them implanted. She did not inform the hospital that her partner was different. She went about having the baby and setting up home with her new partner. She did not want Jon to see the baby or have any details about her.</p> <p>Under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, if a couple are unmarried, the man who signs the consent form for infertility treatment is the father \"for all purposes\". In the first case of its kind in Britain, Jon went to the high court and the court of appeal in an attempt to gain access to Chloe and to be given parental responsibility for the child he considered his daughter \"beyond a shadow of a doubt\".</p> <p>He set a precedent as the first man to be confirmed by the courts as the father of an IVF and donor-sperm baby because of his signature on a form. Last week, the court of appeal refused Jon's application to challenge a high court ruling that he should not meet Chloe face to face for two years, and that his application for a share in parental responsibility should be postponed.</p> <p>Jon had been granted indirect contact, which meant he could send Chloe a \"modest\" present at Christmas and birthdays, an Easter egg and card in April and one letter during the summer. In return, he would receive two photographs of Chloe a year. But meeting her face to face was unlikely to be considered before she was three.</p> <p>The high court ruled, however, that if Jon maintained the commitment he had shown, he was likely to gain parental responsibility in the future. Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss said in the court of appeal last week that \"unusual circumstances\" surrounded the case; that Debbie had been found \"mentally and emotionally fragile\", and was unable to cope with any direct contact between her ex-boyfriend and her daughter.</p> <p>The judge expressed concern that \"the child will have to face aspects of her background that most children do not have to face\". She and two other judges upheld Judge Mark Hedley's original ruling that \"at some stage this child has to come to terms with the fact that she has a biological male progenitor of whom she can know nothing, a legal father with whom she has no contact, and quite likely, a male figure who is acting as her father and is the only one she has known as such. What effect this will all have can only be a matter of speculation.\"</p> <p>Judge Hedley hoped it might serve to widen the debate on IVF treatment and parents' rights. Jon, 38, a quiet, smartly dressed man, is now preparing to wait patiently for two years to meet his daughter.</p> <p>\"Chloe is my daughter totally and completely,\" he says. \"As a man, when you choose to have a child by anonymous donor, they check your height, build, blood group, eye colour and appearance to match the donor with the person. So when the child is born it will have the characteristics of both the father and the mother. It will look like both. A child is not a product of one person, but of two.</p> <p>\"I wasn't surprised by the court of appeal's decision. I hoped parental responsibility would be given, but I've learnt to expect nothing and to be patient. That way you don't get disappointed. I am sad that I will miss out on all the firsts - teething and steps. But Chloe is our child for life and I just have to prepare for the input I will have in the future. I never expected media attention from the case, nor did I think I was a champion of father's rights.\"</p> <p>Jon considers himself to be a normal father, doing his best to gain contact and provide some input into his daughter's life. \"It's a let-down that generally fathers are not as important to the courts as mothers. If I have set a precedent for future fathers I am pleased. But I have never spoken out as part of a legal crusade. I have simply loved Chloe from the moment I heard she had been born. And I save all the press cuttings and record all the television coverage so that when Chloe grows up, she can see how much I love her.\"</p> <p>Jon says he did not go to the court of appeal to rush the direct contact, or to cause unnecessary strain on Chloe's mother. \"I appealed because I wanted to stop Chloe losing the father she deserves.

She has round cheeks and big eyes. \"Look at the likeness,\" Jon says. \"She's got my eyes and my colouring, my smile, my face shape. Everyone says it. She looks just like me.\" This is surprising because Jon is infertile. The child carries none of his genes.

      "bodyText": "Michael Portillo yesterday took the pre-election battle over tax to Gordon Brown's home turf when he pledged an extra \u00a3200 a year for parents of children under the age of five. In a daring attempt to steal the chancellor's thunder, Mr Portillo promised to set aside an extra \u00a3400m to boost Labour's cherished children's tax credit which comes into force in April. Under his plan, families with a child under the age of five will receive an additional tax break of \u00a3200 a year, which works out at just under \u00a34 a week. The pledge will stand even if the chancellor increases the credit's starting rate in the Budget from \u00a3442 a year to \u00a3520, as proposed by the Treasury. In a speech to the Centre for Policy Studies, Mr Portillo said he believed it would be best to give extra help to families with the youngest children. \"When children are not yet at school, they make the greatest demands in terms of expense, time and nervous energy.\" The children's tax credit, launched amid great fanfare by the chancellor last month, is designed to top up the pay of less well off parents. Standard rate taxpayers who earn less than \u00a332,000 will receive an extra \u00a3442 a year from April. The payments are reduced for higher earners and any parent receiving more than \u00a341,000 receives nothing extra. Mr Portillo indicated that he would open up the tax credit to the better off. The shadow chancellor, who will announce further details next week, said that it was \"absurd and indefensible\" to prevent the better off from receiving the credit. \"Gordon Brown has arranged that a couple each earning \u00a330,000 will receive the credit but a couple with a smaller joint income, with one earner receiving just over \u00a340,000 will receive no tax credit,\" he said. The announcement by the shadow chancellor was the latest in a series of tax concessions unveiled by the Tories in the past few weeks. Central office hopes to appeal to floating voters by targeting tax cuts at middle income earners. Mr Portillo has pledged to introduce \u00a38bn worth of tax cuts in the run-up to the general election, which will be paid for by cuts in public services. In his speech yesterday, Mr Portillo insisted that there was a moral case for low taxation. \"We will remind the country that it was through the pursuit of low-tax policies that the British economy was transformed from the sick man of Europe to a picture of health.\" Labour last night claimed Mr Portillo's announcement was another Tory u-turn. Andrew Smith, shadow chief secretary, said: \"Just a few weeks ago, Michael Portillo told the Daily Mail that the children's tax credit was a 'stealth tax on marriage'. A month ago, David Willetts described the children's tax credit as a 'gimmick'. Today their policy is in chaos and confusion.\" Mr Smith said that the Tory figures did not add up because he claimed that the party was committed to introducing \u00a316bn of cuts. His criticism was echoed by the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Matthew Taylor, who said: \"People know you can't get something for nothing - you can only cut taxes by cutting schools, hospitals and pensions.\"",

Chairman Stuart Wallis is to follow him in July, when his contract will not be renewed. </p> <p>On a black day for the Cheshire-based firm, the departures were accompanied by a profits warning, which sent the shares plunging 107p to 409p. This revealed that factory closures and staff reorganisation following the firm's merger in 1999 were proving slower and less lucrative than expected. </p> <p>The changes were agreed at a tense board meeting on Friday afternoon at the group's Cheshire head office, Toft Hall. In a split revealed by the Guardian earlier this month, the firm's executive directors were pitted against non-executives in their views on who should run the business. </p> <p>Mr Wallis, who was pressing for Mr Cater's departure with support from his fellow non-executives, yesterday said he had been planning to leave all along: \"I had already indicated I was likely to step down in July - I'm involved in several other public companies, and some private ones. I've been at SSL for four years and that's almost a record for me.\" </p> <p>He said Mr Cater had been asked to leave because of the company's disappointing performance: \"Following the profits warning we had in November, and then the one today, the board felt it was probably appropriate for Iain to step down.\" </p> <p>Mr Wallis insisted that the changes had been agreed \"very democratically\", although he admitted that there were disagreements on the board: \"You would not expect, in a situation like this, for everybody to have exactly the same views. But the detail of the way a board operates is not something that should be in the public domain.\" </p> <p>When contacted yesterday, Mr Cater was tight-lipped about the way his 22-year career at the company had ended. He would only say of his dismissal: \"I don't think it's subject to negotiation.\" </p> <p>When asked about his plans, Mr Cater said his job prospects were \"an open agenda\" before adding: \"I really shouldn't comment any further.\" </p> <p>Mr Cater, the 49-year-old son of an RAF officer from Cheltenham, was the architect of SSL's creation through a combination of healthcare firm Seton, footcare company Scholl and condoms maker London International. However, his ambition of creating a world leader in over-the-counter healthcare products began to fall apart in November. The company warned of a setback in its attempts to use in-house salesmen, rather than third-party distributors - former partners were dumping their remaining stocks of bandages and dressings on the market at knockdown prices. </p> <p>Analysts cut their forecasts from \u00a3130m to \u00a3110m. But the real damage was in presentation - analysts complained that SSL had briefed its own broker in advance, and many were furious that Mr Wallis walked out of a meeting early to catch a plane. </p> <p>Mr Wallis yesterday said he was obliged to hurry away due to urgent commitments in the US, but admitted he regretted his handling of the incident: \"Could I have handled it better? I probably could - with hindsight, I should have made it clear from the outset that I would have to leave early.\" </p> <p>The incident threw up differences in the way SSL communicated - Mr Wallis felt the firm should have been more forthright about its predicament, while Mr Cater remained relentlessly upbeat. </p> <p>After a disastrous plunge in the shares, there were calls for change but the board could not agree on who should take the blame. Mr Wallis urged Mr Cater to quit but he faced opposition from executives, many of whom were long standing colleagues of the chief executive from the days of Seton. They, instead, wanted Mr Wallis to go - one document was drawn up detailing \"the case against the chairman\". </p> <p>For a time, the board was deadlocked. But this month's arrival of new finance director Garry Watts, a former executive at Celltech, broke the stalemate. </p> <p>Mr Watts' first act has been a review of the firm's progress in merging its operations with London International. His conclusion was that the promised \u00a325m in annual savings would be very difficult to achieve. </p> <p>The need for another profits warning sealed Mr Cater's fate. Mr Wallis said: \"If there was a mistake, it was over-optimism about the speed with which things could be achieved.\" </p> <p>Mr Cater's colleagues got what they wanted too. Mr Wallis surrendered his position, having failed to keep a lid on unrest. He remains chairman of a clutch of other companies, including the biotech firm Protherics. </p> <p>SSL yesterday indicated that its profits are likely to be \u00a390m this year. Some analysts believe the firm could now be broken up - Michael King of WestLB Panmure said: \"The shares are looking very cheap at the moment and there are some very valuable brands among the group. A number of expanding healthcare companies could be interested in brands like Scholl and Durex.\" </p> <p>Mr Cater is likely to pick up compensation of more than \u00a3700,000 to soften the blow of redundancy. That will do little to calm impatient shareholders, some of whom are already questioning whether SSL can work as an independent business.</p>",

The changes were agreed at a tense board meeting on Friday afternoon at the group's Cheshire head office, Toft Hall. In a split revealed by the Guardian earlier this month, the firm's executive directors were pitted against non-executives in their views on who should run the business. Mr Wallis, who was pressing for Mr Cater's departure with support from his fellow non-executives, yesterday said he had been planning to leave all along: \"I had already indicated I was likely to step down in July - I'm involved in several other public companies, and some private ones. I've been at SSL for four years and that's almost a record for me.\" He said Mr Cater had been asked to leave because of the company's disappointing performance: \"Following the profits warning we had in November, and then the one today, the board felt it was probably appropriate for Iain to step down.\" Mr Wallis insisted that the changes had been agreed \"very democratically\", although he admitted that there were disagreements on the board: \"You would not expect, in a situation like this, for everybody to have exactly the same views. But the detail of the way a board operates is not something that should be in the public domain.\" When contacted yesterday, Mr Cater was tight-lipped about the way his 22-year career at the company had ended. He would only say of his dismissal: \"I don't think it's subject to negotiation.\" When asked about his plans, Mr Cater said his job prospects were \"an open agenda\" before adding: \"I really shouldn't comment any further.\" Mr Cater, the 49-year-old son of an RAF officer from Cheltenham, was the architect of SSL's creation through a combination of healthcare firm Seton, footcare company Scholl and condoms maker London International. However, his ambition of creating a world leader in over-the-counter healthcare products began to fall apart in November. The company warned of a setback in its attempts to use in-house salesmen, rather than third-party distributors - former partners were dumping their remaining stocks of bandages and dressings on the market at knockdown prices. Analysts cut their forecasts from \u00a3130m to \u00a3110m. But the real damage was in presentation - analysts complained that SSL had briefed its own broker in advance, and many were furious that Mr Wallis walked out of a meeting early to catch a plane. Mr Wallis yesterday said he was obliged to hurry away due to urgent commitments in the US, but admitted he regretted his handling of the incident: \"Could I have handled it better? I probably could - with hindsight, I should have made it clear from the outset that I would have to leave early.\" The incident threw up differences in the way SSL communicated - Mr Wallis felt the firm should have been more forthright about its predicament, while Mr Cater remained relentlessly upbeat. After a disastrous plunge in the shares, there were calls for change but the board could not agree on who should take the blame. Mr Wallis urged Mr Cater to quit but he faced opposition from executives, many of whom were long standing colleagues of the chief executive from the days of Seton. They, instead, wanted Mr Wallis to go - one document was drawn up detailing \"the case against the chairman\". For a time, the board was deadlocked. But this month's arrival of new finance director Garry Watts, a former executive at Celltech, broke the stalemate. Mr Watts' first act has been a review of the firm's progress in merging its operations with London International. His conclusion was that the promised \u00a325m in annual savings would be very difficult to achieve. The need for another profits warning sealed Mr Cater's fate. Mr Wallis said: \"If there was a mistake, it was over-optimism about the speed with which things could be achieved.\" Mr Cater's colleagues got what they wanted too. Mr Wallis surrendered his position, having failed to keep a lid on unrest. He remains chairman of a clutch of other companies, including the biotech firm Protherics. SSL yesterday indicated that its profits are likely to be \u00a390m this year. Some analysts believe the firm could now be broken up - Michael King of WestLB Panmure said: \"The shares are looking very cheap at the moment and there are some very valuable brands among the group. A number of expanding healthcare companies could be interested in brands like Scholl and Durex.\" Mr Cater is likely to pick up compensation of more than \u00a3700,000 to soften the blow of redundancy. That will do little to calm impatient shareholders, some of whom are already questioning whether SSL can work as an independent business.",

Many of them insisted that female troops, especially those performing a teaching role, should not be sent into \"war zones\". \"There is a war there, there is shooting, there are roadside bombs,\" one father told Israel Radio. \"There is no reason to send girls into Gaza or the West Bank. \"These girls are not fighters, they are not combat supporters, [they] do not protect civilians and are in the field for entertainment only. \"I don't want, God forbid, someone to tell me, 'Sorry, I made a mistake.'\" Another father told Israel Radio that women had not been sent into Lebanon during the 22 years Israel occupied the south of the country, and called for a similar ruling for the West Bank and Gaza. An army spokeswoman said the military provided educational activities to troops serving in all sectors. She said that the schedule of activities for teachers was decided, and sometimes cancelled, in accordance with the situation. More than 400 people, mostly Palestinians but also 61 Jews and 13 Israeli Arabs, have been killed since the Palestinian uprising began in September.

      "bodyText": "One of South Africa's most influential black businessmen resigned from a host of prominent positions after corruption investigators raided his home yesterday. The public prosecutor's office ordered the raid on a warrant which accused Keith Kunene of accepting bribes from High Beam Trading, a consortium which includes the London commodities trader Trafigura. Mr Kunene, seen as an icon of economic empowerment for victims of apartheid, is accused of accepting $60,000 (about \u00a341,000) in bribes to influence a $200m oil deal while he was chairman of the state-owned Central Energy Fund, which controls South Africa's fuel reserves. He was allegedly promised a further $2m in exchange for a contract awarded to the consortium, about 10 times the usual handling fee. The South African energy minister, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, sacked Mr Kunene from the energy fund in December after an independent audit revealed irregularities in the oil deal. Among other things, the deal, which effectively privatised the state's oil trading operations, is said to have been done without tendering and without the government being informed. The government, which is asking for the contract to be nullified, has lodged papers with a Johannesburg court alleging that High Beam paid bribes. It is also trying to recover $3m (\u00a32.1m) already paid to the consortium. Trafigura is seeking legal arbitration in London, where the contract was signed. After yesterday's raid Mr Kunene resigned from all his other positions, including the chair of a state gambling board and the University of Zululand, and numerous directorships. According to papers lodged by the investigators with the high court in Pretoria, two fuel fund directors allege that they were paid $20,000 (\u00a313,800) each by Mr Kunene to favour High Beam. Black business groups described the accusations as a further blow to the credibility of the policy of economic empowerment, because Mr Kunene was among the best known and most successful businessmen to penetrate areas previously dominated by whites. Last year a Johannesburg financial newspaper named him businessman of the year. The government's efforts to promote black-owned business has come under criticism for creating a new class of extremely wealthy black people without bringing much benefit to the rest of the population. There have also been accusations of nepotism in the awarding of contracts to black empowerment companies linked to South Africa's controversial agreement to buy \u00a34bn-worth of weapons from British and European arms dealers. A spokesman for the public prosecutor's office said investigators raided Mr Kunene's home and the office of a High Beam director, Moses Molele, who is alleged to have paid the bribe. Prosecutors say other officials of High Beam International and Trafigura are still under investigation. Trafigura has strongly denied any knowledge of irregular payments to Mr Kunene. \"We would like to stress that there is no basis whatsoever for any such allegations, with reference to Trafigura or to its South African joint venture company,\" it said. \"Trafigura deplores bribery in any form and will not tolerate any irregularities from its own employees or those of its business partners.\"",

      "body": "<p>Six British warplanes flying alongside US aircraft are a good backdrop to Tony Blair's first meeting with President Bush. So say the government's spinners, ever ready to use anything for effect, however deadly and serious.</p> <p>Unleashing weaponry from a great height on Saddam Hussein's defences is a step too far for many traditional Labour supporters. Its cynical exploitation by Labour's press machine is trying to make up for the misjudgment Blair made in thinking Al Gore would win. It is also trying to bridge a growing chasm between European and US attitudes towards Nato, defence and world problems.</p> <p>When Blair gets to Washington, he will find goodwill for this gesture, but he will still be under pressure privately on a range of issues where the alliance is no longer in good shape. One raid cannot repair all the damage done by the EU defence initiative nor the bad will generated by a series of expensive trade disputes between the EU and the US. Indeed, Blair is playing a very dangerous game, risking our security for the sake of his over-extended European diplomacy.</p> <p>Robin Cook and Tony Blair have appeared regularly to tell us that the US is our oldest ally, our best friend, we are united by a common language, history and culture. It is difficult to accept their sincerity about the American alliance when at the same time they want to move into a political, economic and monetary union with our continental friends.</p> <p>The government refuses to see that we are at a crossroads. If we wish to join France and Germany in a Euro force that has a separate command structure from Nato and intervenes where Nato fears to tread, we will be pulled apart slowly but inevitably from the US defence alliance. Why should the US share intelligence with us if we may share it with others she does not trust completely? Why should the US shield protect us, if we have decided for part of the time to go off and do things that the US disagrees with?</p> <p>If we sign up to the common foreign policy of the EU we have to accept that it will pull us further away from the US position. A common EU foreign policy would be unlikely to support this type of operation against Iraq. EU policy is much more sympathetic to Russia than US policy likes. EU attitudes to the Middle East and eastern Europe are very different from US ones.</p> <p>If we sign up to the euro and abolish the pound, we are accepting a plan to provide a rival currency to the dollar. The aim is to create a single economic bloc as strong as the US, and to assert that power around the world.</p> <p>We are already dragged into conflicts with the US over a range of trading issues. There are rows over beef exports, genetically modified foods, rum and bananas. Airbus sets out to topple Boeing, only to find the US calling foul over its launch aid and the EU crying unfair over Boeing's military contracts.</p> <p>The UK tried but failed to bring the two sides together in the recent environmental summit. John Prescott's shuttle diplomacy ran out of steam when he decided he wanted to go home. He had had enough of squabbling foreigners. His ration of tact and diplomacy had more than given out. It was a fitting epitaph for a policy that cannot last much longer. Britain has been a bridge between the old world and the new. Now the divide is growing wider and the waters rougher it is becoming impossible to be loved by both sides.</p> <p>What should the UK do? We need to decide where our best interests lie. Some will say they rest with the EU. They want us to agree with our partners who do not like the Iraqi strikes, throw in our lot with EU defence and join the great project for political and monetary union. That entails \"standing up\" to the US on a wide range of issues, as France has often done.</p> <p>Most British people believe that we cannot accept political union. We believe Britain needs a strong defence alliance with the US. That means no Euro army, and an independent foreign policy. It means keeping our own currency. It means trying to prevent the trade conflict between the EU and the US from getting out of hand.</p> <p>When Mr Blair gets to Washington he will find he has not done enough to reassure the US about our intentions.

      "bodyText": "Six British warplanes flying alongside US aircraft are a good backdrop to Tony Blair's first meeting with President Bush. So say the government's spinners, ever ready to use anything for effect, however deadly and serious. Unleashing weaponry from a great height on Saddam Hussein's defences is a step too far for many traditional Labour supporters. Its cynical exploitation by Labour's press machine is trying to make up for the misjudgment Blair made in thinking Al Gore would win. It is also trying to bridge a growing chasm between European and US attitudes towards Nato, defence and world problems. When Blair gets to Washington, he will find goodwill for this gesture, but he will still be under pressure privately on a range of issues where the alliance is no longer in good shape. One raid cannot repair all the damage done by the EU defence initiative nor the bad will generated by a series of expensive trade disputes between the EU and the US. Indeed, Blair is playing a very dangerous game, risking our security for the sake of his over-extended European diplomacy. Robin Cook and Tony Blair have appeared regularly to tell us that the US is our oldest ally, our best friend, we are united by a common language, history and culture. It is difficult to accept their sincerity about the American alliance when at the same time they want to move into a political, economic and monetary union with our continental friends. The government refuses to see that we are at a crossroads. If we wish to join France and Germany in a Euro force that has a separate command structure from Nato and intervenes where Nato fears to tread, we will be pulled apart slowly but inevitably from the US defence alliance. Why should the US share intelligence with us if we may share it with others she does not trust completely? Why should the US shield protect us, if we have decided for part of the time to go off and do things that the US disagrees with? If we sign up to the common foreign policy of the EU we have to accept that it will pull us further away from the US position. A common EU foreign policy would be unlikely to support this type of operation against Iraq. EU policy is much more sympathetic to Russia than US policy likes. EU attitudes to the Middle East and eastern Europe are very different from US ones. If we sign up to the euro and abolish the pound, we are accepting a plan to provide a rival currency to the dollar. The aim is to create a single economic bloc as strong as the US, and to assert that power around the world. We are already dragged into conflicts with the US over a range of trading issues. There are rows over beef exports, genetically modified foods, rum and bananas. Airbus sets out to topple Boeing, only to find the US calling foul over its launch aid and the EU crying unfair over Boeing's military contracts. The UK tried but failed to bring the two sides together in the recent environmental summit. John Prescott's shuttle diplomacy ran out of steam when he decided he wanted to go home. He had had enough of squabbling foreigners. His ration of tact and diplomacy had more than given out. It was a fitting epitaph for a policy that cannot last much longer. Britain has been a bridge between the old world and the new. Now the divide is growing wider and the waters rougher it is becoming impossible to be loved by both sides. What should the UK do? We need to decide where our best interests lie. Some will say they rest with the EU. They want us to agree with our partners who do not like the Iraqi strikes, throw in our lot with EU defence and join the great project for political and monetary union. That entails \"standing up\" to the US on a wide range of issues, as France has often done. Most British people believe that we cannot accept political union. We believe Britain needs a strong defence alliance with the US. That means no Euro army, and an independent foreign policy. It means keeping our own currency. It means trying to prevent the trade conflict between the EU and the US from getting out of hand. When Mr Blair gets to Washington he will find he has not done enough to reassure the US about our intentions. Above all, they will want to know whether he will support their national missile defence system, at a time when Mr Blair wants to bury the issue as another embarrassment to his party. \u0095 John Redwood is the member of parliament for Wokingham and author of Stars and Strife on the EU/US relationship. redwoodj@parliament.uk",

      "body": "<p>On June 11 1981, Issei Sagawa invited Renee Hartevelt, a 25-year-old Dutch woman, back to his Paris flat for a poetry reading session. They were both students at the Sorbonne university and had been friends for a few months. She was teaching him German. He liked her easy smile, her sunny personality. In a letter home to her parents in Holland, she wrote that she found him \"friendly and intellectual\".</p> <p>As she sat in his living room, reading aloud, Sagawa stepped behind her and pulled out a carbine rifle that he had hidden in a chest of drawers. He walked towards her, pointed the gun at the back of her neck and pulled the trigger. After having sex with her dead body, Sagawa began to eat her. \"I wanted to know the taste of human flesh, the young beautiful girl's flesh,\" he tells me 20 years later, over iced coffee in a downtown Tokyo cafe. \"Just one bite of the hips. When you fall in love, you really want to kiss her. It's just the same, I just wanted to taste her. I'm a cannibal. It's an obsession.\"</p> <p>Sagawa ate part of Hartevelt's thigh, buttock, breast, lips, calves - some cooked, some raw. After two days he decided he needed to get rid of the body. He bought two large suitcases, filled them with her remains, and called a taxi. Helping to load the suitcases, the taxi driver remarked on how heavy they were. \"What have you got in here? A dead body?\"</p> <p>When he remembers the taxi driver's question, Sagawa bursts out laughing. This is one of the things about Sagawa - he laughs at inappropriate moments. I am interviewing him for a documentary about modern cannibals, and the first thing that strikes me when I meet him is his size; he is at least a foot shorter than me. His hands and feet are tiny, his fingers deformed. His skin is shiny white and pockmarked. He is 51, but could be in his 30s.</p> <p>Sagawa was an inept criminal. He dumped the two suitcases in the Bois de Boulogne and ran. Two joggers opened them and found Hartevelt's remains. Sagawa was easily traced through the taxi driver, found to be clinically insane and was put in a psychiatric unit in Paris. The French kept him in a maximum security unit for four years, until the authorities decided they couldn't foot the bill for the rest of his life, so he was deported back to his native Japan. There was no clause in the deportation order that said he had to be kept under lock and key, so now he is a free man. He has become a sort of celebrity; he does restaurant reviews and stars in porn films.</p> <p>The aim of the documentary is to gain some understanding of how seemingly ordinary people can do the unthinkable, the grotesque. Sagawa tries to describe the sexual obsession which drove him to kill - a complex obsession which involved merging completely with a member of the opposite sex. \"I'm a very short, ugly, small man so I always admire big, strong and healthy people, especially beautiful girls. In my mind, eat and eaten is the same. So I don't mind being eaten by a young, beautiful girl.\"</p> <p>\"So you would like me to eat you?\" I ask him.</p> <p>\"Yes,\" he replies.</p> <p>We travel to the US. Arthur Shawcross conforms more easily to many people's idea of a cannibal serial killer with his explosive rage, choice of victims and use of savage violence. He has 239 years to serve in New York state's maximum security prison. In 1972, he murdered a girl and a boy, and served 15 years in jail.</p> <p>Within a year of his release, he was killing again. He killed 11 more people, all prostitutes, within 18 months. Caught in 1990, he was tried and sentenced, since when he has undergone much analysis. He claims that he ate the penis and heart of the 11-year-old boy, Jack Blake; he also says he ate the genitalia of three prostitutes.</p> <p>Inside the Sullivan Correctional Facility, we are taken through a large number of air-locked doors, down a corridor which echoes with the sounds of lots of men behind bars and into a large white room with nothing in it but a table and two chairs. Shawcross comes in with two guards. He is as big as Sagawa is small, weighing about 320lbs. He has a pot belly and long grey hair, scraped back into a pony tail. He looks like someone's uncle gone wrong. There is no glass divide, the guards are not armed. Shawcross is not wearing handcuffs and is obviously checking us out. The crew and I feel very exposed and the atmosphere is tense.</p> <p>But Shawcross seems to enjoy being filmed, getting off on playing up to the camera. \"I used to eat a lot of raw meat in '64 and '65 when I worked as a butcher. I used to butcher 19 cows a day and just liked the taste of raw meat. You know, I'd just cut off a chunk ... I could tell just by the taste of the blood whether we could turn it into steaks or hamburger.\"</p> <p>Shawcross tells me that he developed a taste for human flesh when he served in Vietnam. He describes in lurid detail tracking two Vietcong women in the jungle, ambushing them and tying one alive to a tree while he cut up and cooked the other.</p> <p>I ask him what human flesh tastes like. \"When was the last time you had nice roast pork?\" he replies.</p> <p>\"A while ago.\"</p> <p>\"I don't think you're going to eat it again, are you? If you take a fresh ham, a roast pork, and the butt-end where it's a little burnt, that's what you taste like.\"</p> <p>\"And why did you eat it?\"</p> <p>\"I have no idea.\"</p> <p>\"Were you hungry?\"</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>We will never know the truth behind Shawcross's claims of cannibalism. The autopsies showed mutilation in the genital areas, but the bodies retrieved were so decomposed that evidence of cannibalism was inconclusive. The women in Vietnam were probably a fantasy.</p> <p>Shawcross frightens and outrages me, but as a film-maker it is important to seek explanations. In our interviews with professionals working in the areas of mental health and criminal justice, a complex matrix of factors emerges. Brain injury was one of them. Both Sagawa and Shawcross sustained damage to the frontal lobes of the brain before they became murderers. But this can only go a short way towards explaining people like them. Many thousands of people suffer such brain damage without becoming monsters.</p> <p>The \"softer\" sciences of psychology and sociology offer potential clues. Is it merely a coincidence that Andrei Chikatilo, who was convicted of 53 murders from all over the former Soviet Union, was traumatised as a child by the story of his elder brother, who was killed and eaten during the Russian famine?</p> <p>Then there are Sagawa's home movies. I remember how shocked I was the first time I saw the film of a game he and his brother had played with their father and uncle. Dad dressed up as a knight. Their uncle played a giant. The two adults would \"fight\" over the children. When dad won, everything was OK. When he lost, the giant got to \"eat\" them.</p> <p>The scratchy black and white film shows two children, aged four and two, screaming with delight as the giant prepares the cooking pot - a real one on a real stove.</p> <p>No one is suggesting for a moment that similar, if less gruesome, games are not played innocently and safely every day by millions of families. But is it just coincidence that Sagawa, the four-year-old child, became Issei Sagawa, the 32-year-old cannibal? Perhaps we can find not the full story within those home movies but they may offer some small clue.</p> <p>In making this film, we wanted to find scientific explanations for cannibalism. But the scientists are struggling. They want experimental populations numbering hundreds or even thousands. They want extensive control groups. They want vast statistical analysis. But cannibals don't come in such numbers. So ultimately, perhaps, we must turn towards less scientific concepts.</p> <p>I spend four intense days with Sagawa. Knowing that the crew are uncomfortable eating and drinking in his flat, he is always at pains to reassure us that the glass or plate he is handing us is freshly washed. He recognises our fear of \"contamination\". But then he makes a joke about the disappearance of the British woman, Lucie Blackman. In trying to understand such paradoxes, I suspect that we must turn to writers such as Dostoevsky and the Bront\u00ebs for insight. The scientific quest for explanation is fascinating and essential, but that journey has barely begun.</p> <p>On return from Japan, there is a fax waiting from Sagawa. It is a thank-you letter, in which he says: \"You treat me like a man, not a monster.\"</p> <p>Here is a man who has tragically and brutally ended the life of a young woman and cannibalised her body. The horrific autopsy pictures say it all. Perhaps his letter stems from self-pity. Since then, his faxes have been veiled threats to sue if I misrepresent him. By the seventh fax I start to see how paranoid, inadequate and vulnerable he is. Then I realise that I have taken my first real step towards understanding him.</p> <p>\u0095 Katharine English is the producer/director of Cannibal: The Real Hannibal Lecters, tonight on Channel 4 at 10pm.</p>",

He claimed he had told her to shut up, threatened to hit her, and the car swerved into the path of a lorry as his wife stuck her chin out to him. But he was unaware of the impending crash on the A540 at Woodbank, south Wirral, until it was too late. The lorry driver, Joseph Robinson, tried to brake but could not avoid a collision, the court heard. Kathryn Whitlow's brother, Michael Bresnen, later said the family was devastated by the verdict.",

Nick Berry trying to be all grizzled and troubled was a lot more worrying. As part of the Special Ops team, he had Seen A Lot. Naturally, this meant he had a difficult relationship with his wife and his children and that he walked around as though he had just stood in something unpleasant. Which, in a manner of speaking, he had. Namely, this drama. </p> <p>Watching Berry and Tompkinson attempting a metamorphosis from housewives' favourites into mini-Ken Stotts was painful enough - like trying to accept that Big Bird is running a crack den on Sesame Street while Oscar the Grouch is pimping for Maria - but the icky feeling that they were doing so in such an unoriginal, lethargic and plain boring show made it worse. </p> <p>I mean, dead prostitutes? The oldest trick (so to speak) in the police procedural book. And who are these men? Bent coppers, you say? And they're dealing in what? Drugs? What a dazzlingly unique and inventive story!

He and Tompkinson are in deep alright. Right up to their eyeballs in the stinky stuff. </p> <p>In the jurisdiction of <strong> The Toughest Sheriff In America</strong> (Channel 5), crime pays. Not for the \"criminals\" of course, but for the sheriff himself, Joe Arpaio. Quite the media whore, Sheriff Joe enjoys sky-high popularity in this Republican stronghold in Arizona, and invites camera crews on drug busts. He prides himself on making chain gangs clear up litter and dig graves for the poor. He smiles while explaining how he houses prisoners in tents and makes them generate their own electricity. He is positively gleeful when explaining how all of this saves the taxpayer money while keeping him in office. Sheriff Joe clearly has a tiny penis. </p> <p>With his posse of volunteers and prison guards who are allowed to kill inmates, certain to be exonerated by Sheriff Joe's corrupt justice, Arpaio is a shining example of the deluded self-righteousness in which the right-wing cloak themselves to justify their loathing for everyone, including themselves, and their blind ignorance and stupidity. </p> <p>Widespread gun ownership reduces crime, Sheriff Joe maintained, while jailing someone for the possession of one joint is completely legitimate. Having pursued his policies for nearly a decade, you would think Sheriff Joe's little corner of Arizona would be blissfully crime free. As if.

Casting such sexual aspersions on the F\u00fchrer wasn't confined to playground chants, as the intriguing <strong> Hitler's Women</strong> (Channel 4) explained.

Such a discovery would validate the idea that only those with sexual perversions were capable of sanctioning horrendous acts of torture, murder and destruction. Only judging from the way Hitler treated women (badly), he was simply as intemperate in that respect as in any other. He wasn't abnormal in his misogyny at all. Rather, he was normal in the extreme.

The British Medical Association said that ministers were \"playing politics with Britain's 25,000 consultants to the detriment of patients and the NHS\". The government is expected tomorrow to publish proposals for a new consultants' contract. They will incorporate an idea floated in the NHS plan in July to make newly-qualified consultants work exclusively for the NHS \"for perhaps the first seven years of their career.\" The move follows a private meeting between Mr Milburn and the BMA last week at which the doctors' representatives are understood to have harangued the minister over his treatment of them. It looked last night as if Mr Milburn has decided Labour will lose nothing in the forthcoming election campaign by taking on a profession whose image has been dented by recent scandals. But Peter Hawker, chairman of the BMAs consultants committee, hinted that doctors would respond by challenging the credibility of Mr Milburn's NHS reforms. \"He should not assume consultants will be endlessly cooperative when the call on their goodwill is entirely one-sided,\" Dr Hawker said. The row centres on the first comprehensive reform of the national consultants' contract since 1948. Ministers want to provide better rewards for consultants who are fully committed to NHS work, in return for a stronger system of appraisal and clearer lines of accountability. Dr Hawker said: \"We have been seeking to negotiate privately and in good faith ...

He was responding to their refusal to sign a pact against terrorist agreed by the main political parties. \"There is no room here for ambiguities or half-heartedness,\" he said. Mr Rajoy, whose conservative Popular party is normally close to the church, said the vast majority of Catholics in Spain \"demand a pronouncement\". The bishops' congress argued that it was unable to sign an essentially political document. Privately, bishops recognise that the refusal to support the government's stance on terrorism is led by Basque bishops. There is growing concern that sectors of the Basque church are not only ambiguous about Eta, which killed 23 people last year, but actively sympathised with its aims. Mr Rajoy's criticism was endorsed by the opposition Socialist party and various newspapers, all of whom accused Basque bishops of being too nice to Eta. \"The Basque bishops try to maintain an impossible balance between those who kill and those who are killed,\" El Mundo said. \"The church has been practising politics for 2,000 years but, faced with the destruction of the social fabric of the Basque country, it has responded with empty words.\" The Basque country is one of Spain's most intensely Catholic regions: the Jesuit order was founded there by St Ignatius of Loyola in the 16th century. In Franco's time the church was the main defender of the Basque language, Euskara, and of Basque culture. In the past Basque priests have been jailed for giving refuge to Eta gunmen.",

What more persuasive argument could an ex-president with his back to the wall have deployed to sway US public opinion behind him?

      "body": "<p>Charles Trenet, who has died aged 87, was the most influential popular French songwriter of the mid-20th century. A performer of immense charm, with a light baritone voice of individual, caressing softness, he created - with his near-contemporaries Jean Sablon and Yves Montand - a style veering between wistful nostalgia and exuberant bravado that withstood the bombardment of American pop music for more than 30 years. His most famous song, La Mer (The Sea), sold more than 70m records after its release in 1946.</p> <p>Trenet was born in Narbonne, where his early schooling took place; after his parents divorced, he was a boarder at the Institution de la Trinit\u00e9 at B\u00e9ziers. He finished his studies at Perpignan, where his first efforts as a poet and painter were noticed by the poet Albert Bausil, editor of Le coq catalan. He encouraged Trenet to go to Paris, where he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie des Arts D\u00e9coratives. He later worked as an assistant to the stage designer Jacques de Baroncelli.</p> <p>At a student haunt, College Inn, in the rue Vavin in Montparnasse, the 20-year-old Trenet met the pianist Johnny Hess. Two years younger than Trenet, Hess came from Switzerland and had studied with Horowitz, but soon turned towards jazz, influenced by the music of Arthur Briggs and Django Reinhardt. The two became co-authors of a series of songs which they performed in cabaret as Charles et Johnny; at first, Trenet wrote the words and Hess the music, but later in his career, Trenet was sole author of all his material.</p> <p>Charles et Johnny made their first recordings in January 1934 and, although they included some numbers by Cole Porter and St\u00e9phane Grappelli, most of their duets were their own work - witty, cheeky songs that soon caught on, including Maman, ne vends pas la maison, Sous le lit de Lily, and one of Trenet's earliest solo successes, Rendezvous sous la pluie.</p> <p>Trenet's facility with words and music soon brought commissions from established stage and recording artists. He wrote Y'a de la joie for Maurice Chevalier, and Vous qui passez sans me voir for Jean Sablon, while the as-yet-unkown Yves Montand made his debut in 1937 with Trenet's C'est la vie qui va.</p> <p>Military service brought the Charles et Johnny duo to an end in 1936. The following year, Trenet began his career as a solo performer, adopting the outfit he wore on stage for the next 50 years or more - light blue, double-breasted suit, dark shirt and pale tie, a narrow-brimmed Fedora perched on the back of his head. Jean Cocteau drew a famous poster showing Trenet in this outfit, but equipped with angels' wings, floating in mid-air. With the songs Boum!, Je chante, La Polka du Roi, and Vous oubliez votre cheval, he established the quick-talk charm of his own tour-de-chant.</p> <p>More than his light-hearted comedy songs, it was Trenet's romantic, nostalgic numbers that put him at the forefront of the chanson. Cocteau wrote that when Trenet sang, \"He was so young, so fresh that the bar yielded to a rustic decor, the projectors became the stiff branches of a cherry tree, the microphone a hollyhock, the piano a cow.\"</p> <p>During the Nazi occupation of France, Trenet continued to write and record, but, after performances at the Folies Berg\u00e8re, refused to socialise with the German officers who made up almost all of his audiences. In 1943, Que reste-t-il de nos amours? - widely regarded as his greatest num ber - became a love song for the French, and for everyone who longed for the return of \"ces beaux jours\". After the war, even greater success came with La Mer, L'me des po\u00e8tes, which De Gaulle once quoted in one of his speeches, Coin de rue and Mes jeunes ann\u00e9es.</p> <p>Trenet made several films, including La Route Enchant\u00e9e and Adieu, Leonard, but he was essentially a man of the stage, with a rapport with the public that never deserted him. He celebrated his 80th birthday with a series of concerts at the Op\u00e9ra Bastille.</p> <p>Trenet never officially retired. In his 80s, he could still fill the huge concert hall of the Palais des Congr\u00e9s in Paris. He outlived virtually all his contemporaries - Piaf, Brel, Ferr\u00e9 and Montand - to become a national monument, the most successful and best-loved chanteur of the age. In 1995, he brought out a CD, Fais ta vie, with 12 new songs on it.</p> <p>Although he lived in Aix-en-Provence, Colette referred to him as \"the provincial genius who gives lessons in happiness to Paris\". Trenet's songs about it - M\u00e9nilmontant, La Romance de Paris (the title song of Jean Boyer's 1941 film) and Quartier Latin - remain among the best of the thousands of chansons serenading the pavements of that city.</p> <p>\u0095<b> Peter Lennon writes:</b> When you realise that the early 1940s was the period when Charles Trenet was \"an immense star\" in Paris, some uncomfortable questions are raised. The Folies Berg\u00e8re and Gaiet\u00e9 Parisienne, where he starred, were some of the favourite haunts of the Wehrmacht.

      "body": "<p>Lord Terrington of Huddersfield, better known as \"Monty\" Woodhouse, who has died aged 83, was a scholar, soldier and politician of unusual distinction. His intimate connection with wartime resistance forces in Greece, and with that country's later history and politics, spanned 60 years, and he was Conservative MP for Oxford for many years.</p> <p>The second son of the Liberal peer Lord Terrington, Woodhouse was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford, where one of his tutors was Isaiah Berlin. In 1939 he gained a double first in classics and a clutch of the most prestigious university prizes. He seemed destined for an academic career, and, on graduation, left for Greece to prepare for the All Souls fellowship examination. Unlike so many of those immersed from an early age in the study of classical Greek, he was intrigued rather than affronted by the fact that modern Athens bore little resemblance to the city of Pericles.</p> <p>On the outbreak of the second world war, Woodhouse enlisted in the Royal Artillery, a choice determined by his prowess in mathematics. His knowledge of the modern Greek language made him an obvious candidate for attachment to the British military mission sent to Greece early in 1941 in the forlorn hope of stemming the threatened German invasion of the country.</p> <p>After the withdrawal of British forces to Egypt, he was recruited into the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and spent a dispiriting few months in Crete in the winter of 1941-42, assisting in the evacuation of Commonwealth troops left behind in June 1941, in gathering intelligence and in assessing the prospects for resistance.</p> <p>In the autumn of 1942, he was parachuted by SOE into mainland Greece as second-in-command of the Harling party, whose task was to disrupt the Thessaloniki-Athens railway line, an important supply route for Rommel's Afrika Korps. After a confused landing, the Harling commander, Brigadier Eddie Myers, ordered Woodhouse to make contact with Nap- oleon Zervas, the commander of the EDES resistance group in Epirus.</p> <p>This Woodhouse accomplished after a prodigious feat of high-speed walking, sometimes for 15 hours at a stretch across rugged mountains. The Harling party, with the cooperation of units of the communist and non-communist resistance, blew up the Gorgopotamos railway viaduct on the night of November 24-25; it was one of the most spectacular wartime acts of resistance in occupied Europe.</p> <p>From the outset, Myers and Woodhouse found themselves embroiled in the fraught politics of occupied Greece, and the tall and conspicuously un-Greek-looking Woodhouse, his gingerish hair and eyebrows dyed black, was infiltrated into Athens early in 1943 on an extremely hazardous mission to attempt to fathom these complexities.</p> <p>When Myers was withdrawn from Greece in the summer of 1943, Woodhouse, promoted to the rank of full colonel at the age of 26, became commander of the allied military mission to the Greek resistance. In this ca pacity, he played a key role in negotiating a truce in the civil war that broke out between the communist and non-communist resistance groups in the winter of 1943-44.</p> <p>On the liberation of the country in October 1944, Woodhouse, appalled that no room could be found for representatives of the resistance organisations, characteristically declined to take part in the victory parade organised by the British military authorities. For his service in Greece he received British (DSO and OBE), American (Legion of Merit) and Greek decorations, while the official historian of SOE described the team of Myers and Woodhouse as one of the most effective in the troubled, brief existence of that organisation. Soon after the war, Woodhouse wrote The Apple Of Discord, a profound analysis of this critical period in Greek history, in which his own central involvement is scarcely hinted at.</p> <p>In the early 1950s, he briefly served in SIS (MI6). In this capacity he masterminded the critical initial stages of Operation Boot, the unimaginative codename for the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadeq, the Iranian politician bent on nationalising the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. One of the more remarkable disclosures in Woodhouse's entertaining, self-deprecating autobiography, Something Ventured (1982), was the use of the BBC Persian Service to send coded messages to the Shah.</p> <p>A not altogether happy four-year stint (1955-1959) as director-general of Chatham House followed. Woodhouse was also, for a time, chief editor of Penguin Books. In 1959 he was elected Conservative MP for Oxford, holding the seat until 1966, and again from 1970-1974. During his first term, he held junior ministerial office, latterly in the Home Office.</p> <p>His second term coincided with the colonels' dictatorship in Greece. Whereas a good number of his parliamentary colleagues, from all parties, were only too eager to accept the junta's hospitality in the form of freebies dressed up as fact-finding missions, Woodhouse was always steadfast and outspoken in his opposition - a rare voice on the Conservative benches prepared to speak out against the idiocies of military dictatorship.</p> <p>This was in part out of loyalty to his old resistance com rades and politician friends, many of whom were the victims of the colonels' brutal excesses. In part, too, it reflected that profound commitment to freedom and parliamentary democracy that had made Woodhouse such a formidable obstacle to the ambitions of the communist-controlled resistance in wartime Greece.</p> <p>The loss of his parliamentary seat in 1974 meant more time for scholarship. In addition to studies of British foreign policy, and lives of Rhodes (with JG Lockhart) and Dostoevsky, he published a dozen books on different aspects of Greek history. This prodigious output ranged widely over the history of the Greek people from the fall of Constantinople to the present day.</p> <p>Woodhouse's books included a study of the 15th-century philosopher Georgios Genistos Plethon; a number of works on the struggle for Greek independence in the early 19th century, including a monumental life of Count Ioannis Capodistrias, the first president of independent Greece; two major books on the troubled decade of the 1940s; a study of Greece under the colonels; and a life of Constantinos Karamanlis, the conservative Greek politician whom he so greatly admired. His last book, published in 1995, was a life of Rigas Velestiatis, the proto-martyr of Greek independence.</p> <p>Shortly before his death, Woodhouse completed the formidable task of translating into English the 10-volume History Of The European Spirit, by his friend Panayiotis Kanellopoulos, a man who, like Woodhouse, combined the life of the mind with the world of politics.</p> <p>It gave him particular pleasure that his study of Plethon, originally published by Oxford University Press, was republished last year by Sandpiper Books, prompting an invitation to Mistra, in the Peloponnese, where, in the dying days of the Byzantine empire, Plethon had called for a return to the pagan philosophies of the ancient world.</p> <p>In 1945, Woodhouse married Davina, the widow of the 5th Earl of Erne. She died in 1995. He is survived by the two sons, Christopher and Nicholas, and the daughter, Emma, of the marriage, by one stepson and two stepdaughters. He became the 5th Lord Terrington on the death of his brother in 1998.</p> <p>\u0095 Christopher Montague 'Monty' Woodhouse, Lord Terrington of Huddersfield, scholar, soldier and politician, born May 11 1917; died February 13 2001.</p>",

In this ca pacity, he played a key role in negotiating a truce in the civil war that broke out between the communist and non-communist resistance groups in the winter of 1943-44. On the liberation of the country in October 1944, Woodhouse, appalled that no room could be found for representatives of the resistance organisations, characteristically declined to take part in the victory parade organised by the British military authorities. For his service in Greece he received British (DSO and OBE), American (Legion of Merit) and Greek decorations, while the official historian of SOE described the team of Myers and Woodhouse as one of the most effective in the troubled, brief existence of that organisation. Soon after the war, Woodhouse wrote The Apple Of Discord, a profound analysis of this critical period in Greek history, in which his own central involvement is scarcely hinted at. In the early 1950s, he briefly served in SIS (MI6). In this capacity he masterminded the critical initial stages of Operation Boot, the unimaginative codename for the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadeq, the Iranian politician bent on nationalising the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. One of the more remarkable disclosures in Woodhouse's entertaining, self-deprecating autobiography, Something Ventured (1982), was the use of the BBC Persian Service to send coded messages to the Shah. A not altogether happy four-year stint (1955-1959) as director-general of Chatham House followed. Woodhouse was also, for a time, chief editor of Penguin Books. In 1959 he was elected Conservative MP for Oxford, holding the seat until 1966, and again from 1970-1974. During his first term, he held junior ministerial office, latterly in the Home Office. His second term coincided with the colonels' dictatorship in Greece. Whereas a good number of his parliamentary colleagues, from all parties, were only too eager to accept the junta's hospitality in the form of freebies dressed up as fact-finding missions, Woodhouse was always steadfast and outspoken in his opposition - a rare voice on the Conservative benches prepared to speak out against the idiocies of military dictatorship. This was in part out of loyalty to his old resistance com rades and politician friends, many of whom were the victims of the colonels' brutal excesses. In part, too, it reflected that profound commitment to freedom and parliamentary democracy that had made Woodhouse such a formidable obstacle to the ambitions of the communist-controlled resistance in wartime Greece. The loss of his parliamentary seat in 1974 meant more time for scholarship. In addition to studies of British foreign policy, and lives of Rhodes (with JG Lockhart) and Dostoevsky, he published a dozen books on different aspects of Greek history. This prodigious output ranged widely over the history of the Greek people from the fall of Constantinople to the present day. Woodhouse's books included a study of the 15th-century philosopher Georgios Genistos Plethon; a number of works on the struggle for Greek independence in the early 19th century, including a monumental life of Count Ioannis Capodistrias, the first president of independent Greece; two major books on the troubled decade of the 1940s; a study of Greece under the colonels; and a life of Constantinos Karamanlis, the conservative Greek politician whom he so greatly admired. His last book, published in 1995, was a life of Rigas Velestiatis, the proto-martyr of Greek independence. Shortly before his death, Woodhouse completed the formidable task of translating into English the 10-volume History Of The European Spirit, by his friend Panayiotis Kanellopoulos, a man who, like Woodhouse, combined the life of the mind with the world of politics. It gave him particular pleasure that his study of Plethon, originally published by Oxford University Press, was republished last year by Sandpiper Books, prompting an invitation to Mistra, in the Peloponnese, where, in the dying days of the Byzantine empire, Plethon had called for a return to the pagan philosophies of the ancient world. In 1945, Woodhouse married Davina, the widow of the 5th Earl of Erne. She died in 1995. He is survived by the two sons, Christopher and Nicholas, and the daughter, Emma, of the marriage, by one stepson and two stepdaughters. He became the 5th Lord Terrington on the death of his brother in 1998. \u0095 Christopher Montague 'Monty' Woodhouse, Lord Terrington of Huddersfield, scholar, soldier and politician, born May 11 1917; died February 13 2001.",

      "bodyText": "The hard-pressed German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, received a big boost to his struggle for political survival yesterday when the Frankfurt regional chief justice suggested that the prosecutors investigating him were politically motivated and said their formal inquiry was \"totally irregular\". \"Whoever understands politics can see what is what,\" Judge Heinrich Gehrke said in a newspaper interview. The formal investigation of complaints that Mr Fischer gave false testimony to a murder trial was opened as the minister prepared to meet the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, in Washington today. At the same time the conservative daily Die Welt moved the affair into new territory by claiming that Mr Fischer could soon become dispensable in the eyes of the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. Mr Fischer's political fate is a key issue not just for Mr Schr\u00f6der's coalition government but also for the debate on Europe's future, which Mr Fischer has helped to shape in recent months. Last month Mr Fischer gave evidence in Judge Gehrke's court as a character witness in the trial of a friend from his radical youth, Hans-Joachim Klein. Klein, who took part in the 1975 raid on an Opec meeting in Vienna in which three people were killed, was jailed for nine years last week for murder, attempted murder and hostage-taking. Among the questions Mr Fischer was asked by the counsel prosecuting Klein was whether he had ever harboured a terrorist. Judge Gehrke cut in to say that he was under no obligation to answer the question since it had no bearing on the case. But the foreign minister replied that he would happily do so, and dismissed the notion with a quip. It later emerged that a member of the Red Army Faction, Margit Schiller, who was not wanted by police at the time, had stayed in the same house as Mr Fischer - a communal squat in Frankfurt divided into several flats. Mr Fischer did not testify under oath, but in German law it is an offence to give intentionally unsworn evidence that is wrong or incomplete. In an interview with the Financial Times Deutschland, Judge Gehrke said: \"Fischer's testimony may perhaps have been wrong, but it would be hard to prove intention.\" The occupant of the flat next door to Mr Fischer's, Barbara K\u00f6ster, came forward yesterday to say, in another interview, with the leftwing Berlin daily Tageszeitung, that it was she who had put Ms Schiller up. \"I came home late and found Schiller sleeping in my bed,\" she said. Mr Fischer has never tried to disown his radical past, but he has always insisted that he opposed the resort of some on the left in the 1970s to guerrilla methods. His version has been backed consistently by former terrorists. Mr Fischer, a Green, has always been seen as crucial to the architecture of Germany's coalition government - an alliance between the Greens and Mr Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats. But Die Welt argued that the performance of another Green, Renate K\u00fcnast, who took over responsibility for the BSE crisis last month as agriculture minister, had provided Mr Schr\u00f6der with a possible replacement as the cabinet's highest-ranking Green. Poll results released yesterday suggested that most Germans do not believe that Mr Fischer should be under investigation. Another survey published at the weekend by the news magazine Focus found that, while Mr Fischer's popularity and credibility had been dented by the affair, he remained the best-liked politician in Germany after the president, Johannes Rau.",

      "body": "<p>The flat in Soho's Frith Street has been empty for a few hours, since police and immigration officers marched in and pulled out Irina, a prostitute from Kosovo, while she was servicing a client. At the same time last Thursday, nearby flats were raided and another 32 immigrant sex workers arrested. None has been charged with any criminal offence but three Albanian women and one Thai woman have already been deported. The rest have all made asylum claims.</p> <p>Judy, Irina's maid and an ex-Soho prostitute herself, witnessed her forced departure, handcuffed and in tears, and is upset at the way the raid was carried out. \"It was police from the Clubs and Vice Unit who came and they are usually very good round here. They know all the girls and they leave us alone unless there's anyone underage working or a girl is being held against her will,\" she says.</p> <p>Twenty-two of the women removed are Kosovan, the rest are Albanian, Moldovan, Iraqi, Thai, Russian and Belarussian. Police say the swoop - the biggest ever in the sex industry's internationally famous square mile - was the culmination of months of intelligence gathering, but Judy laughs at that. \"They have known some of these girls for years because they visit us regularly to check that everything is OK. I don't think this raid was down to them, it's not their style. This was an immigration job.\"</p> <p>Soho has always been about sex - reports of copulation for sale here date back to the 17th century - but it is only in the past four years that women from overseas have begun to appear on the scene in significant numbers. Now between 50 and 75% of sex workers in the area are from abroad and Judy is angry about the media spin that paints them as sex slaves trafficked into the UK kicking and screaming - \"slave trade in vice girls\" as London's Evening Standard newspaper put it.</p> <p>\"Yes, there have been one or two who were here against their will,\" Judy admits, \"but by and large we got rid of the pimps for them, threatened we'd shop them to the police if they didn't clear off.\"</p> <p>She will miss the women who have gone, she says. \"Soho is quite small and everyone knows everyone. We all used to meet for breakfast and talk through our problems. It's not a perfect lifestyle here and I don't mean to make it sound cosier than it really is but we did all support each other. It was a bit like a little union really.\"</p> <p>Judy says a lot of the women were asylum seekers, some with babies and young children. \"They were starving while they waited for their vouchers to come through and, like Irina, they ended up here because they didn't know any other way to make money to feed themselves and their kids. They didn't have drug problems like some of the English girls - they didn't even drink - and they sent hundreds of pounds home to their families.\"</p> <p>While there is evidence that hard-core traffickers who force refugee women into prostitution have gained a foothold in other European countries such as Germany, the women who were raided in Soho support Judy's assertion that they were not coerced. Yes, many of them paid a trafficker to smuggle them into the UK and, yes, most started to sell sex reluctantly because there were few other options open to them, but there is no hard evidence to support the sex slaves banner headlines. Nor is there much sign of their alleged slave masters - only women were seized in the raids.</p> <p>It is unlikely a true picture will ever emerge of just how much or how little coercion was involved in bringing these women to Soho and the raids have put the police in a difficult position. The low-key approach previously adopted by the Metropolitan Police's Clubs and Vice Unit allowed its officers to gather intelligence about the circumstances of the foreign women in the Soho flats, and the women and their maids viewed the police with a degree of trust.</p> <p>Scotland Yard admits this raid was not the usual \"softly, softly\" style of the Clubs and Vice Unit. But according to chief inspector Chris Bradford: \"Any other predators out there realise that they [the prostitutes] haven't gone to the police, they've been deported by the police, so it gives them a cover story, a little bit of protection.\"</p> <p>Carrie Mitchell of the English Collective of Prostitutes has little time for this explanation of the raids. \"If the women are victims, then they need support and resources, not deportation,\" she says. \"But the women are not working for pimps or traffickers; they have found a safer, more independent way of working. This crackdown will force many women out on to the streets, where evidence shows it's ten times as dangerous to work.\"</p> <p>Michelle Farley of Sexual Health On Call, an agency that encourages prostitutes to look after their health and practise safe sex, is concerned that the women will now go further underground. \"It has taken a long time for us to build up trust with some of these women, particularly the eastern European ones,\" she points out, \"but in the past year they have been coming to the clinics. If they stop accessing healthcare, they put at risk not only themselves but also the men who use their services and the men's partners.\"</p> <p>Julie Bindel is an academic from North London University who is researching trafficking. \"These women are some of the most disenfranchised you're ever likely to meet,\" she says. \"The occupational hazards of their job are rape, murder and HIV, and with no documents, they're not likely to walk into a police station and report any problems.</p> <p>\"I don't think the dramatic language about a modern-day slave trade is helpful. It obscures the real issues about why so many men are choosing to use foreign women for sex.

      "bodyText": "The flat in Soho's Frith Street has been empty for a few hours, since police and immigration officers marched in and pulled out Irina, a prostitute from Kosovo, while she was servicing a client. At the same time last Thursday, nearby flats were raided and another 32 immigrant sex workers arrested. None has been charged with any criminal offence but three Albanian women and one Thai woman have already been deported. The rest have all made asylum claims. Judy, Irina's maid and an ex-Soho prostitute herself, witnessed her forced departure, handcuffed and in tears, and is upset at the way the raid was carried out. \"It was police from the Clubs and Vice Unit who came and they are usually very good round here. They know all the girls and they leave us alone unless there's anyone underage working or a girl is being held against her will,\" she says. Twenty-two of the women removed are Kosovan, the rest are Albanian, Moldovan, Iraqi, Thai, Russian and Belarussian. Police say the swoop - the biggest ever in the sex industry's internationally famous square mile - was the culmination of months of intelligence gathering, but Judy laughs at that. \"They have known some of these girls for years because they visit us regularly to check that everything is OK. I don't think this raid was down to them, it's not their style. This was an immigration job.\" Soho has always been about sex - reports of copulation for sale here date back to the 17th century - but it is only in the past four years that women from overseas have begun to appear on the scene in significant numbers. Now between 50 and 75% of sex workers in the area are from abroad and Judy is angry about the media spin that paints them as sex slaves trafficked into the UK kicking and screaming - \"slave trade in vice girls\" as London's Evening Standard newspaper put it. \"Yes, there have been one or two who were here against their will,\" Judy admits, \"but by and large we got rid of the pimps for them, threatened we'd shop them to the police if they didn't clear off.\" She will miss the women who have gone, she says. \"Soho is quite small and everyone knows everyone. We all used to meet for breakfast and talk through our problems. It's not a perfect lifestyle here and I don't mean to make it sound cosier than it really is but we did all support each other. It was a bit like a little union really.\" Judy says a lot of the women were asylum seekers, some with babies and young children. \"They were starving while they waited for their vouchers to come through and, like Irina, they ended up here because they didn't know any other way to make money to feed themselves and their kids. They didn't have drug problems like some of the English girls - they didn't even drink - and they sent hundreds of pounds home to their families.\" While there is evidence that hard-core traffickers who force refugee women into prostitution have gained a foothold in other European countries such as Germany, the women who were raided in Soho support Judy's assertion that they were not coerced. Yes, many of them paid a trafficker to smuggle them into the UK and, yes, most started to sell sex reluctantly because there were few other options open to them, but there is no hard evidence to support the sex slaves banner headlines. Nor is there much sign of their alleged slave masters - only women were seized in the raids. It is unlikely a true picture will ever emerge of just how much or how little coercion was involved in bringing these women to Soho and the raids have put the police in a difficult position. The low-key approach previously adopted by the Metropolitan Police's Clubs and Vice Unit allowed its officers to gather intelligence about the circumstances of the foreign women in the Soho flats, and the women and their maids viewed the police with a degree of trust. Scotland Yard admits this raid was not the usual \"softly, softly\" style of the Clubs and Vice Unit. But according to chief inspector Chris Bradford: \"Any other predators out there realise that they [the prostitutes] haven't gone to the police, they've been deported by the police, so it gives them a cover story, a little bit of protection.\" Carrie Mitchell of the English Collective of Prostitutes has little time for this explanation of the raids. \"If the women are victims, then they need support and resources, not deportation,\" she says. \"But the women are not working for pimps or traffickers; they have found a safer, more independent way of working. This crackdown will force many women out on to the streets, where evidence shows it's ten times as dangerous to work.\" Michelle Farley of Sexual Health On Call, an agency that encourages prostitutes to look after their health and practise safe sex, is concerned that the women will now go further underground. \"It has taken a long time for us to build up trust with some of these women, particularly the eastern European ones,\" she points out, \"but in the past year they have been coming to the clinics. If they stop accessing healthcare, they put at risk not only themselves but also the men who use their services and the men's partners.\" Julie Bindel is an academic from North London University who is researching trafficking. \"These women are some of the most disenfranchised you're ever likely to meet,\" she says. \"The occupational hazards of their job are rape, murder and HIV, and with no documents, they're not likely to walk into a police station and report any problems. \"I don't think the dramatic language about a modern-day slave trade is helpful. It obscures the real issues about why so many men are choosing to use foreign women for sex. We hear stories of women being trafficked from Romania to Cambodia because the men there want white women, and from Cambodia to Thailand because the men there want black women. These men want a woman who couldn't be their sister, daughter or mother because it dehumanises them.\" Judy is changing the sheets on Irina's bed, ready for a new tenant.

      "bodyText": "Russian wildlife experts are concerned that the tiny surviving population of the Amur leopard - one of the world's most endangered species - may be devastated by the harshest winter to hit the country's far east for 70 years. They fear that there are no more than 25 or 30 of the subspecies left, most of them in the forests around Vladivostok. Local protection groups say it is in immediate danger of extinction. The leopard has evolved to cope with the Russian winter: it has long legs to help it walk through the snow and a reddish-yellow coat which grows 7cm thick towards the end of autumn. But experts are afraid that the surviving few may starve because huge numbers of deer, hares and badgers, on which it feeds, died when the temperature dropped to minus 60C. Intense poverty on Russia's eastern flank has hampered protection efforts. Despite anti-poaching campaigns local hunters persist in killing both the leopard and the threatened Amur tiger. The Amur skin, with its distinctive colour and unusually large spots, is coveted by international fur traders. The skeleton is smuggled across the Chinese border for use in traditional medicines. Although the law prescribes strict penalties for killing leopards, prosecutions are rare. Local judges appear to sympathise with the hunters, who see the leopard as an expensive threat to the livestock on which they depend. The region is also becoming popular with rich Russians as a venue for licensed hunting. Even killing permitted animals like boar threatens the leopard by reducing its food supplies. A UN Development Programme project to cultivate the nearby Tymangan basin as a commercial centre has caused alarm, because it would further diminish the dwindling strip of land where the surviving leopards live. \"This is the biggest and most beautiful of all leopards, but the situation it is in at the moment is catastrophic,\" said Maria Vorontsova, of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, which sponsors an anti-poaching project.",

      "bodyText": "The United States says it is looking for new ways to punish Robert Mugabe following government threats to the lives of Zimbabwe's leading judges and the expulsion of two foreign journalists, including a BBC correspondent. Washington said it was consulting key allies, including Britain, to coordinate measures to get the government to halt its increasingly violent campaign against opponents and what appear to be the first steps toward barring the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, from running for president on trumped up charges of inciting revolution. The US has already cut a large proportion of its aid since Mr Mugabe encouraged supporters to occupy white-owned farms and ignored his supreme court's ruling that the land invasions were illegal. Britain joined in the international condemnation of the expulsion orders issued against a BBC reporter, Joseph Winter, and Mercedes Sayagues, a reporter for the Guardian's sister paper in South Africa, the Mail and Guardian. Zimbabwe's high commissioner, Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, was called to the Foreign Office to hear a minister, Brian Wilson, protest at the expulsions, the harassment of judges, and the recent bombing that wrecked the presses of Harare's Daily News. \"A free press and independent judiciary are essential parts of any democratic society,\" Mr Wilson said.\" Expelling journalists cannot prevent the world from seeing what is happening in Zimbabwe or anywhere else.\" President Mugabe's reaction to such protests came in an address to foreign diplomats assembled at State House in Harare: \"We are still the subject of malicious propaganda by external forces opposed to the land reform programme,\" he told them. \"This is affecting our image abroad.\" Mr Winter flew to Johannesburg yesterday after a raid on his home late Sunday night by men presumed to be government supporters forced him and his family to seek shelter at the British high commission. He and Ms Sayagues had won a high court order letting them stay until the end of the week to settle their affairs, but the BBC correspondent said he had decided to leave quickly, fearing for his wife and two-year-old daughter: \"There is just too much pressure and harassment, and it's not fair for them to go through it.\" The information minister, Jonathan Moyo, who ordered the reporters out, refused to accept the extension and said he did not recognise the court's authority. He has hinted that all foreign journalists will have to leave before long. But confusingly, a senior BBC TV reporter and camera team from Johannesburg were allowed into Zimbabwe yesterday and given accreditation \"until new regulations come into force\". The information minister faces problems of his own: the Ford Foundation filed a lawsuit in Nairobi yesterday accusing him of embezzling $80,000 (then worth \u00a351,600) when he worked for the charity for four years up to 1997. Mr Moyo, who described the charges as \"scurrilous accusations\", says he in turn is suing the Ford Foundation, accusing it of \"misrepresenting a research project\" in which he participated. In a further move to intimidate or drive out white Zimbabweans, the government says it will tighten laws barring dual citizenship. About 20,000 people in Zimbabwe are believed to hold British passports. Many also hold Zimbabwean citizenship without revealing their British status to the Harare administration. The current law technically bars dual citizenship, but the supreme court has ruled this impractical because no provision was made for renunciation of citizenship. The new laws are also going to strip anyone who remains out of the country for five years of their Zimbabwean nationality. \"There are concerns that those with dual citizenship are behind efforts to discredit the government,\" an official said.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Eurotunnel called on the British and French governments yesterday to take action to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into Britain through the Channel tunnel, claiming that the numbers were disrupting journeys. </p> <p>The company said that a \"daily flow\" of 150 asylum seekers from the French side was causing considerable delays and inconvenience to scheduled services. Numbers have been escalating since the beginning of the year. </p> <p>Patrick Ponsolle, the outgoing chairman, said that after making \"multiple and repeated efforts to prevent or limit the consequences of these intrusions,\" Eurotunnel had no option but to turn to the authorities in London and Paris. </p> <p>Mr Ponsolle said: \"We very much hope that the British and French authorities will themselves take the necessary measures to curtail this phenomenon as a matter of urgency.\" </p> <p>In January, the Guardian disclosed that Eurotunnel was discreetly lobbying the government to change the system under which fines are imposed on transport companies found to be carrying asylum seekers. </p> <p>The company has made approaches to immigration minister Barbara Roche as well as south coast MPs including the Conservative former home secretary, Michael Howard. </p> <p>Yesterday a Eurotunnel spokesman said security measures had been tightened and \u00a32m had been spent on improved inspection methods. Last year an estimated 5,500 people attempted to stow away on freight trains. </p> <p>The refugees, many from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, wait at the Calais terminal for lorries to park. When detected, they are sent to a Red Cross holding centre at Sangatte, not far from the entrance to the Channel tunnel. Eurotunnel claims that they are \"back again the next day\". </p> <p>Isnardo Gheza, Eurotunnel's customer services officer, said that security was so bad on the Brussels service that delays were frequent. \"Sometimes the 'immigrants' do not leave the train and make a fuss so the service is stopped,\" he said. </p> <p>He said that there were many problems on the Paris-Lille service because passenger numbers were always checked. </p> <p>The French have agreed to a request from Tony Blair to allow more British immigration officials to operate on Eurostar trains from Paris to London Waterloo. </p> <p>Mr Ponsolle, who has been chairman of the debt-laden company since 1994, will be leaving in April for a job in an unrelated sector. He will be succeeded by Charles Mackay, deputy chairman, while Philip Lazare will take day-to-day control as chief executive. </p> <p>Full year operating losses have been reduced from \u00a3139m to \u00a3124m, mainly due to lower costs and a greater number of lorries using the shuttle. Higher prices and strong freight traffic growth helped fill the revenue vacuum left by the abolition of duty free sales. </p> <p>Operating revenues in the year up to December 31 slipped 5% to \u00a3580m. Before interest charges, operating profits rose 2% to \u00a3208m, al though they fell by 2% after foreign exchange fluctuations. </p> <p>Mr Ponsolle said that the results showed that within 18 months, the company had succeeded in compensating for the substantial loss of duty free sales. During the second half of the year, Eurotunnel also achieved more than 100% interest cover for the first time. </p> <p>\"For the first time, the tunnel is paying for the tunnel,\" Mr Ponsolle said. \"Overall, our 2000 performance gives us confidence in our ability to meet the objective we set a year ago: to cover by 2002 not only our financial charges but also the capital investment costs from our operating cashflow.\" </p> <p>Long term, he said, completion of the first stage of a Folkestone to London high-speed rail link, planned for 2003, should lift revenues. </p> <p>\"Growth in our shuttle revenues of 7% to 8%, together with stable operating costs, would be enough to generate double digit growth of operating profit.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eurotunnel called on the British and French governments yesterday to take action to stem the flow of illegal immigrants into Britain through the Channel tunnel, claiming that the numbers were disrupting journeys. The company said that a \"daily flow\" of 150 asylum seekers from the French side was causing considerable delays and inconvenience to scheduled services. Numbers have been escalating since the beginning of the year. Patrick Ponsolle, the outgoing chairman, said that after making \"multiple and repeated efforts to prevent or limit the consequences of these intrusions,\" Eurotunnel had no option but to turn to the authorities in London and Paris. Mr Ponsolle said: \"We very much hope that the British and French authorities will themselves take the necessary measures to curtail this phenomenon as a matter of urgency.\" In January, the Guardian disclosed that Eurotunnel was discreetly lobbying the government to change the system under which fines are imposed on transport companies found to be carrying asylum seekers. The company has made approaches to immigration minister Barbara Roche as well as south coast MPs including the Conservative former home secretary, Michael Howard. Yesterday a Eurotunnel spokesman said security measures had been tightened and \u00a32m had been spent on improved inspection methods. Last year an estimated 5,500 people attempted to stow away on freight trains. The refugees, many from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, wait at the Calais terminal for lorries to park. When detected, they are sent to a Red Cross holding centre at Sangatte, not far from the entrance to the Channel tunnel. Eurotunnel claims that they are \"back again the next day\". Isnardo Gheza, Eurotunnel's customer services officer, said that security was so bad on the Brussels service that delays were frequent. \"Sometimes the 'immigrants' do not leave the train and make a fuss so the service is stopped,\" he said. He said that there were many problems on the Paris-Lille service because passenger numbers were always checked. The French have agreed to a request from Tony Blair to allow more British immigration officials to operate on Eurostar trains from Paris to London Waterloo. Mr Ponsolle, who has been chairman of the debt-laden company since 1994, will be leaving in April for a job in an unrelated sector. He will be succeeded by Charles Mackay, deputy chairman, while Philip Lazare will take day-to-day control as chief executive. Full year operating losses have been reduced from \u00a3139m to \u00a3124m, mainly due to lower costs and a greater number of lorries using the shuttle. Higher prices and strong freight traffic growth helped fill the revenue vacuum left by the abolition of duty free sales. Operating revenues in the year up to December 31 slipped 5% to \u00a3580m. Before interest charges, operating profits rose 2% to \u00a3208m, al though they fell by 2% after foreign exchange fluctuations. Mr Ponsolle said that the results showed that within 18 months, the company had succeeded in compensating for the substantial loss of duty free sales. During the second half of the year, Eurotunnel also achieved more than 100% interest cover for the first time. \"For the first time, the tunnel is paying for the tunnel,\" Mr Ponsolle said. \"Overall, our 2000 performance gives us confidence in our ability to meet the objective we set a year ago: to cover by 2002 not only our financial charges but also the capital investment costs from our operating cashflow.\" Long term, he said, completion of the first stage of a Folkestone to London high-speed rail link, planned for 2003, should lift revenues. \"Growth in our shuttle revenues of 7% to 8%, together with stable operating costs, would be enough to generate double digit growth of operating profit.\"",

      "body": "<p>The 900 refugees whose ship was beached on the French Riviera at the weekend are the visible tip of a much larger exodus fleeing harassment by Saddam Hussein, Kurdish sources said yesterday.</p> <p>\"People are continuously fleeing,\" Mahmoud Osman, a Kurdish leader based in London said. \"The arrival of the refugees in France should send a very strong message to Europe that as long as Saddam is there people will leave.</p> <p>He added: \"Every Kurd I know wants the no-fly zone in northern Iraq to stay, though at present it doesn't give adequate protection.\"</p> <p>The 250 men, 180 women and 480 children who arrived in Fr\u00e9jus on Saturday claim to come from the Mosul area of Iraq where they were protected, in theory, by British and American air patrols north of the 36th parallel.</p> <p>The area, however, is just south and west of the territories controlled by two rival - and effectively autonomous - Kurdish factions, the Kurdish Democratic party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).</p> <p>Salih Azad, a Kurdish speaker who was called in by the French government to interview the refugees, said they had fled because their village had been devastated.</p> <p>\"Many of them are house-owners and had had their property seized by Saddam because they are Kurds and Yazidites - in other words, not Muslim. They all thought they were heading for Italy.</p> <p>\"Some told me of throat-slittings and torture. They all say there is not enough to eat there. Even the babies are deprived of food. They could no longer live where they were.\"</p> <p>Mr Azad, who himself came to France as a refugee, said they paid $300 (\u00a3210) to get to the Turkish border, and then $2,000 to $3,000 (\u00a31,400 to \u00a32,100) to be ferried out to the ship moored off a beach in eastern Turkey.</p> <p>\"This shows once more the desperate state of the Kurdish people. In northern Iraq, some 4,000 of their villages have been destroyed or are completely cut off from the rest of the country,\" he said.</p> <p>The Kurdish areas of northern Iraq have long been in conflict with the Baghdad regime. In 1988 Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to attack the Kurdish town of Halabjah, killing thousands of people.</p> <p>In 1991, following the Gulf war, rebellions broke out in both northern and southern Iraq and many Kurds fled their homes in the north as Iraqi forces sought to reassert control.</p> <p>UN security council resolution 688, passed in April 1991, called on Iraq to end repression of its civilian population, and the US declared a no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel to protect the KDP and PUK areas. Ground forces also gave temporary assistance to the Kurds under Operation Provide Comfort.</p> <p>The no-fly zone covers only about two-thirds of the Kurdish areas, leaving large parts - such as Kirkuk - under Iraqi control on the ground. After 1991, the Baghdad government held on to the main oil fields around Kirkuk and Mosul and since then has pursued a policy of moving in Arab families from further south, displacing the resident, and unprotected, Kurds. Iraqi influence also penetrates the Kurdish areas which have autonomy.</p> <p>\"Iraqi spies come in and go out,\" Mr Osman said. \"Relations between the Kurdish parties also allow infiltration, so the Iraqis are still active here and there. There are some skirmishes, but Saddam can't bring in his army or shell people with artillery as he did before.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, the KDP said that gunmen with automatic weapons had killed Francois Hariri, a former governor of Irbil. Hariri, who was the KDP's governor until last year, was attacked in his car in the Kurdish-controlled city on Sunday, the party said. It was not clear if Iraqi forces were to blame.</p> <p>If western air patrols provide incomplete protection they do, in the eyes of many Kurds, fulfil a useful role.</p> <p>Last December, according to the Foreign Office, Iraqi troops surrounded the Kurdish village of Ba'edra, near Dohuk, but were driven back by the combined efforts of KDP fighters on the ground and US-British patrols in the air.</p> <p>Many of the Kurdish refugees who make their way to Europe come, originally, from outside the protected area.</p> <p>\"Some are ousted from Kirkuk and the Arabised areas under Iraqi control,\" Mr Osman said. \"But when they come to the so-called liberated areas they can't find homes or jobs. There is 85% unemployment in Kurdistan.

      "bodyText": "The 900 refugees whose ship was beached on the French Riviera at the weekend are the visible tip of a much larger exodus fleeing harassment by Saddam Hussein, Kurdish sources said yesterday. \"People are continuously fleeing,\" Mahmoud Osman, a Kurdish leader based in London said. \"The arrival of the refugees in France should send a very strong message to Europe that as long as Saddam is there people will leave. He added: \"Every Kurd I know wants the no-fly zone in northern Iraq to stay, though at present it doesn't give adequate protection.\" The 250 men, 180 women and 480 children who arrived in Fr\u00e9jus on Saturday claim to come from the Mosul area of Iraq where they were protected, in theory, by British and American air patrols north of the 36th parallel. The area, however, is just south and west of the territories controlled by two rival - and effectively autonomous - Kurdish factions, the Kurdish Democratic party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). Salih Azad, a Kurdish speaker who was called in by the French government to interview the refugees, said they had fled because their village had been devastated. \"Many of them are house-owners and had had their property seized by Saddam because they are Kurds and Yazidites - in other words, not Muslim. They all thought they were heading for Italy. \"Some told me of throat-slittings and torture. They all say there is not enough to eat there. Even the babies are deprived of food. They could no longer live where they were.\" Mr Azad, who himself came to France as a refugee, said they paid $300 (\u00a3210) to get to the Turkish border, and then $2,000 to $3,000 (\u00a31,400 to \u00a32,100) to be ferried out to the ship moored off a beach in eastern Turkey. \"This shows once more the desperate state of the Kurdish people. In northern Iraq, some 4,000 of their villages have been destroyed or are completely cut off from the rest of the country,\" he said. The Kurdish areas of northern Iraq have long been in conflict with the Baghdad regime. In 1988 Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons to attack the Kurdish town of Halabjah, killing thousands of people. In 1991, following the Gulf war, rebellions broke out in both northern and southern Iraq and many Kurds fled their homes in the north as Iraqi forces sought to reassert control. UN security council resolution 688, passed in April 1991, called on Iraq to end repression of its civilian population, and the US declared a no-fly zone north of the 36th parallel to protect the KDP and PUK areas. Ground forces also gave temporary assistance to the Kurds under Operation Provide Comfort. The no-fly zone covers only about two-thirds of the Kurdish areas, leaving large parts - such as Kirkuk - under Iraqi control on the ground. After 1991, the Baghdad government held on to the main oil fields around Kirkuk and Mosul and since then has pursued a policy of moving in Arab families from further south, displacing the resident, and unprotected, Kurds. Iraqi influence also penetrates the Kurdish areas which have autonomy. \"Iraqi spies come in and go out,\" Mr Osman said. \"Relations between the Kurdish parties also allow infiltration, so the Iraqis are still active here and there. There are some skirmishes, but Saddam can't bring in his army or shell people with artillery as he did before.\" Yesterday, the KDP said that gunmen with automatic weapons had killed Francois Hariri, a former governor of Irbil. Hariri, who was the KDP's governor until last year, was attacked in his car in the Kurdish-controlled city on Sunday, the party said. It was not clear if Iraqi forces were to blame. If western air patrols provide incomplete protection they do, in the eyes of many Kurds, fulfil a useful role. Last December, according to the Foreign Office, Iraqi troops surrounded the Kurdish village of Ba'edra, near Dohuk, but were driven back by the combined efforts of KDP fighters on the ground and US-British patrols in the air. Many of the Kurdish refugees who make their way to Europe come, originally, from outside the protected area. \"Some are ousted from Kirkuk and the Arabised areas under Iraqi control,\" Mr Osman said. \"But when they come to the so-called liberated areas they can't find homes or jobs. There is 85% unemployment in Kurdistan. These people, when they come out, want to stay in Europe and help their families.\" The northern no-fly zone, officially known as Operation Northern Watch, is enforced from Incirlik air base in Turkey with about 45 US and British aircraft and more than 1,400 support personnel. In the most recent incident, on February 12, Iraq fired at patrolling aircraft from sites north of Mosul. The western aircraft responded by attacking Iraq's air defence system. Amid international criticism of the no-fly zones following Friday's US-British attacks on radar stations around Baghdad, the arrival of so many Kurdish refugees has highlighted the other side of the argument.

The tense stand-off that developed during visiting day on Sunday and spread rapidly to other prisons throughout the country - resulting in the death of 12 inmates, including three at Carandiru - underlined the chaotic state of Brazil's prison system.</p> <p>Yesterday, as politicians debated the scale of the uprisings and the speed with which they spread, questions were being asked about whether the degree of independence given to prisoners had reached disturbing new levels.</p> <p>The events have underlined the absolute lack of authority within the prison system, where even at the best of times the prisoners run the show.</p> <p>\"Brazil differs from other countries in that here there is a very significant degree of control by the prisoners themselves,\" said James Cavallaro, of the human rights monitor Global Justice. \"The only way to guarantee security is to let the prisoners make their own rules.\"</p> <p>Prisoners took several thousand hostages on Sunday to protest about the transfer of five prisoners last week. Receiving messages on mobile phones, inmates at 28 other prisons started simultaneous uprisings throughout Sao Paulo state. In addition to the deaths, four police officers received bullet wounds. There was relief that the death toll was so low.

      "bodyText": "Armed police last night ended the largest uprising in Brazilian penal history when they persuaded inmates at Carandiru prison, one of the most bizarre and unruly jails in the world, to release thousands of hostages, including hundreds of children. The officers negotiated entry to the pavilions at the notorious Sao Paulo jail, the most crowded in Latin America, where last night they were supervising cell-to-cell searches carried out by independent prison staff. The tense stand-off that developed during visiting day on Sunday and spread rapidly to other prisons throughout the country - resulting in the death of 12 inmates, including three at Carandiru - underlined the chaotic state of Brazil's prison system. Yesterday, as politicians debated the scale of the uprisings and the speed with which they spread, questions were being asked about whether the degree of independence given to prisoners had reached disturbing new levels. The events have underlined the absolute lack of authority within the prison system, where even at the best of times the prisoners run the show. \"Brazil differs from other countries in that here there is a very significant degree of control by the prisoners themselves,\" said James Cavallaro, of the human rights monitor Global Justice. \"The only way to guarantee security is to let the prisoners make their own rules.\" Prisoners took several thousand hostages on Sunday to protest about the transfer of five prisoners last week. Receiving messages on mobile phones, inmates at 28 other prisons started simultaneous uprisings throughout Sao Paulo state. In addition to the deaths, four police officers received bullet wounds. There was relief that the death toll was so low. In 1992, riot police stormed a rebellion at Carandiru and killed 111 people. In Carandiru, where 7,200 men live in space designed for a third that amount, there is only one guard for every 100 prisoners. The result has been the emergence of an alternative society based on privileges and staff corruption. As soon as they arrive, prisoners are made to \"rent\" the cells they live in and must bargain favours to improve their living conditions. Sometimes prisoners who have done their time must continue paying \"rent arrears\" from outside the jail. There is a strict hierarchy and violent code of discipline for those who are seen to break it. Deaths and punishment beatings are common. Mobile phones Light was first shed on life within the prison in Carandiru Station, written by the Aids doctor Drauzio Varella. The book became an unexpected hit in 1999, selling 165,000 copies. Dr Varella explained how it is sociably acceptable for a macho prisoner to \"marry\" a transvestite prisoner and keep \"her\" domesticated in his cell, if he can afford to keep \"her\" well. During the day, all prisoners can circulate more or less freely within each pavilion provided they are not part of the 10% imprisoned in the prisoners' own prison (called the Yellow, the colour of these inmates' skin since they rarely see sunlight). Certain privileges can get you almost whatever you want in Carandiru: drugs, mobile phones, fridges, TVs, stereos, cigarettes and alcohol. Armando Tambelli, of the Sao Paulo prison chaplaincy, estimates that 80% of prisoners take drugs and that there are at least 200 mobile phones, probably many more. The advent of mobile phones in prisons has meant that prisoners can communicate with those in other jails. It is believed that this made possible the simultaneous protests that spread throughout Sao Paulo state's prisons on Sunday. The blame for the rebellions has been given to the Capital's First Command, one of the many networks of prisoners linked to drug gangs.

On the other hand, Mr Bush clearly made an effort to assemble the most diverse cabinet of any Republican president in history, including two blacks, four women, two Asian-Americans (one a Democrat), a Cuban-American and an Arab-American. Colin Powell, as secretary of state, became the most powerful African American in US history, alongside the most powerful black woman ever, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser. Characteristically of the new president, outward appearances belied the policy substance beneath. His cabinet may reflect the country's ethnic diversity, but they are almost all conservative on the issues closest to the collective heart of the American right. Mr Bush is choosing his battles in line with a pared-down but still aggressively partisan strategy. The keystone of that strategy was presented earlier this month, in the form of a $1,600bn (\u00a31,100bn) tax-cut which will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest members of US society. Mr Bush also proposes to abolish inheritance tax, which affects only the top 2% of people with estates worth more than $675,000. If approved by Congress the measures will reverse the redistributive steps taken by the Clinton administration and further widen the already huge gap between haves and have-nots. His tax policy represents a policy of making no concessions to the Democrats, as do Mr Bush's and Mr Rumsfeld's plans to pursue a scaled-up national missile defence system in the face of grave doubts about its affordability and feasibility in Congress and among US allies. The NMD is an article of faith among military conservatives. The exception to the rule has been Mr Bush's policy in education, a field in which there is already a high degree of consensus on the need for new thinking and greater accountability. Mr Bush won support from Democrats with his concern about the progress of schools in the poorest areas. Furthermore he signalled that he was ready to compromise on his controversial conservative advocacy of a voucher-based education scheme. It was a compromise in an argument Mr Bush knew he was likely to lose. It also won him room for manoeuvre on issues which are more central to his agenda, and in particular the redistribution of income towards the nation's wealthiest citizens. Long after the charm has faded, that redistribution may prove to be this presidency's most abiding legacy.",

      "body": "<p>How the mighty fall. <strong> Vodafone</strong> was stripped of the title of Europe's biggest company yesterday as investors started to worry about its debt position. </p> <p>Vodafone, which saw it shares price slip below 200p for the first time in two years, saw the title taken by <strong> BP</strong>, up 13p to 580p. At the height of the dot.com boom last year, Vodafone shares were changing hands for 400p. </p> <p>The unprecedented concern about Vodafone's debt centres on the sale of Infostrada, its fixed-line Italian telecoms subsidiary, to electricity firm Enel. The deal was supposed to bring \u00a37bn into Vodafone coffers, leave it with debt of about \u00a310bn at its fiscal year-end in March and confirm it as the company with the strongest balance sheet in the industry. </p> <p>All that now hangs in the balance. On Friday, Vodafone warned that demands by Italy's competition authorities could derail the deal. It seems they want Enel to cut its electricity production by 25% as a condition for allowing the sale to progress. </p> <p>If the deal is pulled, Vodafone's debt will total \u00a317bn at the fiscal year-end.

      "bodyText": "How the mighty fall. Vodafone was stripped of the title of Europe's biggest company yesterday as investors started to worry about its debt position. Vodafone, which saw it shares price slip below 200p for the first time in two years, saw the title taken by BP, up 13p to 580p. At the height of the dot.com boom last year, Vodafone shares were changing hands for 400p. The unprecedented concern about Vodafone's debt centres on the sale of Infostrada, its fixed-line Italian telecoms subsidiary, to electricity firm Enel. The deal was supposed to bring \u00a37bn into Vodafone coffers, leave it with debt of about \u00a310bn at its fiscal year-end in March and confirm it as the company with the strongest balance sheet in the industry. All that now hangs in the balance. On Friday, Vodafone warned that demands by Italy's competition authorities could derail the deal. It seems they want Enel to cut its electricity production by 25% as a condition for allowing the sale to progress. If the deal is pulled, Vodafone's debt will total \u00a317bn at the fiscal year-end. Although Vodafone would not lose its cherished single-A credit rating, it would still be a blow. \"It is clearly possible that the Infostrada developments will slow the pace of Vodafone's M&amp;A drive in the short term ... or push the company to use equity rather than cash for future acquisitions, which would not be well received by investors,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said. The deal could be renegotiated but the prospect of a 25-40% reduction in the asking price failed to support Vodafone, which settled 6.5p lower at 198p. Investors were also given a clear illustration of why the London market is dependent on Wall Street for its direction. With US markets closed for the President's Day holiday, the FTSE 100 drifted aimlessly, trading in a range of just 37 points. Turnover, which normally reaches 1.7bn on a Monday, struggled to 1.5bn, with trading in Vodafone accounting for about 23% of that. Up to the closing bell it was unclear whether the blue chip index would end higher or lower as falling telecom shares ( Energis lost 21.5p to 454.5p and Spirent 17p to 428p) were offset by gains in the oil and drug sectors. In the end solid performances from GlaxoSmithKline, up 37p to \u00a319.20 ahead of tomorrow's full-year figures, and BP were just enough to push the FTSE 5.7 points higher to 6094. The FTSE Techmark 100, slipped 14.60 points to 2505.39 and the FTSE 250 eased 2.4 to 6716.80. AB Foods, maker of Twinings tea and Ryvita, topped the blue chip leaderboard, benefiting from its defensive qualities and a big push from its broker, WestLB Panmure. Following a meeting with the company, which goes into its quiet season soon, the German broker repeated its \"outperform\" rating and said it was happy with its full-year pre-tax profits forecast of \u00a3402m.

Galen Weston, the chairman of the Canadian company, is also a non-executive director of ABF and is a director of Wittington Investments, the family company which owns a controlling stake in ABF. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group, said that Bestfood Baking, a US-based business, no longer fitted its strategy of operating in fewer sectors with fewer brands. Patrick Cescau, the group's foods director said that Bestfood Baking was \"a very strong business that happens to fall outside of our foods strategy to focus on leading brands in core categories, such as Lipton, Knorr, Slim-Fast and Hellmann's\". Bestfood Baking, best known for its Entermann's sweet baked goods and Thomas' English muffins, has been up for sale ever since Unilever bought its parent company, Bestfoods, for \u00a316.8bn in October last year. Since that deal, Unilever has raised about \u20ac4bn (\u00a32.5bn) through a series of disposals including its European baking supplies business, the Elizabeth Arden cosmetics company, and a number of European soup and sauce operations. The price which Unilever got for Bestfood Baking was at the top end of analysts' expectations, reflecting interest from rivals bidders thought to include Sara Lee and Grupo Bimbo de Mexico. Bestfood Baking, which employs about 12,000 people at 19 plants in the US, last year made a profit before tax and interest of \u00a397m on sales of \u00a31.2bn. The acquisition of the company will double George Weston's US sales. The Canadian company already operates 23 bakery plants in the US and Canada and controls Canada's largest chain of supermarkets. Unilever yesterday played down reports that the company was interested in Clairol, the US hair products maker, which Bristol Myers Squibb has put up for sale with an estimated price tag of \u00a33.1bn.

Robert Tulloch, 17, and James Parker, 16, said to be all-American boys with a shared interest in theatre and rock climbing, were thought to have discussed the killing at school before going on the run. They were picked up after police listened to a citizens' band radio conversation between two truck drivers. One said he was giving a ride to two hitchhikers who said they were trying to get to California. Their arrest in New Castle, Indiana, nearly 2,000 miles short of their destination, ended a hunt which began after the murder three weeks ago of Half and Susanne Zantop, stabbed to death in their home in the town of Etna, five miles east of Hanover, New Hampshire. The couple had a reputation for keeping open house for students and colleagues. The police have not suggested a motive for the attack, and it is understood that the boys were linked to the crime by fingerprints and a knife bought on the internet. Mr Zantop, 62, was a professor of earth studies at Dartmouth College and Susanne, 55, the head of its German studies department. The accused boys had no connection with the University and had visited Hanover, 25 miles south of their home in Chelsea, Vermont, only to go to the cinema. The driver who picked them up after they abandoned the car in which they had been travelling had no idea that they were murder suspects. \"The truck driver had felt sorry for them because they were close in age to one of his own,\" Sergeant Bill Ward said in Indiana. Robert Sherman, a neighbour of the boys in Chelsea,which has a population of 1,300, said: \"I've known them most of their lives. My children went to high school with them and played sports with them. The whole community is in shock. \"They are very important members of this community. No one's invisible in this community. Everyone is part of a great big family. \"I imagine their families are going through hell. \"No one in America can explain why two good boys would do something horrible,\" he said. Kevin Ellis, a friend of the Parker family, said: \"James is a very bright kid and his father's an ace carpenter who built my house. I trust him with my life.\" Robert Tulloch was president of Chelsea high school student council last year. He intended to study overseas. \"He was supposed to go abroad, but he didn't go,\" Marilyn Childs, a speech coach at the school, said. \"I will tell you, this boy is brilliant. I deal with a lot of students and this boy was gifted.\"",

The code states: \"It will be for individual ministers to judge how best to act in order to uphold the highest standards. They are responsible for justifying their conduct to parliament.\"</p> <p>The question of a possible conflict of interest was first raised when Channel 4 and the Guardian revealed that Mr Meacher and his wife, Lucianne, were buying through property companies flats to rent out as investments, as well as owning three homes.</p> <p>In the 1980s Mr Meacher in a book attacked the use of property as a \"status symbol and an object of conspicuous consumption\".

      "bodyText": "Michael Meacher was last night embroiled in a new dispute over his ownership of up to 12 homes after he invoked a secrecy clause in the \"open government\" code to avoid answering a parliamentary question on the issue. Andrew Lansley, the shadow Cabinet Office spokesman, wrote to Tony Blair last night after the environment minister refused to tell parliament how he ensured there was no conflict of interest over his home purchases and his government policy role. Mr Meacher, while saying he believed there was no conflict of interest, insisted that he was not obliged to explain how he had resolved the issue with his permanent secretary, Sir Richard Mottram. The minister invoked part of John Major's access to government information code, and said that \"the handling of my personal interests\" was covered by a ban on the release of internal Whitehall documents. Mr Lansley has asked the prime minister to insist that Mr Meacher gives a detailed reply to parliament and has quoted the ministerial code which, he says, obliges the environment minister to give a full explanation. The code states: \"It will be for individual ministers to judge how best to act in order to uphold the highest standards. They are responsible for justifying their conduct to parliament.\" The question of a possible conflict of interest was first raised when Channel 4 and the Guardian revealed that Mr Meacher and his wife, Lucianne, were buying through property companies flats to rent out as investments, as well as owning three homes. In the 1980s Mr Meacher in a book attacked the use of property as a \"status symbol and an object of conspicuous consumption\". At a Labour conference meeting two years ago he condemned second home owners for \"robbing people of a home which is a basic right\". Yesterday the Department of the Environment defended Mr Meacher's decision not to reveal the information. A spokeswoman said that \"Sir Richard Mottram has been following the issue closely and is content that Mr Meacher has no conflict of interest\". The department also said the minister had been scrupulous in trying to get the best advice on how to deal with the situation.",

      "byline": "Hugo Young",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's shocking, but should not be surprising, that the lord chancellor has become a fundraiser for the Labour party. The revelation is a salutary delight. It cuts through pretences, explodes illusions and destroys the exquisite British paradox that has permitted the holder of the office to be a judge, an executive and a legislator all at once, without any one of these jobs being seen as in conflict with the others. Derry Irvine's \u00a3200-a-plate dinner - with a more \"significant contribution\" strongly advised on top - should be the beginning of the end for an office that cannot now be defended.</p> <p>This is more important than whether Lord Irvine himself stays in post, which he surely will until after the election. His lordship has done service to a truth he long denied. His deed illuminates what his words invariably bury. We learn definitively that the lord chancellorship is, above all, a political job. The politics comes first. Any danger that judicial impartiality might be compromised by the spectacle of him touting for political funds was plainly swept aside when the dinner was arranged. It wasn't even worth considering. That's where Irvine stands. It is a clarifying moment.</p> <p>He's not the first modern lord chancellor whose conduct raised a question about his multi-hatted role. Lord Hailsham was just as politically identified as Irvine, with an experience of elective politics that gave him more right to intervene in general controversy. Occasionally he used it. Irvine's predecessor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, presided over years of tension between the judiciary and the government, owing to his resolve to defend cabinet policy on public spending. In the minds of some judges, Mackay ranked among the most hated leaders his profession has ever had.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Hailsham and Mackay respected the paradox of their office. They did their best to avoid rubbing their political allegiance in. They understood that the appearance of impartiality was worth preserving. They didn't abuse the cardinal feature of the job, which is the way its judicial aspect confers unique authority on its political functions. That's where the chancellor's special magic comes from. They didn't purloin this to give more heft to party work, let alone to cadging for funds.</p> <p>Lord Irvine has been different. From the start, he operated not merely as lord chancellor but as general counsel to the prime minister: very close, available, trusted, and powerful across the field. He deserves credit for muscling through the Human Rights Act and imposing professional reform, though less for his sabotage of legal aid and his complicity in the curbing of jury trial.</p> <p>But the main thing wrong with Irvine has been his refusal to contemplate reform of his own job. Like any good advocate, when challenged he went straight on the attack. Far from all his jobs being in conflict, he claimed that each supported the integrity of the others. Far from being a threat to judicial independence, he, Derry Irvine, was its very embodiment and protector.</p> <p>Well before he became lord chancellor, agreement on this was less than universal. The great British paradox was fraying for want of credibility. Lord Steyn, a law lord, said the chancellor should cease to be head of the judiciary. Steyn and some other law lords withdrew from their own conflict of interest by declining any longer to take part in legislative work.</p> <p>Irvine himself was prevailed on not to sit as a judge in any case that involved the government, which cuts out human rights cases, devolution cases and much judicial review. In effect, he has ceased to be a functioning judge, while still claiming the highest salary both in the cabinet and the judiciary on the grounds that, as senior judge, he must maintain a proper differential over the lord chief justice.</p> <p>Despite this, he insists on being untouchable. While withdrawing from the judicial function, he demands that he must keep it. While becoming the most political lord chancellor in living memory, he insists he must be leader of the judiciary. While purporting to defend judicial impartiality, he puts the party political arm on lawyers whose careers he holds in his hands. While occupying a post that requires at least the appearance of standing aside from the government, he's proud of his role as executive minister, intimate political adviser and, now, money-raiser in chief from the richest profession in Britain.</p> <p>Of these conflicts, the most specific concerns his power of appointment. Single-handedly he can shuffle the senior judges, promote the appellate judges, appoint the lower judges and make or break every lawyer whose ambition stops at the circuit bench. What barrister, hoping to advance his claims, might not have been impressed by the desirability of responding positively to Derry's appeal for Labour funds? Who could fail to be struck by the redefinition of the judicial climate his begging letter appeared to authorise?</p> <p>This specific concern has a simple answer, which is to revert to the commitment Labour once made to hand judicial appointment to an independent commission, free of control by a member of the cabinet. Irvine, who supported this in opposition and rejected it in government, has now driven it far up the agenda for the next parliament. How else can the standing of the judiciary be maintained, after the present sole appointer has shown himself so indifferent to the impartiality that's the key to judicial standing in the first place?</p> <p>The general message is more telling. For the indifference is not particular but pervasive. The entire system of government finds it hard to grasp the meaning of impartiality. It simply cannot see the point. Revealing his constitutional illiteracy, Alastair Campbell said there was no difference between Irvine raising party money and Tony Blair doing the same thing. Where New Labour is concerned, normal proprieties are not meant to apply, not because they've ceased to be proper but because this inclusive government somehow transcends them. The new norm is New Labour by definition. Much the same rubric applied when Greg Dyke, despite having made a huge donation to the Labour party, was put in charge of that other bastion of impartiality, the BBC.</p> <p>Someone called lord chancellor could still survive. The law lords, after all, are overworked and undermanned. They need him as a judge. But he should not be head of the judiciary, so long as he's a minister. His political work should be handed to a ministry of justice, accountable in the Commons not the Lords, with the appointments commission as guardian of the judges. For centuries the paradox the office embodied, its sublime non-separation of powers, may have been sustainable.

      "bodyText": "It's shocking, but should not be surprising, that the lord chancellor has become a fundraiser for the Labour party. The revelation is a salutary delight. It cuts through pretences, explodes illusions and destroys the exquisite British paradox that has permitted the holder of the office to be a judge, an executive and a legislator all at once, without any one of these jobs being seen as in conflict with the others. Derry Irvine's \u00a3200-a-plate dinner - with a more \"significant contribution\" strongly advised on top - should be the beginning of the end for an office that cannot now be defended. This is more important than whether Lord Irvine himself stays in post, which he surely will until after the election. His lordship has done service to a truth he long denied. His deed illuminates what his words invariably bury. We learn definitively that the lord chancellorship is, above all, a political job. The politics comes first. Any danger that judicial impartiality might be compromised by the spectacle of him touting for political funds was plainly swept aside when the dinner was arranged. It wasn't even worth considering. That's where Irvine stands. It is a clarifying moment. He's not the first modern lord chancellor whose conduct raised a question about his multi-hatted role. Lord Hailsham was just as politically identified as Irvine, with an experience of elective politics that gave him more right to intervene in general controversy. Occasionally he used it. Irvine's predecessor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, presided over years of tension between the judiciary and the government, owing to his resolve to defend cabinet policy on public spending. In the minds of some judges, Mackay ranked among the most hated leaders his profession has ever had. Nonetheless, Hailsham and Mackay respected the paradox of their office. They did their best to avoid rubbing their political allegiance in. They understood that the appearance of impartiality was worth preserving. They didn't abuse the cardinal feature of the job, which is the way its judicial aspect confers unique authority on its political functions. That's where the chancellor's special magic comes from. They didn't purloin this to give more heft to party work, let alone to cadging for funds. Lord Irvine has been different. From the start, he operated not merely as lord chancellor but as general counsel to the prime minister: very close, available, trusted, and powerful across the field. He deserves credit for muscling through the Human Rights Act and imposing professional reform, though less for his sabotage of legal aid and his complicity in the curbing of jury trial. But the main thing wrong with Irvine has been his refusal to contemplate reform of his own job. Like any good advocate, when challenged he went straight on the attack. Far from all his jobs being in conflict, he claimed that each supported the integrity of the others. Far from being a threat to judicial independence, he, Derry Irvine, was its very embodiment and protector. Well before he became lord chancellor, agreement on this was less than universal. The great British paradox was fraying for want of credibility. Lord Steyn, a law lord, said the chancellor should cease to be head of the judiciary. Steyn and some other law lords withdrew from their own conflict of interest by declining any longer to take part in legislative work. Irvine himself was prevailed on not to sit as a judge in any case that involved the government, which cuts out human rights cases, devolution cases and much judicial review. In effect, he has ceased to be a functioning judge, while still claiming the highest salary both in the cabinet and the judiciary on the grounds that, as senior judge, he must maintain a proper differential over the lord chief justice. Despite this, he insists on being untouchable. While withdrawing from the judicial function, he demands that he must keep it. While becoming the most political lord chancellor in living memory, he insists he must be leader of the judiciary. While purporting to defend judicial impartiality, he puts the party political arm on lawyers whose careers he holds in his hands. While occupying a post that requires at least the appearance of standing aside from the government, he's proud of his role as executive minister, intimate political adviser and, now, money-raiser in chief from the richest profession in Britain. Of these conflicts, the most specific concerns his power of appointment. Single-handedly he can shuffle the senior judges, promote the appellate judges, appoint the lower judges and make or break every lawyer whose ambition stops at the circuit bench. What barrister, hoping to advance his claims, might not have been impressed by the desirability of responding positively to Derry's appeal for Labour funds? Who could fail to be struck by the redefinition of the judicial climate his begging letter appeared to authorise? This specific concern has a simple answer, which is to revert to the commitment Labour once made to hand judicial appointment to an independent commission, free of control by a member of the cabinet. Irvine, who supported this in opposition and rejected it in government, has now driven it far up the agenda for the next parliament. How else can the standing of the judiciary be maintained, after the present sole appointer has shown himself so indifferent to the impartiality that's the key to judicial standing in the first place? The general message is more telling. For the indifference is not particular but pervasive. The entire system of government finds it hard to grasp the meaning of impartiality. It simply cannot see the point. Revealing his constitutional illiteracy, Alastair Campbell said there was no difference between Irvine raising party money and Tony Blair doing the same thing. Where New Labour is concerned, normal proprieties are not meant to apply, not because they've ceased to be proper but because this inclusive government somehow transcends them. The new norm is New Labour by definition. Much the same rubric applied when Greg Dyke, despite having made a huge donation to the Labour party, was put in charge of that other bastion of impartiality, the BBC. Someone called lord chancellor could still survive. The law lords, after all, are overworked and undermanned. They need him as a judge. But he should not be head of the judiciary, so long as he's a minister. His political work should be handed to a ministry of justice, accountable in the Commons not the Lords, with the appointments commission as guardian of the judges. For centuries the paradox the office embodied, its sublime non-separation of powers, may have been sustainable. It falls to Lord Irvine to show with welcome crudity that this is no longer so. The new culture has no time for the old rules. It reminds me of what the US supreme court did to itself to get George Bush declared president. But unlike America, where the tainted court soldiers on, we have a remedy. The office, being putrefied, can be buried, with the incumbent in all his finery as first gravedigger. hugoyoung@compuserve.com Talk about it Should Lord Irvine resign?

      "body": "<p>The First Invention <a href=\"#one\">(1)</a> </p> <p>Imagine the time of my grandfather's grandfather, when the darkness was newly separated from the light. Society was only a shadowy image of what it would soon become. This was Mandragora before my invention and all that it set in motion. People spoke to one another, but their habits of thought were coarse. People lived in fear. Our forefathers farmed, but with great difficulty; a man used a sharp stick to dig a hole for each seed, and furrowed his fields by dragging his fingernails through them and picking out each small stone. Often a whole spring passed in preparing the ground, and families went hungry or died come winter. They had fire, but they had no candles, nor did they have proper looms - when a woman made cloth for her household, she wound the woof through each strand of warp, and tamped down each row of weaving with her fingers. It took so long to make a bolt of cloth that growing children went about in tatters because their mothers could not keep pace. Men knew how to count and keep tally, but they had no numbers bigger than twenty. Twenty acres was the size of Mandragora's largest farm (my grandfather's, which I cultivate still), and twenty sheep the size of its largest flock; what need had they to reckon the infinite? Men's faculties may have been as well developed as ours, but they spent so much effort scratching their existence from the soil that they had no time for ideas or contemplation. What sufficed sufficed; and however much men might have profited from introspection, their days were full of drudgery that kept it at bay. </p> <p>Such darkness persisted nigh unto the present day, and might nearly have persisted ever, had not a glimmering seed of an idea taken root in my mind and beckoned me out of the night. I wish it had been an idea of philosophical profundity, one that could explain to men where God resides or what happens to our essence after death, but it was only a workaday idea, the kind a farmer such as myself might have about his farming. Of all the events to set the process of history in motion, mine was a realization about my horse. Had I known then what terrors my invention would bring us along with its joys, perhaps I would have allowed the idea to drift off like a thousand other daydreams. I could not have envisioned myself, two winters later, spending these long nights writing in my barn, writing against what seems the inevitable outcome: that I, and all that I have wrought, will be forgotten utterly as the future gallops forth to devour us. At the time I knew nothing but the perfect beauty of what I imagined. </p> <p>I have already gone ahead of myself, however, for you do not yet even know what I accomplished. Perhaps you will best come to understand the deed's magnitude by its first outward sign: because of my invention, I was able to name my horse. I called her Hammadi. My neighbor Ydlbert von Iggislau named his horse Thea. These names had weight for us beyond their intrinsic beauty, because these two work weary horses were the first anyone had ever named. No horse before Hammadi lived long enough to need a name. It was enough that God had given us the beasts to serve us; we had never spent enough time with a single one to come to know its soul. We named our other animals - sheep and billy goats, for example, performed no labor and had fair chances of survival. My cow, who had provided me milk even before I married Adela\u00efda, had always been called Sophronia, and seemed worthy of such a name. We loved our horses nonetheless, as we loved our crops and loved the gentle spring. In their infancy we patted their soft ears and watched their first, faltering steps with the same fear and pride we felt in watching our own growing babes. We had little to spare, but the horses performed important duties, and we thanked them when we could with windfall apples or carrots that had gone early to rot. And in times of trouble, we prayed for our horses, sure. </p> <p>But we could not risk giving a horse a name. They were subject to all manner of plagues, maladies of the tooth, hoof, and digestion, sometimes a dread illness that turned a healthy horse to a deranged beast, choking on its own frothy spittle, spewing blood from every orifice. Because God is merciful, such a horse rarely lived longer than a day. Horses died young, as all creatures die young - like hatchlings in the nest or children yet unable to speak, foals were delicate, without sense, and held always in a balance that desired to tip against them. Sometimes God spared a foal its childhood torments, and it grew to be a strong adult, suitable for work. The seasons could not turn round upon a workhorse, however; they often died in their first few months of service. Even the smallest human error could bring a horse to its knees. I hitched my third horse, a beautiful chestnut mare whose white socks I brushed down of mud each night, to a full cart of grain one August morning - a cart only slightly more full than that she had pulled the week before - and she strained too hard under the load. Before I could loose the choking strap from her neck, she stood quite dead at the edge of my farthest field, her eyes popping and her tongue aloll. Her pained and frozen visage struck terror into my heart, and I let much of the shocked wheat go to rot in the field because I dreaded to approach the dead horse. After a few days I enlisted the help of my closest companions - my brother, Mandrik le Chouchou, and my neighbor Ydlbert von Iggislau - to drag the stinking, stiffened carcass away. \"Fear not,\" Mandrik told me, bowing his head of fine brown curls before the sight. \"The multitudes depart our presence thus, but the few escape intact.\" Ydlbert set his hat on the ground, revealing his balding pate to the hot sun, spat in his two strong hands, and set to hacking off the edible sections and the horse's skin. I could neither think long on the commentary nor bear to watch the flaying, so I returned to our house, where we wintered in poverty and want, except for copious lots of salted horse meat. </p> <p>I am not certain I have conveyed the direness of our situation. We could not produce horses fast enough to make use of them - the chances of bringing both a male and a female to healthy adulthood were few, and when they mated, the spirit often left the foal before it left its mother's womb. Horses - like even the bravest of women, my first wife, Elynour, among them, may she rest in peace - often died in giving birth, and a foal would languish on the diet of sugar and water it suckled in its mother's absence. A foal that persevered to its adulthood was prone to the aforementioned afflictions of the body; those beasts we acquired from Andras Drck, the dealer, were healthier, but often dearer than their short lives made worthwhile. Watching a horse in my barn at night, I sometimes saw in its trusting downcast eyes a premonition of the death that the weight of its suffering would surely and eventually bring. Our ancestors dreamed up a thousand spells to save them, but though a man might studiously recite his </p> <p>Day be bright, <br> Load be light, <br> Bring this horse safely <br> Back home tonight </p> <p>it only worked when the spirits were willing. When the horses did not die of their sundry natural maladies, they strangled pulling loads. </p> <p>I and my countrymen desired the plight of the horses to be otherwise, but we knew no way to bring about the change except through ardent prayer, in which we engaged together each Sabbath, and in which many of us engaged alone in the dreary hours before sleep. It is by such meditation, as well as by luck, that eventually I came upon the solution, a solution so simple yet so unknown that we did not have a name by which to call it. Though human vanity convinced me that the invention was the product of my mind, I soon came to realize that I had received both a vision and a blessing; only much later did I begin to see the terrors such a blessing can wreak. That first night I gave the longest prayer of thanks I have ever found it within me to offer, and thus, with a heart full of devotion, did I learn the thing's Heaven-given name: Harness. </p> <p>***</p> <p>Before we had the harness, we would tie a piece of flaxen rope or leather thong around the neck of the beast, secure the two traces to the swingletree of the cart (which at that time had but one wheel, square in the center of the load), and hope for successful drayage. If the horse was strong and the cart half laden, the burden arrived with its bearer intact, but the more weight we placed on the cart, the more likely it would strangle the horse. God is merciful, but he does not remove weights from around the necks of beasts, and we lost many horses in this manner. We gambled accordingly on each load; if it arrived safely, then we could eat, and if ill befell it or the horse, we couldn't. The material loss was, however, only part of the grief when our horses died. Even before we dared name them, we grew accustomed to their wants and ways. When we saw their dear lips, black as night or pink as a newborn babe, grimace in pain, it cut our hearts, as it would cut your heart, in two. </p> <p>One morning when the sun had not yet lifted his chin above the mountains to the east, I dreamed I was a horse dragging a cart heavy with sacks of flour. In the dream the hands of a black devil pulled the rope taut about my neck, and I knew the terrible truth of how cursed our horses felt. I awoke with a start and sat gasping for breath in my bed, holding my hand over my chest to see that my heart was still beating. I felt it working its miracle behind the bone. My wife, Adela\u00efda, quickly awoke beside me, her yellow braid brushing across my cheek. </p> <p>\"Yves,\" she asked, \"what's wrong?\" </p> <p>\"I dreamed the devil was choking me. I dreamed I couldn't breathe.\" </p> <p>Adela\u00efda settled back into the bedclothes. \"It'll be a bad season for goldenrod, then. We'll have to keep Elizaveta indoors.\" </p> <p>But I knew in my aching heart that the dream had been a prophecy of a different kind, though none of my deceased kin had come to herald it in the usual fashion. Of a sudden it seemed quite natural that a rope should choke a horse's throat, just as the devil's hands choked mine. But, like me, the horse had a hard place above her heart, a shell to protect the most sacred part of her, and if I could bind her to the cart across that place, it would make use of that strength instead of aggravating a weakness. </p> <p>The next morning, after briefly watering the near pasture and dumping the night's slops out besides, I brought my horse - nameless still - out into the yard, tethered her to the stake, and took strips of cured leather and pieces of flaxen rope from the barn. The chickens clucked in the yard, and my dog, Yoshu, bit fleas off her yellow backside, annoyed that I should pay more attention to the horse than to her. Elizaveta, a year-old infant then whose eyes had but recently gone brown, rolled into the yard behind me. Adela\u00efda had tied the child's left ankle to the kitchen bench with a length of twine, so that she could roll only a short distance from the door. My wife stood in the doorway with her distaff, spinning and watching the child play with her doll. They were the picture of beauty in the early-morning light, both fair-haired and sturdy, Adela\u00efda's round face ruddy with health around her gap-toothed grin. Her long braid shone, and she rocked her round hips slightly as she spun; Elizaveta fixed her gaze on her doll with a grown woman's intensity. Thus to observe their morning activities - so different, yet so intimately tied - brought me great pleasure and renewed dedication to my project. </p> <p>I watched the horse as I worked, wondering if she would give me a sign how my invention should progress. I had acquired her from the dealer three years since, and she was the best, most intelligent horse I had yet owned - not the most delicately featured, but a solid work beast, bay of hue, with a silky black mane, beautiful white feathering over her hooves, and a white star between her brown eyes that gave her a thoughtful air. She switched her tail, and wagged her head expectantly, but she could give me no advice. </p> <p>With all the combined efforts of my intellect and soul, I could imagine no way to secure a strap around the horse's breastplate. Every position, it seemed, caused the thong to slip back up to her windpipe. In any position she would choke. </p> <p>Adela\u00efda spun her flax into a long thread as fair as her heavy plait. \"That doesn't seem to be working,\" she offered. </p> <p>\"I can see that.\" </p> <p>\"It's too bad the horse doesn't wear an apron, because you could tie the ends of the straps to it and that'd be that.\" </p> <p>\"A fine point, but one which I must qualify,\" I said, mindful that my wife's tutelage was among my duties upon this earth, \"by reminding you that horses, who do no women's work, require no aprons.\" </p> <p>\"I was only remarking how much easier for you it would be if they did,\" she replied. \"I've more wit about me than a suckling child.\" </p> <p>I was chastened by her saying, for, either by accident or by God's grace, Adela\u00efda had solved the problem as she spun. The horse had no need for an apron, true, but if I provided her a tight-fitting girdle, then I could attach a strap to it across the breastbone; from this, in turn, would emanate the traces that bound it to the cart, thus distributing the weight of the load over a more solid area of the horse's body. I measured the horse's girth with a length of twine, and with another the distance about her breastplate, and retired to the barn to cut leather to those lengths. This leather I sewed to its own edge, so that it made a long, hollow shape, like entrails; and this I stuffed with straw, so that the straps could cushion the horse even further against the blow of labor. Elizaveta continued to roll about the front garden, gurgling her native song of praise. Although I shut the barn door to ensure the stillness necessary for work, I could faintly hear Adela\u00efda singing a song she oft sings as she works: </p> <p>Well, I love Yves Gundron, <br> Tell you, Lord, I do. <br> Yes, I love my old man Yves, <br> Yes, indeed, it's true. <br> But the fact that he don't listen, <br> Lord, it makes this woman sad and blue. </p> <p> Yves, he leaves me 'lone <br> And plows his fields all day. <br> Yes, he leaves me 'lone <br> While he plows all day. <br> But I wouldn't feel so lonesome <br> If he'd just listen to what I say. <br> <a href=\"#two\">(2)</a></p> <p>Though she intended her music as a reproach, it reminded me of my mother, who had ever a song upon her lips; it aided me in my thinking, and spurred me to complete my work. I stitched the breast strap firmly to the girding strap, so it would hold tight, and furnished the girding piece with an old iron buckle and multiple holes, so I could adjust it. The two ends of the breast strap I left long, that I might tie them to the cart. Fashioning the device, a labor of love unlike any I had yet known, took the better part of the day, but the sun sped past in what seemed an hour. </p> <p>He had not yet known reached the western edge of the horizon when I brought my work out and showed it to the puzzled horse, who was nibbling the scant grass of the near pasture. The shyness of her usually forthright gaze told me that she knew her life was about to change irrevocably. When I slipped the strap around her breastbone she hung her head, anticipating the drudgery of all the many workdays that had come before. She kicked when I fastened the belt about her midsection, and again when I tightened it and adjusted the breast strap. The fit, even on that first attempt, was nearly perfect - evidence, it seemed, of God's desire for man to have this invention. Sophronia, the cow, kept chewing nonchalantly on her cud, but I knew she was watching with something more than her ordinary interest. I fitted the horse's lead about her head, and she burred in annoyance. </p> <p>\"Adela\u00efda!\" I called. She appeared in the doorway, now in shadow, with the child on one hip and her distaff in the other hand. \"Look at the horse!\" </p> <p>\"What in Heaven's name have you done to her?\" </p> <p>\"I've made an invention.\" </p> <p>\"It doesn't look kindly.\" </p> <p>\"Never mind its outward form - will you help me bring the cart?\" </p> <p>It was not so heavy that I could not have moved it alone, but I wanted her nigh when the great event took place. She tied the child back up to the bench and rested her spindle against the door frame. Together we maneuvered the awkward cart out of the barn, and pulled it up behind the bewildered horse. I fastened the ends of the contraption to the cart, and tested their hold. The horse hung her head and looked at me askance, but when I clicked my tongue and urged her to follow me by tugging gently upon her lead, she knew the moment of reckoning had arrived, and began, hesitantly, to walk. For what seemed an eternity the traces pulled taut, and then the cart began to roll at a stately pace behind her. The horse, who still believed disaster was imminent, continued to regard me. But nothing went amiss. The cart's solid iron-clad wheel whined, bumped, and turned as it always had, but nothing pulled at the horse's throat. I put my hand upon the horse's neck to stop her. </p> <p>\"Adela\u00efda,\" I said. \"Climb up on the cart.\" </p> <p>She pursed her lips. \"This much seems miracle enough.\" </p> <p>\"But another is about to unfold,\" I said, uncertain though I was. \"Climb on.\" </p> <p>I prayed silently as Adela\u00efda hitched her skirt up, revealing her pale underskirt, and climbed up to the bed. I saw her lips moving, if not in prayer, then in a song of private devotion. Once more I clicked my tongue at the horse, and though she strained to set the cart in motion, she soon lifted her white feet high, and carried Adela\u00efda without apparent effort toward the southern fields. Adela\u00efda whooped with glee, for she had never before moved so quickly. No one had ever moved with such speed, and had I not known the cause of her rapid motion, I would surely have thought her an Arab upon a magic carpet or a witch in the Devil's thrall. </p> <p>Adela\u00efda is by no means as heavy as a load of turnips, but she has weight enough, if not to strangle a horse, then to make her struggle in her labors. The horse, however, pulled my fair wife with ease. When at last she tired of her sport, I returned to the barn and brought forth a bale of last year's hay, Yoshu nipping at my heels. As I hoisted the hay and the dog onto the cart, both the horse and Adela\u00efda winced, but the added weight, nearly equal to my wife's, did not cause the horse more than a moment's pause. Finally I stopped the cart again and climbed aboard. </p> <p>\"Yves!\" my wife cried. \"You'll surely kill her.\" Yoshu, ready for adventure, voiced her approval of my scheme. </p> <p>But I persevered. The horse looked round, wondering where her master had gone. I stood at the forward end of the cart and yelled at her to go, but she did not understand, as I was behind her. I had left her lead dangling before her, as it always had before, so I had no way to signal her to start. I reached over the edge of the cart and slapped her croup, shouting. She turned her head to recognize me, and showed by the gleam in her eye that she understood. She pulled all of us - myself, Adela\u00efda, the dog, and a dry bale of hay - until the sun went down. That evening I rewarded her with oats from my own provender, and with the previous year's dried apples, and scrubbed her down until she gleamed from crest to tail. Elizaveta, when we returned to the house, was completely bound up in her string, and lay with her arms pinned to her sides, blinking. </p> <p>That was the night the device's Heaven-given name appeared to my inward ear. Harness would be its name henceforth until the generations expired. I was still speaking the name to myself when I rose before dawn to bring wood for Adela\u00efda's fire, and as I spoke it, I realized that this one simple word meant that our horse, with God's grace, would survive into her dotage. She would become a member of the family. She, too, would require a name. Again the voice spoke in my inward ear: Call the horse Hammadi. Its beautiful sound rang throughout my body and mind. Although the wood was heavy in my wood sling, I stopped at the barn. All the animals stood wide awake and expectant, and the horse looked at me skeptically, her white star shining, as she hoped for a breakfast as fine as last night's meal. </p> <p>I said, \"Hello, Hammadi.\" </p> <p>She flared her nostrils and flattened her fine brown ears against her head. Perhaps this form of greeting had, in the intervening night, attained an almost human eloquence. I could practically hear her whisper, \"Hello.\" </p> <p>***</p> <p>That day was a Saturday, one among the many. On Sundays God decreed a day of rest, but after we went dutifully to worship, and ate a solemn meal, we would return to our everyday work. We dared not tell our priest, Stanislaus, that we worked on the Sabbath - he was too young to have real experience of the world and its ways, and such an admission might have shaken his confidence. Our old priest, Father Icthyus, had fed us full up on the fear of God; but Stanislaus, thin as a reed in his dun-colored cassock, looked down his hooked nose at whatever he studied, his Adam's apple bobbing ever in confusion, and could not inspire us to the same frenzy of worship and dread. Though he was a young enough fellow, he held to his doctrines with an old man's fervor; and his unwillingness to grant pardon for our workaday follies made us hesitate to admit to him our real sins. The truth was that, whatever God had decreed, survival required a great deal of labor, and to take more than half a day of rest would have meant our demise. And as for spending one day in contemplation, for the multitudes there is nothing to contemplate beyond work; we think about it while we do it. Clerics or no, it is better to bring in the hay on a sunny Sunday than to meditate upon God's goodness and allow the hay to be ruined by an evening rain. </p> <p>Sunday morning Adela\u00efda and I put on our good clothes, tied Elizaveta to a clean string to keep her from running wild in our lovely sanctuary of St. Perpetua, and walked to the village for services. The air was crisp and the sun bright, and I was humbled by the beauty of the mountains that lifted their heads to Heaven all around us. That day our church, with its jewel-hued murals, its clear morning light, and its great congregation of farmers, seemed truly the house of the Lord. Stanislaus's sermon was a dreary injunction against drunkenness and profanity, but all the same was I ardent in my devotions. Adela\u00efda looked especially beautiful that day, and when we joined together in silent prayer, I thanked God for her as well as for my new invention and my horse. My friend Ydlbert must have noticed the happiness on my face, for as we left the sanctuary he regarded me with a look of some curiosity. I held my silence as we began the walk home - Ydlbert and I together, followed by our strong wives carrying our infants, followed by four of Ydlbert's sons, who walked in a row, each holding the previous child's string. The front-most son, whose name I could not recall, held to the back of their mother's apron, which she kept tied in a scrupulous knot. The eldest, Dirk and Bartholomew, scuffed at the dust behind them all, their dark hair hanging forward over their eyes as if they were brigands. </p> <p>Ydlbert said, \"Has something happened, Yves? You look different.\" His gray eyes were bright with expectation. </p> <p>I believe I blushed from pride. I told him, \"I think I invented something.\" \"I hope it's better than that damned thing you made with iron filings.\" <a href=\"#three\">(3)</a></p> <p>\"Indeed,\" Dirk said. \"That was a foolish invention.\" </p> <p>\"Ydlbert,\" his pinch-faced Anya said, as her sons guffawed. \"Not on the Sabbath.\" </p> <p>\"I call it the harness. It allows me to attach my cart to my horse without strangling her.\" </p> <p>Ydlbert laughed, as he does, with all his soul, and with his great, firm belly heaving. \"Oh, well, if that's it, congratulations.\" </p> <p>\"Ydlbert,\" I said, \"I'm serious. When I used it to tether them together, the horse dragged me, Adela\u00efda, a bale of hay, and the dog without the slightest strain.\" </p> <p>\"Yves,\" he said, poking me in my gut - which was only half so ample as his own - \"save your fairy tales for bedtime.\" </p> <p>\"I'll bet you three guilders it works.\" Ydlbert raised and drew together his brows. Three guilders was somewhat more money then than it is now - enough to buy a pound of fine sugar or all the cinnamon one's wife could bake with in a year. \"In that case, my friend, I'll come see.\" </p> <p>Bartholomew said, \"Father, he's baiting you, sure,\" but without enough fire to offend. </p> <p>Ydlbert lived half a mile closer to town than I did, and parted from his family at the rise that marked off his property from my own; Anya trudged down the gentle slope in the brilliant sunlight, her noisy children following behind like a family of rumple-headed ducks. Ydlbert accompanied us to our farm, and thought, no doubt, that I had prepared him an elaborate joke. Adela\u00efda took Elizaveta into the house, and as Ydlbert stood with his arms folded across his chest, I brought my horse, whom I could hardly grow accustomed to calling by her God-given name, Hammadi, outside. Since yesterday evening's exploits, she had begun to stand taller, and her eyes shone with knowledge of her accomplishment. The animals, out grazing in the near field, gathered round to bah and grunt with expectation. Ydlbert helped me drag the cart from the barn, and we pulled it in a wide circle to Hammadi's rear. I hitched her into her harness, which she accepted this time with joy, attached her to the cart, and repeated the previous day's successful experiment, this time with Ydlbert the skeptic in tow. When first he felt the forward motion of the cart, he crowed with joy at my invention. \"You've done better than invent the wheel!\" he yelled, tossing his cap into the air and revealing his comical bald spot. \"What good was the wheel before we had your blessed harness to make it worthwhile!\" Chornaya and Flick, the two black sheep, bahed in unison; God be praised. </p> <p>My heart glowed with pride; I had brought a new, good thing into the world. I stopped Hammadi's circuit, and walked to where Ydlbert had hunkered down in the cart. With my hand on his broad shoulder I told him the dearest secret of all. \"I named my horse.\" </p> <p>He smiled, uncomprehending; his teeth were worn down from more than thirty years of good use. \"What do you mean, you named her?\" </p> <p>I said, \"She's not going to die now. I gave her a name, as we'd name any other thing.\" </p> <p>\"What name?\" </p> <p>\"Hammadi.\" The name still rippled like the faint echo of bells over my ears. Ydlbert nodded and looked at Hammadi, for the first time thinking of her by her own name. Knowing this gave me joy. </p> <p>\"Yves,\" he said. \"We've been friends since childhood.\" </p> <p>\"Yes.\" </p> <p>\"Please make me a harness, for my horse, also.\" </p> <p>\"With pleasure,\" I said. </p> <p>Ydlbert continued to nod, and looked off toward his ancestors' land. \"Then I name my horse Thea,\" he said. </p> <p>\"And my three guilders?\" </p> <p>He smiled broadly. \"I'll pay you anon.\" </p> <p>\"I don't want it. Come,\" I said, steering him toward the barn to begin on the second harness. By Monday morning, then, two horses in our village had names. I cannot overstate the importance of this development. In Mandragora, we do not even name our children when they first emerge from the womb; we call them \"daughter\" or \"son\" until they have lived a full year. On the first anniversary of a child's birth, we name it, for by then it has weathered the most difficult season of its life, and we can pray for the child once it has shown us the light of its soul. But in reality children, like horses, die all the time, for the strangest of reasons. Each morning as I wake, I wonder when Elizaveta will be taken from me. </p> <p>What a mark of our faith, to name our horses as we would name a year-old child. Our neighbors thought we'd gone mad - except for my brother Mandrik, the one man in our village who understands more than the ordinary workings of machines and of God, the one man I defer to in judgment, however odd my countrymen think him. The villagers had not yet witnessed what the harness could do; how could we expect them to believe without any visible sign? </p> <p>***</p> <p>(1) In editing this manuscript for the general readership, I have regularized Yves Gundron's spelling and punctuation - for example, by setting off reported speech in double quotation marks.

Many of the songs Mandrik and Adela\u00efda compose extemporaneously are simple ballads, as one might expect in such a community, but the blues aesthetic which marks some of the songs seems to have been brought to the village by Mandrik and Yves's grandmother (who was also Adela\u00efda's grandaunt), Iulia Gansev\u00f6ort Gundron, the only stranger ever recorded as having visited the village before me, and widely believed to have been a silkie, or half-human spirit of the sea.

      "bodyText": "The First Invention (1) Imagine the time of my grandfather's grandfather, when the darkness was newly separated from the light. Society was only a shadowy image of what it would soon become. This was Mandragora before my invention and all that it set in motion. People spoke to one another, but their habits of thought were coarse. People lived in fear. Our forefathers farmed, but with great difficulty; a man used a sharp stick to dig a hole for each seed, and furrowed his fields by dragging his fingernails through them and picking out each small stone. Often a whole spring passed in preparing the ground, and families went hungry or died come winter. They had fire, but they had no candles, nor did they have proper looms - when a woman made cloth for her household, she wound the woof through each strand of warp, and tamped down each row of weaving with her fingers. It took so long to make a bolt of cloth that growing children went about in tatters because their mothers could not keep pace. Men knew how to count and keep tally, but they had no numbers bigger than twenty. Twenty acres was the size of Mandragora's largest farm (my grandfather's, which I cultivate still), and twenty sheep the size of its largest flock; what need had they to reckon the infinite? Men's faculties may have been as well developed as ours, but they spent so much effort scratching their existence from the soil that they had no time for ideas or contemplation. What sufficed sufficed; and however much men might have profited from introspection, their days were full of drudgery that kept it at bay. Such darkness persisted nigh unto the present day, and might nearly have persisted ever, had not a glimmering seed of an idea taken root in my mind and beckoned me out of the night. I wish it had been an idea of philosophical profundity, one that could explain to men where God resides or what happens to our essence after death, but it was only a workaday idea, the kind a farmer such as myself might have about his farming. Of all the events to set the process of history in motion, mine was a realization about my horse. Had I known then what terrors my invention would bring us along with its joys, perhaps I would have allowed the idea to drift off like a thousand other daydreams. I could not have envisioned myself, two winters later, spending these long nights writing in my barn, writing against what seems the inevitable outcome: that I, and all that I have wrought, will be forgotten utterly as the future gallops forth to devour us. At the time I knew nothing but the perfect beauty of what I imagined. I have already gone ahead of myself, however, for you do not yet even know what I accomplished. Perhaps you will best come to understand the deed's magnitude by its first outward sign: because of my invention, I was able to name my horse. I called her Hammadi. My neighbor Ydlbert von Iggislau named his horse Thea. These names had weight for us beyond their intrinsic beauty, because these two work weary horses were the first anyone had ever named. No horse before Hammadi lived long enough to need a name. It was enough that God had given us the beasts to serve us; we had never spent enough time with a single one to come to know its soul. We named our other animals - sheep and billy goats, for example, performed no labor and had fair chances of survival. My cow, who had provided me milk even before I married Adela\u00efda, had always been called Sophronia, and seemed worthy of such a name. We loved our horses nonetheless, as we loved our crops and loved the gentle spring. In their infancy we patted their soft ears and watched their first, faltering steps with the same fear and pride we felt in watching our own growing babes. We had little to spare, but the horses performed important duties, and we thanked them when we could with windfall apples or carrots that had gone early to rot. And in times of trouble, we prayed for our horses, sure. But we could not risk giving a horse a name. They were subject to all manner of plagues, maladies of the tooth, hoof, and digestion, sometimes a dread illness that turned a healthy horse to a deranged beast, choking on its own frothy spittle, spewing blood from every orifice. Because God is merciful, such a horse rarely lived longer than a day. Horses died young, as all creatures die young - like hatchlings in the nest or children yet unable to speak, foals were delicate, without sense, and held always in a balance that desired to tip against them. Sometimes God spared a foal its childhood torments, and it grew to be a strong adult, suitable for work. The seasons could not turn round upon a workhorse, however; they often died in their first few months of service. Even the smallest human error could bring a horse to its knees. I hitched my third horse, a beautiful chestnut mare whose white socks I brushed down of mud each night, to a full cart of grain one August morning - a cart only slightly more full than that she had pulled the week before - and she strained too hard under the load. Before I could loose the choking strap from her neck, she stood quite dead at the edge of my farthest field, her eyes popping and her tongue aloll. Her pained and frozen visage struck terror into my heart, and I let much of the shocked wheat go to rot in the field because I dreaded to approach the dead horse. After a few days I enlisted the help of my closest companions - my brother, Mandrik le Chouchou, and my neighbor Ydlbert von Iggislau - to drag the stinking, stiffened carcass away. \"Fear not,\" Mandrik told me, bowing his head of fine brown curls before the sight. \"The multitudes depart our presence thus, but the few escape intact.\" Ydlbert set his hat on the ground, revealing his balding pate to the hot sun, spat in his two strong hands, and set to hacking off the edible sections and the horse's skin. I could neither think long on the commentary nor bear to watch the flaying, so I returned to our house, where we wintered in poverty and want, except for copious lots of salted horse meat. I am not certain I have conveyed the direness of our situation. We could not produce horses fast enough to make use of them - the chances of bringing both a male and a female to healthy adulthood were few, and when they mated, the spirit often left the foal before it left its mother's womb. Horses - like even the bravest of women, my first wife, Elynour, among them, may she rest in peace - often died in giving birth, and a foal would languish on the diet of sugar and water it suckled in its mother's absence. A foal that persevered to its adulthood was prone to the aforementioned afflictions of the body; those beasts we acquired from Andras Drck, the dealer, were healthier, but often dearer than their short lives made worthwhile. Watching a horse in my barn at night, I sometimes saw in its trusting downcast eyes a premonition of the death that the weight of its suffering would surely and eventually bring. Our ancestors dreamed up a thousand spells to save them, but though a man might studiously recite his Day be bright, Load be light, Bring this horse safely Back home tonight it only worked when the spirits were willing. When the horses did not die of their sundry natural maladies, they strangled pulling loads. I and my countrymen desired the plight of the horses to be otherwise, but we knew no way to bring about the change except through ardent prayer, in which we engaged together each Sabbath, and in which many of us engaged alone in the dreary hours before sleep. It is by such meditation, as well as by luck, that eventually I came upon the solution, a solution so simple yet so unknown that we did not have a name by which to call it. Though human vanity convinced me that the invention was the product of my mind, I soon came to realize that I had received both a vision and a blessing; only much later did I begin to see the terrors such a blessing can wreak. That first night I gave the longest prayer of thanks I have ever found it within me to offer, and thus, with a heart full of devotion, did I learn the thing's Heaven-given name: Harness. *** Before we had the harness, we would tie a piece of flaxen rope or leather thong around the neck of the beast, secure the two traces to the swingletree of the cart (which at that time had but one wheel, square in the center of the load), and hope for successful drayage. If the horse was strong and the cart half laden, the burden arrived with its bearer intact, but the more weight we placed on the cart, the more likely it would strangle the horse. God is merciful, but he does not remove weights from around the necks of beasts, and we lost many horses in this manner. We gambled accordingly on each load; if it arrived safely, then we could eat, and if ill befell it or the horse, we couldn't. The material loss was, however, only part of the grief when our horses died. Even before we dared name them, we grew accustomed to their wants and ways. When we saw their dear lips, black as night or pink as a newborn babe, grimace in pain, it cut our hearts, as it would cut your heart, in two. One morning when the sun had not yet lifted his chin above the mountains to the east, I dreamed I was a horse dragging a cart heavy with sacks of flour. In the dream the hands of a black devil pulled the rope taut about my neck, and I knew the terrible truth of how cursed our horses felt. I awoke with a start and sat gasping for breath in my bed, holding my hand over my chest to see that my heart was still beating. I felt it working its miracle behind the bone. My wife, Adela\u00efda, quickly awoke beside me, her yellow braid brushing across my cheek. \"Yves,\" she asked, \"what's wrong?\" \"I dreamed the devil was choking me. I dreamed I couldn't breathe.\" Adela\u00efda settled back into the bedclothes. \"It'll be a bad season for goldenrod, then. We'll have to keep Elizaveta indoors.\" But I knew in my aching heart that the dream had been a prophecy of a different kind, though none of my deceased kin had come to herald it in the usual fashion. Of a sudden it seemed quite natural that a rope should choke a horse's throat, just as the devil's hands choked mine. But, like me, the horse had a hard place above her heart, a shell to protect the most sacred part of her, and if I could bind her to the cart across that place, it would make use of that strength instead of aggravating a weakness. The next morning, after briefly watering the near pasture and dumping the night's slops out besides, I brought my horse - nameless still - out into the yard, tethered her to the stake, and took strips of cured leather and pieces of flaxen rope from the barn. The chickens clucked in the yard, and my dog, Yoshu, bit fleas off her yellow backside, annoyed that I should pay more attention to the horse than to her. Elizaveta, a year-old infant then whose eyes had but recently gone brown, rolled into the yard behind me. Adela\u00efda had tied the child's left ankle to the kitchen bench with a length of twine, so that she could roll only a short distance from the door. My wife stood in the doorway with her distaff, spinning and watching the child play with her doll. They were the picture of beauty in the early-morning light, both fair-haired and sturdy, Adela\u00efda's round face ruddy with health around her gap-toothed grin. Her long braid shone, and she rocked her round hips slightly as she spun; Elizaveta fixed her gaze on her doll with a grown woman's intensity. Thus to observe their morning activities - so different, yet so intimately tied - brought me great pleasure and renewed dedication to my project. I watched the horse as I worked, wondering if she would give me a sign how my invention should progress. I had acquired her from the dealer three years since, and she was the best, most intelligent horse I had yet owned - not the most delicately featured, but a solid work beast, bay of hue, with a silky black mane, beautiful white feathering over her hooves, and a white star between her brown eyes that gave her a thoughtful air. She switched her tail, and wagged her head expectantly, but she could give me no advice. With all the combined efforts of my intellect and soul, I could imagine no way to secure a strap around the horse's breastplate. Every position, it seemed, caused the thong to slip back up to her windpipe. In any position she would choke. Adela\u00efda spun her flax into a long thread as fair as her heavy plait. \"That doesn't seem to be working,\" she offered. \"I can see that.\" \"It's too bad the horse doesn't wear an apron, because you could tie the ends of the straps to it and that'd be that.\" \"A fine point, but one which I must qualify,\" I said, mindful that my wife's tutelage was among my duties upon this earth, \"by reminding you that horses, who do no women's work, require no aprons.\" \"I was only remarking how much easier for you it would be if they did,\" she replied. \"I've more wit about me than a suckling child.\" I was chastened by her saying, for, either by accident or by God's grace, Adela\u00efda had solved the problem as she spun. The horse had no need for an apron, true, but if I provided her a tight-fitting girdle, then I could attach a strap to it across the breastbone; from this, in turn, would emanate the traces that bound it to the cart, thus distributing the weight of the load over a more solid area of the horse's body. I measured the horse's girth with a length of twine, and with another the distance about her breastplate, and retired to the barn to cut leather to those lengths. This leather I sewed to its own edge, so that it made a long, hollow shape, like entrails; and this I stuffed with straw, so that the straps could cushion the horse even further against the blow of labor. Elizaveta continued to roll about the front garden, gurgling her native song of praise. Although I shut the barn door to ensure the stillness necessary for work, I could faintly hear Adela\u00efda singing a song she oft sings as she works: Well, I love Yves Gundron, Tell you, Lord, I do. Yes, I love my old man Yves, Yes, indeed, it's true. But the fact that he don't listen, Lord, it makes this woman sad and blue. Yves, he leaves me 'lone And plows his fields all day. Yes, he leaves me 'lone While he plows all day. But I wouldn't feel so lonesome If he'd just listen to what I say. (2) Though she intended her music as a reproach, it reminded me of my mother, who had ever a song upon her lips; it aided me in my thinking, and spurred me to complete my work. I stitched the breast strap firmly to the girding strap, so it would hold tight, and furnished the girding piece with an old iron buckle and multiple holes, so I could adjust it. The two ends of the breast strap I left long, that I might tie them to the cart. Fashioning the device, a labor of love unlike any I had yet known, took the better part of the day, but the sun sped past in what seemed an hour. He had not yet known reached the western edge of the horizon when I brought my work out and showed it to the puzzled horse, who was nibbling the scant grass of the near pasture. The shyness of her usually forthright gaze told me that she knew her life was about to change irrevocably. When I slipped the strap around her breastbone she hung her head, anticipating the drudgery of all the many workdays that had come before. She kicked when I fastened the belt about her midsection, and again when I tightened it and adjusted the breast strap. The fit, even on that first attempt, was nearly perfect - evidence, it seemed, of God's desire for man to have this invention. Sophronia, the cow, kept chewing nonchalantly on her cud, but I knew she was watching with something more than her ordinary interest. I fitted the horse's lead about her head, and she burred in annoyance. \"Adela\u00efda!\" I called. She appeared in the doorway, now in shadow, with the child on one hip and her distaff in the other hand. \"Look at the horse!\" \"What in Heaven's name have you done to her?\" \"I've made an invention.\" \"It doesn't look kindly.\" \"Never mind its outward form - will you help me bring the cart?\" It was not so heavy that I could not have moved it alone, but I wanted her nigh when the great event took place. She tied the child back up to the bench and rested her spindle against the door frame. Together we maneuvered the awkward cart out of the barn, and pulled it up behind the bewildered horse. I fastened the ends of the contraption to the cart, and tested their hold. The horse hung her head and looked at me askance, but when I clicked my tongue and urged her to follow me by tugging gently upon her lead, she knew the moment of reckoning had arrived, and began, hesitantly, to walk. For what seemed an eternity the traces pulled taut, and then the cart began to roll at a stately pace behind her. The horse, who still believed disaster was imminent, continued to regard me. But nothing went amiss. The cart's solid iron-clad wheel whined, bumped, and turned as it always had, but nothing pulled at the horse's throat. I put my hand upon the horse's neck to stop her. \"Adela\u00efda,\" I said. \"Climb up on the cart.\" She pursed her lips. \"This much seems miracle enough.\" \"But another is about to unfold,\" I said, uncertain though I was. \"Climb on.\" I prayed silently as Adela\u00efda hitched her skirt up, revealing her pale underskirt, and climbed up to the bed. I saw her lips moving, if not in prayer, then in a song of private devotion. Once more I clicked my tongue at the horse, and though she strained to set the cart in motion, she soon lifted her white feet high, and carried Adela\u00efda without apparent effort toward the southern fields. Adela\u00efda whooped with glee, for she had never before moved so quickly. No one had ever moved with such speed, and had I not known the cause of her rapid motion, I would surely have thought her an Arab upon a magic carpet or a witch in the Devil's thrall. Adela\u00efda is by no means as heavy as a load of turnips, but she has weight enough, if not to strangle a horse, then to make her struggle in her labors. The horse, however, pulled my fair wife with ease. When at last she tired of her sport, I returned to the barn and brought forth a bale of last year's hay, Yoshu nipping at my heels. As I hoisted the hay and the dog onto the cart, both the horse and Adela\u00efda winced, but the added weight, nearly equal to my wife's, did not cause the horse more than a moment's pause. Finally I stopped the cart again and climbed aboard. \"Yves!\" my wife cried. \"You'll surely kill her.\" Yoshu, ready for adventure, voiced her approval of my scheme. But I persevered. The horse looked round, wondering where her master had gone. I stood at the forward end of the cart and yelled at her to go, but she did not understand, as I was behind her. I had left her lead dangling before her, as it always had before, so I had no way to signal her to start. I reached over the edge of the cart and slapped her croup, shouting. She turned her head to recognize me, and showed by the gleam in her eye that she understood. She pulled all of us - myself, Adela\u00efda, the dog, and a dry bale of hay - until the sun went down. That evening I rewarded her with oats from my own provender, and with the previous year's dried apples, and scrubbed her down until she gleamed from crest to tail. Elizaveta, when we returned to the house, was completely bound up in her string, and lay with her arms pinned to her sides, blinking. That was the night the device's Heaven-given name appeared to my inward ear. Harness would be its name henceforth until the generations expired. I was still speaking the name to myself when I rose before dawn to bring wood for Adela\u00efda's fire, and as I spoke it, I realized that this one simple word meant that our horse, with God's grace, would survive into her dotage. She would become a member of the family. She, too, would require a name. Again the voice spoke in my inward ear: Call the horse Hammadi. Its beautiful sound rang throughout my body and mind. Although the wood was heavy in my wood sling, I stopped at the barn. All the animals stood wide awake and expectant, and the horse looked at me skeptically, her white star shining, as she hoped for a breakfast as fine as last night's meal. I said, \"Hello, Hammadi.\" She flared her nostrils and flattened her fine brown ears against her head. Perhaps this form of greeting had, in the intervening night, attained an almost human eloquence. I could practically hear her whisper, \"Hello.\" *** That day was a Saturday, one among the many. On Sundays God decreed a day of rest, but after we went dutifully to worship, and ate a solemn meal, we would return to our everyday work. We dared not tell our priest, Stanislaus, that we worked on the Sabbath - he was too young to have real experience of the world and its ways, and such an admission might have shaken his confidence. Our old priest, Father Icthyus, had fed us full up on the fear of God; but Stanislaus, thin as a reed in his dun-colored cassock, looked down his hooked nose at whatever he studied, his Adam's apple bobbing ever in confusion, and could not inspire us to the same frenzy of worship and dread. Though he was a young enough fellow, he held to his doctrines with an old man's fervor; and his unwillingness to grant pardon for our workaday follies made us hesitate to admit to him our real sins. The truth was that, whatever God had decreed, survival required a great deal of labor, and to take more than half a day of rest would have meant our demise. And as for spending one day in contemplation, for the multitudes there is nothing to contemplate beyond work; we think about it while we do it. Clerics or no, it is better to bring in the hay on a sunny Sunday than to meditate upon God's goodness and allow the hay to be ruined by an evening rain. Sunday morning Adela\u00efda and I put on our good clothes, tied Elizaveta to a clean string to keep her from running wild in our lovely sanctuary of St. Perpetua, and walked to the village for services. The air was crisp and the sun bright, and I was humbled by the beauty of the mountains that lifted their heads to Heaven all around us. That day our church, with its jewel-hued murals, its clear morning light, and its great congregation of farmers, seemed truly the house of the Lord. Stanislaus's sermon was a dreary injunction against drunkenness and profanity, but all the same was I ardent in my devotions. Adela\u00efda looked especially beautiful that day, and when we joined together in silent prayer, I thanked God for her as well as for my new invention and my horse. My friend Ydlbert must have noticed the happiness on my face, for as we left the sanctuary he regarded me with a look of some curiosity. I held my silence as we began the walk home - Ydlbert and I together, followed by our strong wives carrying our infants, followed by four of Ydlbert's sons, who walked in a row, each holding the previous child's string. The front-most son, whose name I could not recall, held to the back of their mother's apron, which she kept tied in a scrupulous knot. The eldest, Dirk and Bartholomew, scuffed at the dust behind them all, their dark hair hanging forward over their eyes as if they were brigands. Ydlbert said, \"Has something happened, Yves? You look different.\" His gray eyes were bright with expectation. I believe I blushed from pride. I told him, \"I think I invented something.\" \"I hope it's better than that damned thing you made with iron filings.\" (3) \"Indeed,\" Dirk said. \"That was a foolish invention.\" \"Ydlbert,\" his pinch-faced Anya said, as her sons guffawed. \"Not on the Sabbath.\" \"I call it the harness. It allows me to attach my cart to my horse without strangling her.\" Ydlbert laughed, as he does, with all his soul, and with his great, firm belly heaving. \"Oh, well, if that's it, congratulations.\" \"Ydlbert,\" I said, \"I'm serious. When I used it to tether them together, the horse dragged me, Adela\u00efda, a bale of hay, and the dog without the slightest strain.\" \"Yves,\" he said, poking me in my gut - which was only half so ample as his own - \"save your fairy tales for bedtime.\" \"I'll bet you three guilders it works.\" Ydlbert raised and drew together his brows. Three guilders was somewhat more money then than it is now - enough to buy a pound of fine sugar or all the cinnamon one's wife could bake with in a year. \"In that case, my friend, I'll come see.\" Bartholomew said, \"Father, he's baiting you, sure,\" but without enough fire to offend. Ydlbert lived half a mile closer to town than I did, and parted from his family at the rise that marked off his property from my own; Anya trudged down the gentle slope in the brilliant sunlight, her noisy children following behind like a family of rumple-headed ducks. Ydlbert accompanied us to our farm, and thought, no doubt, that I had prepared him an elaborate joke. Adela\u00efda took Elizaveta into the house, and as Ydlbert stood with his arms folded across his chest, I brought my horse, whom I could hardly grow accustomed to calling by her God-given name, Hammadi, outside. Since yesterday evening's exploits, she had begun to stand taller, and her eyes shone with knowledge of her accomplishment. The animals, out grazing in the near field, gathered round to bah and grunt with expectation. Ydlbert helped me drag the cart from the barn, and we pulled it in a wide circle to Hammadi's rear. I hitched her into her harness, which she accepted this time with joy, attached her to the cart, and repeated the previous day's successful experiment, this time with Ydlbert the skeptic in tow. When first he felt the forward motion of the cart, he crowed with joy at my invention. \"You've done better than invent the wheel!\" he yelled, tossing his cap into the air and revealing his comical bald spot. \"What good was the wheel before we had your blessed harness to make it worthwhile!\" Chornaya and Flick, the two black sheep, bahed in unison; God be praised. My heart glowed with pride; I had brought a new, good thing into the world. I stopped Hammadi's circuit, and walked to where Ydlbert had hunkered down in the cart. With my hand on his broad shoulder I told him the dearest secret of all. \"I named my horse.\" He smiled, uncomprehending; his teeth were worn down from more than thirty years of good use. \"What do you mean, you named her?\" I said, \"She's not going to die now. I gave her a name, as we'd name any other thing.\" \"What name?\" \"Hammadi.\" The name still rippled like the faint echo of bells over my ears. Ydlbert nodded and looked at Hammadi, for the first time thinking of her by her own name. Knowing this gave me joy. \"Yves,\" he said. \"We've been friends since childhood.\" \"Yes.\" \"Please make me a harness, for my horse, also.\" \"With pleasure,\" I said. Ydlbert continued to nod, and looked off toward his ancestors' land. \"Then I name my horse Thea,\" he said. \"And my three guilders?\" He smiled broadly. \"I'll pay you anon.\" \"I don't want it. Come,\" I said, steering him toward the barn to begin on the second harness. By Monday morning, then, two horses in our village had names. I cannot overstate the importance of this development. In Mandragora, we do not even name our children when they first emerge from the womb; we call them \"daughter\" or \"son\" until they have lived a full year. On the first anniversary of a child's birth, we name it, for by then it has weathered the most difficult season of its life, and we can pray for the child once it has shown us the light of its soul. But in reality children, like horses, die all the time, for the strangest of reasons. Each morning as I wake, I wonder when Elizaveta will be taken from me. What a mark of our faith, to name our horses as we would name a year-old child. Our neighbors thought we'd gone mad - except for my brother Mandrik, the one man in our village who understands more than the ordinary workings of machines and of God, the one man I defer to in judgment, however odd my countrymen think him. The villagers had not yet witnessed what the harness could do; how could we expect them to believe without any visible sign? *** (1) In editing this manuscript for the general readership, I have regularized Yves Gundron's spelling and punctuation - for example, by setting off reported speech in double quotation marks. In rare instances in which Gundron appeared to have misused a word, I have made the necessary corrections. All chapter and section divisions and footnotes are mine (Ed.) (2) Aficionados will recognise the structural similarity between some of Adela\u00efda's and Mandrik's songs and the blues, which otherwise do not exist in Mandragora. Many of the songs Mandrik and Adela\u00efda compose extemporaneously are simple ballads, as one might expect in such a community, but the blues aesthetic which marks some of the songs seems to have been brought to the village by Mandrik and Yves's grandmother (who was also Adela\u00efda's grandaunt), Iulia Gansev\u00f6ort Gundron, the only stranger ever recorded as having visited the village before me, and widely believed to have been a silkie, or half-human spirit of the sea. All other music in Mandragora consists of devotional chants in the diatonic scale. (3) A primitive compass Yves called a south-pointer Continue",

      "body": "<p>Charismatic Hungarian conductor Ivan Fischer is keen on philosophy. He cites Schopenhauer as one of the most important influences on his work, and, remarkably, it shows. Schopenhauer argued that music mirrored the flux of human emotion and the tense miasma of cosmic change. Fischer combines a probing intellect with an acute awareness of every emotional shift in any given score. This creates performances with transcendental energy, in which feeling and formal logic are held in perfect balance. </p> <p>The centrepiece of this concert was Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto, a performance that seemed to expand the work's emotional range to take in extremes of elation and despair. With his soloist, Richard Goode, in complete accord with his approach, Fischer kicks off in a mood of profound pessimism; the opening phrases seem to struggle nervously out of silence in a quest for identity, only reaching a moment of assertion when the piano makes its first entry. Goode is commanding throughout, steering the first movement towards a glimpse of genuine transcendence, though the focal point lies in the largo, in which time briefly seems to stand still and the music wafts heavenward. The finale, far from being the usual ebullient whirl, returns us to the restless earth-bound ambivalence of the first movement. </p> <p>The same mix of logic, emotional daring and drive characterises Fischer's version of Dvorak's Seventh Symphony. The shadow of Brahms, Dvorak's mentor, hangs over the work, and Fischer refuses to disguise it. You're struck by the contrast between the symphony's formal conciseness and the emotional torrent that Fischer, conducting with an almost balletic extravagance of gesture, manages to unleash. The first movement seethes with menace while the tangy cross-rhythms of the scherzo surprise with every jolt. What never fails to impress in Fischer's conducting is the pitch of intensity he generates without ever seeming excessive. </p> <p>The concert's curtain-raiser was Bartok's Hungarian sketches, an orchestration made in 1931 of piano music composed between 1908 and 1911. Bartok's rhythmic ferocity is only in evidence in the second section, and even here his violence is almost tongue in cheek in his depiction of a dancing bear. Elsewhere the overwhelming impression is of a sequence of modal instrumental solos that seem to hover beyond time and space. The playing throughout was beyond criticism. The Budapest Festival Orchestra, which Fischer founded in 1983, ranks among the most formidable ensembles in the world.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Charismatic Hungarian conductor Ivan Fischer is keen on philosophy. He cites Schopenhauer as one of the most important influences on his work, and, remarkably, it shows. Schopenhauer argued that music mirrored the flux of human emotion and the tense miasma of cosmic change. Fischer combines a probing intellect with an acute awareness of every emotional shift in any given score. This creates performances with transcendental energy, in which feeling and formal logic are held in perfect balance. The centrepiece of this concert was Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto, a performance that seemed to expand the work's emotional range to take in extremes of elation and despair. With his soloist, Richard Goode, in complete accord with his approach, Fischer kicks off in a mood of profound pessimism; the opening phrases seem to struggle nervously out of silence in a quest for identity, only reaching a moment of assertion when the piano makes its first entry. Goode is commanding throughout, steering the first movement towards a glimpse of genuine transcendence, though the focal point lies in the largo, in which time briefly seems to stand still and the music wafts heavenward. The finale, far from being the usual ebullient whirl, returns us to the restless earth-bound ambivalence of the first movement. The same mix of logic, emotional daring and drive characterises Fischer's version of Dvorak's Seventh Symphony. The shadow of Brahms, Dvorak's mentor, hangs over the work, and Fischer refuses to disguise it. You're struck by the contrast between the symphony's formal conciseness and the emotional torrent that Fischer, conducting with an almost balletic extravagance of gesture, manages to unleash. The first movement seethes with menace while the tangy cross-rhythms of the scherzo surprise with every jolt. What never fails to impress in Fischer's conducting is the pitch of intensity he generates without ever seeming excessive. The concert's curtain-raiser was Bartok's Hungarian sketches, an orchestration made in 1931 of piano music composed between 1908 and 1911. Bartok's rhythmic ferocity is only in evidence in the second section, and even here his violence is almost tongue in cheek in his depiction of a dancing bear. Elsewhere the overwhelming impression is of a sequence of modal instrumental solos that seem to hover beyond time and space. The playing throughout was beyond criticism. The Budapest Festival Orchestra, which Fischer founded in 1983, ranks among the most formidable ensembles in the world.",

Relaxed and charismatic, she occupies a musical space with the same inventive idiosyncrasy as Carla Bley. Schneider played two gigs at the weekend with the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra - a prestigious band drawing on the younger generation of that country's best players. This project, Schneider announced, had raised a few eyebrows but it has also led the musicians to classic-jazz reworkings, to projects from Scottish composers and to a commission for US sax star Joe Lovano. </p> <p>Schneider's sumptuous, beautifully crafted, mobile music revealed other pay-offs for such a gamble. Days of Wine and Roses was a typical Schneider reworking of a standard, glowing with subtle tone changes. Waltz for Toots (written for Toots Thielemans) was built from quiet bass beginnings and a swirling dress of a melody - featuring a pure-toned Laura Macdonald soprano sax solo - to splashes of ensemble sound that gathered into the portentous intensity of a hymn. </p> <p>Unlike much jazz big-band music, Schneider's pieces often develop without dependence on the repetition of motifs or riffs; they constantly introduce fresh ideas as they grow, blossoming out of the narrative but providing a symphonic sense of long-range development within the tight confines of a song-like, jazz-structured space. Schneider's conducting is as absorbing to watch as her music is to listen to - it is as expressive as Gil Evans's was, though with a more tightly regulated outcome. </p> <p>Allegresse, from Schneider's new CD, soared over a hypnotically steady rimshot pulse, like funk in a trance, then acquired a darker centre, like an intrusion from Holst's Mars, before trumpeter Tom McNiven and the gifted pianist Brian Kellock began recalling snatches of 1960s Miles Davis/Herbie Hancock dialogues. On The Love Theme From Spartacus, Tommy Smith's flute-like sax sound trembled like grass waving in a wind. Two quirky monster themes brought together Schneider's zigzagging melodic originality and some jazzy big-band fundamentals. That Old Black Magic ran the fast theme over wayward counter-melodies, and My Ideal set an audacious group melody like an orchestrated Charlie Parker solo in the midst of a pensive drifter. Not a synth or a loop for miles, but Schneider's music nevertheless sounds vibrantly of its time.</p>",

I still miss the sly charm of the studio version, but at least audiences around Britain will get an insight into the Bollywood phenomenon, which is even attracting our very own Andrew Lloyd Webber. \u0095 Until March 3. Box office: 020-8741 2311. Then tours to Nottingham, Huddersfield, Bristol, Guildford and Birmingham.",

      "body": "<p>Consider the dislocation. Baroness (Margaret) Jay will be retiring from the cabinet and politics this spring. The leader of the House of Lords is 61, way past her bus pass birthday. She is, it was solemnly explained the other day, the second-oldest member of Tony Blair's top team and wishes to spend more time with her grandchildren. Maybe, when she does, she'll jet out of Heathrow as President Bush's newly appointed secretary for defence jets in and give him a glance. Donald Rumsfeld is 68. George W has just given him a post he first held (for Gerald Ford) in 1976. </p> <p>Nothing about age - even as it relates to those who make our laws and order our lives - makes any sense. Is William Hague, at 39, more widely revered than Ken Clarke at 60? When pundits look at the next Tory leadership stakes, they tend to dismiss Malcolm Rifkind (54) as a blast from the past. But George Bush the younger is 54. All we have here is assumptions and attitudes. Praise be that, at last, they are under the microscope. </p> <p>Grinding into line with Europe, our government has just decided to outlaw any benchmark for involuntary retirement. Farewell to the rigid absurdities of 60, 65 - or even the big 50 (which so many employers still think signals the onset of senility). Welcome to the chance to work and earn on, to life beyond the finality of a pensions' slip. </p> <p>There is, of course, no altruism here. Britain, like the rest of Europe, is ageing fast. People are healthier and living longer - but birth rates are plummeting. Italy and Spain are crucially short of babies, nations shrinking inexorably, failing to replace themselves. And, for all the angst over teenage mums, we are contracting and wizening, too. In actuarial terms, that is hopeless. An ever-smaller working population cannot support the swelling ranks of the retired. </p> <p>But it is also a terrible waste. When you read that one-third of men and women aged between 50 and 65 (a cool 2.8m people) have chosen or are condemned to an \"economic inactivity\" which costs \u00a326bn a year, you see the essential challenge: expand that working population by expanding the age span of work. Back to attitudes and assumptions. </p> <p>Some jobs, of course, have a finite physical stretch. There will be no \u00a33m a season for David Beckham at 35. City dealers under constant pressure notoriously burn themselves out (\"I want to make enough now for when I'm 40 and a postman,\" one said to me recently). But particular problems lack general application. </p> <p>Whatever happened to your friendly local bank manager? I can tell you what happened to mine. He looked in gloom as the branches were closed and merged around him, as his fortysomething brothers were put out to grass, and he worried himself sick about what would happen when he was 50. Inevitably, the axe fell. He got a lump sum and a topped-up pension. And where, three years later, is he today? Working as many days a week for the same bank, bringing experience to bear: paid on contract and, with pension, enjoying the toil of \"early retirement\". </p> <p>Whichever way you cut it, that must be economic rubbish. Yet, through the 80s and 90s, it has been the underlying assumption of so much business hiring and firing. Young is beautiful; grey is ghastly. There's a symbolic virility to spitting out a generation ahead of its time. Hand-in-hand with that, moreover, has gone another equally dodgy assumption - which is that retirement is a lustrous, easeful era full of rest from labours and enjoyment of wider pastures. </p> <p>Trade unions, remember, embraced ever earlier retirement as a benefit, not a penalty. They negotiated better terms, not first principles, and they tended to see extra years with your feet up as just as desirable as a salary rise, a suitable case for settlement. Strangely, almost symbiotically, psychological wear and tear seemed to increase as the retirement age came down. Because policemen, say, were supposed to be past it in their 40s, that decade of their life became prey to sickness, depression and chronic absenteeism. Another self-fulfilling prophecy. </p> <p>Now, perhaps, this whole mindset is out of time and out of fashion. Ministries plead with the nurses of the 70s, who have raised their families, to come back to the wards - and to dedicated teachers to stay in the classroom. A civil service that lowers the boom at 60 looks increasingly stupid. Why pay a cabinet secretary to depart at the height of his powers to run an Oxford college or sit on a dozen lucrative boards? Why arbitrarily strip away at the talent you have, and find damned difficult to replace? </p> <p>Slowly, too slowly, we are beginning to see this issue in the round. People are people, which means people are different. Some will, indeed, embrace the chance to escape and vegetate or do fresh things with the rest of their lives; but some, very definitely, will not - will feel, instead, that they have much to contribute and that continued contributing is one definition of their existence. </p> <p>They will not, necessarily, want to plough exactly the same furrow, but they will want to keep working. And society, as we see, needs them to keep working: an obligation as much as an imposition. </p> <p>I'm not, for heaven's sake, arguing for another kind of inflexibility. Fresh generations always need their turn and there's nothing more disheartening than to go back to a nation and government you knew 30 years ago and find (as I did last year) exactly the same master politician, now 82, still in charge and surrounded by exactly the same acolytes. </p> <p>That isn't progress, in the sense that seeing Shimon Peres (77) back in charge of Israeli foreign affairs, or Ariel Sharon (72) finally running the whole shooting match, isn't progress. Yet individual cases, individually chosen, shed a quite separate light. </p> <p>Picture a movie industry without the inexhaustible Robert Altman (76 today), or even Britain's secondhand chance of an Oscar from the Gladiator, Ridley Scott (63). Hannibal Hopkins is 63 and may soon need his dentures. Picture a theatre without Michael Frayn (67), Tom Stoppard (63), Peter Hall (70) or the 70-year-old Harold Pinter. Picture such an empire as News International without Rupert Murdoch (69) or the wise man he keeps close by, Edward Pickering (88). Who wants a Daily Telegraph without Bill Deedes (87), a Tate exhibition without Peter Blake (67), or a Newcastle United without Bobby Robson (68)? </p> <p>The plain fact, when you look around, is that we are not (as we often tell ourselves) a young country like America. We are the country that hasn't noticed that America has changed. While Tony Blair worries about hair loss and retirement after a second term, George W has chosen a new cabinet with an average age of 57 (and a vice-president who has just reached 60 and has three heart bypasses behind him). While the BBC witters about relegating newsreaders when they turn 50, the American networks are still fronted by Dan Rather's 60s generation. Would Granada keep the mummified Mike Wallace (of 60 Minutes) plodding on towards his 80s? </p> <p>Young country UK has lost the plot. Across the channel in France, Jacques Chirac (68) wants five more years and Konrad Adenauer rebuilt Germany from ashes after 65. The Japanese economic miracle, quite clinically, rested on company chairmen and politicians who were all bus pass candidates. If China is tomorrow's tiger, its leaders are yesterday's men. India's rulers go into politics after they retire from whatever they were doing before. Nelson Mandela is 82. </p> <p>Why should we, virtually alone, be the only ones left who draw hard and fast lines? Why should John Prescott (62) need to spend more time at home with his Jags? Why should judges go on to 70 and bank managers go down the drain at 49? </p> <p>Our government, at last, is asking the questions and pondering the answers, consulting while Help the Aged applauds. But this, I think, isn't simply a pressure group issue - and seeing it that way constrains too narrowly. </p> <p>The heart of the matter is more than a supplemented pension or the chance to keep catching the train to an office. It is about a society that values and includes, a society of flexible friends and opportunities that can always come knocking. Happy tendings, Margaret Jay: I hope you keep busy.</p>",

Ministries plead with the nurses of the 70s, who have raised their families, to come back to the wards - and to dedicated teachers to stay in the classroom. A civil service that lowers the boom at 60 looks increasingly stupid. Why pay a cabinet secretary to depart at the height of his powers to run an Oxford college or sit on a dozen lucrative boards? Why arbitrarily strip away at the talent you have, and find damned difficult to replace? Slowly, too slowly, we are beginning to see this issue in the round. People are people, which means people are different. Some will, indeed, embrace the chance to escape and vegetate or do fresh things with the rest of their lives; but some, very definitely, will not - will feel, instead, that they have much to contribute and that continued contributing is one definition of their existence. They will not, necessarily, want to plough exactly the same furrow, but they will want to keep working. And society, as we see, needs them to keep working: an obligation as much as an imposition. I'm not, for heaven's sake, arguing for another kind of inflexibility. Fresh generations always need their turn and there's nothing more disheartening than to go back to a nation and government you knew 30 years ago and find (as I did last year) exactly the same master politician, now 82, still in charge and surrounded by exactly the same acolytes. That isn't progress, in the sense that seeing Shimon Peres (77) back in charge of Israeli foreign affairs, or Ariel Sharon (72) finally running the whole shooting match, isn't progress. Yet individual cases, individually chosen, shed a quite separate light. Picture a movie industry without the inexhaustible Robert Altman (76 today), or even Britain's secondhand chance of an Oscar from the Gladiator, Ridley Scott (63). Hannibal Hopkins is 63 and may soon need his dentures. Picture a theatre without Michael Frayn (67), Tom Stoppard (63), Peter Hall (70) or the 70-year-old Harold Pinter. Picture such an empire as News International without Rupert Murdoch (69) or the wise man he keeps close by, Edward Pickering (88). Who wants a Daily Telegraph without Bill Deedes (87), a Tate exhibition without Peter Blake (67), or a Newcastle United without Bobby Robson (68)? The plain fact, when you look around, is that we are not (as we often tell ourselves) a young country like America. We are the country that hasn't noticed that America has changed. While Tony Blair worries about hair loss and retirement after a second term, George W has chosen a new cabinet with an average age of 57 (and a vice-president who has just reached 60 and has three heart bypasses behind him). While the BBC witters about relegating newsreaders when they turn 50, the American networks are still fronted by Dan Rather's 60s generation. Would Granada keep the mummified Mike Wallace (of 60 Minutes) plodding on towards his 80s? Young country UK has lost the plot. Across the channel in France, Jacques Chirac (68) wants five more years and Konrad Adenauer rebuilt Germany from ashes after 65. The Japanese economic miracle, quite clinically, rested on company chairmen and politicians who were all bus pass candidates. If China is tomorrow's tiger, its leaders are yesterday's men. India's rulers go into politics after they retire from whatever they were doing before. Nelson Mandela is 82. Why should we, virtually alone, be the only ones left who draw hard and fast lines? Why should John Prescott (62) need to spend more time at home with his Jags? Why should judges go on to 70 and bank managers go down the drain at 49? Our government, at last, is asking the questions and pondering the answers, consulting while Help the Aged applauds. But this, I think, isn't simply a pressure group issue - and seeing it that way constrains too narrowly. The heart of the matter is more than a supplemented pension or the chance to keep catching the train to an office. It is about a society that values and includes, a society of flexible friends and opportunities that can always come knocking. Happy tendings, Margaret Jay: I hope you keep busy.",

      "body": "<p>\"I love to learn,\" said Oscar Wilde, \"I just can't bear to be taught.\" Today, though, we cannot move for teachers of one sort or another - personal trainers, mentors, gurus, consultants. Companies are striving to become \"learning organisations\". Even Who Wants to be a Millionaire? puts a new premium on learnedness. The market for imparting information is booming, with \"webucation\" the latest vehicle. </p> <p>Yet real learning remains a deeply personal experience, and an everyday activity. While schools, colleges and courses are seen as the principal sites of learning, it is at work that the steepest learning curves are conquered. We used to learn, then earn. Now we learn as we earn. </p> <p>Helen Handfield-Jones, who has just polled 6,000 senior US executives for <a href=\"http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com\">McKinsey</a> concludes that \"the kind of training that really makes a difference has nothing to do with programs and everything to do with the informal training that goes on within companies\". </p> <p>We learn best from doing, rather than listening. Some of the best-paid computer programmers in the business are school drop-outs; they learned from hours voluntarily spent glued to a screen. The government has announced that some employees are to get a day off a week for \"training\", which is commendable. But it would be better if they were learning on the other four days. </p> <p>We spend most of our waking hours at work - it is what engages our minds and energies. Once you can do a job without too much difficulty, it gets boring, and satisfaction leads inexorably to dissatisfaction. </p> <p>Handfield-Jones recommends that \"people with high potential should move through a series of challenging jobs, for after two or three years the learning curve in any position tends to flatten out, and capable people start to chafe\". Research from the Institute of Personnel Directors confirms that job satisfaction declines over time. Talent has to be kept on its toes. </p> <p>Jobs are, in any case, changing too rapidly to let us stop learning. What really counts is not the possession of a chunk of knowledge, but the ability to rejuvenate and update skills. Javier Bajer, who heads <a href=\"http://www.talentfoundation.org\">The Talent Foundation</a>, a charity that works to improve learning skills, says our preoccupation with courses and technical skills is misplaced. \"What matters most of all is having the emotional capacity and desire to learn,\" he says. \"Technical skills are disposable - we have to be ready to drop them and pick up new ones.\" </p> <p>Many years ago I dropped a law degree course in favour of geography, causing mild parental consternation: \"What will you do with a geography degree?\" I could never answer that question. But the point was that I experienced the thrill of pursuing ideas that interested me. And work can continue to provide those opportunities - I have certainly learned more from my work than from any course in anything. </p> <p>But learning at work requires a new mindset from workers and firms. It means we as individuals have to have the courage to admit ignorance: remember the Chinese proverb that someone who asks the question is a fool for a day, while the one who never asks is a fool for ever. It also requires companies to reform cultures and performance systems that currently force people to maintain a knowing facade, so that asking \"stupid\" questions is seen for what it really is - as a sign of intelligence and intellectual curiosity. </p> <p>The paramount skill required in the new economy - the capacity to learn - means that the best course to take is ancient history, if ancient history is what turns you on. Paradoxically, the old-fashioned idea of \"learning for learning's sake\" is precisely what the new world of work requires. </p> <p> The Orwellian rhetoric of the modern corporation can hinder effective communication. One large chocolate retailer, for example, bans the use of the word \"problem\". Every problem, executives intone, is an opportunity in disguise. One new recruit, on his second day in the job, rang his boss and said: \"I've got a problem.\" Boss: \"No you haven't. Weren't you listening to the induction course? Ring me back in five minutes with an opportunity.\" Recruit (five minutes later): \"I've got an opportunity.\" Boss: \"That's better. What is it?\" Recruit: \"I have the opportunity to get a new company car.\" Boss: \"How so?\" Recruit: \"I've just written off the one you gave me.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:rreeves@indsoc.co.uk\">rreeves@indsoc.co.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:work@theguardian.com\">work@theguardian.com</a></p>",

We spend most of our waking hours at work - it is what engages our minds and energies. Once you can do a job without too much difficulty, it gets boring, and satisfaction leads inexorably to dissatisfaction. Handfield-Jones recommends that \"people with high potential should move through a series of challenging jobs, for after two or three years the learning curve in any position tends to flatten out, and capable people start to chafe\". Research from the Institute of Personnel Directors confirms that job satisfaction declines over time. Talent has to be kept on its toes. Jobs are, in any case, changing too rapidly to let us stop learning. What really counts is not the possession of a chunk of knowledge, but the ability to rejuvenate and update skills. Javier Bajer, who heads The Talent Foundation, a charity that works to improve learning skills, says our preoccupation with courses and technical skills is misplaced. \"What matters most of all is having the emotional capacity and desire to learn,\" he says. \"Technical skills are disposable - we have to be ready to drop them and pick up new ones.\" Many years ago I dropped a law degree course in favour of geography, causing mild parental consternation: \"What will you do with a geography degree?\" I could never answer that question. But the point was that I experienced the thrill of pursuing ideas that interested me. And work can continue to provide those opportunities - I have certainly learned more from my work than from any course in anything. But learning at work requires a new mindset from workers and firms. It means we as individuals have to have the courage to admit ignorance: remember the Chinese proverb that someone who asks the question is a fool for a day, while the one who never asks is a fool for ever. It also requires companies to reform cultures and performance systems that currently force people to maintain a knowing facade, so that asking \"stupid\" questions is seen for what it really is - as a sign of intelligence and intellectual curiosity. The paramount skill required in the new economy - the capacity to learn - means that the best course to take is ancient history, if ancient history is what turns you on. Paradoxically, the old-fashioned idea of \"learning for learning's sake\" is precisely what the new world of work requires. The Orwellian rhetoric of the modern corporation can hinder effective communication. One large chocolate retailer, for example, bans the use of the word \"problem\". Every problem, executives intone, is an opportunity in disguise. One new recruit, on his second day in the job, rang his boss and said: \"I've got a problem.\" Boss: \"No you haven't. Weren't you listening to the induction course? Ring me back in five minutes with an opportunity.\" Recruit (five minutes later): \"I've got an opportunity.\" Boss: \"That's better. What is it?\" Recruit: \"I have the opportunity to get a new company car.\" Boss: \"How so?\" Recruit: \"I've just written off the one you gave me.\" \u0095 Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society. rreeves@indsoc.co.uk work@theguardian.com",

Rivals are also certain to point out that while Nationwide and Halifax are focusing their attention on standard variable rates, an increasing number of homeowners are on specialised deals, such as fixed or discounted rates. Even with its mortgage rate cut, City analysts calculated that the Nationwide's rate was still profitable. They said the lenders' rate is still above the Bank of England's base rate of 5.75% and none have improved the rates on savings. As a building society, the Nationwide's members will carry the cost of the reduction, while Halifax's shareholders will be expected to take the hit. The former building society, which became a bank four years ago, is due to publish its profits figures today. It has already warned the City that it expects its profits margins to be damaged by a battle for customers. Halifax's existing 2.5m customers who want to take advantage of the new rate will not automatically be transferred but have to apply. The company refused to comment.
