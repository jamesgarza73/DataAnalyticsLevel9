      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is searching for a successful entrepreneur to play a high-profile role in the election after Labour officials privately admitted the party's campaign planning has slipped behind schedule. Senior figures in the Millbank HQ blame the pressure on ministers of running the government for missing a pre-Christmas deadline to finalise strategy for an election that could be in May. The prime minister and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, regard an endorsement from a well known industrialist or financier as crucial to persuading former Tory voters that Labour has run the country well. The Granada boss Gerry Robinson played that role in 1997 and could be asked to do it again if Millbank fails to come up with a successor. The Labour peer Clive Hollick is to suggest possible names after meetings with Mr Blair and the general secretary, Margaret McDonagh. The relative lack of preparedness is in sharp contrast to last time round, when Labour's campaign was in place by mid-1996, nearly a year before John Major went to the polls in May 1997. A senior figure said Labour had to be prepared for a snap election in the summer or autumn of 1996. \"Government is very different to opposition. Blair, Brown, [Peter] Mandelson and other ministers need to spend time getting the delivery of policies right as well as planning the campaign.\" The prime minister is expected to go for a short campaign of no more than four weeks to deny William Hague the opportunity of getting a bandwagon moving. Key personnel have been in place since early 2000 with Mr Brown and the Northern Ireland secretary, Mr Mandelson, reunited at the head of the campaign despite their personal and political rivalries. Mr Blair will embark on the traditional nationwide tour as Mr Brown, chairman of election strategy, fronts the morning London media conferences and Mr Mandelson, chairman of election planning, plays a backroom role. As well as persuading a new entrepreneur to endorse Labour, a series of other issues are outstanding - from the crucial, such as the manifesto, to the quest for a theme song to replace the last election's Things Can Only Get Better. May 3 is still thought to be the favoured date with the campaign launched on the back of a three-day conference in Glasgow in the middle of February, a budget promising targeted tax cuts in early March and a string of giveaways, including a new child tax credit, in pay and benefit packets from April. Labour strategists anticipate challenges on three fronts. The Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats will present themselves as alternatives on the left while the Tories and the UK Independence party will attack from the right. Apathy, which Labour fears could cost up to 60 seats, is also a threat. A \u00a320m per party spending limit will change the face of the campaign. Both major parties spent more than that in 1997 when the Conservatives spent \u00a313m on advertising alone. The Tories are similarly unprepared and less ready to fight an election than Labour was at this point before the 1997 contest. They have not yet raised the \u00a320m needed to spend up to the legal limit.

      "bodyText": "George Carman QC was the lawyer everyone wanted on their side. So much so that, when former Tory cabinet minister Jonathan Aitken started his libel action against the Guardian in April 1995, editor Alan Rusbridger said: \"We'd better get Carman - before Aitken gets him.\" Quite simply, he struck fear into the hearts of those standing before him in the witness box. Born on October 6, 1929, in Blackpool, the barrister achieved notable courtroom victories both as a criminal lawyer and, later, in libel actions. His ambitions first centred on the priesthood, but he later decided instead to go to Oxford University to read law. From there, he worked on the northern circuit before moving to London. Nicknamed Gorgeous George or Killer Carman, three-times-married Mr Carman became one of Britain's most respected courtroom performers. Standing 5ft 3in tall, Mr Carman was donnish, bespectacled and always courteous - even when he was taking a witness apart. He was variously described as \"smooth and silky\", \"the master of the soundbite\" and \"past master of the wink, wink, nudge, nudge\". He used his considerable skills to grill politicians, soap stars and sportsmen alike in the witness box. Mr Carman reportedly bet journalists covering the 1981 acquittal of Dr Leonard Arthur that he would make a juror cry within 10 minutes of starting his closing speech - a bet he collected after a woman wiped away a tear on nine minutes 30 seconds. Dr Arthur was cleared of murdering a Down's syndrome baby after prescribing nursing care only for the child. Always something of an outsider, Mr Carman never became part of the legal establishment and never became a judge, saying that he would find it hard to keep quiet on the bench and preferred the \"blood and sand of the arena\". Jonathan Aitken, cricketer Ian Botham and EastEnders star Gillian Taylforth all came under scrutiny during his relentless cross-examinations. It was his 1979 defence of former Liberal party leader Jeremy Thorpe, who was acquitted of attempting to murder gay model Norman Scott, which first propelled Mr Carman into the legal limelight. Following Mr Thorpe's acquittal, Mr Carman took on a number of high-profile criminal trials, including in 1988 actress Maria Aitken -sister of Jonathan Aitken - who was cleared of smuggling cocaine and, in 1989, comedian Ken Dodd, who was cleared of tax charges. Moving into libel actions during the 1990s, Mr Carman became known for his last-minute flourishes. One of his most famous successes was in the action brought in 1994 against the Sun newspaper by actor Ms Taylforth, over a report about an alleged act of indecency between her and her fiance Geoff Knights in a Range Rover car on a slipway off the A1. She failed in her action. In 1993, Mr Carman successfully defended the peer the Marquis of Bristol against heroin and cocaine charges. After hearing Mr Carman shoot holes in the prosecution case, the judge ordered the jury to find him not guilty. In 1996, cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan hired Mr Carman to defend him in a libel case brought by England cricketing legends Ian Botham and Allan Lamb. Mr Botham and Mr Lamb attempted to sue Mr Khan after he said that illegal ball tampering was common among fast bowlers. They also sued him over a newspaper article in which he allegedly accused them of racism, being uneducated and lacking class and upbringing. The pair lost. Commonly a friend of newspapers, as well as foe, Mr Carman triggered Mr Aitken's downfall during the Tory politician's libel action against the Guardian. In this case Mr Carman, representing the Guardian and Granada, produced last-minute documents regarding Mr Aitken's stay at the Paris Ritz, and asked to re-examine Mr Aitken on the matter. He highlighted suspicions that Mr Aitken had lied under oath - starting a process that eventually saw the former Tory minister jailed. On another occasion, in 1997, Mr Carman again won a case for the Guardian by defeating a libel claim from five Metropolitan police officers, who said that they had been identified in a corruption investigation, despite not being named. His last big victory came at the end of 1998 when another former Tory minister Neil Hamilton failed in his marathon libel battle Mohammed Al Fayed. Like many before him, the Harrod's tycoon had called Mr Carman when the case came along. And, also like many before him, he picked a winner.

      "body": "<b>So who is Labour's mystery benefactor?</b> <br>Paul Hamlyn, a publishing magnate and life peer. <p><b>Did he have to identify himself?</b><br>No. Technically, by banking the money before Christmas, Labour would have postponed the need to disclose the benefactor and scale of donation. Under the current rules the names of donors need not be revealed until the autumn, when the party's annual accounts are published, listing people who have given more than \u00a35,000. </p> <p><b>Then why did Lord Hamlyn come forward?</b><br>He said he had decided to make his gift public although he was under no obligation to do so. But Labour had faced mounting criticism because the money had been banked before its own anti-sleaze legislation comes into force on February 16. </p> <p><b>Has Lord Hamlyn given Labour money in the past?</b><br>Yes. He is believed to have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the party.</p> <p><b>Why did he receive a peerage?</b><br>There is no suggestion that the millionaire publisher's peerage is linked to his donations to Labour. When he was made a life peer two years ago it was stressed that the award recognised his charity work. </p> <p><b>Why is the issue of donations important?</b><br>Money and power have always had a fraught relationship where the suspicion of buying favour is concerned. Labour was anxious to avoid a repeat of the Bernie Ecclestone affair. </p> <p><b>What happened then?</b><br>Within months of Labour's landslide election victory in 1997, the Formula 1 chief gave \u00a31m to Labour. After the donation the government relaxed proposed rules which would have curtailed tobacco advertising within the sport.

      "bodyText": "So who is Labour's mystery benefactor? Paul Hamlyn, a publishing magnate and life peer. Did he have to identify himself? No. Technically, by banking the money before Christmas, Labour would have postponed the need to disclose the benefactor and scale of donation. Under the current rules the names of donors need not be revealed until the autumn, when the party's annual accounts are published, listing people who have given more than \u00a35,000. Then why did Lord Hamlyn come forward? He said he had decided to make his gift public although he was under no obligation to do so. But Labour had faced mounting criticism because the money had been banked before its own anti-sleaze legislation comes into force on February 16. Has Lord Hamlyn given Labour money in the past? Yes. He is believed to have donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the party. Why did he receive a peerage? There is no suggestion that the millionaire publisher's peerage is linked to his donations to Labour. When he was made a life peer two years ago it was stressed that the award recognised his charity work. Why is the issue of donations important? Money and power have always had a fraught relationship where the suspicion of buying favour is concerned. Labour was anxious to avoid a repeat of the Bernie Ecclestone affair. What happened then? Within months of Labour's landslide election victory in 1997, the Formula 1 chief gave \u00a31m to Labour. After the donation the government relaxed proposed rules which would have curtailed tobacco advertising within the sport. The prime minister, Tony Blair, felt it necessary to return the donation after a storm of criticism. Who was calling for this year's donor to be named? Many Labour MPs, including former transport minister Glenda Jackson, ex-defence minister Peter Kilfoyle, and Clive Soley, chairman of the parliamentary Labour party. The Tories accused Labour of \"hypocrisy\". Many Conservatives are still bitter about the way Labour managed to portray them as sleaze-ridden during the last election. The Neil Hamilton cash-for-questions affair and Jonathan Aitken's downfall did the Tories lasting damage. A leader in today's Times newspaper said: \"A party with nothing to hide would surely grasp the chance, especially with an election looming, to show its commitment to the spirit as well as the letter of its own legislation.\" Are there other instances where Labour has faced criticism over sleaze? The terms apparently offered to Legacy, the consortium run by Robert Bourne, in its \"preferred bid\" for the site of the vacated Millennium Dome have been attacked as being too favourable. Mr Bourne has given substantial donations to Labour, including to the constituency of Chris Smith, the culture secretary. When science minister Lord Sainsbury gave \u00a32m to the party in 1999 - setting a new record - he revealed the fact and many commentators and politicians regarded this as the way to conduct donations in the future. How are Britain's political parties funded? In the past, the Tories have attracted big business donors, with their coffers dwarfing the funds given by trades unions to Labour. But unions have threatened to cut their contributions to Labour's general election campaign by \u00a34m. There had been hopes within Labour of receiving \u00a310m from the unions but this is now reported to be more likely to be nearer to \u00a36m. Labour spent a record \u00a325m on its 1997 campaign. About \u00a38m of that was donated from trades unions. Labour was also attracting unprecedented funding from the private sector and individual businessmen. Is Labour likely to attract similar sums? No. Contributions are drying up, potential donors fearing negative publicity of the type suffered by Mr Ecclestone. And Labour's grass-roots supporters are feeling both disillusioned with the Labour party and confident that it will win the election irrespective of the size of union donations. And are there further restrictions now in place? Yes. New laws impose a \u00a320m cap on how much a political party can spend on campaigning - and there is now a growing possibility that both the major parties will underspend as they struggle to attract funds. The Tory treasurer, Lord Ashcroft of Chichester, recently attempted to lower the proposed \u00a320m election spending cap to \u00a313m, prompting fresh doubts about the Conservatives' ability to fund their campaign. The Conservatives have been reliant on Lord Ashcroft's own donations of around \u00a35m since the last election, have a \u00a39m overdraft and are also having trouble raising money from big donors. Lord Ashcroft was embroiled in scandal this year when a cross-party committee of peers to barred him from sitting in the House of Lords until he started to pay full British taxes.

Seven cars were believed to have been caught in the landslip, which struck at just after 11.30am, on a long stretch of road which winds its way down to the beach at Nefyn on the remote Lleyn peninsula. Two of the cars were reported to have been swept at least 40ft down towards the sea and were left sticking out of the mud as emergency services launched a major rescue operation in the face of an incoming tide. North Wales Fire Service said that some of the cars involved had been left hanging precariously over the edge of the damaged road following the incident. The woman who died was recovered by a lifeboat but declared dead at the lifeboat base at nearby Porthdinllaen. The man was flown by RAF helicopter to Gwynedd hospital in nearby Bangor with serious, though not life threatening, injuries. A North Wales Police spokesman later said that there were no reports of any further casualties. \"The clear-up operation is under way and will continue during the afternoon, as will the search of the rubble by the search and rescue dogs,\" he added. Police were interviewing witnesses to discover exactly what happened in the landslide. Coastguards warned people to stay away from the area as the rescue operation went on. A spokeswoman for Gwynedd council said torrential rain over the last few months was thought to have caused the landslide in the cliff. \"The problem is all the coast in that particular area is of clay and sand so you can imagine the effect of tremendous rain over the last few months,\" she said. There had been another, smaller slide in the same area over the Christmas period. HM Coastguard Cliff Rescue teams were scrambled to the scene, together with a lifeboat and RAF and police helicopters. A fire service spokesman said a specialist rescue vehicle from the fire station at Caernarfon was called to the scene in addition to two crews from the seaside town of Pwllheli. \"We understand that ambulance personnel rescued one casualty from one vehicle and we have rescued two persons from the other vehicle. \"Our officer at the scene says there is a danger of further landslides. The area is not yet fully secure. This is a major operation for all the emergency services,\" the spokesman added. Today's tragedy comes less than a week after cliffs along one mile of the Dorset coastline slid into the sea. Although no one was injured during the collapse near Charmouth last Wednesday, Dorset police warned people to stay away and fenced off the surrounding area. The clay and soil covered beach has been attracting tourists and a police helicopter had to be scrambled to order fossil hunters away from the area. Dorset Police spokesman Mike Maber said that he hoped the tragedy in north Wales would alert people to the dangers still present in the Charmouth area. Weather experts said the combination of heavy rain, freezing temperatures and rough seas were the likely cause of the recent landslides. \"The heavy rain over the past 36 hours will have saturated the mud on the cliffs in north Wales,\" said a PA WeatherCentre spokesman.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The story of Lexie McConnell's death has the horrifying inexorability of Greek tragedy, chilling to the heart of anyone with a child. Lexie was nine. She was a happy, bright and extrovert girl. Her parents nurtured and protected her, as good parents do. But they were powerless to save her. In trying to do the best for her, they were led to do the worst. She died because her immune system had been destroyed by drugs her mother gave her on the doctor's orders for a minor eye infection, crushed and mixed with honey to make them more palatable. </p> <p>What makes it so terrible is that they knew something was gravely wrong and struggled against the reassurances of the medical profession. They are still struggling - for an admission that doctors got it wrong, and to safeguard the children of the future. </p> <p>Lexie's parents say it is surprising they are still alive. Her father, Art, was once a successful violinist. Now he plays only for friends. Eight years after his little girl died, his face is marked with grief even when he smiles. He cannot relate the way she died without breaking down. Lexie's artist mother, Vicky, is calmer, but tells of the unspeakable horror of the realisation that she, under doctors' orders, may have fatally damaged her child. </p> <p>For the first time, they feel able to tell their whole story, following the lifting of a \"gagging order\" agreed between their lawyers and the lawyers for the hospital where Lexie died. They were given \u00a3100,000 as an out-of-court settlement of their legal case against the Oxfordshire health authority and the John Radcliffe Hospital, but with some stringent conditions attached - not to talk to the press and not to pursue their complaint to the General Medical Council against the doctors who treated their daughter. The health authority and the NHS Litigation Authority vehemently deny demanding any sort of condition, saying the gagging agreement was offered out of the blue, drawn up by the McConnells' own lawyers. </p> <p>Regardless, Art and Vicky McConnell do not intend to keep silent. They don't have the three things they want: an explanation, an apology and an assurance that no child will ever again be treated in the way that Lexie was. \"We won't rest without knowing that all drugs used on children have been tested prop erly for safety,\" says Art. \"I can see us carrying on for the rest of our lives.\" </p> <p>The couple live in Abingdon, near Oxford, where they moved from Wales the year before Lexie died. Art had been head of strings at the College of Music and Drama in Cardiff, but wanted to be nearer London. Lexie, whose given name was Alexandra, had got over her homesickness, had loads of friends, was top of her class at school and was showing a talent for the piano, says her father. </p> <p>In July 1992 at sports day she was hit in the left eye hard with a tennis ball. She was crying and in pain for about 20 minutes and her vision was blurred, but then she recovered. Nobody thought any more about it. \"We were on holiday in August on the Isle of Wight and Lex said to me one morning, 'Dad - I've got a bit of blur in my left eye',\" says Art. \"She'd discovered it because she and her friend were playing opticians and they were reading an eye chart that they had drawn up. </p> <p>\"It sounds so extraordinary, the whole thing. Two months later she was dead, and this is how it started.\" </p> <p>The GP sent Lexie to a consultant paediatric neurologist at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford rather than an opthalmologist, in case the problem was not with the eye at all. But a brain scan and a lumbur puncture showed nothing. The consultant decided something was causing inflammation, probably congenital toxoplasmosis - an organism that can damage the retina. </p> <p>The consultant prescribed steroids and antibiotics. Art knew somebody whose face had swollen up on steroids and asked if there were any side effects. \"He said any drug can have side-effects, even paracetemol,\" says Vicky. </p> <p>Lexie was put on 80mg a day of the steroid prednisolone. The British National Formulary - the prescribing bible used by doctors - recommended at the time a maximum dose of 60mg for adults with serious disease, and that only for short periods with a reduction in the dose after a few days. Like most drugs, steroids are not licensed for use in children. Doctors have to use their judgement based on the information available. Much of that information is provided by drug manufacturers after clinical trials. But few trials are carried out on children. </p> <p>Lexie was put on 80mg a day for three weeks and five days. She was also taking 4g a day of sulphadiazine and 25mg of pyrimethamine. Both antibiotics are recommended for toxoplasmosis - unlike the steroids - but can affect the liver. </p> <p>It isn't easy for a nine-year-old child to take 24 tablets a day, and some of them were large. \"They were like horse pills,\" says Vicky. \"I had to crush them up in honey. It was a Friday when she had her first prescription. Within 24 hours she was feeling very nauseous and had a terrible headache.\" </p> <p>She gestures to the green sofa where Lexie lay all night, in case she wanted to be sick. \"She was on the sofa, and I was sitting in the chair next to her trying to get some sleep and I looked and I could almost see her face swelling. I thought - poor kid - after all this and she's got mumps.\" </p> <p>It wasn't mumps. The next day Art was immediately convinced Lexie was reacting to the drugs. They called the GP, who agreed that might be the cause of the swelling, but said he would check with the consultant. Art and Vicky phoned every day for an answer. Eventually, a week after Lexie began taking the tablets, Vicky went to the surgery where a locum called the hospital and got confirmation that the prescription was right. Who from, Vicky does not know. They asked more than once whether Lexie could stop taking the pills, but were told it was dangerous to give up steroids. The body goes into shock unless they are withdrawn gradually. </p> <p>Lexie had hardly been to school since she started the drugs. Sometimes she felt too ill. Sometimes she would say she was well enough in the morning, only to be sent home. She was lethargic and put on a gross amount of weight to the point where her father could no longer lift her. The consultant confirmed that she was \"cushiongoid\" - that she had swollen up as a reaction to steroids. Her parents were eaten up with anxiety. </p> <p>\"At one point I was so upset I threw the whole lot of pills across the kitchen and said I can't do this,\" says Vicky. Art picks up from her - they pass the story from one to the other. \"I put her to bed and I said Vick, it is almost as if we are poisoning our own child. She said yes, I know.\" </p> <p>\"We were trying not to upset each other,\" says Vicky. \"Right from the moment they are born, you feed them the right things and give them vegetables and wash your hands after you have been to the loo and yet we felt we were the ones who were poisoning her.\" </p> <p>After one of the weekly visits to the consultant, Lexie complained of stomach pain. It got so bad she couldn't walk. When the GP arrived, he prodded her stomach and suggested it was constipation. In fact, she had the liver disease hepatitis. </p> <p>Vicky rang the surgery again in the night and the on-call GP had Lexie admitted to hospital, but the constipation diagnosis went with her. The hospital doctor told the couple to go home and leave Lexie. \"She was nine years-old and frightened. I wasn't going home,\" says Vicky. \"That really put his back up. He thought he was looking at a spoilt brat making a fuss because she was constipated. She was crying in pain. I went to the doctor to tell him and he turned his back on me.\" At the inquest, he apologised. He was not the only doctor to dismiss the parents' anxieties. A consultant paediatrician the next morning wrote in Lexie's notes: \"Neurotic mother winding up child.\" </p> <p>By then, spots were rapidly spreading across Lexie's body. This was no rash. Lexie's parents had a meeting with her consultant and another paediatrician. They were told their daughter had a herpes infection that could be a cold sore or it could be chicken pox. Either way, the virus had spread throughout her body and her damaged immune system was struggling to fight it off. The doctors told them she could die. Lexie went into intensive care. She was bleeding from every orifice, but still cheerful. She was not allowed to eat or drink, so she asked for a tin of banana milkshake by her bed as something to look forward to for when she recovered. It wasn't to be. </p> <p>\"It got worse and worse,\" says Art. \"The consultant came in one time and I said to him very gently, 'This is madness. We brought in our child for a relatively minor eye infection and she is fighting for her life'.\" That night, Lexie died. </p> <p>One good thing came out of her death - a warning was issued that chicken pox can be fatal to those on steroids after the coroner pointed up the danger at the inquest. But, says Art, anything could have killed Lexie. Her immune system had been destroyed. And then there was the liver damage and the possibility that the blow to the eye may have caused the blurring, which would have cleared up without treatment. </p> <p>The McConnells blame the arrogance of doctors, who they say would not listen to them. They allege their daughter was given an overdose of drugs that were not generally recommended in the medical literature for toxoplasmosis. They have joined the growing numbers of parents and doctors who want to see medicines properly tested and licensed for use in children. The chances of it happening are slim. It would cost pharmaceutical companies a lot of money to carry out those tests. While doctors are willing to prescribe drugs \"off label\", there is no incentive. </p> <p>The McConnells have harried the Oxfordshire health authority and the Oxford Radcliffe hospitals NHS trust and were at one point offered an inquiry. They turned it down, because, they say, it would not have been public and they could not have put the questions they wanted to the doctors. </p> <p>The McConnells sued for post-traumatic stress disorder in hopes of having their case heard in public. They were given \u00a3100,000 without a hearing. The health authority says the money was paid rather than incur the costs of a court case and to end the stress on its medical staff. In a statement it said: \"The health authority has at all times maintained, and does maintain, that Lexie's death was not caused by any negligence or want of care on its part.\" </p> <p>It won't end there. The McConnells are now taking their complaints against the doctors to the GMC. \"The obsession for justice and fair play for your child is overwhelming,\" says Art. \"You feel as a parent not just that you are being betrayed, but your child is being betrayed by dishonesty.\" </p> <p>The medical profession may say it is reforming itself and opening up to the public, but it has failed to answer parents' demands for an investigation into the prescribing of medicines to children. Until parents like these can feel they have been dealt with fairly, it has a long way to go.</p>",

The McConnells are now taking their complaints against the doctors to the GMC. \"The obsession for justice and fair play for your child is overwhelming,\" says Art. \"You feel as a parent not just that you are being betrayed, but your child is being betrayed by dishonesty.\" The medical profession may say it is reforming itself and opening up to the public, but it has failed to answer parents' demands for an investigation into the prescribing of medicines to children. Until parents like these can feel they have been dealt with fairly, it has a long way to go.",

How the sight of their dying father with a triple-bore central line sticking out of his blood-soaked neck, and his groin betraying the scars of my traumatic practice runs at inserting a femoral arterial line, his chest covered in electrode pads, being used as a coffee table for bits of equipment, and his trousers lying in half on the trolley beneath him . . . how it all might be too disturbing for the relatives. </p> <p>To be honest, the sound of them in tears outside the door, demanding to be let in, is often the only thing that can bring home what exactly is unfolding before me, and that alone feels like a good enough reason not to let them in, because you don't want to think about that kind of thing when the registrar is barking out instructions and you're trying to get arterial blood gases off quickly enough to impress the anaesthetist so that he'll talk you through the next patient's femoral arterial line (get to do a few yourself, it looks great on the CV). </p> <p>Gradually, by subterfuge, these episodes are changing me, or at least cleaving off my work persona from the boy next door I imagine I must still be. The process of depersonalisation that starts in casualty is just as real on the wards. You cannot rely on innate charm with patients at three in the morning, and you cannot afford to take it personally when that notoriously unhelpful nurse on 7E starts bouncing up and down and giving you grief about somebody else's blood form. </p> <p>Sometimes I am astonished to catch myself on autopilot, asking nothing but pertinent questions (I kid you not), smiling away, almost completely unaware of the fact that I am talking to a person and not a box with \"query unstable angina\" written on its forehead, who may or may not need IV isoket and heparin depending on how highly it scores on the tick list in my head. The rare occasions when I offend or cause distress are the times when I am foolish enough to chance my luck at just being myself. </p> <p>But the strangest thing is that this hugely effective depersonalisation of the patients, this reinvention of myself as a walking bedside manner, is exactly what I have started to do to myself, as the only way to stave off the powerful inner drive towards self-pity and resentment of the NHS, and how it has ruined my life. </p> <p>It is a resentment that has cut even deeper over the festive period, when everyone else is at home watching It's a Wonderful Life on the sofa with their mum and dad, and the only way to cope is to make yourself love the job, by buying into the delusory self- sacrificing herd mentality of junior doctors, where nothing outside the hospital matters any more, where you do not expect to have a life, where friends are a thing of the past, where disasters are a challenge and where you have to love your work because to expect anything more from life is to court disappointment. So this is what I have learned this year, more than how to manage myocardial infarction: how to stop the patients from punishing me, how to cope with evil politics on the ward, and how to stop taking it as a personal affront or judgment on my character when a patient gets ill. </p> <p>So if I grit my teeth hard enough, the festive period (which was anything but) was a delight. The day after Boxing Day A&amp;E was full to boiling, and the casualty sister was sending patients up to the admissions ward (about a million miles away, since you ask) before they had even been seen.

      "body": "<p><strong> Mood swings </strong><br> </p> <p>Q: I have been taking Microgynon for five months, and though I experienced premenstrual moodiness before, now I feel quite unstable and the mood swings are very severe. What do we know about how mood is affected by birth-control pills? </p> <p>A: Premenstrual mood swings (PMS) are sometimes cured by the contraceptive pill, and sometimes they're not. Although the pill stops ovulation, the progestogen part of the pill can make PMS worse. Other options to reduce PMS include eating high-carbohydrate foods every three hours to keep blood-sugar levels stable, exercise and using vitamin and mineral supplements which include vitamin B6 and magnesium. The evidence for these strategies is limited but they may be worth a try. Evening primrose oil is good for breast tenderness and may help mood swings too. Anti-depressants such as Prozac or drugs to stop ovulation can be prescribed if you are desperate. </p> <p><strong> Lead in the water </strong><br> </p> <p>Q: I have recently moved into an old Edwardian house with lead pipes and wonder whether we should replace them with plastic ones to avoid the risk of lead poisoning for our young children. How do I know whether it's necessary? </p> <p>A: Too much lead in the water is bad for the developing nervous systems of unborn babies and young children. So pregnant women and young kids may be at risk if lead levels in your water are high. The water companies have a legal obligation to keep lead levels below 50 micrograms/litre. And there's a new EU directive to ensure that these levels are halved by 2003 and down to 10 micrograms/litre by the end of 2013, which makes you wonder how safe our current levels really are. There is a very good leaflet called Lead in Drinking Water, available from the Drinking Water Inspectorate (020-7944 5956) or from their website at <a href=\"http://www.dwi.detr.gov.uk.  \">www.dwi.detr.gov.uk. </a> </p> <p><strong> Hearing loss</strong><br> </p> <p>Q: I'm 68 and my hearing's going. The TV is a mumble and I often find it hard to hear what people are saying to me if there's a lot of background noise. I hate the idea of sporting a hearing aid. Can you suggest anything?</p> <p>A: If it's any comfort, half of all people over 60 have hearing loss due to advancing years. The fancy term is \"presbyacusis\" and it's due to deterioration of the tiny hair cells in the inner ear. It becomes hard to distinguish sounds so people seem to be mumbling, you may not catch names or phone numbers, noisy places become a nightmare, listening takes a lot of concentration and you may give up and withdraw into yourself. TV or music may sound very loud even though you can't differentiate individual words. On the positive side, the vast majority of those with presbyacusis benefit from a hearing aid. The first step is to get formal hearing tests (audiometry) via your GP, an ENT specialist or local hearing aid centre. There is a wide range of hearing aids now available, especially in the private sector. They can be fitted behind the ear, within the ear, buried deeply in the ear canal, or built into your specs so no one knows you're wearing one. </p> <p><strong> Is it safe to fly? </strong><br> </p> <p>Q: I'm pregnant and want to go on holiday. Is it safe to fly? </p> <p>A:There's no evidence that air travel is dangerous for your developing baby, despite the fall in oxygen that occurs during a flight. If you are very anaemic, this fall in oxygen could theoretically be harmful for mother and baby alike so you'd be well advised to wait until your blood count is near normal. Airlines don't want you to give birth mid-flight - they're quite busy enough pushing those trolleys up and down the aisles - so they won't usually let you fly beyond 34 weeks. You are at increased risk of thrombosis while pregnant, so you should take care to walk around at least once an hour, have plenty of non-alcoholic drinks and move your legs around while sitting. Don't take aspirin - it's not good for the baby. </p> <p>If you're going somewhere exotic, you'll want special advice about vaccines and avoiding infections. British Airways Travel Clinics, tel: 01276 685040. </p> <p><strong> Memory loss</strong><br> </p> <p>Q: My husband's getting slightly depressed about a serious deterioration in his memory (he is 67). His GP has prescribed anti-depressants, which may deal with the depression, but not with the cause of it.

      "bodyText": "Mood swings Q: I have been taking Microgynon for five months, and though I experienced premenstrual moodiness before, now I feel quite unstable and the mood swings are very severe. What do we know about how mood is affected by birth-control pills? A: Premenstrual mood swings (PMS) are sometimes cured by the contraceptive pill, and sometimes they're not. Although the pill stops ovulation, the progestogen part of the pill can make PMS worse. Other options to reduce PMS include eating high-carbohydrate foods every three hours to keep blood-sugar levels stable, exercise and using vitamin and mineral supplements which include vitamin B6 and magnesium. The evidence for these strategies is limited but they may be worth a try. Evening primrose oil is good for breast tenderness and may help mood swings too. Anti-depressants such as Prozac or drugs to stop ovulation can be prescribed if you are desperate. Lead in the water Q: I have recently moved into an old Edwardian house with lead pipes and wonder whether we should replace them with plastic ones to avoid the risk of lead poisoning for our young children. How do I know whether it's necessary? A: Too much lead in the water is bad for the developing nervous systems of unborn babies and young children. So pregnant women and young kids may be at risk if lead levels in your water are high. The water companies have a legal obligation to keep lead levels below 50 micrograms/litre. And there's a new EU directive to ensure that these levels are halved by 2003 and down to 10 micrograms/litre by the end of 2013, which makes you wonder how safe our current levels really are. There is a very good leaflet called Lead in Drinking Water, available from the Drinking Water Inspectorate (020-7944 5956) or from their website at www.dwi.detr.gov.uk. Hearing loss Q: I'm 68 and my hearing's going. The TV is a mumble and I often find it hard to hear what people are saying to me if there's a lot of background noise. I hate the idea of sporting a hearing aid. Can you suggest anything? A: If it's any comfort, half of all people over 60 have hearing loss due to advancing years. The fancy term is \"presbyacusis\" and it's due to deterioration of the tiny hair cells in the inner ear. It becomes hard to distinguish sounds so people seem to be mumbling, you may not catch names or phone numbers, noisy places become a nightmare, listening takes a lot of concentration and you may give up and withdraw into yourself. TV or music may sound very loud even though you can't differentiate individual words. On the positive side, the vast majority of those with presbyacusis benefit from a hearing aid. The first step is to get formal hearing tests (audiometry) via your GP, an ENT specialist or local hearing aid centre. There is a wide range of hearing aids now available, especially in the private sector. They can be fitted behind the ear, within the ear, buried deeply in the ear canal, or built into your specs so no one knows you're wearing one. Is it safe to fly? Q: I'm pregnant and want to go on holiday. Is it safe to fly? A:There's no evidence that air travel is dangerous for your developing baby, despite the fall in oxygen that occurs during a flight. If you are very anaemic, this fall in oxygen could theoretically be harmful for mother and baby alike so you'd be well advised to wait until your blood count is near normal. Airlines don't want you to give birth mid-flight - they're quite busy enough pushing those trolleys up and down the aisles - so they won't usually let you fly beyond 34 weeks. You are at increased risk of thrombosis while pregnant, so you should take care to walk around at least once an hour, have plenty of non-alcoholic drinks and move your legs around while sitting. Don't take aspirin - it's not good for the baby. If you're going somewhere exotic, you'll want special advice about vaccines and avoiding infections. British Airways Travel Clinics, tel: 01276 685040. Memory loss Q: My husband's getting slightly depressed about a serious deterioration in his memory (he is 67). His GP has prescribed anti-depressants, which may deal with the depression, but not with the cause of it. Is treating the memory loss too expensive, or does the GP think there is nothing he can do? A: Memory loss due to dementia is relatively rare in men of your husband's age, whereas depression is more common. Both can cause memory loss, although in depression, the memory loss fluctuates depending on mood, and in dementia the memory loss is progressive. Depressed people are often very worried about memory loss, have been depressed in the past, may have been recently bereaved, and seem unable to enjoy life. Dementia may start with short-term memory loss so that recent events are hard to recall, while childhood memories remain clear. But the gradual disintegration of personality gradually sets in with inability to get dressed, self-neglect, inability to recognise people and objects and eventually loss of language, continence and behavioural norms. If you think your husband is not improving on the anti-depressants, that his memory is getting worse and that these other features of dementia are setting in, you should insist on a referral to a psychiatrist or neurologist who runs a memory clinic. They will be able to use a formal method of assessing memory such as the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and order other tests if needed.",

Earlier this year, for the first time since the second world war, far-right demonstrators made a point of marching through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Comparisons were immediately drawn with the Nazis' torchlight processions under the same arch, but what was overlooked was that the Brandenburg Gate was also a symbol of Prussian triumphalism and unity. On the latest march through the gate, demonstrators from the extreme-right NPD unfurled a banner. On it were the words \"Prussia's law and order\".

      "bodyText": "French pay-TV channel Canal Plus is to sell its stake in sports channel Eurosport and set up a rival network. Canal Plus will pocket \u00a3170m from the sale of its 49.5% holding, which has been triggered by the company's merger with owner Vivendi and Seagram of Canada last year. French TV operator TF1, which owns the rest of the sports channel, is likely to acquire the Canal Plus stake. Canal Plus said it will remain a key customer of Eurosport, but its new channel will compete in some areas. Analysts said that the sale was inevitable since Canal Plus had agreed to dump its holding if its ownership structure changed, but the market is looking for good news from a company which has had difficulty with its merger partners. Marc Loneux, media analyst at Commerzbank, said: \"We are waiting for many things, but the market is not waiting for negative or marginal news like this.\" Vivendi Universal, the company created by the Vivendi and Seagram link-up, has attracted criticism from industry observers, who say it has drastically reduced shareholder value. A recent boardroom shuffle parachuted several members of the Vivendi Universal management team into Canal Plus, prompting rumours of a fallout between Vivendi boss Jean-Marie Messier and Pierre Lescure, his counterpart at the pay-TV channel.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ben Kingsley holds forth on acting. He wants you to hear what he has to say, which is that \"there's so much crap talked about acting\", and that performance comes \"from my intuition, my soul, my urgency\". It's coming in a great flood, because he's rejuvenated. He says so himself. \"Somewhere in your career, your work changes. It becomes less anal, less careful and more spontaneous, more to do with the information that your soul carries.\" </p> <p>Now, Kingsley's CV doesn't demonstrate the most carefree of performers. The bright young Royal Shakespeare Company star of the 1970s bagged an Oscar for his role in Gandhi, and the subsequent string of films documenting 20th-century history. He consolidated a reputation as one of our heavyweight dramatic talents, starring in Schindler's List and Death and the Maiden, and playing Lenin and Simon Wiesenthal, Stanley Spencer and Shostakovich. </p> <p>But \"I am - hello! - an actor, an entertainer, a song-and-dance man,\" says Kingsley. \"I can do anything.\" Song and dance may be surplus to requirements, but his role in Sexy Beast, the latest British movie about the London criminal underworld, will startle anyone who had the wiry 56-year-old gathering dust in the worthy-but-dull pigeonhole. </p> <p>\"I love creatures in their pure form,\" says Kingsley. He's found just such a creature in gangland chief Don Logan, who descends upon \u00e9migr\u00e9 crim Ray Winstone, bent on luring him back from Spain to Blighty for the ultimate bank job. It's a joy to watch these two fine actors spar on screen; Kingsley's, in particular, is a revelatory performance. His Don is drumskin-taut, a study in violence always about to unspring; he's a little man making himself big by psychotic force of will. He's terrifying. </p> <p>\"Don's pure form,\" says Kingsley, \"is rage. I wouldn't like to stand next to Don at a bar and ask him for a light. If he says to you, 'What you fucking looking at?', you just know there's nothing you can do to get out of that killer grip.\" He pauses, then whispers at me conspiratorially: \"I won't do it to you, because I know it's scary when I do it.\" </p> <p>It's a measure of Kingsley's achievement that you believe Winstone to be physically intimidated by his ferrety aggressor. Something of Don Logan persists in Kingsley the interviewee. He's given to sudden mood swings and darts across the room; his manner is supercilious; he raises his voice to keep being heard. He has no time for the suggestion that Britain's geezer-chic film boom, of which Sexy Beast is an admittedly superior part, is rooted in fantasy. \"That hunger of the flesh, that longing for ease, that terror of incarceration, that insistence on tribal honour being obeyed: all of that exists, and it exists everywhere. I just know that this film is so true.\" </p> <p>Truth is an important quality for Kingsley. He may seek to shed gravitas, but he insists that his films should \"reflect who we are, where we are and why we are\". </p> <p>\"I was fortunate as a young actor,\" he explains, \"to go straight to the RSC, where I learned that being an actor can bring with it wonderful responsibilities.\" The son of a Ugandan Asian GP and christened Krishna Bhanji, Kingsley - the name came from his grandfather, a Zanzibar-based spice trader nicknamed King Clove - fell in love with theatre when he saw Ian Holm's Hamlet. He was soon starring in Coronation Street; Brian Epstein, however, sought to lure him into rock music. \"I wonder if I'd still be alive by now,\" Kingsley reflects. \"As a singer, I might have fallen among thieves.\" </p> <p>Instead, Stratford came calling. Over some 20 years with the RSC, Kingsley starred in Trevor Nunn's Nicholas Nickleby, Peter Brook's legendary Midsummer Night's Dream and in the title role in Othello. </p> <p>So when he sees the film industry bent on \"outlawing tragedy\", on eradicating all that's painful or unhappy in stories about human beings, it appals him. \"To offer to our tribe, as storytellers, narratives which are absent of a dark side is a terrible disservice. I'm just fighting for the right,\" he insists, \"for a film to be stirring and brilliant and illuminating.\" </p> <p>Few would argue; fewer still would contradict Kingsley, whose roster of grandiose roles adds weight to his case. But the actor hasn't always been able to speak with such unassailable authority. In the past, he's expressed regret that \"as an actor there's no autonomy, unless you're prepared to risk the possibility of starving.\" </p> <p>As a result, the man who was Gandhi has starred in his fair share of stinkers, including Michael Winner's notorious 1998 flop Parting Shots. I'd read that he suffered a slump in morale 10 years ago (\"I was doing really bad work . . . and I was not in a good state\"), but asked about it now, he denies the crisis of confidence. \"There have not been any troughs as regards my work. There's never been a trough of my assurance.\" </p> <p>The reason for his current soaring self-regard is that \"there is a lot of creative energy in me right now. In the work I'm now doing, I know that my soul - my soul - is fully articulate.\" </p> <p>\"We can talk about a cello having a soul,\" he continues, \"but when an actor talks about his soul people think, 'What a pretentious wanker'. A cello's soul is the resonance that makes it unique: how it was made, when it was made, who's played it. Mine may be who my parents were, what I know about life, who I love and have loved. All that makes my bones resonate. If a director is fortunate enough to tap into that, it's an endless well of information.\" </p> <p>As a performer who, in accordance with some of the less respectful actorly stereotypes, puts his creative processes on a pedestal, Kingsley is infuriated that \"I don't honestly think people know what acting is.\" </p> <p>Notwithstanding his own claim to have prepared for the role of Gandhi by spinning cotton, he takes aim at the \"imposed reputation\" he has for Method-style rehearsal. \"If I were to play somebody who ran a fish and chip shop, I would not work in a fish and chip shop for three months. Staring at chips is not going to help me in my performance. My performance\" - and he jabs at his breast - \"is in here: it all, all, all comes from here.\" </p> <p>So what's in here? He's a mass of contradictions: the \"entertainer\" with a string of heavy credits; the censorious critic of trash who appeared in Parting Shots and Species; the Oscar-winner still seeking credit for his craft. What's given Kingsley the drive to, as he phrases it, \"be seen and heard - a very primal urge\"? </p> <p>His voice drops to an acid hiss. \"As a child, I was neither seen nor heard. I was not taken seriously. Everything I attempted to articulate was diminished, distorted or interrupted. It's a miracle that I got out of that: affluent, middle-class, horrible. That is why I honour that child and voice in me by saying: 'They're going to hear me, and see me, and I'm not going to be interrupted. I'll put them in a place where they can't interrupt me'. \" </p> <p>It comes from nowhere, this volcanic self-revelation, and it's gone as quickly. As explanations go for the urge to \"be seen and heard\", it's well worn - if seldom so vehemently expressed. But Kingsley doesn't dwell on the subject, far less go into detail. Perhaps he's aware of how forlorn it appears, justifying his life's work as vengeance for childhood slights, because he's off again, making himself heard. \"Very soon preconceptions of me, if there are any left, will be meaningless, because I'll be moving too fast. 'Who's that bloke in the white car? No, he's on a yellow horse.' 'Who's that bloke on the yellow horse? No, he's holding a black jaguar.' 'That bloke holding the black jaguar? No, he's a clown up there on the tightrope . . .' \" </p> <p>He makes a karate action with his arms, to indicate how confused we'll all be. The child in him will be pleased at that. </p> <p><strong>I, Kingsley: the actor and his movies</strong></p> <p> <strong> Gandhi (1982)</strong> Kingsley's breakthrough role; his best actor Oscar was one of eight given to Richard Attenborough's three-hour epic charting the subcontinent's tortuous path to independence. </p> <p><strong> Silas Marner (1985)</strong> Fondly remembered BBC adaptation of the George Eliot novella, with Kingsley outstanding in the title role as the miserly weaver whose heart is softened by little Eppie (a pre-Absolute Beginners Patsy Kensit). </p> <p><strong> Pascali's Island (1988)</strong> Meditative intrigue about deception and betrayal adapted from Barry Unsworth's novel, with Kingsley impressive as the translator/spy who crosses paths with archaeologist Charles Dance. </p> <p><strong> Bugsy (1991)</strong> Another Kingsley performance noted by the Academy, though he didn't win for his side-man role as mobster Meyer Lanksy - alongside free-spending mafioso Bugsy Siegel (Warren Beatty). </p> <p><strong> Schindler's List (1993)</strong> Kingsley was somewhat overshadowed by co-stars Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in Spielberg's heart-wrenching Holocaust epic, but did key work as accountant Itzhak Stern, the man who ran Schindler's factory for him and the film's most prominent Jewish character. </p> <p><strong> Death and the Maiden (1994)</strong> Film of Ariel Dorfman's hit play, with Kingsley the doctor taken hostage by a former torture victim convinced he was her oppressor.

Another top performer was Tesco.com, proving that old world retailing know-how can be transferred successfully to the online marketplace. The company's grocery delivery service saw the average order price soar above its previous mark of \u00a386 and filled an additional 10,000 delivery slots that had been added for the Christmas rush. Tesco added an extra 400 staff members to cope with demand.",

The publisher of the Daily Mail and Evening Standard gave six months' notice in November on its contract with WH Smith in protest at the group's plans. Following last-ditch talks, WH Smith agreed a number of concessions that go some way towards allaying the newspaper group's fears about the effect WH Smith's plans would have on sales in cornershops, particularly in rural areas. Mike Newman, Associated's circulation director, said: \"If WH Smith is in a position to support the industry alternative to its plans Associated Newspapers will back out of its plans to terminate these contracts.\" A spokeswoman for WH Smith confirmed that a compromise agreement with publishers would be announced by the end of this week. However, she denied that WH Smith - which has been bullish about its plans - was backing down in the face of industry pressure. \"We always said that if we could get an agreement which met with the needs of all parties then we would consider abandoning the planned national distribution system,\" she said, The spokeswoman added that the compromise solution would reject the so-called Blueprint proposed by magazine publishers' alliance the Periodical Publishers' Association, but would draw some aspects from it. WH Smith's plans for a national distribution system, originally set up with supermarket Tesco, was met with fury by newspaper and magazine publishers.

Channel 4 had already announced it was axing the show after ratings declined and regular presenter Chris Evans had ducked out of hosting the show's final run. But the station hoped the combination of Sir Elton presenting and the fact that it was TFI's last outing would boost the audience figures for the last show on Friday December 22. In the event, TFI Friday spluttered out of existence, beaten by virtually everything around it including a repeat of Harry Enfield's Festive Television Programme on BBC2. True, the show averaged 2.3m in its 9.30pm slot, over a million more than the previous week's TFI, which ran in the programme's usual 6pm Friday night berth. But that audience is nothing special for 9.30-10.30pm, where the previous week a repeat of two Trigger Happy TV episodes averaged 3m viewers for Channel 4 over 60 minutes. But Sir Elton can take comfort in the fact that the grand finale was not the biggest celebrity flop. The December 8 edition, fronted by Donna Air and Fun Lovin' Criminals front man Huey, pulled in just 1m viewers. Meanwhile on New Year's Day, ITV gave a new twist to its hugely successful Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? quiz show format with a special featuring couples. Millionaire drew 12m and won a 41% share over 60 minutes from 8pm. In its first half-hour it averaged 10.4m and was beaten by EastEnders, which had 12.3m.

The awards will be flexible, but will \"typically\" be \u00a375,000 a year, half to top up the researcher's basic salary and half for research expenses. This will mean some award-holders could enjoy salaries of \u00a3100,000 or more. It is estimated that 35 new awards will be made in each of the first two years. The first awards could start as early as April, though many will coincide with the start of the academic year. The scheme is due for review in 2002.</p> <p>The money should not only attract world class scientists to the UK but nurture researchers at an early stage of their career, said Lord Sainsbury. \"The scheme is designed to promote a UK Brain Gain boosting our increasingly knowledge-driven economy. I expect to see the scheme used to make some very high awards and recruit new talent, but the overall emphasis is on flexibility to match individual circumstances.\" The scheme will be administered by the Royal Society, whose president, Sir Robert May, said: \"Britain's universities need to offer competitive salaries and research expenses to attract and retain world class scientists.\"</p> <p>Further details about the scheme can be found on the Royal Society web-site at www.royalsoc.ac.uk</p> <p>The Association of University Teachers gave a qualified welcome to the scheme but said talk of creating a premier league did not stand up. \"It does not meet the outstanding needs of research staff or attract new postgraduates into the profession,\" said spokesman Andrew Pakes. </p> <p>PhD students on average received \u00a37,000 a year and research staff \u00a318,000, compared to \u00a322,000 for London Underground station staff, he added. </p>",

      "bodyText": "British universities are being invited to bid for a share of a \u00a34m annual fund aimed at attracting the world's top scientists to the UK and keeping them here with salaries potentially in excess of \u00a3100,000. Lord Sainsbury, the science minister, said he wanted \"the David Beckhams and Steve Redgraves of the science world\" doing research in the UK. In partnership with the Wolfson Foundation he intends to spend \u00a320m over the next five years in an effort to reverse the brain drain. The awards will be flexible, but will \"typically\" be \u00a375,000 a year, half to top up the researcher's basic salary and half for research expenses. This will mean some award-holders could enjoy salaries of \u00a3100,000 or more. It is estimated that 35 new awards will be made in each of the first two years. The first awards could start as early as April, though many will coincide with the start of the academic year. The scheme is due for review in 2002. The money should not only attract world class scientists to the UK but nurture researchers at an early stage of their career, said Lord Sainsbury. \"The scheme is designed to promote a UK Brain Gain boosting our increasingly knowledge-driven economy. I expect to see the scheme used to make some very high awards and recruit new talent, but the overall emphasis is on flexibility to match individual circumstances.\" The scheme will be administered by the Royal Society, whose president, Sir Robert May, said: \"Britain's universities need to offer competitive salaries and research expenses to attract and retain world class scientists.\" Further details about the scheme can be found on the Royal Society web-site at www.royalsoc.ac.uk The Association of University Teachers gave a qualified welcome to the scheme but said talk of creating a premier league did not stand up. \"It does not meet the outstanding needs of research staff or attract new postgraduates into the profession,\" said spokesman Andrew Pakes. PhD students on average received \u00a37,000 a year and research staff \u00a318,000, compared to \u00a322,000 for London Underground station staff, he added.",

      "body": "<p>Twelve years ago, I was at secondary school. I was also pregnant with my first child. The most shocking consequence of the pregnancy test had not been the impending baby (which I accepted with that trademark teenage mixture of boundless optimism and bravado), but my instant descent to an underclass about which everyone seemed to reserve the right to be rude and scornful. </p> <p>I borrowed a typewriter and vented my fury in an article published in the Guardian. Here's a taster: \"I have found the attitudes of many members of the medical profession presumptuous and patronising . . . I am determined to prove that teenage parents are not social problems, vegetating on bleak council estates, but capable of achieving the same goals as others.\" </p> <p>I grew up in a single-parent family in the days when it was unusual (at least in Norfolk) and John Craven still talked gravely on Newsround about \"broken homes\". Mum struggled to provide for my sister and me, working evenings in pubs while she studied for a degree. She assumed we had learned from her mistakes and was horrified that I might even contemplate not terminating my pregnancy. Eviction from the family home followed swiftly. </p> <p>I was referred to a social worker who was also pregnant (but in a strange parallel universe where everyone could afford maternity clothes and people said \"Congratulations\" rather than \"God, what are you going to do?\"). I assumed she would offer practical help (housing, money for baby equipment, childcare support so I could finish my education). In reality, there was little other than an archaic mother and baby home run by the Catholic church and a care system predicated on the assumption that no one got any qualifications anyway. When she tried to find common ground between us (\"Isn't morning sickness the pits?\"), I found it hard to contain my anger. Eventually my boyfriend's parents took pity on me. </p> <p>I considered myself quite ordinary (we lived in a small terrace house and I went to the local comprehensive) but much of my pregnancy was spent waiting in long queues (at the housing office, at the DSS, at social services) with people who suddenly made me feel obscenely well-educated, healthy and privileged. I never realised so many people were living lives so devoid of opportunity. The thought that I would be joining them was terrifying. </p> <p>Following the birth of my son Joshua, I was allocated a grim council flat on a desolate estate apparently reserved for teenage mothers and ex-psychiatric patients. I saw desperately poor teenage women struggling to provide basic care for their children against substantial odds, in an environment in which carpets and washing machines were luxury items. </p> <p>I was deemed \"fortunate\" (and I was compared with the other people queuing at the DSS), but this limited my entitlement to help. Finishing my education seemed a sensible route out of the benefits system, but social services did not provide care for children not categorised as \"at risk\". To qualify, I needed to prove I was about to neglect my son, put him into care or be admitted to a psychiatric unit - all of which began to look increasingly possible as I contemplated spending my life trying to make ends meet on the estate. </p> <p>So I lived with Josh's father (a teenage undergraduate) in his poky university rooms, because at least I was surrounded by people whose lives were filled with opportunity and hope. Nevertheless, motherhood came as a tremendous shock and I was miserable and isolated. </p> <p>I started my degree when Josh was a toddler and, almost inevitably, I separated from his father. Unusually (for teenage fathers), he remains actively and positively involved. </p> <p>Essex University was a fantastic place to be a teenage mother. There was a campus nursery, I lived in a shared house with lots of babysitters and I had a ball, despite making some embarrassing mistakes. Universities are full of rich kids writing glib essays about \"structural inequalities\" and as a sociology student, I wrote my dissertation on teenage motherhood, confident that at least I was prepared for the humility of the powerless working-class women I interviewed. I wasn't - and I reluctantly recognised that my impending graduation proved nothing about schoolgirl mothers. </p> <p>Teenage motherhood is linked to poverty and low educational achievement (middle-class girls have more reasons not to get pregnant and those who do overwhelmingly choose abortion). The vast majority of the women I spoke to were from families who already lived in poverty on \"sink\" estates. Their lives were characterised by educational failure and some had spent time in care. They hoped for the best (\"I'd like us to get a nice house - when my boyfriend gets a job\"), but expected the worst (\"Well, they usually leave you, don't they?\"). </p> <p>I found little evidence that they would have been any better off had they delayed motherhood into their 20s. If their children fared badly at school and drifted into delinquency, they were simply taking their places in a cycle of deprivation that owed a great deal to the failure of our social care system and little to maternal age or moral laxity. Our shared experience of being teenage mothers did not magically dissolve the inequalities between us. My attempts to form a sisterhood (\"Yes, I remember when I had mould up the walls\") were met with the same derision I had shown the social worker four years earlier. </p> <p>I argued that patriarchy seeks to control women by dictating the circumstances in which it is desirable to reproduce. Deprived working-class boys can indulge in the sort of laddish resistance to dominant morality that is celebrated by Guy Ritchie et al. Working-class women have fewer role models and for them, reproduction can be (or appear to be) a way of acting in the world and changing your life. </p> <p>Teenagers experiment and take risks. If teenage fathers emerge from irresponsible sex relatively unscathed, they have male peers disabled by a range of reckless behaviours in which stupid driving features prominently. Their treatment and rehabilitation costs thousands. Generally they are pitied, rather than castigated, by Tory politicians and the tabloid press. </p> <p> By contrast, student politics was kind to teenage mothers in the early 90s. The NUS had (belatedly) woken up to the discrimination faced by sections of its population and suddenly, if you wanted to get ahead in student politics, you needed an oppression. I never had to say more than: \"Speaking as a teenage mother\" to prompt a standing ovation. Getting my tokens out for the lads became a way of life. So what if the macho politicos who occupied the lecture theatres in support of a campus nursery were ignorant of the realities of teenage motherhood? </p> <p>Childcare began to be taken seriously and I became sabbatical vice-president of the Students Union. My election night celebrations included the sort of spontaneity that results in morning sickness, but by then I'd convinced myself I was invincible. I survived on a week's maternity leave following the birth of Hannah, but I was too exhausted to fight any more. It was time to move on. </p> <p>Subsequently, I followed a typical graduate trajectory. I trained as an English teacher and married a local government officer. We got a mortgage and had a third child. Occasionally, when colleagues were berating female pupils for squandering our taxes on their wanton reproduction, I'd \"out\" myself as a schoolgirl mother. The sudden staffroom silence would be broken by: \"Oh, but you're different; at least your kids have the same father.\" </p> <p>\"Well, um, actually . . . \" And there would be a frantic scramble to find ways to separate me (someone similar to themselves) from the seething amoral hordes on the local estates. </p> <p>As a student, I was taught that \"deviants\" become so defined by their label that normal \"non-deviant\" life is impossible. It is probably the only way to explain my decision to become a Labour councillor. Looking across the rows of balding heads at my first meeting, I saw what an oddity I was (less than a fifth of our councillors are women and I'm 20 years younger than all of them). In a world dominated by old men who live their politics, my lack of a long-suffering wife has turned a morning spent doing the playgroup shift and mopping the kitchen floor into something verging on subversive. </p> <p>When JK Rowling spoke in support of single mothers, Nigella Lawson applauded her, noting that \"feckless teenage mothers\" accounted for only 3% of single parents (phew!). Substitute the words \"teenage mothers\" with \"asylum seekers\" or \"travellers\" and you begin to hear the complaints of a disgruntled minority convinced they've been denied their fair share of life's rewards (from council housing to the moral high ground) and are trying to apportion blame. </p> <p>This scapegoating of society's most disadvantaged has not lessened in the years since I wrote my original article. Back then I yearned for a public arena in which to challenge these attitudes. Now that I've found one, I'm relying on my son (my brilliant mistake) to nudge me if I get complacent.</p>",

I considered myself quite ordinary (we lived in a small terrace house and I went to the local comprehensive) but much of my pregnancy was spent waiting in long queues (at the housing office, at the DSS, at social services) with people who suddenly made me feel obscenely well-educated, healthy and privileged. I never realised so many people were living lives so devoid of opportunity. The thought that I would be joining them was terrifying. Following the birth of my son Joshua, I was allocated a grim council flat on a desolate estate apparently reserved for teenage mothers and ex-psychiatric patients. I saw desperately poor teenage women struggling to provide basic care for their children against substantial odds, in an environment in which carpets and washing machines were luxury items. I was deemed \"fortunate\" (and I was compared with the other people queuing at the DSS), but this limited my entitlement to help. Finishing my education seemed a sensible route out of the benefits system, but social services did not provide care for children not categorised as \"at risk\". To qualify, I needed to prove I was about to neglect my son, put him into care or be admitted to a psychiatric unit - all of which began to look increasingly possible as I contemplated spending my life trying to make ends meet on the estate. So I lived with Josh's father (a teenage undergraduate) in his poky university rooms, because at least I was surrounded by people whose lives were filled with opportunity and hope. Nevertheless, motherhood came as a tremendous shock and I was miserable and isolated. I started my degree when Josh was a toddler and, almost inevitably, I separated from his father. Unusually (for teenage fathers), he remains actively and positively involved. Essex University was a fantastic place to be a teenage mother. There was a campus nursery, I lived in a shared house with lots of babysitters and I had a ball, despite making some embarrassing mistakes. Universities are full of rich kids writing glib essays about \"structural inequalities\" and as a sociology student, I wrote my dissertation on teenage motherhood, confident that at least I was prepared for the humility of the powerless working-class women I interviewed. I wasn't - and I reluctantly recognised that my impending graduation proved nothing about schoolgirl mothers. Teenage motherhood is linked to poverty and low educational achievement (middle-class girls have more reasons not to get pregnant and those who do overwhelmingly choose abortion). The vast majority of the women I spoke to were from families who already lived in poverty on \"sink\" estates. Their lives were characterised by educational failure and some had spent time in care. They hoped for the best (\"I'd like us to get a nice house - when my boyfriend gets a job\"), but expected the worst (\"Well, they usually leave you, don't they?\"). I found little evidence that they would have been any better off had they delayed motherhood into their 20s. If their children fared badly at school and drifted into delinquency, they were simply taking their places in a cycle of deprivation that owed a great deal to the failure of our social care system and little to maternal age or moral laxity. Our shared experience of being teenage mothers did not magically dissolve the inequalities between us. My attempts to form a sisterhood (\"Yes, I remember when I had mould up the walls\") were met with the same derision I had shown the social worker four years earlier. I argued that patriarchy seeks to control women by dictating the circumstances in which it is desirable to reproduce. Deprived working-class boys can indulge in the sort of laddish resistance to dominant morality that is celebrated by Guy Ritchie et al. Working-class women have fewer role models and for them, reproduction can be (or appear to be) a way of acting in the world and changing your life. Teenagers experiment and take risks. If teenage fathers emerge from irresponsible sex relatively unscathed, they have male peers disabled by a range of reckless behaviours in which stupid driving features prominently. Their treatment and rehabilitation costs thousands. Generally they are pitied, rather than castigated, by Tory politicians and the tabloid press. By contrast, student politics was kind to teenage mothers in the early 90s. The NUS had (belatedly) woken up to the discrimination faced by sections of its population and suddenly, if you wanted to get ahead in student politics, you needed an oppression. I never had to say more than: \"Speaking as a teenage mother\" to prompt a standing ovation. Getting my tokens out for the lads became a way of life. So what if the macho politicos who occupied the lecture theatres in support of a campus nursery were ignorant of the realities of teenage motherhood? Childcare began to be taken seriously and I became sabbatical vice-president of the Students Union. My election night celebrations included the sort of spontaneity that results in morning sickness, but by then I'd convinced myself I was invincible. I survived on a week's maternity leave following the birth of Hannah, but I was too exhausted to fight any more. It was time to move on. Subsequently, I followed a typical graduate trajectory. I trained as an English teacher and married a local government officer. We got a mortgage and had a third child. Occasionally, when colleagues were berating female pupils for squandering our taxes on their wanton reproduction, I'd \"out\" myself as a schoolgirl mother. The sudden staffroom silence would be broken by: \"Oh, but you're different; at least your kids have the same father.\" \"Well, um, actually . . . \" And there would be a frantic scramble to find ways to separate me (someone similar to themselves) from the seething amoral hordes on the local estates. As a student, I was taught that \"deviants\" become so defined by their label that normal \"non-deviant\" life is impossible. It is probably the only way to explain my decision to become a Labour councillor. Looking across the rows of balding heads at my first meeting, I saw what an oddity I was (less than a fifth of our councillors are women and I'm 20 years younger than all of them). In a world dominated by old men who live their politics, my lack of a long-suffering wife has turned a morning spent doing the playgroup shift and mopping the kitchen floor into something verging on subversive. When JK Rowling spoke in support of single mothers, Nigella Lawson applauded her, noting that \"feckless teenage mothers\" accounted for only 3% of single parents (phew!). Substitute the words \"teenage mothers\" with \"asylum seekers\" or \"travellers\" and you begin to hear the complaints of a disgruntled minority convinced they've been denied their fair share of life's rewards (from council housing to the moral high ground) and are trying to apportion blame. This scapegoating of society's most disadvantaged has not lessened in the years since I wrote my original article. Back then I yearned for a public arena in which to challenge these attitudes. Now that I've found one, I'm relying on my son (my brilliant mistake) to nudge me if I get complacent.",

Neither the Sun nor the Daily Star would confirm his appointment, but a source close to negotiations said that Mr Woolnough has signed a deal with Northern &amp; Shell, which owns the Star, to become the paper's chief sports writer. A veteran Sun journalist, Mr Woolnough also presents the Sky Sports weekly football programme, Hold the Back Page, and has written books about the sport. He has been at the Sun for more than 25 years and is believed to have upped his salary by some \u00a340,000 in the new deal. Two years ago the Mirror tried to poach Mr Woolnough but he was persuaded to stay put after News International offered him a stint on Sky TV. The signing represents a coup for Daily Star owner Richard Desmond, who has made clear his intention to pitch the Star aggressively against the Sun. It is also a reflection of his commitment to the Star, which has been promised more staff from the day Mr Desmond took over.

Senior officials in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions claim that the rivalry between the two politicians has triggered increasingly bitter battles between the environment and transport wings of the merged body. Mr Prescott and Lord MacDonald of Tradeston have clashed over road, rail and air issues during recent months.

The u-turn on policy by the government entailed more than 70 road bypasses. The plan was championed in the department by Lord MacDonald, minister of state for transport, despite reservations by Mr Prescott. Michael Meacher, the department's minister of state for the enviroment, complained he was not properly consulted. Lord MacDonald also took charge of the government's controversial plan to privatise air traffic control. Mr Prescott was said by an adviser to have been furious at not being consulted before his deputy negotiated a deal with the Conservatives on this issue, involving what was presented as a three-month delay, to get the sale through the House of Lords. And the peer is resisting pressure from Mr Prescott to \"come down heavy\" on the rail companies, arguing the government should work with rather than against the operators to get them to run decent train services as demanded by passengers. The tussle has prompted concern in and out of government among supporters of the merged DETR - created by the marriage of the old environment and transport ministries - that the potential benefits of policy coordination are being lost. As well as transport, Mr Prescott's department is responsible for many other things, from local authorities and regional development to water and the wider environment, including global warming. But it is transport that is Mr Prescott's specialist subject and the former seafarer - who made his mark in opposition during the late 1980s and early 1990s after the Clapham, Lockerbie and Marchioness disasters - jealously guarded it during his early years in government. Lord MacDonald's links with Downing Street, however, make him more powerful than the three previous transport deputies Mr Prescott had in 30 months - Gavin Strang, John Reid and Helen Liddell. Mr Prescott persuaded the prime minister to remove the transport post from the cabinet in Labour's first reshuffle but Lord MacDonald is a cabinet member in all but salary, attending and speaking at the Thursday morning meetings. Mr Prescott is now thought to believe he made a mistake taking the reins of the complex DETR rather than acting as a Cabinet Office enforcer. He is widely expected to give up the department after the election. Parts of the DETR may be hived off, possibly to a new social inclusion department with regional development agencies passing to trade and industry.

      "bodyText": "The final hours of 2000 brought to a close one of the more bizarre internet experiments - the self-imposed isolation of DotComGuy, a US computer programmer who spent the entire year living off the internet. Supported by corporate sponsors flush with the then-plentiful dot.com cash, Mitch Maddox changed his name legally to DotComGuy before settling in for a year of delivered groceries, chatroom social contact and webcams recording and broadcasting his every move. Dismissed by many as the most absurd stunt in a year awash with publicity stunts, DotComGuy nevertheless managed to attract a number of corporate sponsors, including NetB@nk, PhoneFree.com, Network Solutions and Peapod, the online grocer. Mr Maddox intends to revert back to his given name now that the stunt is over, and will marry a woman he met in an online chat session from his website, DotComGuy.com. Paying for the honeymoon may prove difficult, however. Several gossip sites report that Mr Maddox's sponsors haven't come up with the $100,000 he was supposed to collect upon successful completion of the stunt. Mr Maddox's spokeswoman was not available for comment.",

She is 162cm (5ft 4in) tall and wants to be a film star. The only problem is, she isn't real. Eve Solal is being touted in France as the most realistic virtual star yet, capable of expressing human emotions and charming those who see her. Her makers, Attitude Studio of Paris, claim she has a much more expressive face and mobile body than predecessors such as the virtual newsreader Ananova or Lara Croft, star of the video game Tomb Raider. Since Christmas, Eve has had her own website but she will be officially launched in France next month with great media hoopla, including radio interviews, a five-page women's magazine feature and internet appearances. \"Soon Eve will appear in a feature film or take on the role of a presenter on an internet site or television,\" said Marc Viance, 24, head of Attitude Studio. Her (real) agent, Jacques Olivier Broner of the Rouge agency in Paris, is looking for work in films, TV or video games for his client. But Attitude Studio bosses do not want their creation to appear in a fully computer-animated film like Toy Story; rather, they want her to star opposite flesh-and-blood human actors. But why is Eve better than her predecessors? \"Ananova only exists on the internet, she's cut off at the shoulders and she has only two expressions,\" Mr Viance said. \"And as for Lara Croft, she only appears in action situations, and she does not have much in the way of facial expressions.\" Attitude Studio has used \"motion capture\" technology to make Eve. Cameras film the movements of an actor from different angles and these are mapped on to the virtual star using sophisticated software. The couturier Thierry Mugler used similar technology to create a virtual mannequin to show off his spring collection last year. To make Eve's facial expressions convincingly human, a software package called Emotion Mapper was used, which involves filtering video images of each muscle movement of a real face through computer programmes and then grafting them on to Eve's face. Emotion Mapper is particularly easy to use when an actor is replaced in certain scenes by a virtual stunt double. In the film The Matrix, for example, several scenes used a virtual Keanu Reeves constructed with Emotion Mapper and\"motion capture\" technology. Eve Solal goes one step further in that she is based not on one single human prototype, but on several.

Yet never has that 1943 Oscar-winning masterpiece been so misunderstood as by its screeenwriter, Julius Epstein, who has died aged 91. It was, he observed, \"slick shit\". As for the cult, he once suggested it had only been the death of Humphrey Bogart in 1955 that created it.</p> <p>Routinely assigned to Casablanca by Warner Brothers in 1942, Epstein and his twin brother, Philip, never expected it to shake free of its chaotic creation. Not only was their work in transforming a ropey, unpublished play, Everybody Comes To Rick's, given a political twist by a third screenwriter, Howard Koch, but changes were demanded from day to day, not least for the ending. Such uncertainty was of a piece with its seemingly haphazard casting - at one point Ronald Reagan was a candidate for the role of Rick.</p> <p>There is no greater symptom of the film's triumphant muddle than the fact that Dooley Wilson, who plays the theme, As Time Goes By, was a drummer; his piano-playing was dubbed by other fingers. \"We were not making art,\" said Epstein. \"We were making a living.\"</p> <p>Between 1934 and 1984, Epstein worked on more than 50 films. His life was a classic rise from obscurity, with hard slog bringing a lucky break. He and his brother were born on New York's lower east side where, as schoolboys, they cleaned out their father's livery stables each day. Despite this and a penchant for boxing - both ran teams at Penn State University - Julius developed a taste for restoration comedy and Moli\u00e8re.</p> <p>Broadway was his goal; the writing of press releases, a stop-gap. Such work threw up a radio columnist, Jerry Wald, who duly bluffed his way into Hollywood and was hard put to write screenplays. He summoned Julius from New York and gave him $25 a week to ghostwrite. This yielded Twenty Million Sweethearts (1934) for Dick Powell and Ginger Rogers. Epstein continued such ghosting, then, in 1935, came up with his own elegant flying drama, Living On Velvet. A contract with Warners was his, leaving Wald to call on the services of Philip Epstein, who, with his brother, had written a play which was performed in New York.</p> <p>In 1938, Four Daughters got Epstein his first Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, the brothers' collaboration galvanised Philip's talent for screwball comedy, and in 1938 he wrote The Mad Miss Manton. To write of one is to write of the other, such was their bond. If The Bride Came C.O.D. (1941) now seems forced, the same can hardly be said of their 1942 versions of The Man Who Came to Dinner and The Male Animal. One of their finest adaptations was of Arsenic And Old Lace (1944) for Frank Capra, with whom they had a brief wartime propaganda stint in Washington.</p> <p>They could be relied upon to give new life to scripts which a star found lacking. James Cagney insisted upon them being brought in to work on Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), to exhilarating effect.</p> <p>They were keen practical jokers. A high farce could be made about the production of Casablanca. Executive producer Jack Warner complained, for example, that the brothers were not in at nine - \"Get in at nine; even bank presidents get in at nine.\" They responded by sending him part of a script with the note, \"have the bank president finish the script\". When Warner complained that one scene was the worst in motion-picture history, Epstein said: \"How is that possible? It was written at nine o'clock.\"</p> <p>To one scene in Casablanca, Koch added Humprey Bogart's line, \"I don't buy or sell human beings.\" A worthy sentiment, but when it came back to the Epsteins, they gave it true life in Sydney Greenstreet's reply, \"That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity.\"</p> <p>Such was the brothers' closeness that, when driving across Sunset Boulevard and Beverly Glen, Claude Rains's line, \"Round up the usual suspects\", came to them simultaneously. \"Whenever I drive past the spot, I raise my hand in salute,\" recalled Julius.</p> <p>With this success, the brothers began to produce at Warners. Alas, Mr Skeffington (1946), with Bette Davis and Claude Rains, is more serviceable than inspired, as was their pleasant Doris Day vehicle, Romance On The High Seas (1948).</p> <p>A move to Paramount and an adaptation of JM Barrie's Forever Female (1953) had them location-hunting in a wood when Philip got poison oak badly, for which he was prescribed liquid cortisone by the bottleful.

He continued writing but, despite such successes as The Tender Trap (1955) and Fanny (1961), it was not until 1972 that his spirit met its match in a novella by that brilliant, underrated novelist Peter De Vries - the Oscar-nominated Pete 'n' Tillie, with Walter Matthau and Carol Burnett. In 1977, he collaborated, surprisingly perhaps, on the screenplay for Sam Peckinpah's violent account of life on the German side of the second world war, Cross Of Iron.</p> <p>Rather more muted was another De Vries adaptation, the Oscar-nominated Reuben Reuben (1983). Epstein always claimed special regard for this account of a Dylan Thomas-like poet (Tom Conti) at loose in small-town New England.

Howard Koch died five years ago, so with Epstein's death, the last substantial player in the story of the film has passed.</p> <p>Epstein's marriage to Frances Sage ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife Ann, and two children from his first marriage.

The Ibrox disaster of January 2 1971 was a foretaste of the shocking incidents that afflicted British football in the last quarter of the 20th century, and if a reminder were needed that such tragedies are by no means restricted to the past it came with Saturday's crush at the final of the Joao Havelange Cup in Brazil in which 104 fans were injured. </p> <p>Football games across Scotland today will hold a minute's silence in memory of the fans, and survivors and relatives will gather at Ibrox at 3pm. A service for relatives of the bereaved, on the very spot where the infamous stairway 13 stood and where Greig's statue is to be unveiled, will commemorate the 66 supporters who lost their lives. </p> <p>Ibrox, carved into its contemporary all-seated theatre as a consequence of that day, is no stranger to tragedy. The first Ibrox disaster of 1902 had 25 deaths when old timber terraces holding 75,000 people watching an international between England and Scotland gave way under the strain and supporters plunged to their death. In the 1960s there were at least two further incidents involving fatalities on stairway 13. </p> <p>On January 2 1971 all these dire portents reached their climax. A crowd of 80,000 was gathered inside Ibrox watching Rangers and Celtic play out an apparent no-score draw. The game, though, took a dramatic twist in the last two minutes, first when Jimmy Johnstone put Celtic ahead in the 89th minute and 70 seconds later when Colin Stein equalised for Rangers. These two goals are at the heart of perhaps the most enduring myth about any sporting tragedy in Britain. The aftermath was gruesome. </p> <p>The old Ibrox was in the classic mould of the oval football arena, with four wide stairways down from the ter races, two at each end, spilling spectators from its maw. </p> <p>Stairway 13, one of those four exits, was a 50-yard flight of steps with six tubular-steel barriers running from top to bottom, among which only one fan needed to stumble in order to trigger a crush. In addition supporters found themselves penned in by solid timber walls embedded in concrete on either side which refused to yield to the pressure. </p> <p>It is estimated that as many as 25,000 were seeking their exit down the staircase after the final whistle when a fall and then further stumbles resulted in a human pile-up. The pressure of the crush was so great that the steel barriers were twisted and wrecked. </p> <p>Robert McElroy, a Rangers historian and supporter for 40 years, spoke last week of many supporters' wariness of stairway 13. \"There was always a terrible crush approaching it,\" he said, \"and as a historian I had been aware of the previous incidents prior to the disaster. </p> <p>\"In fact, I remember my father always believed that once you actually got on to the stairs you were probably quite safe. I think many supporters believed this, that it was the congested build-up that was the scary bit. Alas, this proved mistaken.\" </p> <p>Among the spectators at the Rangers end that day were Walter Smith and Alex Ferguson. Smith, later to become the manager of Rangers, escaped the carnage by somehow wresting himself free from the congestion and clambering over a fence down the grass embankment. \"It isn't something I particularly enjoy talking about but I recall it all vividly,\" he said. \"Even when I was working at Rangers every day it was hard to see the ground without thinking about that match.\" </p> <p>As to the myth, that Celtic's goal triggered an exodus of Rangers fans who then heard the roar for Stein's equaliser and turned to go back up the stairway, the fatal accident inquiry found that the crush developed 10 minutes after the final whistle and that the goals had nothing to do with it. Both Johnstone and particularly Stein have taken solace from this after years of being repeatedly cited as the unwitting catalysts of the tragedy. </p> <p>The disaster did at least lead to change. The prime minister Edward Heath set up an inquiry into ground safety, which eventually led to the Safety of Sports Grounds Act of 1975, which introduced safety certificates.</p>",

But Blackburn equalised through Junior Bent, who was also denied twice by excellent saves from Andy Marshall. </p> <p>Souness suggested that the occasional Hughes dismissal was a price he was prepared to pay for such a valuable \"natural competitor\". \"The man's 37 and I'm not in a position to teach him anything now,\" the manager said. </p> <p><strong> West Bromwich Albion</strong> moved above Blackburn into third place in the First Division with a 1-0 win over <strong> Barnsley</strong> gained with a late own-goal. Second-placed <strong> Bolton</strong> closed the gap on <strong> Fulham</strong> to seven points with a 2-0 win at <strong> Preston</strong> . Michael Ricketts played only eight minutes but that was long enough to get the clinching goal. </p> <p><strong> Wigan</strong> missed the chance to go top of the Second Division by drawing 0-0 at home to <strong> Wrexham</strong> . <strong> Brighton</strong> missed the chance to close the gap on <strong> Chesterfield</strong> in the Third Division by losing 2-0 at home to <strong> Southend</strong> . </p> <p><strong> Walsall</strong> moved up to second in the Second when Jorge Leitao's 12th goal of the season gave them a 1-0 win over <strong> Swindon</strong> , beaten for the third time in succession. </p> <p>It was an even worse day for Lionel Perez, the <strong> Cambridge United</strong> and former Newcastle and Sunderland goalkeeper.

      "bodyText": "Blackburn Rovers went a goal down and had Mark Hughes sent off at Norwich , but were still disappointed not to gain their fifth successive win. \"I'm a little disappointed,\" Graeme Souness said. \"We looked the better side for long periods and created the better chances but unfortunately we couldn't take them.\" Adrian Forbes gave Norwich the lead after half an hour when Stig Inge Bjornebye was caught in possession, then Hughes was sent off for the ninth time in his career for a bodycheck on Darel Russell just before half-time. But Blackburn equalised through Junior Bent, who was also denied twice by excellent saves from Andy Marshall. Souness suggested that the occasional Hughes dismissal was a price he was prepared to pay for such a valuable \"natural competitor\". \"The man's 37 and I'm not in a position to teach him anything now,\" the manager said. West Bromwich Albion moved above Blackburn into third place in the First Division with a 1-0 win over Barnsley gained with a late own-goal. Second-placed Bolton closed the gap on Fulham to seven points with a 2-0 win at Preston . Michael Ricketts played only eight minutes but that was long enough to get the clinching goal. Wigan missed the chance to go top of the Second Division by drawing 0-0 at home to Wrexham . Brighton missed the chance to close the gap on Chesterfield in the Third Division by losing 2-0 at home to Southend . Walsall moved up to second in the Second when Jorge Leitao's 12th goal of the season gave them a 1-0 win over Swindon , beaten for the third time in succession. It was an even worse day for Lionel Perez, the Cambridge United and former Newcastle and Sunderland goalkeeper. Not only did Cambridge lose 6-2 at Bristol City , he was sent off seven minutes from time for - what do you expect? - \"deliberate handball\".",

      "body": "<p>The pre-match pyrotechnics may have fizzled out but Sunderland's season is proving more explosive by the day. Yesterday's stunning second-half display floored Ipswich Town, propelled Peter Reid's team back up to third - level on points with Arsenal - and had Mackems drooling at the prospect of European football next season. </p> <p>Europe? \"Easy - you said that, not me,\" said a smiling Reid. \"Last year the press had us challenging for Europe and we didn't win for 11 games.\" </p> <p>In terms of overall ability, Reid added, \"we're a long way behind Arsenal and Manchester United and we just have to keep going, but that performance was fantastic. Once we got into our rhythm, the pace and power of the team was really good.\" </p> <p>Ipswich's manager George Burley was more prepared to elaborate on what the whole of Wearside was thinking. \"They are a very powerful side on a great run,\" he said. \"I can see them up there at the end of the season.\" </p> <p>Sunderland's blistering display after the interval apparently had nothing to do with Reid's half-time talk and instead centred on one striker regaining his best form, Kevin Phillips, and another who has had little chance to generate any form at all. Danny Dichio was making his first Premiership start after almost three years at the club and, having hit Richard Wright's legs from close range early in the second half, he picked himself up admirably to fill the void left by Niall Quinn's absence. </p> <p>It was Dichio's flick which bypassed the floundering Titus Bramble and Mark Venus just before the hour, allowing Phillips to burst through the shoddy rearguard and place his fifth goal in three games beyond Wright. Then the England striker wriggled free of Venus and squared the ball unselfishly for Dichio to score his first of the season. </p> <p>\"I though Danny was outstanding,\" said Reid. \"He's an underrated player and I wouldn't have bought him if I didn't fancy him. The partnership looked perfect up front and, as for Kevin, how anyone ever doubted him as a finisher is beyond me. If he doesn't get a chance for England then we must have some of the best strikers on the planet over here.\" </p> <p>To raucous celebrations the substitute Stefan Schwarz capped the win with a volley from Darren Williams's cross. The red-and-white hordes basked in victory, the painful memory of the opening 20 minutes, when Ipswich had baffled them with clever, incisive football of their own, forgotten in the euphoria. Sunderland's supporters are used to sloppy starts; if the Premiership were measured on the opening 45 minutes they would now be fretting over relegation. </p> <p>Ipswich, zipping passes with the confidence fuelled by as many away league wins as United, ran the hosts ragged with pretty triangles and late charges from midfield. </p> <p>The sparky entrance merited their fifth-minute reward. After Michael Gray crunched Alun Armstrong unfairly, advantage was played and Fabian Wilnis chipped the ball into the space vacated by the Sunderland left-back. Matt Holland sprang forward and crossed low for Marcus Stewart, outsprinting the on-rushing Thomas Sorensen, to lob the ball in for his 14th goal of the season. </p> <p>Then James Scowcroft's centre was dummied by Stewart and Emerson Thome had to snap at Holland's feet to block his shot. Yet from such a platform the visitors stumbled. Stewart's horrendous lunge at Gavin McCann flustered his team-mates as much as Sunderland's midfielder and Ipswich promptly conceded another free-kick on the edge of their area as Dichio was fouled. </p> <p>Julio Arca curled the ball sumptuously into the top corner. So decisive was that goal in waking up the home side that, on being substituted late on, the brilliant Argentine got a warm hug from Sunderland's No2 Bobby Saxton - quite possibly the most terrifying moment of his fledgling English career. </p> <p>Although they continued to threaten despite Sunderland's goal rush - Sorensen saved well from Martijn Reuser's vicious shot - the Tractor Boys left with unfamiliar defeat stinging their pride. </p> <p>Ipswich's entire back line was booked and looked uncomfortable. Burley said: \"It's incredible for us to be doing so well and we've got a standard to live up to now. We let that slip today.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pre-match pyrotechnics may have fizzled out but Sunderland's season is proving more explosive by the day. Yesterday's stunning second-half display floored Ipswich Town, propelled Peter Reid's team back up to third - level on points with Arsenal - and had Mackems drooling at the prospect of European football next season. Europe? \"Easy - you said that, not me,\" said a smiling Reid. \"Last year the press had us challenging for Europe and we didn't win for 11 games.\" In terms of overall ability, Reid added, \"we're a long way behind Arsenal and Manchester United and we just have to keep going, but that performance was fantastic. Once we got into our rhythm, the pace and power of the team was really good.\" Ipswich's manager George Burley was more prepared to elaborate on what the whole of Wearside was thinking. \"They are a very powerful side on a great run,\" he said. \"I can see them up there at the end of the season.\" Sunderland's blistering display after the interval apparently had nothing to do with Reid's half-time talk and instead centred on one striker regaining his best form, Kevin Phillips, and another who has had little chance to generate any form at all. Danny Dichio was making his first Premiership start after almost three years at the club and, having hit Richard Wright's legs from close range early in the second half, he picked himself up admirably to fill the void left by Niall Quinn's absence. It was Dichio's flick which bypassed the floundering Titus Bramble and Mark Venus just before the hour, allowing Phillips to burst through the shoddy rearguard and place his fifth goal in three games beyond Wright. Then the England striker wriggled free of Venus and squared the ball unselfishly for Dichio to score his first of the season. \"I though Danny was outstanding,\" said Reid. \"He's an underrated player and I wouldn't have bought him if I didn't fancy him. The partnership looked perfect up front and, as for Kevin, how anyone ever doubted him as a finisher is beyond me. If he doesn't get a chance for England then we must have some of the best strikers on the planet over here.\" To raucous celebrations the substitute Stefan Schwarz capped the win with a volley from Darren Williams's cross. The red-and-white hordes basked in victory, the painful memory of the opening 20 minutes, when Ipswich had baffled them with clever, incisive football of their own, forgotten in the euphoria. Sunderland's supporters are used to sloppy starts; if the Premiership were measured on the opening 45 minutes they would now be fretting over relegation. Ipswich, zipping passes with the confidence fuelled by as many away league wins as United, ran the hosts ragged with pretty triangles and late charges from midfield. The sparky entrance merited their fifth-minute reward. After Michael Gray crunched Alun Armstrong unfairly, advantage was played and Fabian Wilnis chipped the ball into the space vacated by the Sunderland left-back. Matt Holland sprang forward and crossed low for Marcus Stewart, outsprinting the on-rushing Thomas Sorensen, to lob the ball in for his 14th goal of the season. Then James Scowcroft's centre was dummied by Stewart and Emerson Thome had to snap at Holland's feet to block his shot. Yet from such a platform the visitors stumbled. Stewart's horrendous lunge at Gavin McCann flustered his team-mates as much as Sunderland's midfielder and Ipswich promptly conceded another free-kick on the edge of their area as Dichio was fouled. Julio Arca curled the ball sumptuously into the top corner. So decisive was that goal in waking up the home side that, on being substituted late on, the brilliant Argentine got a warm hug from Sunderland's No2 Bobby Saxton - quite possibly the most terrifying moment of his fledgling English career. Although they continued to threaten despite Sunderland's goal rush - Sorensen saved well from Martijn Reuser's vicious shot - the Tractor Boys left with unfamiliar defeat stinging their pride. Ipswich's entire back line was booked and looked uncomfortable. Burley said: \"It's incredible for us to be doing so well and we've got a standard to live up to now. We let that slip today.\"",

Stockport were the unlikely agents of a most unexpected, if deserved, result that came courtesy of goals either side of half-time by their Finland midfielder Jarkko Wiss and their young full-back Peter Clark. But it was the manner of the defeat as much as the scoreline itself which will offer a glimmer of hope to those teams immediately below Fulham, even if Jean Tigana's team lead second-placed Bolton by seven points and have two games in hand. Harried, chased and consistently outfought in key areas by Stockport, the remainder of the season will prove whether this first league defeat since Preston won at Craven Cottage on October 24 was a mere diversion on the road to the Premiership or the first signs of a nasty traffic jam. \"I have no doubt promotion will go down to the wire,\" said Fulham's midfielder Lee Clark. \"Even when I was at Sunderland and we won the division with a record number of points, we were not promoted until a couple of weeks before the end of the season. \"People outside the club have been saying the promotion race is over, that it is us and one other team to go up, but we have never thought that way.

But the 40th minute saw a trip by Andy Melville on the gangling County youngster Aaron Wilbraham and, with it, a dramatic change to the pattern of the match. At the free-kick County astutely lined three players in front of the ball, obscuring the view of Maik Taylor, Mike Flynn touched the ball to Wiss and the Finn drove a low shot into the left-hand corner. Two minutes after half-time, Clark scored a goal of remarkable skill and audacity for a young defender who was rescued from the anonymity of Carlisle for \u00a375,000 in summer. The 21-year-old collected Chris Coleman's clearance 40 yards from goal, surged forward, outmanoeuvred three defenders and retained his composure to stab the ball past Taylor.

      "body": "<p>Liverpool's new year began as happily as they would have wished, but only just and only if results are all that matter. After a bright first half by both sides, the game tailed off scrappily and it needed a header by Markus Babbel four minutes from time to secure all the points and turn growing impatience in the crowd into relief. </p> <p>Southampton, enjoying the bounce of James Beattie's goals over the past two months, had taken only eight minutes to equalise Steven Gerrard's early strike, held their own for more than an hour and were denied a hand-ball penalty. But G\u00e9rard Houllier, though conceding that \"it was not the best Liverpool performance in terms of passing and movement\", added: \"I don't think we were lucky. We dominated a confident team.\" </p> <p>In possession and territory that may have been true. In imagination, though, they looked increasingly bereft, which is why the Anfield fans were restive at the incompetence of it all. Houllier was right when he said his three substitutes made the difference. \"They brought freshness and desire to make the game our way when the guidelines of our play had gone.\" </p> <p>Emile Heskey was briefly at his burly, bustling best; Gary McAllister, bald as a ball-bearing, kept the midfield machinery in running order; and Gerrard, lying deep, got forward unnoticed to inject pace and purpose. In the second minute, from 25 yards, his rocket forced Paul Jones to palm away for a corner. In the 12th, from five yards deeper, and again not picked up, he beat the keeper to his top left-hand corner with another bullet still rising. </p> <p>For once the Southampton goal was not Beattie's, though it owed something to the fear that his 10 goals in 10 games struck in Liverpool's defence.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool's new year began as happily as they would have wished, but only just and only if results are all that matter. After a bright first half by both sides, the game tailed off scrappily and it needed a header by Markus Babbel four minutes from time to secure all the points and turn growing impatience in the crowd into relief. Southampton, enjoying the bounce of James Beattie's goals over the past two months, had taken only eight minutes to equalise Steven Gerrard's early strike, held their own for more than an hour and were denied a hand-ball penalty. But G\u00e9rard Houllier, though conceding that \"it was not the best Liverpool performance in terms of passing and movement\", added: \"I don't think we were lucky. We dominated a confident team.\" In possession and territory that may have been true. In imagination, though, they looked increasingly bereft, which is why the Anfield fans were restive at the incompetence of it all. Houllier was right when he said his three substitutes made the difference. \"They brought freshness and desire to make the game our way when the guidelines of our play had gone.\" Emile Heskey was briefly at his burly, bustling best; Gary McAllister, bald as a ball-bearing, kept the midfield machinery in running order; and Gerrard, lying deep, got forward unnoticed to inject pace and purpose. In the second minute, from 25 yards, his rocket forced Paul Jones to palm away for a corner. In the 12th, from five yards deeper, and again not picked up, he beat the keeper to his top left-hand corner with another bullet still rising. For once the Southampton goal was not Beattie's, though it owed something to the fear that his 10 goals in 10 games struck in Liverpool's defence. St\u00e9phane Henchoz had already been glad to concede a corner when Claus Lundekvam's long ball found Beattie beyond him. Then Sami Hyypia did the same and Marian Pahars' corner cleared everyone to find Trond Soltvedt beyond the far post. Southampton regained full composure, Liverpool realised they had a battle on their hands and could not work out how to break down the organisation that Matt Oakley had marshalled in front of his back four. If Southampton threatened only on the break, Liverpool hardly made a clear-cut chance. The winner came from a corner, won by Michael Owen's burst past Jason Dodd, nodded back by Hyypia and in by Babbel. Just previously, from Pahars' free-kick, Henchoz shot up a hand under pressure from Beattie and clearly palmed the ball out. \"They have to catch it nowadays if you're away,\" said Glenn Hoddle, the visiting manager. Asked about Gerrard's international potential, the former England coach said: \"He plays with his head up, a rarity these days.\" If only more of his team-mates did the same.",

According to concerned local MPs the Berkshire town is facing a \"crisis of prosperity\", an unforeseen flipside to the growth of the last 10 years.

The imminent arrival of Cisco has caused disquiet, with Jane Griffiths, MP for Reading East, questioning whether there are the people to fill the jobs. A one bedroom flat in Reading starts at \u00a380,000, with two bedroom houses closer to \u00a3130,000.

With a degree and 11 years' experience, his salary is at the top end of the nursing scale - \u00a326,000 - yet it is impossible for him to live within 15 miles of the hospital. Instead he commutes from Didcot, Oxfordshire, a 50 mile round trip. </p> <p>\"It costs around \u00a3200 to get to work each month, but there's no choice,\" he said. \"My wife and I bought a three bedroom house in Didcot three years ago for \u00a387,500. A similar property in Reading would cost around \u00a3160,000. We wouldn't get the mortgage.\" </p> <p>Mr Walthall estimates that 55% of his nurses face a similar predicament, a problem which is causing a shortage of nurses. </p> <p>\"They try to make up the shortfall with overseas recruits - we recently recruited in India - but unless there's some sort of weighting we just won't get the staff.\" </p> <p>The problem is more marked among the town's firefighters. While there is no shortage of potential recruits few of them live near their station. Of the six members of red watch at Whitley Wood station, less than a mile from Green Park, only one lives in Reading. </p> <p>David Wilson, the watch commander, commutes daily from Alresford near Winchester, Hampshire, an 80 mile round trip, and his deputy travels from the Isle of Wight for the four days out of eight he works. </p> <p>Mr Wilson said: \"There's a couple of lads from Portsmouth, one from Barnstaple, and I've heard of lads coming down from Northampton and Lincoln and crashing with their mates.

      "bodyText": "It may be an impoverished country, a man's name or even dimpled and pregnant, but whatever it means, Americans are fed up with it. Chad, which came to national prominence after the November 7 presidential election, was the runaway leader of the 26th annual banished word list, compiled by the Lake Superior State University and published yesterday. Hundreds of people sent in suggestions for words that should be banned because of \"mis-use, over-use or general uselessness\". And, after hearing endless discussions of how a tiny slip of paper should or would influence the presidential election, Americans made their feelings clear on the word \"chad\". Mike Warner of Anchorage, Alaska, said: \"We've heard it 12 times an hour on the news. Chad has gotta go.\" Another political phrase that failed to connect with voters during last year's marathon elections was \"fuzzy math\", the less-than-clear term offered by George W Bush during the televised debates. Words and phrases to be outlawed in previous years include \"free gift\" in 1988 and \"live audience\" in 1983, 1987 and 1990. Last year's list tried to exile the much misspelt \"millennium\" as well as \"wake-up call\" - a favourite among politicians around the world. Other words to have received a no-vote in 2000 included dot.com, which followed a dislike for \"e-\" anything the year before. Words which originated among the youthful denizens of America's west coast also began to annoy fellow citizens during a year when fewer people were making any money there. \"Dude\" - which featured in a slacker film \"Dude, where's my car?\"- was also on the 2000 list of most hated words. In entertainment, \"diva\" was also rated as most overused. Jennifer McGraw, of Brevort, Michigan, complained: \"I thought it was bad when I heard Madonna described as a diva. Since then, I've seem promotions for shows on male divas and transvestite divas.\" Other phrases on this year's list include: \"Have a good one\", \"One of the only\", and \"Manual recount by hand\".

      "bodyText": "The Royal College of Nursing is to produce new guidelines on nurse sponsorship as worries grow about the expansion of commercial activity within the profession. The guidelines will cover not only sponsorship of nursing posts but also the ethics of accepting freebies such as T-shirts and biros or of taking up free study trips paid for by commercial companies. The sponsorship of stoma nursing posts is the most controversial example of these public-private \"partnerships\" but in recent years, sponsorship has also been extended into continence nursing, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, MS and many other chronic conditions. The aim of the guidelines, which are expected to be agreed early next year and will go to all trusts as well as college members, is to clarify what is and is not acceptable, and to stamp out some of the worst excesses of past sponsorship deals. In stoma nursing these have included offering inducements to nurses such as company cars, mobile phones and even free air miles. One manufacturer ran a loyalty card scheme complete with free gifts for patients who stuck with its products. In another case, one of the companies bidding for a sponsorship deal reportedly offered a trust \u00a3100,000 a year - \u00a340,000 of which would pay for a stoma care nurse while the trust would be free to spend the remaining \u00a360,000 however it wished. Partly as a result of these abuses, many sponsorship arrangements in other areas of nursing aim to keep nurse and sponsor at arm's length. Innovex NHS Solutions is a health organisation, largely funded by drug companies, which employs a large number of nurses in chronic disease management such as MS and obstructive pulmonary disease. But although drug companies are the \"sponsors\", they have no direct influence on the nurses themselves. Innovex admits some companies have tried to push it \"over the line\" but it has successfully resisted these pressures. In a different model, the Parkinson's Disease Society has linked up with drug companies to fund a total of 100 Parkinson's disease nurses around the country. The idea is that they provide pump priming for these specialist nurses over a period of two years, at the end of which it is hoped the trust will pick up the tabs. As a result 57 nurses have now been assimilated into the NHS. The drug companies gain from such schemes, says RCN nursing policy and practice adviser Sue Thomas, because the disease is getting a higher profile and prescriptions are being dispensed to patients who might otherwise not have been identified. At the same time the health service benefits because none of these posts would have existed without sponsorship. \"In the past many patients with chronic disease had a very poor service,\" said Ms Thomas. \"We can't get away from the fact that sponsorship has helped to bring very real benefits - and we wouldn't want to lose them.\" Julia Breeze, who chairs the RCN gastroenterology and stoma care nursing forum, is also clear about the symbiotic nature of the relationship: \"We need the companies just as much as they need us.\" Ironically, at a time when sponsorship in general is growing, there is now a real threat that some companies could withdraw their funding of stoma care posts - a trend that has helped concentrate minds among both nurses and patients. The threat has emerged because the Department of Health is looking to cut back on the money stoma companies currently earn from their dispensing service. Such a move, warns one of the main patients' groups, the Ileostomy Association, would almost certainly lead to a sharp fall in sponsorship deals. Said association secretary Bruce McKenzie: \"I don't care who pays for the nurses, I just want to make sure they're there. They make such a big difference to our lives. Our fear is that if these people go the effect on patients will be massive.\"",

The guidance lays down a number of principles for future sponsorship arrangements but the bottom line is clear: outside money should never dictate what is best for the patient. And it goes on to warn that any existing sponsorship contracts that fail to meet these standards should be renegotiated. That move could be accompanied by the sound of the ripping up of contracts across the NHS because it is clear that the central motivation for much health sponsorship is to get preferential treatment for a particular company's product. In stoma care, for instance, more than 60% of the country's 600 stoma nursing posts are now financed by the stoma care companies. The nurse will still be employed by the trust but the contracts will offer the company some tangible benefits in return for its investment - an investment which can be worth as much as \u00a3100,000 each year. Some contracts, for instance, stipulate that a certain proportion of patients treated should be fitted with the sponsoring company's stoma bag. That proportion is often more than 50%. That can be very big money indeed for the manufacturer since once a patient is fitted with a bag they may be using that product - along with a range of accessories - for life. Julia Breeze, who chairs the Royal College of Nursing gastroenterology and stoma care nursing forum, recalls how when she was a sponsored stoma nurse, the sponsoring company complained that only 30% of her patients were going home with the company's products and that the figure must be increased. She resisted successfully, but has no doubt other nurses are put under similar pressures and that in some cases they succumb. The other common way in which sponsoring companies can recoup their investment is by inserting a clause in the contract that stipulates they should be the sole dispenser of any stoma care equipment to the patient in their home. This may be small print but it is big business because it entitles them to 25% of the cost of each item dispensed - money that the NHS forks out on top of the cost of the product. The new guidelines suggest this would no longer be acceptable and says such clauses should be urgently renegotiated. Although Ms Breeze remains uneasy about sponsorship, she says stoma services cannot survive without it. \"We are a very expensive commodity and the money isn't there for us otherwise - there are so many competing needs in the NHS these days,\" she said. Stoma care nursing may be the biggest target for sponsorship but it is by no means the only one. Continence care and a number of chronic conditions such as Parkinson's, MS and inflammatory bowel disease have attracted the attention of manufacturers and drug companies who can see big advantages in teaming up with clinicians. RCN nurse adviser Susan Scott believes the pressures are likely to increase now that nurses have some prescribing powers. The only way forward is to be completely open about the process and to be clear the patient's interests must always come first. \"The absolute bottom line is that any nurse has got to use her clinical judgement knowledge and skill to ensure that the product or service is the right one for that patient,\" said Ms Scott.

      "bodyText": "The NHS is to crack down on sponsorship deals in which commercial firms pay for health service staff and equipment in exchange for \"endorsement\" of their products, amid fears that such arrangements are compromising clinical judgments. The move could lead to the tearing up of thousands of contracts worth millions of pounds every year to the NHS, and which help pay for specialist services which otherwise might not be provided by the health service. Such sponsorship deals are often connected to the care of chronic conditions such as continence nursing, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis, but are also used as a marketing tool by suppliers of products such as prosthetic hips. The crackdown will dismay some patient groups because it will potentially threaten the provision of services. New guidance forces NHS trusts to review all agreements in which suppliers meet all or part of the cost of certain staff members, provide discounts on drugs and equipment, or subsidise research and training, in return for contracts. Ministers do not want to prevent \"collaborative partnerships\" with private sector suppliers, but want to ensure that such deals \"should always be based upon clinical evidence that the product is best for their patients\". The guidance expressly outlaws deals whereby sponsorship is linked to the purchase of particular products, or use of a particular supplier - although there is evidence that many trusts are tied in to such contracts. More than 360 of the UK's 600 nursing posts dedicated to stoma care - treatment following bowel surgery such as colostomy - are financed by the suppliers of stoma bags in deals worth up to \u00a3100,000 per year to a trust. According to the Royal College of Nursing, some stoma deals stipulate that a certain proportion - as much as 50% - of patients treated at a particular trust should be fitted with the sponsoring companies' stoma bag. Some deals stipulate that the sponsor should be the sole dispenser of stoma care equipment to the patients at home - a non-skilled distribution job that is worth up to 25% of each item bought by the NHS. Julia Breeze, who chairs the Royal College of Nursing gastroenterology and stoma care nursing forum, said it would be difficult for many trusts to pull out of sponsorship deals without threatening services. \"We are an expensive commodity and the money isn't there for us otherwise - there are so many competing needs in the NHS these days,\" she said. Ray Hodgkinson, director of the British Healthcare Trades Association, admitted that sponsorship was used by firms as a way of increasing sales. But he added that many such deals were initiated by the NHS itself. A recent house of commons public accounts committee report revealed that five NHS trusts had admitted to auditors that their choice of artificial hip supplier was influenced by the \"incentives\" on offer, including free equipment and research funding.

      "body": "<p>Britain's system for dealing with asylum seekers is in complete disarray after the collapse of attempts to disperse potential refugees around the country. </p> <p>Local councils and refugee groups have warned Ministers that asylum seekers in their thousands are drifting back to London after dispersal, or are simply choosing to remain in the capital or the south east without any money for housing. </p> <p>The compulsory dispersal system was introduced with a fanfare last April to ease the burden of supporting asylum seekers on a few councils in these areas. It was designed to house 65,000 people across the UK by next April. </p> <p>But the latest figures from the Home Office show that only 9,340 have so far been dispersed, despite generous financial incentives for private companies to find empty properties, and the removal of all money for accommodation from those who fail to comply. Home Office officials told The Observer that the target has now been cut to 36,000. </p> <p>The North West and Yorkshire have each taken 2,500 people, still well short of their targets of 6,000. But in some areas the figures are even lower. The South West has taken only 209 asylum seekers under the scheme and, so far, only nine people have been sent to Wales. </p> <p>Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the British Refugee Council, said asylum seekers were rejecting dispersal in droves because they are often sent to sink estates where they are too frightened to venture outside their homes. </p> <p>'Many asylum seekers are giving up their right to accommodation and squeezing into already cramped conditions with relatives so they can reach proper legal support, pursue their claims with the Home Office or simply feel safe,' he said. </p> <p>'To ensure the dispersal programme works, asylum seekers need to feel confident that their basic needs will be met and that they are not at risk of racial harassment.' </p> <p>The collapse of the dispersal programme comes as the Government braces itself for record asylum applications. Attempts to toughen the system by introducing a compulsory voucher system have done nothing to deter people. Up to November, 70,215 asylum seekers had entered the country. With a further 7,000 expected in December, this year's total is set to far exceed the 71,000 who arrived in 1999. </p> <p>The Government also faces criticism over the rising cost of asylum. By next April this will have risen to \u00a3694 million, an increase of 18 per cent over last year. </p> <p>Steve Hitchins, leader of Islington Council in London, said: 'I don't know a single council in London that doesn't want this problem dealt with humanely, but the money to deal with it has to come from central government. The Government believed that if they made life hard for people when they arrived in Britain, word would get back, and they wouldn't come here in the first place. They have been completely wrong.' </p> <p>Amanda Sebestyen, of the Asylum Education and Legal Fund, said: 'People are just being shunted into places where there is no one qualified to help them. Because of this many have no chance of getting asylum, even though they have a clear-cut case.' </p> <p>She said government claims to have cut the backlog of asylum applications to under 70,000 were boosted by a 40 per cent rise in the number rejected for not filling in their forms correctly. </p> <p>Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes, whose Southwark constituency is home to many asylum seekers, said: 'The Home Office must take responsibility for what is going on and recognise that dispersal just has not worked. There is huge pressure on London boroughs and housing services are already stretched beyond capacity.' </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman insisted last night: 'We have yet to feel the deterrent effect of many of the measures we have put in place.' The backlog of asylum seekers awaiting decisions on their applications was being reduced. </p> <p>'The numbers [of asylum seekers entering the country] were increasing before we enacted these measures. They could have been much higher if we had done nothing.' </p> <p>The crisis has led the Government to draw up secret plans to house increasing numbers of asylum seekers in prisons. At the beginning of December, Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered the creation of 500 new places in prisons, including Liverpool and two London jails.</p>",

'To ensure the dispersal programme works, asylum seekers need to feel confident that their basic needs will be met and that they are not at risk of racial harassment.' The collapse of the dispersal programme comes as the Government braces itself for record asylum applications. Attempts to toughen the system by introducing a compulsory voucher system have done nothing to deter people. Up to November, 70,215 asylum seekers had entered the country. With a further 7,000 expected in December, this year's total is set to far exceed the 71,000 who arrived in 1999. The Government also faces criticism over the rising cost of asylum. By next April this will have risen to \u00a3694 million, an increase of 18 per cent over last year. Steve Hitchins, leader of Islington Council in London, said: 'I don't know a single council in London that doesn't want this problem dealt with humanely, but the money to deal with it has to come from central government. The Government believed that if they made life hard for people when they arrived in Britain, word would get back, and they wouldn't come here in the first place. They have been completely wrong.' Amanda Sebestyen, of the Asylum Education and Legal Fund, said: 'People are just being shunted into places where there is no one qualified to help them. Because of this many have no chance of getting asylum, even though they have a clear-cut case.' She said government claims to have cut the backlog of asylum applications to under 70,000 were boosted by a 40 per cent rise in the number rejected for not filling in their forms correctly. Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Simon Hughes, whose Southwark constituency is home to many asylum seekers, said: 'The Home Office must take responsibility for what is going on and recognise that dispersal just has not worked. There is huge pressure on London boroughs and housing services are already stretched beyond capacity.' A Home Office spokesman insisted last night: 'We have yet to feel the deterrent effect of many of the measures we have put in place.' The backlog of asylum seekers awaiting decisions on their applications was being reduced. 'The numbers [of asylum seekers entering the country] were increasing before we enacted these measures. They could have been much higher if we had done nothing.' The crisis has led the Government to draw up secret plans to house increasing numbers of asylum seekers in prisons. At the beginning of December, Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered the creation of 500 new places in prisons, including Liverpool and two London jails.",

Meanwhile in the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian man was killed and seven were wounded by Israeli troops in two separate shootings, and two Israeli soldiers were hurt by roadside bombs detonated near two Jewish settlements.

      "body": "<p>Rocketing numbers of political campaigners are embracing the internet with the fervour their parents showed for sit-ins as they try to claw back its independence and make online actions a standard part of modern protests. </p> <p>Computer activists - \"hacktivists\", as they have become known - are squaring up to governments and corporations who want to restrict their activities. They are not opposed to business, but their immediate political aims, which range from improvements in working conditions to political independence, are fuelled by anger at the commercial dominance of cyberspace. Their tactics range from sending straightforward emails of complaint to crashing websites or diverting visitors to different sites. Some have overwhelmed servers with email \"bombs\" of thousands of protest messages or launched computer viruses and worms. </p> <p>In the US election both Republican and Democratic sites were defaced with anti-Bush and anti-Gore sentiments, while the Middle East conflict has been fought almost as heatedly online as in the real world. Palestinian and Israeli computer users have defaced websites, set up spoof sites as propaganda and even stolen the credit card details of their enemies. </p> <p><strong> Ingenious</strong><br> </p> <p> But so far hacktivism has been dominated by social justice and leftwing issues, with the far right using the internet only to organise and recruit. In one case campaigners diverted visitors seeking the Ku Klux Klan site to hatewatch.org instead; public reaction is likely to be very different when someone tries to do the opposite. </p> <p>That day may come sooner rather than later, as new programs make it easy for activists with little computer knowledge to enter systems or crash a website. These newcomers have joined the original hackers: highly skilled and ingenious programmers who share a distaste for authority and belief in freedom of information. Some are malicious; most see their hobby as a technical challenge; and increasingly, many are investigating its political possibilities. </p> <p>\"People don't like the way the internet is increasingly commercialised,\" says Paul Taylor, a sociologist at Salford University who has written a book on hackers and is currently researching hacktivism. \"Comparisons are made with the land enclosure acts - who owns common land? There are a lot of insidious ways in which corporate power has increased and is pervading the whole social fabric. It's happened within the structure of the internet; big corporations have got an advantage over governments and their values are getting incorporated into government policies.\" </p> <p>Underlying tensions are coming to a head with the advent of new legislation and information-gathering techniques. In Britain, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act has given the police and security services the power to collect internet data without a warrant and to demand the keys to encrypted material. In the United States, the FBI is seeking the right to capture all messages sent across the internet with software called Carnivore. This would allow them to trawl for emails containing particular words. </p> <p>In both cases, the authorities insist that the measures are essential to combat international crime and terrorism. But others worry that they will be used to monitor and discourage legitimate political activity and will ultimately ensure that only \"acceptable\" voices are heard on the net. Hacktivists fear that politicians, often lacking technical expertise, will be easily swayed by business. </p> <p>\"The prime minister of this country, by his own admission, gets most of his information on the internet from his kids,\" says Paul Mobbs, co-founder of the UK-based Electrohippies. \"Politicians don't know the first thing about it.\" </p> <p>He fears that individuals may be driven off the net because they have no rights to access. They are dependent on internet service providers who, for commercial reasons, are likely to refuse to host material that is controversial or which could attract expensive legal action and who could block users requesting certain sites. </p> <p>\"E-commerce has driven the internet over the past few years. Anyone who's not part of that is not supposed to be there,\" Mr Mobbs complains. He acknowledges the damage that some hacktivists have caused and accepts the need for policing. But he also says security forces and businesses are scaremongering and believes that the RIP Act and Terrorism Act are a dangerous combination. </p> <p>\"These new laws, rather than enabling free use of the internet by all, are seeking to blur the distinction between public protest, crime and terrorism in order to provide a 'safe environment' for corporations to do their deals,\" he says. \"The British government is seeking to define a 'virtual corporate free state' where corporations can do business free from public pressure.\" </p> <p>What delights the protesters - but worries their opponents - is that the internet acts as a magnifying glass for discontent. Individuals using computers can wield power they could never command on the street: it takes dozens, maybe hundreds, to occupy a building and unveil a banner but only one to hack into a computer system and take over a website. One person can bring down an e-commerce site, disrupting or halting a firm's trading. </p> <p>Oxblood Ruffin, of the respected hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow, suggests that the versatility and technical knowhow of protesters offers them a chance to redress imbalances of power in the real world: \"Hacktivism allows us to mount better arguments, rally unseen allies, and take on any tyranny,\" writes Ruffin, who is based in Toronto. \"It shrinks any Goliath down to his true size. Usually puny. </p> <p>\"Where a large physical mass is the currency of protest on the street, or at the ballot box, it is an irrelevance on the internet. Or more correctly, it is not always necessary ... To think that it takes a lot of people to execute an act of civil disobedience on the internet is naive. Programs make a difference, not people.\" </p> <p>For that reason, detractors argue that hacktivists are a classic example of power without responsibility. But unlike the original hackers many are happy to discuss their actions openly: Mr Mobbs publishes his address and phone number on the web. The Electrohippies informed the World Trade Organisation before launching an attack on its website in November 1999, and ensured that their own site linked to sites supportive as well as critical of the organisation. </p> <p>They debate their tactics with passion and sophistication, citing Aristotle, Thoreau and Lord Acton. Many, like the Electrohippies, refuse to access other people's computer systems and regard denial of service attacks as a last resort. Oxblood Ruffin goes further and insists they are unforgiveable: \"Denial of service attacks are a violation of the freedoms of expression and assembly,\" he insists. \"You do not make a better point in a public forum by shouting down your opponent. Say something more intelligent or observe your opponents' technology and leverage your assets against them in creative and legal ways.\" </p> <p>It seems inevitable that many of the protesters' tactics will be outlawed. Dr Taylor agrees that some measures may be needed, but suggests that we have overreacted, encouraged by security specialists who have a clear commercial interest in playing up the threat to worried businesses and who may mislead the public with their real world analogies. </p> <p>One firm described the Electrohippies as \"terrorists\" for their WTO action. Yet the Electrohippies refuse to intrude into computer systems. \"I think we have really twisted values,\" says Dr Taylor. \"In the Kosovan war the Pentagon was scared of using cyber warfare in case it was a war crime - but they bombed civilians.

      "bodyText": "Rocketing numbers of political campaigners are embracing the internet with the fervour their parents showed for sit-ins as they try to claw back its independence and make online actions a standard part of modern protests. Computer activists - \"hacktivists\", as they have become known - are squaring up to governments and corporations who want to restrict their activities. They are not opposed to business, but their immediate political aims, which range from improvements in working conditions to political independence, are fuelled by anger at the commercial dominance of cyberspace. Their tactics range from sending straightforward emails of complaint to crashing websites or diverting visitors to different sites. Some have overwhelmed servers with email \"bombs\" of thousands of protest messages or launched computer viruses and worms. In the US election both Republican and Democratic sites were defaced with anti-Bush and anti-Gore sentiments, while the Middle East conflict has been fought almost as heatedly online as in the real world. Palestinian and Israeli computer users have defaced websites, set up spoof sites as propaganda and even stolen the credit card details of their enemies. Ingenious But so far hacktivism has been dominated by social justice and leftwing issues, with the far right using the internet only to organise and recruit. In one case campaigners diverted visitors seeking the Ku Klux Klan site to hatewatch.org instead; public reaction is likely to be very different when someone tries to do the opposite. That day may come sooner rather than later, as new programs make it easy for activists with little computer knowledge to enter systems or crash a website. These newcomers have joined the original hackers: highly skilled and ingenious programmers who share a distaste for authority and belief in freedom of information. Some are malicious; most see their hobby as a technical challenge; and increasingly, many are investigating its political possibilities. \"People don't like the way the internet is increasingly commercialised,\" says Paul Taylor, a sociologist at Salford University who has written a book on hackers and is currently researching hacktivism. \"Comparisons are made with the land enclosure acts - who owns common land? There are a lot of insidious ways in which corporate power has increased and is pervading the whole social fabric. It's happened within the structure of the internet; big corporations have got an advantage over governments and their values are getting incorporated into government policies.\" Underlying tensions are coming to a head with the advent of new legislation and information-gathering techniques. In Britain, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act has given the police and security services the power to collect internet data without a warrant and to demand the keys to encrypted material. In the United States, the FBI is seeking the right to capture all messages sent across the internet with software called Carnivore. This would allow them to trawl for emails containing particular words. In both cases, the authorities insist that the measures are essential to combat international crime and terrorism. But others worry that they will be used to monitor and discourage legitimate political activity and will ultimately ensure that only \"acceptable\" voices are heard on the net. Hacktivists fear that politicians, often lacking technical expertise, will be easily swayed by business. \"The prime minister of this country, by his own admission, gets most of his information on the internet from his kids,\" says Paul Mobbs, co-founder of the UK-based Electrohippies. \"Politicians don't know the first thing about it.\" He fears that individuals may be driven off the net because they have no rights to access. They are dependent on internet service providers who, for commercial reasons, are likely to refuse to host material that is controversial or which could attract expensive legal action and who could block users requesting certain sites. \"E-commerce has driven the internet over the past few years. Anyone who's not part of that is not supposed to be there,\" Mr Mobbs complains. He acknowledges the damage that some hacktivists have caused and accepts the need for policing. But he also says security forces and businesses are scaremongering and believes that the RIP Act and Terrorism Act are a dangerous combination. \"These new laws, rather than enabling free use of the internet by all, are seeking to blur the distinction between public protest, crime and terrorism in order to provide a 'safe environment' for corporations to do their deals,\" he says. \"The British government is seeking to define a 'virtual corporate free state' where corporations can do business free from public pressure.\" What delights the protesters - but worries their opponents - is that the internet acts as a magnifying glass for discontent. Individuals using computers can wield power they could never command on the street: it takes dozens, maybe hundreds, to occupy a building and unveil a banner but only one to hack into a computer system and take over a website. One person can bring down an e-commerce site, disrupting or halting a firm's trading. Oxblood Ruffin, of the respected hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow, suggests that the versatility and technical knowhow of protesters offers them a chance to redress imbalances of power in the real world: \"Hacktivism allows us to mount better arguments, rally unseen allies, and take on any tyranny,\" writes Ruffin, who is based in Toronto. \"It shrinks any Goliath down to his true size. Usually puny. \"Where a large physical mass is the currency of protest on the street, or at the ballot box, it is an irrelevance on the internet. Or more correctly, it is not always necessary ... To think that it takes a lot of people to execute an act of civil disobedience on the internet is naive. Programs make a difference, not people.\" For that reason, detractors argue that hacktivists are a classic example of power without responsibility. But unlike the original hackers many are happy to discuss their actions openly: Mr Mobbs publishes his address and phone number on the web. The Electrohippies informed the World Trade Organisation before launching an attack on its website in November 1999, and ensured that their own site linked to sites supportive as well as critical of the organisation. They debate their tactics with passion and sophistication, citing Aristotle, Thoreau and Lord Acton. Many, like the Electrohippies, refuse to access other people's computer systems and regard denial of service attacks as a last resort. Oxblood Ruffin goes further and insists they are unforgiveable: \"Denial of service attacks are a violation of the freedoms of expression and assembly,\" he insists. \"You do not make a better point in a public forum by shouting down your opponent. Say something more intelligent or observe your opponents' technology and leverage your assets against them in creative and legal ways.\" It seems inevitable that many of the protesters' tactics will be outlawed. Dr Taylor agrees that some measures may be needed, but suggests that we have overreacted, encouraged by security specialists who have a clear commercial interest in playing up the threat to worried businesses and who may mislead the public with their real world analogies. One firm described the Electrohippies as \"terrorists\" for their WTO action. Yet the Electrohippies refuse to intrude into computer systems. \"I think we have really twisted values,\" says Dr Taylor. \"In the Kosovan war the Pentagon was scared of using cyber warfare in case it was a war crime - but they bombed civilians. It seems to me that it's quite skewed values by which 1,500 lives are less relevant than the legal elements of cyber war. People talk about the Tamils sending email bombs to the Sri Lankan government, but surely that's better than real ones.\" He predicts that a \"cat and mouse\" game will ensue as talented hackers find new ways to protest every time governments ban an old tactic. Oxblood Ruffin, one of the most technically advanced of the hacktivists, is currently working on a complex program that could mark the next significant stage in online activism: it focuses on giving people a tool rather than criticising or disabling opponents.

The robbers sped away in a boat moored near the waterfront museum. Police found the boat but not the thieves or the paintings, which museum officials say are worth several million pounds. \"In the present sensitive negotiation situation we don't want to make any comment at all. We will have to wait and see,\" the acting director of the museum, Torsten Gunnarsson, said. Like other government property in Sweden the paintings - a self-portrait by Rembrandt, Conversation by Renoir, and Young Parisian, also by Renoir - were not insured. The National Museum's collections contain about 15,000 paintings and sculptures. One of the most valuable paintings is Rembrandt's Kitchenmaid. The biggest art theft in Sweden happened at Stockholm's Modern Museum in November 1993 when works by Picasso and Georges Braque worth about 500m kronor (\u00a336m) were stolen. In 1995, three Swedes were sentenced to prison in connection with that theft and all but one of the works were retrieved.",

      "bodyText": "Former deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine yesterday called for a halt to the sale of the contents of the Millennium Dome until the contract for its conversion to a business park had been sealed. Workmen have moved into the dome following its closure on New Year's Eve to strip the contents for an auction which it is hoped will raise \u00a350m. There was further controversy last night when it emerged that dome management and staff are to share bonuses that could total \u00a33m. Mr Heseltine, Conservative MP for Henley, and the minister responsible for dreaming up the dome project, said it was \"madness\" to strip the interior of the Greenwich building until it was certain it would not be reopened as a visitor attraction. The move was premature when the business park deal proposed by Legacy plc, which has offered \u00a3125m to buy the dome, had not been sealed. He told the Times: \"It's madness. They have not signed anything at all. Legacy has only got first preference. \"The government is weakening the option of someone else coming in, in the event of the Legacy bid failing, if they sell off all the internal assets.\" A fellow former dome commissioner, Simon Jenkins, one of the attraction's most long-standing and vocal supporters, backed Mr Heseltine's call. The contents of the 12 theme zones and the 2,000-seat stadium would be vital to an alternative scheme fronted by the dome's chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, to keep the site open as a theme park by day and use it as a concert venue in the evenings, he said. Legacy said: \"We are confident our bid will succeed. We see no reason to change it.\" On bonuses, a dome spokesman said that in almost all cases these were retention bonuses roughly equivalent to a month's salary. For the six current and former executive directors the bonuses would be linked to performance.

Not only are they making a huge decision about their child's future, but they may have to face long suppressed feelings about their own school life. </p> <p>While the experience of primary or prep school has become a distant, even rose-tinted memory (although I was put off sending my son to the primary school I went to because they still had the same school secretary and she was just as horrible to me as she had been when I was a child), few do not easily remember much of our secondary school experience. </p> <p>Most of us know our duty as parents is to clear our minds and judge schools solely on whether they suit our children who are educated in systems which have changed considerably. At the same time, taking my 10-year-old son Louis round schools a year early (I had friends whose kids did not get into any of their chosen schools so I wanted to be prepared), it surprised me how hard it is not to let your own educational past colour your impression of a particular school or even a whole educational sector. </p> <p>We went to see one comprehensive with a fantastic reputation, but because I went to a comparatively small school I could not get beyond the overwhelming size of the school. Robert Dunnington, 39, and his partner Rachel have looked around seven schools for their 10-year-old son in the last few weeks, ranging from a prestigious private day school to an comprehensive with unimpressive league table results. </p> <p>\"We have tried to keep a really open mind and have seen a wide range of schools so that we can compare them,\" says Dunnington. \"We both went to comprehensives, although we had totally different experiences because Rachel lived in a rural area and went to an all girls' school. </p> <p>\"We tried not to be intimidated or over-impressed by flashy buildings and smooth rhetoric of the private schools nor to be too damning of the less glossy comprehensives. We told each other how much education has changed since we went to school. </p> <p>\"Nevertheless I went into a stuffy science class in one comprehensive where most of the pupils had their coats on and there was that awful, familiar smell of boredom and body odour. Nothing on earth could have persuaded me to send my son to that school.\" </p> <p>This experience does not seem uncommon. The familiarity - or unfamiliarity - of a school can hinder a parent's ability to judge the school on its merits. Sara Lowry, 32, whose only daughter is in year six, admits: \"I am adamant that Clara will not go to a single sex school. We haven't gone to see any girls' schools because I hated my girls' grammar school and worry that my attitude towards men has been horribly affected by that. </p> <p>\"But Clara seems very different from me and, of course, she might prefer it. Her father has offered to arrange to go round some girls' schools by private arrangement if she wants and I will try really hard not to be so hung-up on this issue.\" </p> <p>Like Lowry, some parents seem determined not to send their child to anything remotely resembling their own \"alma mater\". Footballer Vinny Jones claimed he sent his daughter to a very expensive school so that she would mix with \"posh people\", whereas my parents did the opposite. Having gone to prestigious boarding schools, they knew they wanted something much more liberal and relaxed for their children. </p> <p>Scratch the surface of a pushy parent desperate to get their child into the school with the best results - perhaps without considering other aspects of their child's all-round education - and you will often find someone who feels that they didn't do very well at school or that they were frustrated by being at a school or having parents who did not encourage them. </p> <p>Hetty Einzig, research and development director at the Parenting Education and Support Forum, believes this is inevitable. \"Of course, our past must influence our choice of school for our children. None of us can avoid drawing on our own experience, but being aware is the first step to managing those feelings and trying to put them to good use. </p> <p>\"For parents and children looking round secondary schools when they are used to the intimacy of a primary school, it can seem like a jungle. It is really important to include your child in the selection process and to discuss with them that there are different elements at play, such as your own responses due to your experience.\" </p> <p>But many of those who had a positive school experience seem naturally to veer towards sending their child to the very school they went to. Petra Fried's daughter Lauren attends Camden School for Girls, of which she is an old girl. \"I was affected by my own school days because they were very happy,\" she says. </p> <p>\"When we went round the school for Lauren I felt it was an even friendlier place, with quite a few of the same teachers. No doubt my enthusiasm affected Lauren, but I also felt that it would really suit her, even though she is different from me. I think she likes the continuity of me having been to the school.\" </p> <p>Such continuity is more common in the private sector, where families put down their child's name at birth. Here some parents don't want to break tradition. Richard Harding, 43, says he was utterly miserable at his boys' boarding school but would still find it difficult to send his eight-year-old son anywhere else. </p> <p>\"It has made me resourceful and pretty tough. It would be too much of a leap away from my family's expectations to send him to any other type of school. Actually, his boarding school is a much better place now and I am secretly relieved.\" </p> <p>Educational psychologist Sonya Hinton, author of a package for parents, pupils and teachers on the difficult transition to secondary school, says: \"Parents should understand that the decision of 'which school' is not something that should be done on behalf of but with their child. The children will have anxieties of their own which will not be the same as their parents', and which have to be given significant weight, time and consideration. </p> <p>\"The way you handle this change from the familiar to the new and strange will deeply affect the way your child copes, not only with this leap forward but with the many changes in their lifetime.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Mohammed VI succeeded Hassan II as king in July 1999 there were hopes of a more liberal climate in Morocco. The new king set himself the task of loosening the authoritarian regime he inherited from his father, who earned a reputation as a despot in the 1970s. Expectations rose higher as Mohammed began work on pushing through an educational and judicial reform programme tabled by his prime minister, Abderrahmane Youssoufi, a secular socialist who had spent years in exile. But last month Mr Youssoufi launched a savage attack on the press, banning outright three weeklies, including the independent French language publication Demain, published in Casablanca. Its editor, Ali Lmrabet, received death threats. Mr Lmrabet founded his weekly in 1997 and it quickly achieved a reputation for its fearless reporting. Its comparatively long survival was probably due to the fact that it is published in French rather than Arabic. Although the bans on Demain and the two other publications, Le Journal and Assahifa, an Arabic-language weekly, were said to have been implemented because of a political story threatening \"the stability of the country\", the action against Demain was in fact almost certainly motivated by its exposure of a huge drug smuggling conspiracy involving senior political and judicial figures. Assahifa and Le Journal were banned after they revealed a political - albeit rather historical - scandal. In 1972, the minister for defence, General Mohammed Oufkir, staged an unsuccessful coup against King Hassan. Last month, the two weeklies published a letter from a former opposition leader, Mohamed Basri, claiming that Mr Youssoufi was aware of the plot. Relations between the government and monarchy in Morocco are delicate, and the government response was savage. Demain did not publish Mr Basri's statement. It merely commented on the story, as did other publications, although its cover did pose the question: \"Did he plot against the monarchy?\" But revelations of political and judicial involvement in the drug trade sealed its fate. \"Why was Demain banned?\" Mr Lmrabet asks in an unpublished editorial in his banned publication which has been obtained by The Guardian. \"Did the information on the drug trade which the magazine has been disseminating for some weeks have something to do with it?\" Demain claimed there was \"a strange channel which allows criminals, convicted by the courts and sought by the police, to appear before a judge in T\u00e9touan [said to be the centre of drug smuggling] and be absolved in three minutes\". Mr Lmrabet claims that a recent anti-corruption campaign had been organised to protect the interests of \"certain figures involved in national high finance, still untouchable\". Demain was about to publish taped conversations between drug dealers, revealing connections with high-ranking figures in Morocco and Spain. \"Names to make you shiver,\" Mr Lmrabet said. \"Those whose rank protects them from judicial pursuit.\" Speaking from Casablanca, Mr Lmrabet said that he had been forced to let 15 of his 20 staff go. \"We and the other editors tried to start a new journal but our applications were turned down by the king's prosecutor,\" he said. \"This is totally illegal, the king's prosecutor does not have such powers. By law anyone can apply to start a magazine and they are obliged to accept. \"What we have now is a repressive partnership between the army, the government and the king.

I pocketed the high-level confirmation that, barring accidents, May 3 is the appointed day, but confessed that I had not yet blocked out my personal pre-election game plan.

A debate is buzzing in high Labour circles about whether to go into the election with a \"radical\", or what amounts to a conservative, manifesto. The answer sounds obvious.

It may befit a government about to shed the protective coat of panic which has guarded it against follies that could jeopardise a fat second term.</p> <p>But radical is a buzzword not a programme. The very asking of the question, one soon understands, concerns presentation more than substance. The issue is not about whether to produce, from an overflowing raft of radical alternatives, an arresting selection, but whether to frame the Labour manifesto as one of enormous radical excitement - or of responsible, even struggling, continuity. Radical is all about spin. The debate is thus in danger of deepening the very problem that has most blighted the first term, which is public scepticism about how many of the words ministers say can actually be believed.</p> <p>Far from dissipating scepticism, an avowedly radical manifesto will increase it.

Its 100th year as a nation will be marked by events including a centenary Test match, a politicians' cycle ride and, in tribute to the bewhiskered men who drew its colonies together and wrote its constitution, a founding fathers' beard-growing competition. But the celebrations of Australia's 1901 federation will also be the target of a renewed campaign for the removal of the Queen as head of state. The prime minister, John Howard, said the Australian achievement of the last 100 years had been massive: \"We've gone through depression, we've gone through enormous changes of mass migration, we've gone through the challenges of modernisation and globalisation - and yet we do remain a very cohesive society.\" Australia's 1901 agreement to federate followed a referendum and years of debate about the form of the nation's government. The form that was eventually adopted - a constitutional monarchy with Britain's head of state as its ceremonial ruler - was approved by an act of the British parliament. The deputy chairman of the centenary celebrations, Rodney Cavalier, admitted the republican question would be one of the \"dust clouds of distraction\" during the \u00a313m celebrations.

      "body": "<p>When you are at the top, they say, there is only one way to go. And the stock market's performance last year certainly proved that old maxim. At virtually the very end of the old millennium - December 30 1999 to be precise - the FTSE 100 index stood proudly at 6,930 points, an all time high. It never hit that level again. </p> <p>The boom in technology and internet shares came to a juddering halt, as dot.com dottiness followed the biotech boom and Dutch tulip fever into the dustbin of history. The Techmark 100 index has more than halved from a peak of 5,743 points in early March to its 2,564, in the wake of hefty falls on the US technology market Nasdaq, hit by a seemingly endless series of profit warnings from major and minor outfits alike. </p> <p>This slump in so-called new economy shares was mainly responsible for bringing the wider market down. With little recovery in old economy companies to compensate, by the end of the year the FTSE 100 had fallen to 6,222 - a 10% drop over the 12 months. Private investors who believed the much hyped rise in share prices - especially in smaller, more volatile stocks - would carry on forever learnt a nasty and abrupt lesson. Many City institutions, fearful of missing out on the boom, also ended up with their fingers burnt. </p> <p>All of which justified our decision this time last year to avoid trying to predict any winners for 2000. Our list of likely losers proved prophetic. Arthur Shaw, a window frames maker which reinvented itself as an online music business, was 18p a year ago. It now stands at 3.25p. Property group Bolton has fallen from 10.75p to 5.5p. Shell company Ronson has slid from 2p to 0.75p. </p> <p>Dan Wagner's Dialog, after a traumatic year, has curtailed its ambitions, been renamed Bright Station, and has seen its shares drop from 91p to 23.5p (albeit that it touched 230p during the course of 2000). Internet investment group Jellyworks typified the fall from grace for dot.com incubators. The company, 111.5p when mentioned here last year as one to avoid, was sold to Shore Capital in an all paper deal valuing it at around 29p a share. </p> <p>Then there was Knutsford. In some ways a symbol of the market's euphoria, Knutsford soared from nothing to a value of around \u00a31bn in a matter of days. This was based on little more than the backing of four entrepreneurs - the so-called Awesome Foursome of Archie Norman, Nigel Wray, Nick Leslau and Julian Richer - whose ambition was to take over a large retailer. </p> <p>Sainsbury and Marks &amp; Spencer were among the names bandied about. In the end it all fell apart, and Knutsford bought a small US financial group no one had ever heard of. Now called WILink its shares - traded at 250p last January - languish at 4p. </p> <p>What then of the year ahead? There are a number of uncertainties which are likely to influence the future direction of shares. Most analysts believe UK interest rates have peaked, and that the next move may be downwards. There is some debate however, as to when this might happen. Pessimists believe a cut will not happen until near the end of the year. A few die-hards are even forecasting a further rise. </p> <p>But much depends on another key factor - a general election. Widely predicted to take place in May, the uncertainty over timing and outcome (although in truth not many people are betting against Labour getting back in) is likely to hang over the market. Added to that is the prospect of a pre-election Budget giveaway, which could have unintended economic consequences and cast a shadow over interest rate policy. On top of all that, there is growing talk of a slowdown in the United States which would drag down the rest of the world's leading economies. </p> <p>Despite this, the general view seems to be that, even if technology shares do not again hit the heady heights of early 2000, there is likely to be a recovery in the previously overlooked old economy shares. In that event the FTSE 100 index could well end 2001 at a new peak. </p> <p>So here are 10 companies to watch out for in the next 12 months, ranging from established names like House of Fraser and Cable &amp; Wireless to more speculative stocks such as Systems Union. </p> <p><strong> Berkeley Homes</strong><br> </p> <p> South-eastern housebuilder Berkeley, now at 755p, is likely to continue on its growth path. The company says its niche is providing top quality homes at reasonable prices (this seems to mean an average selling price of around \u00a3290,000) and it is still seeing plenty of buyers despite some evidence that the London market may be drifting lower. </p> <p>Recent results showed a 24% rise in half-year profits to \u00a375m, and it says it is on track to complete around 3,500 house sales in the current year which could give full-year profits of some \u00a3160m. </p> <p>It recently sold a half-share of its upmarket Gunwarf Quays development in Portsmouth for \u00a380m. The proceeds will cut its borrowings to around \u00a3100m, giving it plenty of scope to make further land purchases or even go on the acquisition trail. </p> <p><strong> Cable &amp; Wireless</strong><br> </p> <p> Cable &amp; Wireless, 903p, is being valued by the City as if it were an incumbent telephone operator like BT or France Telecom. This used to be the case when it owned Hong Kong Telecom, but is far from the truth these days, since it has now turned itself into a fast growing internet services business. </p> <p>Analysts say it should be rated closer to Energis and Colt. It is expected to sell off parts of its Optus operations in Australia, including the cable TV and mobile businesses, which should be received positively by the market. </p> <p>After spending two and a half years disposing of unwanted divisions it has around \u00a33.5bn in cash which will give it enough fire power to snap up technology assets at good prices. </p> <p>The company is expected to make a number of smaller acquisitions to take it into highly rated areas like web hosting services. This leaves its shares looking undervalued. </p> <p><strong> House of Fraser</strong><br> </p> <p> House of Fraser has suffered in the general gloom about retailers, and also from trading problems at a couple of its key stores. But it could be time for a bounce back. </p> <p>The company has established brand names like Dickens &amp; Jones, DH Evans and Army &amp; Navy and, at its share price of 61p, it is well below its net asset value of around 100p a share. It also has a good dividend yield of around 9%, which should provide some support to the shares. </p> <p>Its half-year profits were knocked to the tune of \u00a33.5m due to refurbishment of its Oxford Street and Guildford stores, but the benefits of sprucing up these key sites should start to show through shortly. A lot depends on the crucial Christmas trading period, of course, but analysts are expecting profits of around \u00a319m for the current year, up from \u00a317.4m, and rising to \u00a325m next year. </p> <p><strong> Jacobs Holdings</strong><br> </p> <p> After a torrid time over the past 12 months, culminating in the disposal of its loss-making Ontime Logistics subsidiary, this should be the year that Jacobs Holdings (now at 30.5p) finally starts to deliver some performance to its long suffering shareholders. Not, perhaps, from any startling improvement in its core shipping and vehicle handling businesses, but from a realisation that fat property profits are on the horizon. </p> <p>By moving its Dart Line ferry business from Dartford to P&amp;O's newly acquired Shell Haven on the opposite bank of the Thames, Jacobs is freeing up its 60-acre freehold site for a joint redevelopment with P&amp;O.

      "bodyText": "When you are at the top, they say, there is only one way to go. And the stock market's performance last year certainly proved that old maxim. At virtually the very end of the old millennium - December 30 1999 to be precise - the FTSE 100 index stood proudly at 6,930 points, an all time high. It never hit that level again. The boom in technology and internet shares came to a juddering halt, as dot.com dottiness followed the biotech boom and Dutch tulip fever into the dustbin of history. The Techmark 100 index has more than halved from a peak of 5,743 points in early March to its 2,564, in the wake of hefty falls on the US technology market Nasdaq, hit by a seemingly endless series of profit warnings from major and minor outfits alike. This slump in so-called new economy shares was mainly responsible for bringing the wider market down. With little recovery in old economy companies to compensate, by the end of the year the FTSE 100 had fallen to 6,222 - a 10% drop over the 12 months. Private investors who believed the much hyped rise in share prices - especially in smaller, more volatile stocks - would carry on forever learnt a nasty and abrupt lesson. Many City institutions, fearful of missing out on the boom, also ended up with their fingers burnt. All of which justified our decision this time last year to avoid trying to predict any winners for 2000. Our list of likely losers proved prophetic. Arthur Shaw, a window frames maker which reinvented itself as an online music business, was 18p a year ago. It now stands at 3.25p. Property group Bolton has fallen from 10.75p to 5.5p. Shell company Ronson has slid from 2p to 0.75p. Dan Wagner's Dialog, after a traumatic year, has curtailed its ambitions, been renamed Bright Station, and has seen its shares drop from 91p to 23.5p (albeit that it touched 230p during the course of 2000). Internet investment group Jellyworks typified the fall from grace for dot.com incubators. The company, 111.5p when mentioned here last year as one to avoid, was sold to Shore Capital in an all paper deal valuing it at around 29p a share. Then there was Knutsford. In some ways a symbol of the market's euphoria, Knutsford soared from nothing to a value of around \u00a31bn in a matter of days. This was based on little more than the backing of four entrepreneurs - the so-called Awesome Foursome of Archie Norman, Nigel Wray, Nick Leslau and Julian Richer - whose ambition was to take over a large retailer. Sainsbury and Marks &amp; Spencer were among the names bandied about. In the end it all fell apart, and Knutsford bought a small US financial group no one had ever heard of. Now called WILink its shares - traded at 250p last January - languish at 4p. What then of the year ahead? There are a number of uncertainties which are likely to influence the future direction of shares. Most analysts believe UK interest rates have peaked, and that the next move may be downwards. There is some debate however, as to when this might happen. Pessimists believe a cut will not happen until near the end of the year. A few die-hards are even forecasting a further rise. But much depends on another key factor - a general election. Widely predicted to take place in May, the uncertainty over timing and outcome (although in truth not many people are betting against Labour getting back in) is likely to hang over the market. Added to that is the prospect of a pre-election Budget giveaway, which could have unintended economic consequences and cast a shadow over interest rate policy. On top of all that, there is growing talk of a slowdown in the United States which would drag down the rest of the world's leading economies. Despite this, the general view seems to be that, even if technology shares do not again hit the heady heights of early 2000, there is likely to be a recovery in the previously overlooked old economy shares. In that event the FTSE 100 index could well end 2001 at a new peak. So here are 10 companies to watch out for in the next 12 months, ranging from established names like House of Fraser and Cable &amp; Wireless to more speculative stocks such as Systems Union. Berkeley Homes South-eastern housebuilder Berkeley, now at 755p, is likely to continue on its growth path. The company says its niche is providing top quality homes at reasonable prices (this seems to mean an average selling price of around \u00a3290,000) and it is still seeing plenty of buyers despite some evidence that the London market may be drifting lower. Recent results showed a 24% rise in half-year profits to \u00a375m, and it says it is on track to complete around 3,500 house sales in the current year which could give full-year profits of some \u00a3160m. It recently sold a half-share of its upmarket Gunwarf Quays development in Portsmouth for \u00a380m. The proceeds will cut its borrowings to around \u00a3100m, giving it plenty of scope to make further land purchases or even go on the acquisition trail. Cable &amp; Wireless Cable &amp; Wireless, 903p, is being valued by the City as if it were an incumbent telephone operator like BT or France Telecom. This used to be the case when it owned Hong Kong Telecom, but is far from the truth these days, since it has now turned itself into a fast growing internet services business. Analysts say it should be rated closer to Energis and Colt. It is expected to sell off parts of its Optus operations in Australia, including the cable TV and mobile businesses, which should be received positively by the market. After spending two and a half years disposing of unwanted divisions it has around \u00a33.5bn in cash which will give it enough fire power to snap up technology assets at good prices. The company is expected to make a number of smaller acquisitions to take it into highly rated areas like web hosting services. This leaves its shares looking undervalued. House of Fraser House of Fraser has suffered in the general gloom about retailers, and also from trading problems at a couple of its key stores. But it could be time for a bounce back. The company has established brand names like Dickens &amp; Jones, DH Evans and Army &amp; Navy and, at its share price of 61p, it is well below its net asset value of around 100p a share. It also has a good dividend yield of around 9%, which should provide some support to the shares. Its half-year profits were knocked to the tune of \u00a33.5m due to refurbishment of its Oxford Street and Guildford stores, but the benefits of sprucing up these key sites should start to show through shortly. A lot depends on the crucial Christmas trading period, of course, but analysts are expecting profits of around \u00a319m for the current year, up from \u00a317.4m, and rising to \u00a325m next year. Jacobs Holdings After a torrid time over the past 12 months, culminating in the disposal of its loss-making Ontime Logistics subsidiary, this should be the year that Jacobs Holdings (now at 30.5p) finally starts to deliver some performance to its long suffering shareholders. Not, perhaps, from any startling improvement in its core shipping and vehicle handling businesses, but from a realisation that fat property profits are on the horizon. By moving its Dart Line ferry business from Dartford to P&amp;O's newly acquired Shell Haven on the opposite bank of the Thames, Jacobs is freeing up its 60-acre freehold site for a joint redevelopment with P&amp;O. With land values on the adjoining Crossways Business Park reaching \u00a3600,000 an acre, scope to speed up Dart Line's growth from its new home at Shell Haven, and even the prospect of profits from its residual interest in a large airfield site in Oxfordshire, Jacobs shares look set for a bounce. Northern Recruitment Northern Recruitment, which specialises in placing permanent and contract staff in the north of England and Scotland, issued a profits warning in November. It said it was suffering from several clients moving their recruitment plans to later in the year, which would hit its half-year figures. But investors could do worse than follow the example of Midlands entrepreneur Bob Morton, who has built up a 9.25% stake in the business. Chief executive Lorna Moran holds more than 50% of the company so there is little chance of a hostile takeover. Investors like Mr Morton, however, are attracted by the dividend yield of 6% and believe the company is likely to get back on track during the course of the year. At 45p the shares are a speculative recovery play. Shire Now a constituent of the FTSE 100 index, pharmaceutical group Shire spooked investors at the tailend of the year with a $4bn (\u00a32.7bn) all share offer for Canada's BioChem. There were suggestions the company had paid too much, and concerns about the amount of paper to be issued. But there were similar doubts when Shire acquired US group Roberts last year. Those worries were soon scotched and the deal seen as a valid one. The same is likely to be true this time round. The track record of chief executive Rolf Stahel is likely to persuade investors of the merits of the BioChem takeover, and the deal continues the move to lessen the company's dependence on the hyper activity drug Adderall. Shire's shares now stand at \u00a310.55, well off their 12-month high of \u00a315.08, and look likely to stage a recovery. Systems Union The bursting of the technology bubble has not helped this internet and software group, formerly known as freecom. But some of its problems were self-induced. When it floated at the end of 1999 it shares soared to more than 550p and it used its paper to make a number of acquisitions. These included accountancy software group Pegasus - subject of a three-way bid battle - and Oneview.net, an online business serving smaller companies.

Just a few weeks before his death he received the fruits of his labours, Patty Scholten's Elephants In Love And Other Poems, in a fine edition by Alan Ross of the London Magazine.</p> <p>Jim was the youngest son of a Birmingham industrialist. In 1935, he took a civil service job in London, and, in 1940, joined the Royal Air Force, travelling to Egypt, India and the Far East, and ending up as a flight lieutenant.</p> <p>The major change in his life came in 1946, when he left homophobic Britain for Holland, where he had friends and could \"live life my way at last\". A long companionship with a man 20 years his senior gave Jim the stability he needed to write and to begin translating.</p> <p>Dutch versions of the novels of Alan Sillitoe, Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch appeared, as well as critical essays on trends in English writing. Meanwhile, he put together his first collection of his own poems, No Summer Song (1949).</p> <p>But it was translations from his adopted to his native tongue that brought him the recognition he desired. His translations of Rutger Kopland appeared in the early 1980s in Stand magazine, and then as a selection of 10 poems in The Prospect And The River. That was followed by 57 translations of Kopland's poetry in A World Beyond Myself (1991) and Singers Behind Glass (1995), was a selection of eight modern Dutch poets.</p> <p>In Holland, there were publicatons of Jim's translations from the poet Maria Vasalis and the male Frisian poet, Tsj bbe Hettinga. For his achievements in promoting Dutch literature abroad, in 1966 he received the prestigious Martinus Nijhoff Prize and in 1997 - \"to my genuine surprise\" - a Netherlands knighthood. In 1990, he took up English poetry again.</p> <p>It was during the preparation of his collection, A Way Of Getting Through (1995), that I first met \"Sir Jim\". He was a small, slight, charming man, always wondering how it might have been had he lived on in England after 1946. When he learned that I lived in the Hertfordshire town of Ware, he asked if I thought he could live there. Later, I learned of similar conversations with friends from Devon and Oxfordshire.</p> <p>Yet he was happy in his apartment in one of the quiet northern suburbs of the Hague, cared for by a small circle of close friends, Dutch, English and Australian. His partner Bram predeceased him, 13 years ago.</p> <p>It was in the Hague that I saw him last, on a cold, slightly damp day in November, when I took him copies of his latest Rockingham collection, The Brightness In Between. He was pleased that a book of his own poems had been praised by Rutger Kopland. But our conversation, like many of his final poems, like The Brightness In Between, turned mainly on the past: \"We are not the single selves we think we are./Nor have we ever been those shadows/moving among shades in other people's minds./We lack all true identity./Yet how we loved each other, you and I,/who lacked all true identity./Come from dust and on our slow way back/to dust, but ah, the brightness in between.\"</p> <p>\u0095 <b>Tim Heath writes:</b> James Brockway's vocation as a poet grew out of his love for the Netherlands; in the words of a title to one of his poems: \"God made the World but the Dutch made Holland\". But it was by luck that he received an invitation from friends to their family home in the Hague. In this \"magical\" house, he set to work on a literary career in a land that had been turned into a German prison camp and whose people longed to break out into the world of culture.</p> <p>Brockway enjoyed the sport of placing his translations into England's \"little\" magazines for 50 years; there was little money, and frequent rejections, yet each success was akin to a sexual conquest.</p> <p>His own early writing had been the target of wartime bombing, but the editor of the Adelphi, John Middleton Murray, asked to see some of his poems. Brockway's work soon appeared in the Poetry Review under Muriel Spark's editorship and in the London Magazine, under John Lehmann and later Alan Ross.</p> <p>Yet after No Summer Song's publication in 1949, there was to be a gap of 46 years before his second collection. \"An entry for the Guiness Book Of Records,\" he would quip, yet this silence curiously marked out the period of the great love in his life while the translation work continued to flow.</p> <p>In Hans Lodeizen, Maria Vasalis (a pseudonym for Margaretha Droogleever Fortuyn) and Rutger Kopland, Brockway was responsible for translating three great Dutch poets. With Lodeizen, he learnt an important lesson - to know when a poem is beyond translation. With Vasalis, the process of translation revealed a grammar of love. A full stop inserted in the middle of a sentence can transform a poem and begin a friendship. Translation requires an unusual intelligence, and Brockway met his equal in the spirit of this beautiful and underpublished woman.</p> <p>Kopland, a professor of psychiatry, reawakened Brockway's voice. Late night telephone calls, struggling together in his garden at the end of a busy week, they advanced line by line as Kopland focused his scientific curiosity on the minute processes of creation. In contrast, Brockway grew less explicit in his own writing, making the reader work harder, and in 1995 his second book of poetry was published: A Way Of Getting Through.</p> <p>Brockway once wrote: \"Discontent leans on the air with giant hands.\" Yet he himself was a man of disciplined joy - \"there was a duty to be happy\". He was not a poet of universal themes, but found truth in the particular, moments of psychological insight best caught in poetry. He took pleasure in beautiful things: in paper, type and handmade books. And artists.</p> <p>\u0095 James Brockway, poet, translator and critic, born October 21 1916; died December 15 2000.</p>",

In Hans Lodeizen, Maria Vasalis (a pseudonym for Margaretha Droogleever Fortuyn) and Rutger Kopland, Brockway was responsible for translating three great Dutch poets. With Lodeizen, he learnt an important lesson - to know when a poem is beyond translation. With Vasalis, the process of translation revealed a grammar of love. A full stop inserted in the middle of a sentence can transform a poem and begin a friendship. Translation requires an unusual intelligence, and Brockway met his equal in the spirit of this beautiful and underpublished woman. Kopland, a professor of psychiatry, reawakened Brockway's voice. Late night telephone calls, struggling together in his garden at the end of a busy week, they advanced line by line as Kopland focused his scientific curiosity on the minute processes of creation. In contrast, Brockway grew less explicit in his own writing, making the reader work harder, and in 1995 his second book of poetry was published: A Way Of Getting Through. Brockway once wrote: \"Discontent leans on the air with giant hands.\" Yet he himself was a man of disciplined joy - \"there was a duty to be happy\". He was not a poet of universal themes, but found truth in the particular, moments of psychological insight best caught in poetry. He took pleasure in beautiful things: in paper, type and handmade books. And artists. \u0095 James Brockway, poet, translator and critic, born October 21 1916; died December 15 2000.",

      "body": "<p>To celebrate the pedant's millennium and the election year of 2001, here's a thought that some Guardian readers might find cheering. First, a bit of historical background: it was 18 years from the general election of 1906, when the Liberals won 400 parliamentary seats, until 1924, when they won 40 and finally descended - so far irrevocably - into the status of a third party. This is the period remembered in George Delderfield's book, the title of which has turned almost into cliche: The Strange Death of Liberal England.</p> <p>It is now 18 years since 1983, when the Conservatives gave the Labour party, then led by Michael Foot, the mother and father of a hiding. Shortly before that election, opinion poll figures made it seem as though Labour might disappear, to be replaced by the Gang of Four and the SDP.</p> <p>As we now know, shrewdies (like Tony Blair) were in fact buying Labour shares at the bottom of the market, and 14 years later were in place to reap the dividend of power. These days, the initials SDP evoke either bafflement or a chortle, and Labour's recovery might seem to have been inevitable. It was nothing of the kind. If Tony Benn had scored a handful more votes in the deputy leadership vote in 1981 and beaten Denis Healey to the job, the exodus of moderate MPs from the party could have become an unstoppable stampede.</p> <p>In 1997 the Conservatives were beaten even more heavily than Labour in 1983 and, four years later, have arguably declined further. Yet Labour is still suffering an Eeyore-ish pessimism. Well, I am all for caution, especially when making predictions in print that can be flung back when they are proved wrong. But just consider another possibility: that the dragon really has been slain, and that we are witnessing, without realising it, The Even Stranger Death of Conservative England.</p> <p>The most skilled pathologist would find the rigor mortis hard to spot, because the rightwing press is so combative and so powerful. However, although newspapers can nudge people towards what they were already half-thinking - as in the Sun's blisteringly effective attacks on Neil Kinnock's competence in 1992 - the press cannot persuade readers to believe what they know instinctively to be ludicrous. The combined forces of Charles Foster Kane and Phineas T Barnum could not make the present Conservative party popular.</p> <p>The Tories' problems over personalities and policies are too well-known to be worth repeating here. There remains a terror that the combined might of the Tories and the tabloids might turn \"Save the pound\" into a rallying cry. But Europe has never been an election issue here, no matter how hot the debate during the rest of the political cycle. The parties have always been too divided; the electorate too uncaring.</p> <p>Some analysts claim that the Conservatives will gain in the forthcoming election from differential turnout because their opponents will not be as motivated as they were in 1997 when the country voted to turn the rascals out with such unanimity. Actually, turnout is one of the most unpredictable factors in any election, and the effect of a month of shouting is impossible to gauge. Remember that there is a class of voters terrified of change, who cleave naturally to the party in power and actually stayed loyal to the Tories in 1997. There is also one wholly predictable factor which has been overlooked.</p> <p>The electoral register has a turnover of about 1.6% a year: voters, mostly elderly ones, die, alas; they are replaced by 18-year-olds. In the course of a four-year parliament that means a change of more than 6%. But the Tories have been continuously unpopular (save for the briefest of blips during the fuel crisis) since the autumn of 1992. Indeed, if you exclude that spring and summer, this phase has now gone on since 1988. Since that time, almost a fifth of the electorate has changed. Increasingly, the Conservatives have to woo, not disaffected supporters, but under-30s who have never supported them in their lives.</p> <p>In governmental terms, it is still a mystery what the Blair Project actually means, if anything. In political terms, the prime minister wanted - probably still wants - a vaguely left-of-centre, touchy-feely alliance that would outnumber the Tories more often than not. He was too unambitious. There is an altogether more alluring scenario in which the present Labour party gets harried in time by a Lib Dem party strengthened by breakaways from the humanoid wing of the Tories, with the existing Conservatives reduced to a rump. Improbable? Perhaps. Impossible? Certainly not.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk\">matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk</a></p>",

However, although newspapers can nudge people towards what they were already half-thinking - as in the Sun's blisteringly effective attacks on Neil Kinnock's competence in 1992 - the press cannot persuade readers to believe what they know instinctively to be ludicrous. The combined forces of Charles Foster Kane and Phineas T Barnum could not make the present Conservative party popular. The Tories' problems over personalities and policies are too well-known to be worth repeating here. There remains a terror that the combined might of the Tories and the tabloids might turn \"Save the pound\" into a rallying cry. But Europe has never been an election issue here, no matter how hot the debate during the rest of the political cycle. The parties have always been too divided; the electorate too uncaring. Some analysts claim that the Conservatives will gain in the forthcoming election from differential turnout because their opponents will not be as motivated as they were in 1997 when the country voted to turn the rascals out with such unanimity. Actually, turnout is one of the most unpredictable factors in any election, and the effect of a month of shouting is impossible to gauge. Remember that there is a class of voters terrified of change, who cleave naturally to the party in power and actually stayed loyal to the Tories in 1997. There is also one wholly predictable factor which has been overlooked. The electoral register has a turnover of about 1.6% a year: voters, mostly elderly ones, die, alas; they are replaced by 18-year-olds. In the course of a four-year parliament that means a change of more than 6%. But the Tories have been continuously unpopular (save for the briefest of blips during the fuel crisis) since the autumn of 1992. Indeed, if you exclude that spring and summer, this phase has now gone on since 1988. Since that time, almost a fifth of the electorate has changed. Increasingly, the Conservatives have to woo, not disaffected supporters, but under-30s who have never supported them in their lives. In governmental terms, it is still a mystery what the Blair Project actually means, if anything. In political terms, the prime minister wanted - probably still wants - a vaguely left-of-centre, touchy-feely alliance that would outnumber the Tories more often than not. He was too unambitious. There is an altogether more alluring scenario in which the present Labour party gets harried in time by a Lib Dem party strengthened by breakaways from the humanoid wing of the Tories, with the existing Conservatives reduced to a rump. Improbable? Perhaps. Impossible? Certainly not. matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk",

It is believed Marcello Minale, 58, who rowed in the Olympics as a teenager, was stabbed after an argument in a car park near Fayence, southern France, on Saturday. A 23-year-old man was arrested and last night a spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said a man had been charged with the French crime of voluntary homicide. The men were members of a party from the Tideway Scullers school, based at Chiswick, west London, who were on a 10-day training trip at Lac de St Cassien, near Cannes. The club chairman, Chris Williams, said: \"Details are very sketchy, but it seems there was an argument in the course of which Marcello got killed. We have no idea why it happened, or what caused the trouble. Marcello was a very jovial, quite big Italian guy, very much loved by all members of the club and very respected.\" Mr Minale left Italy to study design in Helsinki. In 1964 he set up a practice in London with Brian Tattersfield in a tiny room \"with only a window sill to work on\", according to the company's website. Minale Tattersfield and Partners now has 160 staff worldwide in 18 offices and has won more than 300 international awards, including 13 silver medals from the London-based Designers' and Art Directors' Association. The company's clients include Marconi, Motorola, Nivea and the Royal Armouries, Leeds, with projects ranging from packaging to petrol pumps. Mr Minale, a father of three from Ealing, west London, had published eight books on design and with Mr Tattersfield received the D&amp;ADA president's award for their outstanding contribution to the industry. Alex Maranzano, managing director of Minale Tattersfield, which is based in Richmond, south-west London, said Mr Minale had won a silver medal for rowing at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome and remained a keen rower, often taking to the river in the mornings before coming to to the office. \"As he got older, he got into the coaching side of things more, but he would often come into the office later in the morning, having been out on the water. \"It didn't matter what the weather was like, he was very keen and would always go out.\" Mr Maranzano said he had visited his colleague's wife and youngest son yesterday, while the dead man's two eldest sons had flown out to France. \"They are in a hell of a state, as you can imagine,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "A senior Ulster Unionist last night rejected an IRA statement blaming Tony Blair for the deadlock in the Northern Ireland political process as \"totally unrealistic\". The New Year message repeated previous claims that the IRA had made \"unprecedented initiatives to enhance all genuine efforts to realise a just and lasting peace\". But it accused the government of failing to grasp the opportunities this had created and said that while the IRA remained committed to resolving the arms issue, this would not happen unless the prime minister \"takes political responsibility for it\". London and Dublin are due to restart intensive efforts to stop the peace process lurching toward crisis once again, with unionists and republicans deadlocked over paramilitary disarmament, demilitarisation and policing. The IRA has taken the unprecedented step of allowing international inspectors to examine several of its secret arms dumps twice in the past few months but has not been in contact with General John de Chastelain's disarmament body since a phone call in June. Republicans want more action on police reform and a substantial security scaledown, particularly in the heavily fortified south Armagh region, before they will consider further moves. But Ulster Unionist hardliners could force their leader, David Trimble, to pull out of the power-sharing Stormont government within the next few weeks if the IRA does at least re-engage seriously with General de Chastelain. One of Mr Trimble's closest allies, the Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Ken Maginnis, said yesterday: \"Unionism totally rejects the basis on which the IRA tries to function.

The Israelis and Palestinians marked the start of the new year by clashings all over the region, with elements on both sides vowing revenge attacks. The militant Palestinian group Hamas threatened a resumption of suicide bombings and Palestinians were braced for a punitive strike from Israel in retaliation for the latest bombings. Amr Moussa, the foreign minister of Egypt, which has been at the centre of negotiations between Israel, Palestine and the US over the last week, gave his most pessimistic assessment yet. Speaking after a meeting with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, Mr Moussa said there were \"no indications\" that a deal could be sealed in the 19 days left before Mr Clinton leaves office. Mr Arafat told the Egyptians he wanted a meeting with Mr Clinton in Washington to clarify the US proposals and look at detailed maps of the territorial arrangements. If such clarification was not forthcoming, he would reject the plan. A meeting was later arranged, possibly in the next 24 hours, but it was not clear whether Mr Clinton would be able to provide what Mr Arafat wanted.

A three-year-old child was killed and an 11-year-old died of wounds sustained the previous day. In a separate incident, witnesses said Jewish settlers had driven into Hizma village near Jerusalem in two cars on Sunday and shot dead a Palestinian, Tahrir Rezeq, 22. The car bomb in Israel, near the coastal city of Netanya, about 12 miles (20 kilometres) from Tel Aviv, marks the second time in a week that Palestinian militants have struck inside Israel, which normally avoids the worst of the violence. Moshe Seff, Netanya's fire chief, said three blasts occurred in rapid succession, smashing shop windows. Palestinians marked the anniversary of the New Year's Day founding of the Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation with a call for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 298 Palestinians, 13 Israeli Arabs and 43 other Israelis have been killed in the Palestinian uprising that erupted three months ago. Jewish settlers blocked roads to West Bank Arab villages in anger at Sunday's killing by Palestinian gunmen of Binyamin Kahane, the son of rabbi Meir Kahane, who was himself killed by an Arab in New York a decade ago. Still hoping for a peace breakthrough, Mr Barak told conscripts at an army base: \"We aren't throwing up our hands.

A nervous Palestinian, watching him go down a flight of steps on the way out of a block of flats in Ramallah yesterday, said: \"Give him a few minutes in case the Israelis are waiting.\"</p> <p>Those around him have been especially nervous in the last 48 hours as the rate of killings has increased. Among the casualties was one of Mr Barghouti's colleagues in Fatah, the dominant faction in the Palestine Liberation Organisation, shot dead by Israeli security forces on Sunday.</p> <p>Mr Barghouti is leader of Fatah on the West Bank and its army of stone-throwers, the Fatah youth wing that Israelis refer to as the Tanzim.</p> <p>He has been dubbed by the Arab press \"Fatah's Napoleon\", partly because of his diminutive stature and partly because of his energy and charisma. He is a general on the ground, who can be found at street corners during stone-throwing, mobile phone in hand.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has personally blamed him for the intifada. But the uprising has left Mr Barghouti both popular and powerful, and a candidate for succession after the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, goes.</p> <p>Mr Barghouti is part of Mr Arafat's dilemma. The Palestinian leader is caught between the US president, Bill Clinton, who wants him to accept his peace proposals, and Mr Barghouti, who wants them rejected.</p> <p>Mr Barghouti, one of the younger generation of Palestinian leaders, is a problem for Mr Arafat because he has come to represent the mood among Palestinians on the ground.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Barghouti was unequivocal: \"The US plans are very bad. They have to be rejected. They go against all the UN resolutions [that call for a return to the border that existed before the Arab-Israeli war in 1967 and a return of the refugees].\"</p> <p>Any journalist wanting to meet Mr Barghouti will be directed to Ramallah but no address will be provided, in case the Israelis are listening or following. He does everything possible to minimise the chance of assassination. Once in the town, after a series of phone calls, directions will be given to wherever he has set up his office that particular day, usually in a dingy block of residential flats.</p> <p>The interview was conducted in an office with dirty white walls, sparsely furnished, with men in jeans and T-shirts armed with AK-47s lounging around. Above his head was a huge portrait of Jerusalem's disputed holy site, called Haram al-Sharif by by Muslims and Temple Mount by Jews. Both sides claim it.</p> <p><b> Anniversary</b><br></p> <p>Yesterday was an important day for Mr Barghouti, the 36th anniversary of the founding of Fatah (Victory). Soon after it was established, Palestinian commandos began raids into Israel. Rallies were held throughout the West Bank yesterday to mark the day, adding to the volatility.</p> <p>Crucially, Mr Barghouti has emerged as the most important Palestinian sceptic about Mr Arafat's conduct of the peace negotiations over the last seven years, especially as during that time the number of Jewish settlements on the West Bank has expanded.</p> <p>He said publicly that Fatah would refuse to obey an order to stop the intifada on the basis of the US plan on the table at present.

      "bodyText": "Marwan Barghouti is dangerous company. As the leader of the Palestinian uprising, he is a top target of the Israelis. A nervous Palestinian, watching him go down a flight of steps on the way out of a block of flats in Ramallah yesterday, said: \"Give him a few minutes in case the Israelis are waiting.\" Those around him have been especially nervous in the last 48 hours as the rate of killings has increased. Among the casualties was one of Mr Barghouti's colleagues in Fatah, the dominant faction in the Palestine Liberation Organisation, shot dead by Israeli security forces on Sunday. Mr Barghouti is leader of Fatah on the West Bank and its army of stone-throwers, the Fatah youth wing that Israelis refer to as the Tanzim. He has been dubbed by the Arab press \"Fatah's Napoleon\", partly because of his diminutive stature and partly because of his energy and charisma. He is a general on the ground, who can be found at street corners during stone-throwing, mobile phone in hand. The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has personally blamed him for the intifada. But the uprising has left Mr Barghouti both popular and powerful, and a candidate for succession after the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, goes. Mr Barghouti is part of Mr Arafat's dilemma. The Palestinian leader is caught between the US president, Bill Clinton, who wants him to accept his peace proposals, and Mr Barghouti, who wants them rejected. Mr Barghouti, one of the younger generation of Palestinian leaders, is a problem for Mr Arafat because he has come to represent the mood among Palestinians on the ground. In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Barghouti was unequivocal: \"The US plans are very bad. They have to be rejected. They go against all the UN resolutions [that call for a return to the border that existed before the Arab-Israeli war in 1967 and a return of the refugees].\" Any journalist wanting to meet Mr Barghouti will be directed to Ramallah but no address will be provided, in case the Israelis are listening or following. He does everything possible to minimise the chance of assassination. Once in the town, after a series of phone calls, directions will be given to wherever he has set up his office that particular day, usually in a dingy block of residential flats. The interview was conducted in an office with dirty white walls, sparsely furnished, with men in jeans and T-shirts armed with AK-47s lounging around. Above his head was a huge portrait of Jerusalem's disputed holy site, called Haram al-Sharif by by Muslims and Temple Mount by Jews. Both sides claim it. Anniversary Yesterday was an important day for Mr Barghouti, the 36th anniversary of the founding of Fatah (Victory). Soon after it was established, Palestinian commandos began raids into Israel. Rallies were held throughout the West Bank yesterday to mark the day, adding to the volatility. Crucially, Mr Barghouti has emerged as the most important Palestinian sceptic about Mr Arafat's conduct of the peace negotiations over the last seven years, especially as during that time the number of Jewish settlements on the West Bank has expanded. He said publicly that Fatah would refuse to obey an order to stop the intifada on the basis of the US plan on the table at present. This proposes sharing control over Haram al-Sharif and a territorial division more favourable to the Palestinians than before. But Palestinians have difficulty, in particular, with a US proposal that they renounce the right of return of the 3.5m refugees to Israel. What if Mr Arafat were to do a deal on the basis of the US plan? Would he oppose his own leader? \"He [Arafat] will not. I am confident he will not accept this suggestion because it is an offer to reorganise the Israeli occupation rather than an Israeli withdrawal.\" He has built up Fatah on the West Bank as a separate powerbase, separate from the Palestinian Authority, the embryonic government. \"We are a party which is the party of the leadership, but we are not the Palestinian Authority,\" he said. He provoked controversy when he criticised the Palestinian Authority police for failing to join in the intifada. \"Fatah has seven years' experience of an intifada without a Palestinian Authority, and seven years' experience of an Authority without an intifada.\" In a direct challenge to Mr Arafat, he wants the delegation negotiating with the Israelis to be widened beyond Mr Arafat and his inner circle to include voices such as Hamas, the Palestinian group committed to violence. The reason for Mr Barghouti's popularity with Palestinians, especially the young, is his high-profile involvement in the intifada. In contrast with Mr Arafat and his inner circle, who have seldom been seen on the streets during the uprising, Mr Barghouti is visible at each stage of the violent cycle: rallies, riots and funerals. Mr Barghouti, 41, belongs to the coming generation of Palestinian leaders. He was brought up on the West Bank, unlike Mr Arafat's closest colleagues, almost all of whom were with him in exile in Tunis. Mr Arafat, 71, is showing signs of ill-health. Palestinians generally are reluctant to speculate on who might replace him, though the assumption is that his successor will be one of the Tunis crowd. The names usually mentioned are Abu Mazin, Abu Ala and Faruq Qaddumi. Even if one of those takes over, Mr Barghouti's generation, with their different views, know their time will not be long in coming. When Mr Arafat goes, the Palestinians might even go directly for Mr Barghouti or one of his contemporaries. It would not be the first time that a society living with conflict has opted to follow the man with the gun. Outspoken critic Mr Barghouti is a farmer's son, raised in the West Bank village of Kafr Kuber. He was head of Fatah's student movement while at university and was in and out of prison over a six-year period before being deported by Israel to Jordan. While in exile, he was elected to the Fatah Revolutionary Council, becoming its youngest member. He returned to the West Bank in 1994, among the first group of deportees to go home under the Oslo agreement signed by the Israelis and Palestinians, ending the first intifada. In a society where few Palestinians will publicly criticise Mr Arafat, Mr Barghouti has been outspoken, especially about the widespread corruption involving those round the Palestinian leader. The extravagant lifestyle of some of them has led to a lot of disillusionment with the Tunis crowd among young Palestinians. Mr Barghouti has said repeatedly that the only language Israel understands is force. He has consistently advocated a more aggressive approach towards Israel. When Israeli forces pulled out of Lebanon in the summer after sustained attacks from the guerrillas of the Islamic group, Hizbullah, the lesson Mr Barghouti drew was that Israel responds to force. Against that background, it is no surprise that the Israelis have already made one strike against one of his offices since the uprising began: he was absent when the helicopter fired its missile. He said at the time: \"The Israelis say they bombed the headquarters of the Tanzim and the offices of Marwan Barghouti, but as you can see, that is not true. Marwan Barghouti is right here. They say they wanted to send me a personal message. But you can tell them I did not receive the message.\" They missed that time. They may not miss next time.

Soon the \"devil monkey\", as it was swiftly dubbed, had been blamed for scores of injuries at work.

The cautionary tale emerged as customs officers yesterday revealed some of the more bizarre tricks in the smuggler's repertoire. Filling condoms with drugs and then hiding them on the body is a favourite tactic; in one recent case a man who was stopped in his car in the Channel tunnel was jailed for seven years after an x-ray revealed 117 condoms inside his stomach. \"He also had one stuffed somewhere else for good measure,\" Mr Knott said. There have been people who have swallowed more than 200 condoms, and they can be stored for up to 14 days. One of the most unusual smuggling methods is to dissolve cocaine in alcohol. \"The alcohol is placed in a bath and the cocaine is absorbed into the liquid,\" Mr Knott said. \"A suit is then put in the bath and the suit is transported across the borders.\" Seven hundred boxes of fake avocados made from papier-mache and filled with cocaine have also been seized, while a man was jailed for 14 years for trying to smuggle thousands of ecstasy tablets in the arms of a JCB digger.

Tony Blair's \"patriotism minister\", Michael Wills, and the cabinet office minister, Lord Falconer, both insisted they were open to suggestions, in the face of Tory taunts that Labour's commitment to Britishness was skin deep. Lord Falconer, who is also in charge of the Millennium Dome project, told the Guardian that 2001 was also the tercentenary of the 1701 Act of Union which united the crowns of England and Scotland, six years before political union of the two parliaments was finally agreed. \"If people have ideas about how we should celebrate them, let them come forward,\" he said. Mr Wills, whose main job is minister for information and communications technology, said: \"We haven't made a decision on this yet. The Cabinet Office is still considering what to do about this.\" The even more controversial abolition of the Irish parliament by William Pitt took place in the wake of radical rebellion in 1798 and war against revolutionary France - which invaded Ireland. It was steered through the Dublin parliament, long dominated from London, in August 1800. The union, which gave the union flag its current form, came into force on January 1 1801 but was never accepted, not least because Pitt was unable to fulfil his pledge to restore the vote to Catholics in the package that gave Ireland 100 MPs at Westminster. When they finally got the vote after 1829, Catholics began the long agitation for home rule which culminated in the partition of Ireland in 1921. None of which prevented the Conservative party chairman, Michael Ancram, on Radio 4's Today programme, from accusing ministers of lacking respect for or understanding of British institutions. \"It is a bit rich for Michael Wills to say: 'We are still considering whether we are going to celebrate the birthday', when the birthday has taken place. The very fact that this government has appointed a junior minister as the patriotism minister puts in perspective what this government thinks about the union.\" As a Scottish Catholic aristocrat and former Northern Ireland minister, Mr Ancram is better placed than most people to understand the controversies lurking below the surface or the historic propensity of his own party to \"play the Orange card\" in Irish politics.

The army watchtowers of south Armagh, 80ft high and covered in satellite dishes and observation equipment, are at the centre of a debate which threatens to obscure the Northern Ireland peace process. Republicans say they should be pulled down and the whole south Armagh operation, including foot patrols and helicopters, got rid of as part of the demilitarisation promised in the Good Friday agreement. But unionists, the security forces and to date, the government, insist that the menace from dissident and, in some cases, mainstream paramilitaries, means the towers, built in 1986, are still essential. There are between 600 and 1,000 troops in the region, depending on operations, though these are spread as far as Newry and Downpatrick, and 14 watchtowers. An army spokesman would only confirm: \"We will continue to provide the level of protection and support the RUC requires to provide a service to the entire community.\" It is believed police officers venturing out in south Armagh have around a dozen soldiers covering them, and if the towers were taken away, two or even three times as many troops would be on the ground during RUC manoeuvres. For the residents' spokeswoman Toni Carragher, the damage caused and dangers posed by the security operation outweigh the supposed benefits. She claimed there was evidence that the electronic surveillance equipment in the towers caused radiation contributing to the high incidence of cancer in the region.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The clouds had cleared over Guy Hurst's back garden and, as our eyes adjusted to the night, a few pinpricks of light resolved themselves in the sky. \"That's Jupiter, in the east,\" said Hurst, pointing to the brightest object. \"To the right, much fainter, is Saturn. That belt of stars is the Pleiades.\" </p> <p>With a shuddering and a clattering, a tight constellation of stars, two white and one red, detached itself from the firmament and moved swiftly across the heavens. \"That's a helicopter,\" said Hurst. Military helicopters from the airbase at Odiham nearby are the gentlest kind of interference coming between Hurst, one of the country's best-known amateur astronomers, and the glories of the night sky. </p> <p>He lives outside Basingstoke, Hampshire, which is trapped, like much of Britain, in a giant bubble of light pollution - billions of watts of wasted light, poured into the sky from signs, security lights, floodlights and around 7m street lights. </p> <p>Over Christmas, when the skies were briefly clear, people got their best chance to see the International Space Station, its newly-attached 200ft sun-gathering \"wings\" catching the light for several minutes as it tracked across the horizon. City dwellers could only see it through the thick fog of artificial lights, because it is one of the brightest objects in the sky. In 2000, if we want to see wonders of the cosmos, we have to make them. </p> <p>Anger over light pollution has coalesced into a campaign for planning controls called the British Astronomical Association's Campaign for Dark Skies. The coordinator, Bob Mizon, said they wanted better lights, not no lights. \"We're not campaigning for dark streets,\" he said. \"We're campaigning for dark skies.\" </p> <p>All of us are blinded by the light, he points out. Children are growing up ignorant of the nightly glories of the natural skyscape - constellations, meteors, comets and the richness of a black sky dusted with thousands of stars. \"One reason why astrology is promoted in popular culture more than astronomy is people can see horoscopes any day, but nobody can see real stars and planets. Because of light pollution, most children in this country have never seen the Milky Way.\" </p> <p>A few years ago evening shoppers in the centre of Basingstoke saw a man standing in the middle of a supermarket car park, his shopping forgotten, gazing at the sky. They asked him what he was looking at. They followed his finger: it was comet Hale-Bopp, a comet so bright it could penetrate the heart of the town's electric glow. </p> <p>That man was Guy Hurst. No wonder the shoppers were intrigued. There's usually precious little reason to scan the heavens over central Basingstoke, a town no more or less light polluted than scores of others. The road from the station is awash in apricot-coloured streetlight bright enough to read a newspaper by. A retail park blazes with car park lights, metre-high logos glow on retail warehouses. The moon is bright, a couple of days off full, but it is outshone into insignificance by the illuminations of corporate and municipal Britain. </p> <p>Hurst lives in the suburbs four or five miles away.

      "bodyText": "The clouds had cleared over Guy Hurst's back garden and, as our eyes adjusted to the night, a few pinpricks of light resolved themselves in the sky. \"That's Jupiter, in the east,\" said Hurst, pointing to the brightest object. \"To the right, much fainter, is Saturn. That belt of stars is the Pleiades.\" With a shuddering and a clattering, a tight constellation of stars, two white and one red, detached itself from the firmament and moved swiftly across the heavens. \"That's a helicopter,\" said Hurst. Military helicopters from the airbase at Odiham nearby are the gentlest kind of interference coming between Hurst, one of the country's best-known amateur astronomers, and the glories of the night sky. He lives outside Basingstoke, Hampshire, which is trapped, like much of Britain, in a giant bubble of light pollution - billions of watts of wasted light, poured into the sky from signs, security lights, floodlights and around 7m street lights. Over Christmas, when the skies were briefly clear, people got their best chance to see the International Space Station, its newly-attached 200ft sun-gathering \"wings\" catching the light for several minutes as it tracked across the horizon. City dwellers could only see it through the thick fog of artificial lights, because it is one of the brightest objects in the sky. In 2000, if we want to see wonders of the cosmos, we have to make them. Anger over light pollution has coalesced into a campaign for planning controls called the British Astronomical Association's Campaign for Dark Skies. The coordinator, Bob Mizon, said they wanted better lights, not no lights. \"We're not campaigning for dark streets,\" he said. \"We're campaigning for dark skies.\" All of us are blinded by the light, he points out. Children are growing up ignorant of the nightly glories of the natural skyscape - constellations, meteors, comets and the richness of a black sky dusted with thousands of stars. \"One reason why astrology is promoted in popular culture more than astronomy is people can see horoscopes any day, but nobody can see real stars and planets. Because of light pollution, most children in this country have never seen the Milky Way.\" A few years ago evening shoppers in the centre of Basingstoke saw a man standing in the middle of a supermarket car park, his shopping forgotten, gazing at the sky. They asked him what he was looking at. They followed his finger: it was comet Hale-Bopp, a comet so bright it could penetrate the heart of the town's electric glow. That man was Guy Hurst. No wonder the shoppers were intrigued. There's usually precious little reason to scan the heavens over central Basingstoke, a town no more or less light polluted than scores of others. The road from the station is awash in apricot-coloured streetlight bright enough to read a newspaper by. A retail park blazes with car park lights, metre-high logos glow on retail warehouses. The moon is bright, a couple of days off full, but it is outshone into insignificance by the illuminations of corporate and municipal Britain. Hurst lives in the suburbs four or five miles away. It is darker, but is still well within the area of Basingstoke's primary light bubble. Two street lights gush bright orange light outside his house. Across the road, his neighbours - whom he gets on fine with otherwise - have installed a powerful security light, the latest scourge of stargazers. Hurst has surrounded the garden with tall laurel and leylandii but the light leaks through into his shed-like home-made observatory. \"The security light shines straight through this gap here,\" he said. \"If it comes on just as you're about to start looking at something, you find your whole dark adaptation goes.\" He nodded at the streetlights. \"They're not really designed to reflect light downwards. A good proportion of that light is going horizontally, or even slightly upwards.\" Back in the garden, Hurst pointed to where the Milky Way, a river of millions of stars making up one of the spokes of our spiral home galaxy, should be visible, running through the constellations Auriga (the Charioteer), and Perseus. There is nothing to be seen. We drove across the M3 and headed into the countryside, seeking darkness. On a B-road close to the village of Axford, we got out to see a sky which was almost black. More stars could be seen. In quick succession, three meteors cut white streaks through the night. Even here, the Milky Way was invisible. We were in the overlap between the edge of Basingstoke's night glow and that of other southern towns and villages. There are thousands of stars and at least one galaxy to be seen with the naked eye, but we could only see a few dozen. Hurst indicated the square of Pegasus, formed by four stars. \"There are lots of stars in that square, but we can't see any of them.\" Serious light pollution began blotting out the stars in the 1950s, when electric street lighting became widespread and powerful. The government is becoming aware of the problem, and is starting to realise that street lights are available which direct light into a broad cone downwards, leaving the sky dark and saving energy. Campaigners praise Railtrack and the highways agency, which are beginning to install sky-friendly lighting. Some town streets and a handful of supermarket car parks have been purged of lamps such as the dreaded globes which radiate illumination evenly in all directions. Sometimes there are other reasons for darkening the skies. Railtrack found its old lights were confusing drivers on the lookout for signals, while a scheme to illuminate the Humber Bridge with 72 thousand-watt floodlights - the glow would have been visible 50 miles away - was dumped mainly because of fears that migrating birds would get fatally lost. The era of the security lights - a high powered external light linked to a movement detector to deter burglars - means a new threat. \"Anyone can put a 1000-watt security light on their cottage and there is nothing you can do about it,\" said Bob Mizon. \"Light isn't considered pollution like barking dogs or dirty air.",

An icon of ITV's better days, source of style tips for Thatcherite fops everywhere, and great comfort of Anglophile Americans to this day. And, presumably, an inspiration to anyone considering appearing in a TV adaptation of an Evelyn Waugh book. Someone like Daniel Craig, star of Sword Of Honour. </p> <p>\"When I went to meet the director I said 'If this is anything like Brideshead, fuck off. I can't be bothered with it.' He just went, 'No, we're not going to do that.'\" The casting alone is enough to tell you that Sword Of Honour isn't Brideshead Revisited revisited. Rather than Jeremy Irons, we have Craig, still best known as Geordie - the one who learns the dark ways of Soho from Malcolm McDowell - in Our Friends In The North. Mike Leigh favourite Katrin Cartlidge plays a scheming expat, and Leslie Phillips is the central character's father. William Boyd has boiled the whole thing down from Waugh's autobiographical trilogy about the Second World War, a disillusioned and bitterly funny series of books that is a world away from the social-climbing nostalgia of Brideshead Revisited. In Sword Of Honour, middle-aged posh failure, Guy Crouchback, joins up in search of redemption through glory, and finds that the British army only values cowards and liars. Boyd likes to think of it as an English Catch-22. The best bits of this TV adaptation, showing the sick comedy of the disastrous British operations in Crete, are exactly that. </p> <p>\"If we got a page in the Daily Mail saying 'This is not Evelyn Waugh!' I'd be very happy,\" says Craig. He knows that Crouchback isn't an obviously sympathetic character. \"That's what makes him interesting. The fact is that he's a bit of a screwup. That either endears you to him, or you wish he'd get on with things. But I related to that, that's quite a modern feeling, that feeling that life ends up passing you by if you don't stop and think about it. And he forces himself to think about it, but he forces himself in the wrong way: he thinks he's going to find it by going to war.\" </p> <p>At 32, Craig is a bit younger than Crouchback, but he has one of those faces that is neither transparently young nor old. It helped him in the long timespan of Our Friends In The North, and has allowed him to play a series of wildly different characters, perhaps, most memorably, Francis Bacon's lover, George Dyer, in Love Is The Devil. But he is easily recognisable because of his striking blue eyes. </p> <p>This is the Daniel Craig story, as he tells it: \"Grew up on the Wirral, left home at 16 or 17, came down to London, did the National Youth Theatre, managed to stay in London somehow, went to drama school, became an actor. There is some other stuff, but really that's it.\" </p> <p>His performances suggest someone gruff, insular and hard, but he turns out to be affable and talkative, even on the subject of Tomb Raider. He is in the middle of shooting the film version - his first blockbuster - and all sorts of dire warnings have been issued about plot secrecy. </p> <p>\"The deal is: I know about the game, I find out that this guy Simon West is directing it, I get an interview to meet the guy and I really like him. I don't want to be screwed around and I think I'm going to play the poor English cousin in this big old movie. But my profile had been raised because of Love Is The Devil, and they were going 'We WANT YOU to do this movie' and for an actor that's 'Oh, you do? Really?' It was shit-or-get-off-the-pot time. I mean, I want to make smaller-budget movies, much more character-based, with more of a message. But if I can do this movie and it can raise my profile enough...\" </p> <p>As Kate Winslet did with Titanic? (Incidentally, a younger Winslet and Craig once played a couple in A Kid In King Arthur's Court.) \"That's my ideal. She's doing it right. Now she can go to do a movie that is short of half a million quid, and that half a million quid will then appear, and that film will get made, and she'll have some artistic control and, on the back of her name, she'll be putting something back into the business. And that seems to be the right move.\" </p> <p>He is fully versed in the Tomb Raider worldwide-phenomenon statistics, which he recites with a laugh. Usefully, before he ever got the role, he'd wasted enough hours sending Lara Croft down secret passageways himself. But he has a more pertinent argument about why the film might just work: \"This guy Simon West...Con Air [directed by West] is a very funny movie, its tongue is placed firmly in its cheek, but with style. I think he's bright. And Angelina Jolie is a piece of classic casting.\" Of course, Tomb Raider could be the hit of the summer and international superstardom could still pass Daniel Craig by. After all, The Mummy hasn't turned John Hannah into someone who makes people faint in the streets. But that doesn't seem to be what Daniel Craig is after, anyway. He's not interested in making it too easy for himself, or the audience. Which is why you should give Sword Of Honour a go, even - no, especially - if the decaying aristos of Brideshead made you feel nauseous. </p> <p>\"If you stick with it, there is a sort of pay-off, but what I like about it is that it's not an obvious pay-off. It's not like everything joins up and is happy. Waugh was a bitter and twisted old man by the time he died, and that's what Sword Of Honour is about. It is a bit inconclusive. The audience has to work a bit, and I think that's a good thing.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Sword of Honour, tonight &amp; tomorrow, 9pm, Channel 4,</p>",

      "body": "<p>You remember Big Al, over Christmas? This was simply enormous Al. </p> <p>Alan Torrance has long, red-gold hair and looks like Thorfinn Skullsplitter. Tony Robinson looks as if he is standing in a hole and, curiously enough, often is. He took a quick step backward. Simply Enormous Al was laying about him with a disembowelling tool and giving an informed running commentary the while. \"You're stabbing. You're slashing. You're upper-cutting. You're disembowelling. You're aiming for the ligaments. You're catching the back of the guy's leg. You're crunching bones.\" Battle, he added, would be nasty, brutish and short. \"How short...?\" said Tony Robinson nervously, morphing into Baldrick. \"You're probably looking at 30 minutes,\" said Al. At which point in the 11th century, if your ligaments were still intact, you legged it. </p> <p>All this was apropos <strong> The Real Macbeth</strong> (Channel 4), who turned out to be charming, at least in terms of his time, earning a warm endorsement from, of all people, the Duncan clan. By the way, have you any idea what Macbeth's first name was? The question never seemed to arise. Lady Macbeth was called Gruoch, which sounds like a sheep coughing in the fog. Her husband killed Macbeth's father so Macbeth naturally burned him alive and married Gruoch. Robinson, an old softie, asked if Gruoch loved Macbeth. Dr Louise Yeoman of the National Library of Scotland was convulsed. \"What's love got to do with it? I mean, come on.\" </p> <p> <strong> Gentleman's Relish</strong> (BBC 2) is so called, I assume, because it goes particularly well with crumpet. </p> <p>Billy Connolly has silvered into something rather flowing and leonine, which could go on as Moses without make-up. Here he plays an Edwardian painter, Kingdom Swann, who turns to photography when his crowded canvases of tangled goddesses go out of fashion. Cromwell Marsh, a quick-talking cockney with an eye to the main chance, pops up like a minor devil. The devil always has the best jokes and Douglas Henshall's perfect imitation of Michael Caine tickles you throughout like a feather in your vest. Cromwell's titillating tit-bits from Kingdom's tableaux are soon selling well under the counter at selected tobacconists to gentlemen with pronounced moustaches. Gentleman's Relish is Edwardian slapstick, a broad-bottomed, jumbo joke which seemed to trundle down the runway for a long time without becoming airborne. On paper it must have seemed perfect. A costume drama about photography and pornography (but was there ever an uglier period? Women seem to be lost in a blizzard of crocheted doilies and moulting poultry. Even the luminous Sarah Lancashire is snuffed out). </p> <p>Exploding jokes along the way remind you that David Nobbs wrote the screenplay. For instance, at the time ladies' bottoms were very much to the fore, so to speak. As Cromwell says, caught in flagrante with an ample model, \"Oh bugger!\" </p> <p>You sense with maternal pleasure what fun the researchers must have had. </p> <p>We all want to go and live on a Scottish island. In theory. As Michelle Collins says, \"Scotland's beautiful. I've seen it on TV.\" The evocatively named <strong> 2000 Acres Of Sky</strong> (BBC 1) is a sort of Hamish Heartbeat, set on a Hebridean island. (Not, in fact, an island but Port Logan on the west coast, if you fancy rushing up there.) A bunch of scruffs from Hackney are lured in to bring the haemorrhaging island school up to numbers. The Scottish cast is unobtrusively strong. As Abby, a single mother, Michelle Collins looks like a flower and croaks like a frog and Paul Kaye makes an impact as the lankily dislocated but oddly imaginative Kenny, pretending to be her husband. In the first episode the islanders interview prospective families. Dame Sybil Thorndike said of audiences, \"Some nights they're porridge and some nights they're electricity.\" These, no doubt about it, were porridge. As the hotel owner said, \"Anyone prepared to give up their lives and come here, they'd have to be the sort of people we'd rather not come here.\" The view is an eyebath, you feel refreshed just looking. </p> <p> <strong> Postcards from Monica</strong> (Channel 5 Sunday), \"Monica Lewinsky visits exotic parts of America.\" You couldn't make it up.</p>",

I mean, come on.\" Gentleman's Relish (BBC 2) is so called, I assume, because it goes particularly well with crumpet. Billy Connolly has silvered into something rather flowing and leonine, which could go on as Moses without make-up. Here he plays an Edwardian painter, Kingdom Swann, who turns to photography when his crowded canvases of tangled goddesses go out of fashion. Cromwell Marsh, a quick-talking cockney with an eye to the main chance, pops up like a minor devil. The devil always has the best jokes and Douglas Henshall's perfect imitation of Michael Caine tickles you throughout like a feather in your vest. Cromwell's titillating tit-bits from Kingdom's tableaux are soon selling well under the counter at selected tobacconists to gentlemen with pronounced moustaches. Gentleman's Relish is Edwardian slapstick, a broad-bottomed, jumbo joke which seemed to trundle down the runway for a long time without becoming airborne. On paper it must have seemed perfect. A costume drama about photography and pornography (but was there ever an uglier period? Women seem to be lost in a blizzard of crocheted doilies and moulting poultry. Even the luminous Sarah Lancashire is snuffed out). Exploding jokes along the way remind you that David Nobbs wrote the screenplay. For instance, at the time ladies' bottoms were very much to the fore, so to speak. As Cromwell says, caught in flagrante with an ample model, \"Oh bugger!\" You sense with maternal pleasure what fun the researchers must have had. We all want to go and live on a Scottish island. In theory. As Michelle Collins says, \"Scotland's beautiful. I've seen it on TV.\" The evocatively named 2000 Acres Of Sky (BBC 1) is a sort of Hamish Heartbeat, set on a Hebridean island. (Not, in fact, an island but Port Logan on the west coast, if you fancy rushing up there.) A bunch of scruffs from Hackney are lured in to bring the haemorrhaging island school up to numbers. The Scottish cast is unobtrusively strong. As Abby, a single mother, Michelle Collins looks like a flower and croaks like a frog and Paul Kaye makes an impact as the lankily dislocated but oddly imaginative Kenny, pretending to be her husband. In the first episode the islanders interview prospective families. Dame Sybil Thorndike said of audiences, \"Some nights they're porridge and some nights they're electricity.\" These, no doubt about it, were porridge. As the hotel owner said, \"Anyone prepared to give up their lives and come here, they'd have to be the sort of people we'd rather not come here.\" The view is an eyebath, you feel refreshed just looking. Postcards from Monica (Channel 5 Sunday), \"Monica Lewinsky visits exotic parts of America.\" You couldn't make it up.",

Imagine it accompanied by a sackful of other Italian Renaissance masterpieces: Giorgione's Tempest, Masaccio's Crucifixion, Piero della Francesca's Flagellation. How long would the queues be? What would the critics say? </p> <p>In 1930 what they said was, 'Thank you, Mr Mussolini.' This stupendous exhibition actually happened, as the art historian Francis Haskell recounts in his book The Ephemeral Museum: Old Master Paintings and the Rise of the Art Exhibition. It was the brainchild of Lady Chamberlain, wife of the Conservative foreign secretary and an ardent fan of Italian fascism; it was made possible because Mussolini himself backed the plan as a piece of propaganda and ordered museums and local authorities to lend works they would never have normally parted with. </p> <p>And the reviews were worth it. Haskell reprints the cartoon in Punch that portrayed \"Mussolini the Magnificent\" presenting Botticelli's Primavera to John Bull. Even the socialist New Statesman admitted that Britain was in the dictator's debt. Italian Art 1200-1900 was one of the greatest hits in the Royal Academy's history. It attracted 540,000 visitors. </p> <p>It would be nice to think that today we would greet such an exercise with scepticism. But let's face it - we'd fall for it head over heels. Who asked any difficult questions about the potential harm to Russia if the Hermitage Rooms at Somerset House mark the beginning of a general diffusion of its art treasures? The art exhibition has become one of our favourite treats. Orgies of hype and merchandising, blockbuster shows are the cultural equivalent of a royal wedding or the World Cup - spectacles that make us feel part of a community of chat, deciding that yes, we really do all feel that late Monet is as fascinating if not more so than the Monet of the 1870s. </p> <p>Last year hardly a week went by without the opening of some absolutely unmissable show, and this year the procession rolls on, genuflecting before one modern or ancient master after another. Many of these exhibitions reconstruct whole cities and art worlds, offering the chance to travel magically to great moments in history: Caravaggio's Rome at the Royal Academy later this month; Brassa\u00ef's Paris at the Hayward Gallery in February; and Vermeer's Delft at the National Gallery in the summer. </p> <p>Vermeer will be the ultimate blockbuster of the year, the guaranteed crowd magnet, though in sheer eye-knackering scale the big blowout is Tate Modern's first loan exhibition, Century City, opening next month, which takes us from Picasso's Paris to Gary Hume's London in 10 normal-sized shows dedicated to 10 cities at significant cultural moments. </p> <p>But at this banquet of art enters the ghost of Francis Haskell, warning us, if we care to listen, that we're losing something precious in the riot and noise. Haskell, an art historian who changed the way his subject was understood, died a year ago and The Ephemeral Museum is a posthumous publication. He worked on it in the knowledge he was dying and it was prepared for publication by his friend and collaborator Nicholas Penny. There's a subtle passion running through what is on the surface a sombre history of the rise of the Old Master exhibition. But it's love rather than anger that shines out of the book - Haskell's love for the art of the past and his conviction it is being abused. </p> <p>He is fair in showing the positive side of exhibitions. The first shows were contemporary ones, beginning with the Salon in 18th-century Paris. The Old Master exhibition, Haskell's b te noire, came into its own in 19th-century Britain, where the National Gallery (founded in 1824) took a long time to build its collection to the standard of European rivals. The gap was filled by temporary shows from Britain's private collections; from 1870 the main venue of these was the Royal Academy's new home at Burlington House in Piccadilly. Yet the most awesome Victorian exhibition took place in Manchester. </p> <p>Art Treasures of the United Kingdom opened in a custom-built pavilion at Old Trafford in 1857. This was not just a huge popular hit, with workers at Lancashire mills more or less frogmarched there by employers keen to overturn Manchester's philistine image, but also, Haskell acknowledges, a triumph of scholarship. It presented a cogent history of western art and made several masterpieces well-known for the first time, including the Manchester Madonna, probably by Michelangelo, which is now in the National Gallery. This exhibition transformed British attitudes to art: it was as significant in its own day as the opening of Tate Modern in ours. </p> <p>Haskell never completely spells out the nature of his rage with exhibitions, all exhibitions, and you might come away from the book believing his only real objection to blockbuster shows is that they endanger works of art by ferrying them around the world. The art treasures sent by Mussolini to the Royal Academy were transported in a single cargo ship, Haskell recounts in horror; if it had sunk, so many beautiful things would have been lost. The trouble is, it didn't sink, and despite the image Haskell evokes of airways crowded with flying art treasures - \"jets speed through the skies carrying their freight of Titians and Poussins, Van Dycks and Goyas\" - there's no real evidence of art being damaged by transport to exhibitions. Nevertheless, Haskell argues, the rise and rise of the blockbuster has been tainted by dubious motives and dodgy methods. Nationalism has played its sinister part in mega-shows of famous artists, from Germany showing off Holbein and D\u00fcrer to Mussolini's RA spectacular. </p> <p>Most telling of all is the way exhibitions are put together. No exhibition is ever the one its curators intended. Some requests for loans are always refused, some artworks simply cannot be moved, yet when the museum announces its definitive Rembrandt show or whatever, all this backstage politics is hidden. The exhibition is presented as a disinterested, perfect expression of an argument. Critics review it on that basis, and audiences are encouraged to think they've seen all the Rembrandts that are worth seeing. Done that, been there. </p> <p>The most glaring example was the Royal Academy's massively hyped Monet in the 20th Century show in 1998. The show presented itself as the last word on Monet's late waterlily paintings. This was ridiculous. The most important late paintings by Monet, his final masterpieces, are housed permanently in a custom-built space in the Mus\u00e9e de l'Orangerie in Paris, arranged as Monet intended in memorial to the dead of the first world war. There's nothing like seeing these paintings there. So the exhibition we queued for was not at all the unmissable, definitive survey of late Monet it claimed to be but a second-best alternative to visiting Paris. </p> <p>The blockbuster exhibition encourages an idiotic attitude to art. We think we're getting the best possible chance to see a certain artist or period in art, we think that by seeing an exhibition on Jackson Pollock or Botticelli (who comes back to the RA this year) we know these artists, fully experience them. There's always something chest-beating and phony about it. What we get is a selective view, determined partly by practical considerations, from the RA's financial situation to the fact the National Gallery owns several Rembrandt self-portraits, and partly by the views of curators. But perhaps the biggest lie is the one that this exhibition is urgent here, now. Does Vermeer need another big exhibition this year? Will it change the fact that he's one of the world's great artists? Whenever there's a big exhibition it's as if this artist had just been discovered, and we all need to get along there or miss out. This is crushing, it's the opposite of the love of art. Love is personal, it is complicated. You can't hurry love. </p> <p>We're not just talking about old art. I haven't met one artist who thinks the RA's Sensation (1997) offered anything but a cartoon view of contemporary art in London: it took 10 years of history and turned them into fiction, erasing from the record artists who were not in Charles Saatchi's collection. And because Sensation was a huge hit in Britain and then toured the world, it became the official compilation of 1990s British art. </p> <p>In the end what is wrong with travelling, making an effort, waiting years to see works of art? You can spend a lifetime looking at a favourite artist's work, and over a lifetime is how it should be done - as a romance, a relationship. And is it such a terrible thing to admit you don't want to share your favourite art with so many others? There's something about the big show that erases the moments of discovery, surprise, bafflement that make art live. Art is difficult. Not all art, not all art by the same person, can interest you in the same moment. Yet this is the premise of the blockbuster exhibition - that you can take a mental photograph of 30, 50, 80 works by Rembrandt and it will mean something. </p> <p>An experience of art that is instant, quick, and directed by another's eye and taste is an experience not worth having. Art is worth giving time to, or it's not worth bothering with at all. More and more, we are bombarded by exhibitions that foster the opposite of a worthwhile experience of art. They turn art into a commodity. We pay for our ticket, and in the act of paying we are encouraged to feel we have bought an experience of the artist, so we can fit Goya's extreme visions (showing at the Hayward Gallery in February) into our busy lives. But that's the last thing art should do - fit into our lives. </p> <p>It's fantastic that art has become so popular in Britain. But let's not allow our love of art to be destroyed by chaperones and bullies.

Botticelli: The Drawings for Dante's Divine Comedy Royal Academy from March 17 One that deserves the hype: the first time all the surviving fragments of Botticelli's illustrated manuscript of The Divine Comedy have been exhibited. A chance to see a sublime masterpiece. OK, exhibitions aren't all bad. Vermeer and the Delft School National Gallery from June 20 We'll queue like idiots for this one, even though it comes so soon after the mega-Vermeer show in the Netherlands and the US, and even though it features not just everyone's favourite Delft painter but lesser contemporaries. \u0095 Francis Haskell's The Ephemeral Museum is published by Yale University Press, price \u00a316.95.",

The most shocking consequence of the pregnancy test had not been the impending baby (which I accepted with that trademark teenage mixture of boundless optimism and bravado), but my instant descent to an underclass about which everyone seemed to reserve the right to be rude and scornful.</p> <p>I borrowed a typewriter and vented my fury in an article published in the Guardian. Here's a taster: \"I have found the attitudes of many members of the medical profession presumptuous and patronising . . . I am determined to prove that teenage parents are not social problems, vegetating on bleak council estates, but capable of achieving the same goals as others.\"</p> <p>I grew up in a single-parent family in the days when it was unusual (at least in Norfolk) and John Craven still talked gravely on Newsround about \"broken homes\". Mum struggled to provide for my sister and me, working evenings in pubs while she studied for a degree. She assumed we had learned from her mistakes and was horrified that I might even contemplate not terminating my pregnancy. Eviction from the family home followed swiftly.</p> <p>I was referred to a social worker who was also pregnant (but in a strange parallel universe where everyone could afford maternity clothes and people said \"Congratulations\" rather than \"God, what are you going to do?\"). I assumed she would offer practical help (housing, money for baby equipment, childcare support so I could finish my education). In reality, there was little other than an archaic mother and baby home run by the Catholic church and a care system predicated on the assumption that no one got any qualifications anyway. When she tried to find common ground between us (\"Isn't morning sickness the pits?\"), I found it hard to contain my anger. Eventually my boyfriend's parents took pity on me.</p> <p>I considered myself quite ordinary (we lived in a small terrace house and I went to the local comprehensive) but much of my pregnancy was spent waiting in long queues (at the housing office, at the DSS, at social services) with people who suddenly made me feel obscenely well-educated, healthy and privileged. I never realised so many people were living lives so devoid of opportunity. The thought that I would be joining them was terrifying.</p> <p>Following the birth of my son Joshua, I was allocated a grim council flat on a desolate estate apparently reserved for teenage mothers and ex-psychiatric patients. I saw desperately poor teenage women struggling to provide basic care for their children against substantial odds, in an environment in which carpets and washing machines were luxury items.</p> <p>I was deemed \"fortunate\" (and I was compared with the other people queuing at the DSS), but this limited my entitlement to help. Finishing my education seemed a sensible route out of the benefits system, but social services did not provide care for children not categorised as \"at risk\". To qualify, I needed to prove I was about to neglect my son, put him into care or be admitted to a psychiatric unit - all of which began to look increasingly possible as I contemplated spending my life trying to make ends meet on the estate.</p> <p>So I lived with Josh's father (a teenage undergraduate) in his poky university rooms, because at least I was surrounded by people whose lives were filled with opportunity and hope. Nevertheless, motherhood came as a tremendous shock and I was miserable and isolated.</p> <p>I started my degree when Josh was a toddler and, almost inevitably, I separated from his father. Unusually (for teenage fathers), he remains actively and positively involved.</p> <p>Essex University was a fantastic place to be a teenage mother. There was a campus nursery, I lived in a shared house with lots of babysitters and I had a ball, despite making some embarrassing mistakes. Universities are full of rich kids writing glib essays about \"structural inequalities\" and as a sociology student, I wrote my dissertation on teenage motherhood, confident that at least I was prepared for the humility of the powerless working-class women I interviewed. I wasn't - and I reluctantly recognised that my impending graduation proved nothing about schoolgirl mothers.</p> <p>Teenage motherhood is linked to poverty and low educational achievement (middle-class girls have more reasons not to get pregnant and those who do overwhelmingly choose abortion). The vast majority of the women I spoke to were from families who already lived in poverty on \"sink\" estates. Their lives were characterised by educational failure and some had spent time in care. They hoped for the best (\"I'd like us to get a nice house - when my boyfriend gets a job\"), but expected the worst (\"Well, they usually leave you, don't they?\").</p> <p>I found little evidence that they would have been any better off had they delayed motherhood into their 20s. If their children fared badly at school and drifted into delinquency, they were simply taking their places in a cycle of deprivation that owed a great deal to the failure of our social care system and little to maternal age or moral laxity. Our shared experience of being teenage mothers did not magically dissolve the inequalities between us. My attempts to form a sisterhood (\"Yes, I remember when I had mould up the walls\") were met with the same derision I had shown the social worker four years earlier.</p> <p>I argued that patriarchy seeks to control women by dictating the circumstances in which it is desirable to reproduce. Deprived working-class boys can indulge in the sort of laddish resistance to dominant morality that is celebrated by Guy Ritchie et al. Working-class women have fewer role models and for them, reproduction can be (or appear to be) a way of acting in the world and changing your life.</p> <p>Teenagers experiment and take risks. If teenage fathers emerge from irresponsible sex relatively unscathed, they have male peers disabled by a range of reckless behaviours in which stupid driving features prominently. Their treatment and rehabilitation costs thousands. Generally they are pitied, rather than castigated, by Tory politicians and the tabloid press.</p> <p>By contrast, student politics was kind to teenage mothers in the early 90s. The NUS had (belatedly) woken up to the discrimination faced by sections of its population and suddenly, if you wanted to get ahead in student politics, you needed an oppression. I never had to say more than: \"Speaking as a teenage mother\" to prompt a standing ovation. Getting my tokens out for the lads became a way of life.

It is hoped that in the next few years up to 13 new countries will be accommodated. And how are we supposed to accommodate these 13 new countries? Er, well we've got the Moppe under-bed storage, the Skubb nylon shoe hangers with Velcro fastening. . . and of course there's always the Kungalv sofabed with easy click-clack mechanism. And which 13 countries are we talking about? Candidates include Poland, Estonia and Latvia. I thought Latvia was a galvanised steel spotlight (halogen bulb included)? That's enough Ikea jokes. Don't say: \"Could you help me carry this stuff to my car please?\" Do say: \"Goran sounds just the Persson for the job.\"",

A thief stole 7m yen (\u00a341,000) in cash from the car of a doctor, Shinobu Ogura, while he prayed for good fortune at the Kita-in Buddhist temple in Kawagoe, Saitama prefecture. The fact that Dr Ogura left such a large sum of money in his car has raised few eyebrows in Japan, where crime rates are far lower than in Britain and where many people prefer hard currency to credit cards and cheques. But as an omen at this most superstitious period, the timing of his misfortune could not have been much worse. Only 53% of Japanese people profess any strong religious convictions, but most people honour the customs of the shogatsu - New Year - festival, which is a time to wipe away the bad luck of the old year and start afresh. The final weeks of December were spent purging the mind of unpleasant memories with bonenkai - forget-the-year parties. Then as soon as the first bell of the New Year chimed, an all-out effort began to attract good fortune in the year ahead. Dr Ogura was among the 93m people expected to seek the favour of the gods in a traditional and spiritual fashion with a hatsumode, or first religious visit of the year. At temples or shinto shrines, this is considered a lucky time of the year to buy road-safety charms, bats for slapping away bad luck, and omikuji - fortune slips that claim to spell out the buyer's prospects for love, business, travel and health in the year ahead.

It poses a higher threat than probably anywhere else in western Europe.</p> <p>\"The border region along with north Louth is where the majority of dissident republicans operate from, and where the most effective wing of the Provisional IRA was and is based.</p> <p>\"They are not just producers but exporters of terrorism. The Omagh bomb, the Canary Wharf bomb both passed through here.</p> <p>\"Weapons from Croatia are bought to be smuggled to this area. It's only just over a year since Eamon Collins [the former IRA man turned one of their fiercest critics] was found murdered in a ditch. Those people don't want peace. How can we walk away?</p> <p>\"It's not just about terrorism but general lawlessness and criminal activity. Troops are required to back up police officers to enforce the law. They have to go around by helicopter because it is not safe by road.</p> <p>\"Smuggling and fuel laundering is big business. Customs and excise lose around \u00a310m a year in this area. Paramilitaries are up to their necks in it.</p> <p>\"Just over the border a few weeks ago, customs officials were trying to investigate a fuel laundering scam on a farm when they found \u00a3100,000-worth of dodgy goods in a shed.</p> <p>\"The next day, Gardai were sent to recover the stuff but the gang jumped out of a hedge with automatic weapons and seized goods they'd confiscated.</p> <p>\"It's hard on the people who keep the law, yes, but the towers are a necessary part of the operation here. It's either that or more foot patrols tramping over land.</p> <p>\"It's no picnic for soldiers here.

It remains the heartland of terrorism and a very dangerous place. It poses a higher threat than probably anywhere else in western Europe. \"The border region along with north Louth is where the majority of dissident republicans operate from, and where the most effective wing of the Provisional IRA was and is based. \"They are not just producers but exporters of terrorism. The Omagh bomb, the Canary Wharf bomb both passed through here. \"Weapons from Croatia are bought to be smuggled to this area. It's only just over a year since Eamon Collins [the former IRA man turned one of their fiercest critics] was found murdered in a ditch. Those people don't want peace. How can we walk away? \"It's not just about terrorism but general lawlessness and criminal activity. Troops are required to back up police officers to enforce the law. They have to go around by helicopter because it is not safe by road. \"Smuggling and fuel laundering is big business. Customs and excise lose around \u00a310m a year in this area. Paramilitaries are up to their necks in it. \"Just over the border a few weeks ago, customs officials were trying to investigate a fuel laundering scam on a farm when they found \u00a3100,000-worth of dodgy goods in a shed. \"The next day, Gardai were sent to recover the stuff but the gang jumped out of a hedge with automatic weapons and seized goods they'd confiscated. \"It's hard on the people who keep the law, yes, but the towers are a necessary part of the operation here. It's either that or more foot patrols tramping over land. \"It's no picnic for soldiers here. Many of them are working seven days a week and most are away from their families for months. \"Yes, the watchtowers are ugly. But they provide vital cover and information that cannot be disclosed because it would jeopardise future security. What do these people want?

Michael Meacher, the department's minister of state for the environment, complained he was not properly consulted.

Mr Prescott was said by an adviser to have been furious at not being consulted before his deputy negotiated a deal with the Conservatives on this issue, involving what was presented as a three-month delay, to get the sale through the House of Lords. And the peer is resisting pressure from Mr Prescott to \"come down heavy\" on the rail companies, arguing that the government should work with rather than against the operators to get them to run decent train services as demanded by passengers. The tussle has prompted concern in and out of government among supporters of the merged DETR - created by the marriage of the old environment and transport minis tries - that the potential benefits of policy coordination are being lost. As well as transport, Mr Prescott's department is responsible for many other things, from local authorities and regional development to water and the wider environment, including global warming. But it is transport that is Mr Prescott's specialist subject and the former seafarer - who made his mark in opposition during the late 1980s and early 1990s after the Clapham, Lockerbie and Marchioness disasters - jealously guarded it during his early years in government. Lord MacDonald's links with Downing Street, however, make him more powerful than the three previous transport deputies Mr Prescott had in 30 months - Gavin Strang, John Reid and Helen Liddell. Mr Prescott persuaded the prime minister to remove the transport post from the cabinet in Labour's first reshuffle but Lord MacDonald is a cabinet member in all but salary, attending and speaking at the Thursday morning meetings. Mr Prescott is now thought to believe he made a mistake taking the reins of the complex DETR rather than acting as a Cabinet Office enforcer.

Then it is fast forward a century to 2056, and if the princess is not awoken with a kiss before the 100 years is up she will die. Only it's hard to find a prince to do the deed when the people have overthrown the monarchy and Britain has become a republic. The silly moments are really silly, the shivery moments extra shivery. When the wicked old woman settles down beside the sleeping princess to wait for her death 100 years hence she starts knitting: it is like watching Madame Lafarge at the guillotine. The jokes are as old as the hills but still funny: Queen: \"You better change that baby, nurse.\" Nurse: \"Did you keep the receipt?\" But it is the way the show plays with the concept of time that is really smart. When Prince Justin arrives at the palace, the princess is already dead. It is up to the audience to cheat time by turning the clock backwards, which turns out to be as easy as tick tock - or rather, kcot kcit. This is a lovely, inventive treat for all the family that might convert even the most dedicated pantomime hater. Until January 13. Box office: 020-7242 7040.",

      "body": "<p>\"Welcome to my 100th birthday, here at the 60 club,\" said saxophonist Don Weller, kicking off four and a half hours of music in honour of his big day. </p> <p>Whatever age he feels - or jokes about feeling - he certainly doesn't give it away in his blowing. His reputation as one of the \"tough\" English tenor players to have emerged, post-John Coltrane, stands firm. Although he can dip into airy vibratoed sweetness when required, with a sound that seems to emerge imperceptibly from the sanding of the drummer's brushes, his trademark is still a bold, coruscating, sometimes belligerent voice. He is playful, too, managing the difficult musical manoeuvre of translating wit into sound without resorting to slapstick. </p> <p>Weller's own quartet started the evening. They were virtuosic, bouncing little improvised phrases off each other, turning jazz standards on their head. \"We would like to play our version of a tune called The Way You Look Tonight,\" said Weller. \"It's called The Way You're Going to Look Tomorrow Morning.\" Their set culminated in a party-piece piano solo from Dave Newton that took a theme and car-chased it through stride and Latin styles, with Weller, joined by Allan Barnes on baritone sax, improvising a swinging, complex, snake-like fugue. </p> <p>This was followed by three-quarters of the Stan Tracey quartet, and a more angular style. While saxophonist Bobby Wellins chopped tunes up into little solitary packets, Tracey's voicings on the piano varied from rich percussive handfuls to primitive two-note cliff-hangers at either end of the keyboard. </p> <p>All this great playing was for the initiated jazz fans - and the crowd confirmed it with every nod, beret and wisp of creative facial hair. But the final hour made you want to proselytise madly to those who wouldn't touch jazz with a pair of hair clippers. Weller's big band, formed in the mid-1990s, attracts the best of the mainstream players in this country (Peter King, Art Themen, Alan Barnes, Dick Pearce, Mornington Lockett and Martin Speake). It's a testament to the respect Weller commands among players and to the quality of his writing, which brings to a traditional big band set-up a distinctively earthy and jubilant sound. </p> <p>There was an energised, collective feeling to the music, partly because Weller often favours keeping the different sections playing as one block, with internal melodic lines tumbling over each other. Also, faced with the forces of a big band, soloing players tend to take risks, to push themselves to the edge of their playing. It's a visceral, visual, and musical experience that, for economic reasons, has become a rarity. </p> <p>As the band roasted through its last number, it couldn't take the pace, and peeled off in search of the floor. But the man himself was still standing, swinging happy birthday to himself. </p>",
