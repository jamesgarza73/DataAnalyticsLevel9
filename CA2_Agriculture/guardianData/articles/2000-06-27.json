It was all down to the fact that we got on so well.

You have to see if a relationship will develop first, then discuss work later. </p> <p> <strong> Chris Reynolds, 35</strong> managing director </p> <p> When I got my first big promotion, I asked a very important businesswoman in the organisation out to lunch because I was ambitious and I wanted to make good contacts. It all got rather embarrassing, though, because she clearly thought I'd organised lunch for personal rather than professional reasons and she kept flirting with me while I tried to steer her towards work issues. I learned that it's best to state at the start of a lunch why you've arranged it and that it's not a bad idea to send a letter of confirmation beforehand, mentioning the points you wish to discuss. </p> <p> <strong> Peter Harris, 34</strong> design consultant </p> <p> I once had a bizarre lunch with a potential client. He was a millionaire, and my boss and I wanted to impress him by going somewhere terribly expensive, but he spotted the \u00a37.50 special offer on the menu and thought we'd brought him there because it was such a bargain. We got his business because he was impressed with how we used our expense accounts! He thought if we were that good with the company's money, we'd be the same with his. Since then, I've always sounded out a potential client's secretary about where he or she likes to eat. That way you can get an idea of someone's tastes. </p> <p> <strong> Sarah Green, 23</strong> IT consultant </p> <p> I had a three-month contract at one company and was invited out to a birthday lunch. There was a power struggle between the head of the department and his deputy, so all the deputy's cronies sat at one end of the table and all the head's cronies sat at the other. I chose a chair in between the two factions and chatted amiably with everyone because I'm freelance and can't afford to take sides. Where you sit at a lunch is as important as what you eat - and it's a bad idea to order alcohol or a pudding when no one else does.

His secretary said he'd left on time, but he turned up an hour and a quarter late, absolutely livid. I work in a big building where it's difficult to find your way around.

She was unmarried and obviously pregnant (seven months) when the school sacked her. This should be an obvious case of sex discrimination, except the nuns are denying that they knew Mary was pregnant. They are saying she was dismissed for \"pilfering\". </p> <p>We have photos of Mary at the time she was sacked. She is five feet tall and looks like a children's book drawing of a worm that has swallowed an apple. The evidence of pilfering comes from an ancient sister who thought she may have left her rosary on Mary's desk. Or in the garden. Or under her bed. </p> <p>I can tell the tribunal panel are uncomfortable. The chair does lots of hearty heh-hehing. \"I don't need to ask whether you'll be wanting to swear on the Bible,\" he joshes Sister Veronica with crushing levity. </p> <p>The school's barrister has been smirking continuously. When I ran into him before the tribunal in the Crumbly Muffin (as he was tucking into a full English breakfast), he said: \"I'm looking forward to you reminding the sisters they're on oath.\" I refrained from telling him he had egg yolk on his tie. </p> <p>Sister Veronica has a bland soft face like fallen dough, lightly whiskered in the sunlight falling on the witness table. After she gives her evidence-in-chief, another nun beetles up and whispers in her ear. This is a big no-no. </p> <p>Me: \"Uhh, excuse me, you're not meant to talk to Sister Veronica while she's giving evidence.\" </p> <p>Nun: \"I was just telling her that our prayers were with her to give her strength in the ordeal ahead.\" </p> <p>An epidemic of smirking breaks out. I commence the ordeal. Sister Veronica is resolute that she \"never notices that sort of thing\" (pregnancy bumps), her mind being on other (higher) matters. I am reduced to: \"Well, what about pictures of the Virgin Mary before she gives birth to the baby Jesus? It must have struck you that her figure is somewhat altered.\" </p> <p>A wily smile plays over Sister Veronica's lips. \"Oh, but you see, dear, I would be looking at her face, at her expression of exaltation, the sublime meekness with which she accepted her role\" and so forth.

With her straight dark hair, pharaoh make-up and thin, elongated body, she looks as if she haunts grave yards at the witching hour, looking for buried inspiration. Her songs are dark and heavy, not least Too Rough, a cacophony of random noise and ironic rock'n'roll postures. When she sings, her voice swoops unnervingly between Betty Boop and John Lee Hooker. </p> <p>Despite his veteran status, Richard Thompson can still surprise and unsettle too. Armed only with his acoustic guitar, with a fetishistic Vincent Black Lightning motorcycle parked onstage beside him for dramatic effect, he ripped through a potent selection from his bottomless back catalogue. </p> <p>Dressed in a baggy dark suit and black beret, Thompson bantered matily with the audience, mocking his own meagre record sales and joking facetiously about his lack of superstar status. But when he sings, a deeper, stranger Thompson emerges. His guitar playing is deft and decisive, whether he's piling on the powerchord-strum of Feel So Good or fingerpicking his way with bleak precision through Cold Kisses. Where his speaking voice is diffident and throwaway, he sings with a stridency and power which make you wonder why he ever felt he needed a backing band. In I Misunderstood, he managed to sound both wounded and vengeful; in Shoot Out the Lights, the force of his performance made him seem two feet taller. </p> <p>He has always stuck fast to his roots in classic folk music, and he has become a gripping story-teller. He apologised for adding new biker-friendly verses to his Vincent Black Lightning saga, a classic tale of love, death and loyalty. In God Loves a Drunk, a dirge in 3/4 time, he shone a redemptive light on the squalid details of his tale. And if that's not enough, Thompson is the only performer I've ever seen who can change a broken guitar string while ad libbing his way through Twist and Shout. That's worth a Grammy, at least. </p> <p> Richard Thompson plays the Playhouse, Oxford (01865 798600), tomorrow. </p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Cliff Richard may have confounded the critics with the length of his pop career, but one Cliff number that has failed the test of time is \"We're all going on a summer holiday\". The fact is, we're not. If online recruiters <a href=\"http://www.totaljobs.com\" target=\"_new\">totaljobs.com</a> can be believed, an astonishing 60% of British workers are failing to take their full holiday entitlement. As summer arrives and many people's thoughts turn to beaches, bars and complete relaxation, the once-skiving British worker is apparently clocking on for an extra shift. And, according to the totaljobs.com survey, half of us even feel guilty when - if - we finally do get away. </p> <p>Paid leave, like health and safety legislation, equal pay and equal opportunities, represents one of the great achievements of the modern workplace. Since last October, thanks to the Working Time Directive, British employees are entitled to four weeks paid leave a year, by statute. Law-abiding employers have to put this legislation into practice. It's what we used to call progress. But all over the country, it appears, \"free\" employees can be heard calling for chains. Why? </p> <p>Britain's long working hours culture has been well charted in these pages and, at its simplest, not taking holiday is simply the latest manifestation of this wider trend. Some people stay at work under the (usually misguided) impression that they are indispensable. Others just don't trust their colleagues to carry out even simple tasks in their absence. And, worst of all, some are simply too scared to ask for what is rightfully theirs - a full holiday entitlement. The spectre of a domineering boss or a muscular competitor makes a holiday seem an unaffordable luxury. </p> <p>It is a complicated picture. \"Some people set themselves very high standards,\" says Nick Isles, spokesman for the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD). \"They find it difficult to let go, and don't want to let the company down. This latest statistic has more to do with employee choice than some people might realise.\" </p> <p>But the IPD is under no illusions about the main cause of the non-holidaying culture. \"Pressure from employers - especially in smaller businesses - may be keeping a lot of people at work for longer,\" says Isles.

      "bodyText": "Cliff Richard may have confounded the critics with the length of his pop career, but one Cliff number that has failed the test of time is \"We're all going on a summer holiday\". The fact is, we're not. If online recruiters totaljobs.com can be believed, an astonishing 60% of British workers are failing to take their full holiday entitlement. As summer arrives and many people's thoughts turn to beaches, bars and complete relaxation, the once-skiving British worker is apparently clocking on for an extra shift. And, according to the totaljobs.com survey, half of us even feel guilty when - if - we finally do get away. Paid leave, like health and safety legislation, equal pay and equal opportunities, represents one of the great achievements of the modern workplace. Since last October, thanks to the Working Time Directive, British employees are entitled to four weeks paid leave a year, by statute. Law-abiding employers have to put this legislation into practice. It's what we used to call progress. But all over the country, it appears, \"free\" employees can be heard calling for chains. Why? Britain's long working hours culture has been well charted in these pages and, at its simplest, not taking holiday is simply the latest manifestation of this wider trend. Some people stay at work under the (usually misguided) impression that they are indispensable. Others just don't trust their colleagues to carry out even simple tasks in their absence. And, worst of all, some are simply too scared to ask for what is rightfully theirs - a full holiday entitlement. The spectre of a domineering boss or a muscular competitor makes a holiday seem an unaffordable luxury. It is a complicated picture. \"Some people set themselves very high standards,\" says Nick Isles, spokesman for the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD). \"They find it difficult to let go, and don't want to let the company down. This latest statistic has more to do with employee choice than some people might realise.\" But the IPD is under no illusions about the main cause of the non-holidaying culture. \"Pressure from employers - especially in smaller businesses - may be keeping a lot of people at work for longer,\" says Isles. When there is healthy growth in the economy and rising demand for goods and services, these pressures are likely to increase.

      "body": "<p>Des Lynam had a funny old feeling that Holland might go out to Yugoslavia on Sunday night. And, although he may not thank me for reminding him, I'm delighted to say he couldn't have been more wrong. </p> <p>The great news is that we are left not just with the four best teams but with four teams whose philosophy shows England the way ahead. They have a basis of defensive strategy and, to varying degrees, use a fluid system that allows the best players to go out and express themselves. </p> <p>Only the Dutch play with any sort of strict formation and, with Dennis Bergkamp floating, it is hardly set in cement. You'd be hard-pressed to state what the Portuguese system is because people like Luis Figo get everywhere. Against Turkey he started on the left and set up two goals from the right. </p> <p>The French are also very fluid and the Italians are the same in the top part of the field. They have a rigid three at the back but it's difficult to say where Stefano Fiore, Francesco Totti and Antonio Conte play. They don't govern any one area. And that freedom, within a framework of discipline, has underpinned these teams' success. </p> <p>It gives them a creativity, an unpredictability and an expressiveness that England lacked. We have got good players but I think we have to get them to perform in a refreshing manner. </p> <p>I'd like to see David Beckham as the playmaker, surrounded by people like Kieron Dyer, Steve McManaman and Paul Scholes, who would be told: \"There's the football. Just go out and kick it between you.\" So what if at first we lose? We're losing anyway, only in an ugly manner. Let's dare them to show us some skill. </p> <p>I will never forget Jimmy Hogan, one of my coaches when I was a youngster at Aston Villa. He had coached the Hungarians of the Puskas era and the Austrians before that and he wanted us all to be comfortable on the ball. </p> <p>Of course I'm not talking about having centre-halves playing up the wings. You need disciplined people and a few who can not only win challenges but move things on. The Dutch, for instance, have Edgar Davids and Philip Cocu, who are not just hammer-throwers who win tackles. They can play and will keep movements going. The same goes for Patrick Vieira, who has come in and looked an established international for France. Christophe Dugarry, who I didn't think could trap a ball, has also shown some great tricks. </p> <p>One of the things that has been lacking is surprises. I thought there might be a hiccup - there always is - but the four expected to win their quarter-finals have done so. The only giantkilling of the tournament was Norway's win over Spain, which ultimately counted for nothing. But that is not to say everything is too predictable. Not too many fancied Portugal before the tournament began. </p> <p>They have been great but I think their journey will end tomorrow. Even though France have gone off the boil a bit, perhaps feeling the pressure of being favourites, I think they will have too much power. </p> <p>Despite Holland's remarkable performance against Yugoslavia I regard their game against Italy as harder to call. Against anyone else I would have no hesitation in backing the Dutch but Italy are the sort of side who could give them a hard time. This is not the best Italian team by a long chalk - they play more long balls than I've ever seen - but they're hard to break down. </p> <p>It will be worth keeping an eye on the confrontation between Davids and Demetrio Albertini.

      "bodyText": "Des Lynam had a funny old feeling that Holland might go out to Yugoslavia on Sunday night. And, although he may not thank me for reminding him, I'm delighted to say he couldn't have been more wrong. The great news is that we are left not just with the four best teams but with four teams whose philosophy shows England the way ahead. They have a basis of defensive strategy and, to varying degrees, use a fluid system that allows the best players to go out and express themselves. Only the Dutch play with any sort of strict formation and, with Dennis Bergkamp floating, it is hardly set in cement. You'd be hard-pressed to state what the Portuguese system is because people like Luis Figo get everywhere. Against Turkey he started on the left and set up two goals from the right. The French are also very fluid and the Italians are the same in the top part of the field. They have a rigid three at the back but it's difficult to say where Stefano Fiore, Francesco Totti and Antonio Conte play. They don't govern any one area. And that freedom, within a framework of discipline, has underpinned these teams' success. It gives them a creativity, an unpredictability and an expressiveness that England lacked. We have got good players but I think we have to get them to perform in a refreshing manner. I'd like to see David Beckham as the playmaker, surrounded by people like Kieron Dyer, Steve McManaman and Paul Scholes, who would be told: \"There's the football. Just go out and kick it between you.\" So what if at first we lose? We're losing anyway, only in an ugly manner. Let's dare them to show us some skill. I will never forget Jimmy Hogan, one of my coaches when I was a youngster at Aston Villa. He had coached the Hungarians of the Puskas era and the Austrians before that and he wanted us all to be comfortable on the ball. Of course I'm not talking about having centre-halves playing up the wings. You need disciplined people and a few who can not only win challenges but move things on. The Dutch, for instance, have Edgar Davids and Philip Cocu, who are not just hammer-throwers who win tackles. They can play and will keep movements going. The same goes for Patrick Vieira, who has come in and looked an established international for France. Christophe Dugarry, who I didn't think could trap a ball, has also shown some great tricks. One of the things that has been lacking is surprises. I thought there might be a hiccup - there always is - but the four expected to win their quarter-finals have done so. The only giantkilling of the tournament was Norway's win over Spain, which ultimately counted for nothing. But that is not to say everything is too predictable. Not too many fancied Portugal before the tournament began. They have been great but I think their journey will end tomorrow. Even though France have gone off the boil a bit, perhaps feeling the pressure of being favourites, I think they will have too much power. Despite Holland's remarkable performance against Yugoslavia I regard their game against Italy as harder to call. Against anyone else I would have no hesitation in backing the Dutch but Italy are the sort of side who could give them a hard time. This is not the best Italian team by a long chalk - they play more long balls than I've ever seen - but they're hard to break down. It will be worth keeping an eye on the confrontation between Davids and Demetrio Albertini. Davids might need his goggles because I fancy there will be sparks flying. He looks very wound up and, judging by Albertini's ugly tackle on Gheorghe Hagi, anything could happen. I take Holland to come through, possibly in extra-time, and it would not surprise me if Bergkamp got the winner. He may get special attention but he's due a goal and, after the hard time he had with Inter, it would be one in the eye for the Italians. I feel the crowd could be a decisive factor. Against Yugoslavia the stands were literally moving and there was not one ounce of nastiness. Even from the commentary position it was hard not to join in.",

People are in hurry and want to find what they are looking for without having to click their way through a company's entire site. </p> <p>RealNames, a California company founded in 1997, believes it has developed the technology to make e-commerce quick and painless. Known as the Internet Keywords system, this click-cutting device is being backed financially by, among others, Microsoft, as part of the software giant's new strategy to put itself at the centre of the internet for consumers and businesses. </p> <p>\"Surfing was two years ago, now we're looking for e-commerce solutions. We look at Internet Keywords as a way for people to go straight to the products,\" explains John Tomany, vice president of business development RealNames Europe.</p> <p>Several companies have turned to Keywords, including eBay, the hugely-successful online auctioneer, and Panasonic, the Japanese electronics consumer giant. The \"deep brand-navigation\" devised by RealNames allows a company to shepherd customers directly to products, using key phrases. </p> <p>Say a customer wants to buy a digital video player (DVD) from Panasonic; typing \"Panasonic DVDs\" in the address field of their browser will take them straight to a list of Panasonic DVDs, cutting out the company's home page and navigation. Ford recently used Keywords technology to push sales of its Explorer cars. Instead of trawling through the Ford site, customers who typed in the words \"Ford Explorer\" were taken directly to the relevant pages.</p> <p>For companies keen to exploit e-commerce, such directness can be a boon. Typically, the Keyword system is used in conjunction with a promotion campaign through posters, print or TV ads. Once a company has generated interest in a product, potential customers have the option of following up that interest online. </p> <p>\"It's all about convergence of the offline and online experience,\" says Mr Tomany. </p> <p>RealNames claims there has been overwhelming interest in its Keywords technology, which may be mostly hype, but since Microsoft - which has already taken a 20% stake in the company - has today committed itself to Keywords for its Internet Explorer browser and MSN Search, deep brand-navigation could be the shopping tool of the very near future. </p> <p>About two million Keywords are currently in use in the US and Europe, with between 250,000 and 300,000 of those being based on this side of the Atlantic. A company typically pays RealNames about \u00a32,000 a year for the use of a Keyword and the evidence so far is that companies are willing to give Keywords a go as a means of boosting sales.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.uk.realnames.com/UK/UK_Corporate_RealNamesHomepage.asp\">RealNames</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/efinance/0,2759,180884,00.html\">E-finance: special report</a></p>",

Several companies have turned to Keywords, including eBay, the hugely-successful online auctioneer, and Panasonic, the Japanese electronics consumer giant. The \"deep brand-navigation\" devised by RealNames allows a company to shepherd customers directly to products, using key phrases. Say a customer wants to buy a digital video player (DVD) from Panasonic; typing \"Panasonic DVDs\" in the address field of their browser will take them straight to a list of Panasonic DVDs, cutting out the company's home page and navigation. Ford recently used Keywords technology to push sales of its Explorer cars. Instead of trawling through the Ford site, customers who typed in the words \"Ford Explorer\" were taken directly to the relevant pages. For companies keen to exploit e-commerce, such directness can be a boon. Typically, the Keyword system is used in conjunction with a promotion campaign through posters, print or TV ads. Once a company has generated interest in a product, potential customers have the option of following up that interest online. \"It's all about convergence of the offline and online experience,\" says Mr Tomany. RealNames claims there has been overwhelming interest in its Keywords technology, which may be mostly hype, but since Microsoft - which has already taken a 20% stake in the company - has today committed itself to Keywords for its Internet Explorer browser and MSN Search, deep brand-navigation could be the shopping tool of the very near future. About two million Keywords are currently in use in the US and Europe, with between 250,000 and 300,000 of those being based on this side of the Atlantic. A company typically pays RealNames about \u00a32,000 a year for the use of a Keyword and the evidence so far is that companies are willing to give Keywords a go as a means of boosting sales.

      "bodyText": "The government has set itself on collision course with the high sheriffs of England and Wales after insisting they reform or risk being consigned to the history books in which many of their powers already reside. Amid private government concerns that the so-called \"shrievalty\" is suffering from institutional racism, the body representing the 55 high sheriffs has been warned that its members are mostly white, male and too rich to properly represent a new Britain in which taxes are collected by the inland revenue rather than local despots. The prime statutory role of today's sheriffs is the enforcement of civil writs, with most emerging into the glare of the media only when they serve papers blocking the activities of eco-warriors attempting to impede the building of roads such as the Newbury bypass in Berkshire. This year six high sheriffs are women, a number that is set to rise to nine in the year 2002-2003. To ministers' frustration, there has never been a black or Asian high sheriff, though Greater London and Leicestershire are both understood to be about to appoint one. The government has given the Shrievalty Association, which represents the sheriffs, until next year to increase the number of women and representatives of ethnic minorities holding the office, though it has stopped short of setting quotas. At present, there is no ethnic or gender monitoring of candidates or post holders, leaving ministers to guess from names the number of women and members of ethnic minorities. In an article in the association's newsletter, Alex Galloway, clerk of the privy council, which administers the sheriffs' appointments process, wrote: \"In terms of representativeness, the shrievalty scores pretty badly, with a very low percentage of women among high sheriffs, even fewer (if any) members of ethnic minorities, and a very limited social range.\" He added: \"Thoughtful sheriffs should be... looking to see how they might make the process of selecting their successors as inclusive as possible.\" A new approach is needed to broaden the field, Mr Galloway warned, risking the fury of more traditional current and past postholders - including one who claimed that \"white males are not welcome as sheriffs\". Arguing that sheriffs must not \"limit the search to people of traditional background\", he proposed using advertisements in local newspapers to publicise the selection process, or asking the public to nominate candidates as they now do for honours. The post of high sheriff is one of the oldest secular offices and dates back to the turn of the 11th century. They are chosen annually by the Queen from a list drawn up by the incumbent and narrowed to two or three candidates by a tribunal. Anyone is eligible to be appointed as long as they hold land in the county. Peers, clergy, officers in active service, barristers and solicitors cannot hold the office, and poverty is also grounds for exemption. Their powers are mainly ceremonial now, but once high sherriffs held responsibility for both judicial and administra tive matters within their bailiwick. They were formerly responsible for the safety of judges within the county and were liable for the safe custody of prisoners as well as the preparation of jury panels for assizes. Margaret Beckett, leader of Commons, pushed for reform of selections shortly after taking up her post, which also carries the title of president of the privy council office. One government source said: \"The problem of lack of balance is effectively self-perpetuating because the existing sheriffs nominate the next lot.\" Duties and functions 'still count for a lot' Paul Kelso The first high sheriff of Suffolk took the job in 1199.

      "bodyText": "Serious failings in financial and management controls lay behind the collapse of an international conference organised by the commission for racial equality and backed by Tony Blair that was supposed to showcase the government's anti-racist achievements, according to an official inquiry report published last night. Tory MPs last night described the report by the new CRE chairman, Gurbux Singh, as identifying a \"devastating catalogue of incompetence and mismanagement\" within the CRE, the Home Office and GCDC 2000 Ltd, the company set up to run the global cultural and diversity congress which was to be held in Cardiff in March this year. Several senior CRE figures including the acting chairman, a commissioner, its chief executive and its chief press officer, are among the directors of the company. The congress had been planned to coincide with the first anniversary of the Lawrence inquiry report and Nelson Mandela had been invited to speak alongside government ministers from Australia, Canada and China. Mr Singh said the collective responsibility for its collapse only a month before it was scheduled is shared between the company, CRE and the Home Office. He said: \"Many factors con tributed to the final outcome: limited assessment of the risks facing the congress and GCDC, over-optimistic projections about income; cashflow and other resourcing difficulties; poor financial challenge and oversight; the inexperience of key staff; and a lack of systems or failing to apply correctly the systems that did not exist.\" Mr Singh said the CRE should now appoint a finance director to strengthen its financial controls and ensure appropriate Home Office oversight of its management. Among the basic failings identified by the Singh report was the appointment of Diane Morley as congress director without any proper consideration of whether she had any suitable experience. At one point the board was told 1,200 delegates had pre-registered during 1999 but these turned out to only be expressions of interest by people who had no idea they faced a delegate fee of \u00a3595 each. In the Commons yesterday, the Conservative home affairs spokesman, David Lidington, said it was not adequate to say nobody was responsible for a the devastating catalogue of incompetence. But while the Home Office minister, Mike O'Brien, confirmed there would be losses as a result of the collapse of the congress, he insisted there was no evidence of impropriety. It is thought the losses could be as high as \u00a3750,000.",

      "body": "<p>Summer begins in early March in Jill Richardson's house. It may not be particularly sunny outside, but she'll wear sunglasses when she leaves the house, and she monitors weather reports with an almost religious observance. But Richardson, unlike the rest of the nation, is not hoping for sunny days. She's praying for rain. </p> <p>Richardson suffers from hay fever. Not the occasional sneeze and sniffle, but painful, miserable, relentless irritation. Like thousands of other sun-starved Brits, she and her partner and their four-year-old daughter Amy spent the heatwave weekend earlier this month at the seaside. She hoped the pollen count would be lower because of the sea breeze, but woke up with infuriatingly itchy eyes and throat, and didn't stop sneezing all day. </p> <p>Her partner also has hay fever, and they believe Amy has developed the disease. The family returned home feeling exhausted, headachey and utterly miserable. \"You get to the stage when you are weighing up whether it's worth leaving the house at all,\" she says. </p> <p>Hay fever, like the common cold, is one of those seasonal diseases we have to muddle through as best we can, hoping for a change in the weather. Where it differs from colds and flu is that only part of the population is vulnerable to it, those who have a specific allergy to pollen. That proportion, however, is increasing every year. In the past 20 years the number of GP consultations for hay fever has quadrupled. </p> <p>Up to a fifth of Britons may now have the allergy, many of them probably known only to their long-suffering colleagues and families and their local pharmacist. As British summers hot up and our nasal tracts get increasingly pollen-sensitive, hay fever could soon overtake the weather as the nation's favourite summertime gripe. </p> <p>For that unfortunate 20%, we are in prime griping season. Late June is the peak grass pollen season in the south of England - Wimbledon fortnight, ironically, is the worst time to be around grass. And this has been the worst year for a generation. \"With pollen counts over 50 grains per cubic metre, virtually every person with hay fever will be feeling the effects,\" says Professor Jean Emberlin, director of the national pollen research unit at Worcester university, which compiles the pollen count figures published in the media: 150, she says, is considered high. Last Monday Derby had a pollen count of 683, the highest since 1968. </p> <p>We tend to assume that environmental extremes are necessarily our fault, but while global warming may have had a part to play in muddling up flowering seasons, pollution does not cause hay fever. It may aggravate the symptoms and irritate an already streaming nose, but it's not the trigger. </p> <p>So what's to blame? Doctors themselves confess to being unsure as to what prompts the allergy. \"We think it's to do with the western lifestyle,\" says Dr Stephen Durham, professor of allergy and respiratory medicine at the Royal Brompton hospital in London. \"Things like immunisation and, ironically, hygiene, have been implicated. </p> <p>\"If you are a snotty-nosed kid running around with 10 siblings who all catch coughs and colds, you are probably more likely to be protected from hay fever in later life.\" Mollycoddling immune systems when we are children produces softies too enfeebled to fight off pollen allergies in their teens and 20s, the disease's peak years. </p> <p>The key to coping with hay fever, says Durham, is understanding how it works. Despite the name, grass pollen is not the only trigger - a minority of sufferers are affected by tree pollen or, most commonly, birch. </p> <p>Tree pollen allergy can be linked to asthma, and sufferers often experience a cross reaction when they eat apples and stone fruits like peaches. Because tree pollen peaks earlier, those who suffer symptoms in March and April are likely to have this type of allergy. \"Lots of councils plant birch trees because they are pretty,\" says Emberlin, \"but they don't realise that this has a big role in promoting hay fever.\" </p> <p>Sufferers also may not realise that their parents may be to blame. Before concerned mums and dads start rolling their toddlers in grime and pushing them out the door to catch a few colds and grow up hardy, they should pause to check if their own noses need wiping. The best thing you can do to avoid developing hay fever, says Durham, is choose your parents. The child of two parents who are sufferers has a 70-90% chance of developing the disease, which falls to 50% with one parent, and less than 20% if neither has the allergy. Nice thought, if hardly practical advice for the millions of sufferers. </p> <p>But there are steps you can take to avoid the disease. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and passive smoking as a child are known to contribute to the allergy's development in later life. Wearing sunglasses, keeping car windows shut and fitting a pollen filter to your car can also help, as can staying indoors in late afternoon, when the pollen count is at its highest - \" it's the last set of the day at Wimbledon that's going to set your hay fever off,\" says Durham. </p> <p>Emberlin counsels watching the pollen forecast carefully - her unit can supply information of counts on certain days. Useful if, for instance, you have suffered badly on the day of an A-level paper and want to appeal to the exam board. If all else fails, says Durham, try to take a holiday abroad or by the coast in the last two weeks in June. </p> <p>The reason for this year's record highs, ironically, is that the weather has been good but not good enough. Extended periods of very hot, dry weather suppress the pollen-releasing mechanism in plants, while wet drizzly weather dampens it down. It's when the weather is hot in bursts, then cool and damp for a few days, that pollen is at its worst. Just like this summer. </p> <p>Jill Richardson confesses to looking forward to September, when her six-month season of medication and misery finally comes to an end.

      "bodyText": "Summer begins in early March in Jill Richardson's house. It may not be particularly sunny outside, but she'll wear sunglasses when she leaves the house, and she monitors weather reports with an almost religious observance. But Richardson, unlike the rest of the nation, is not hoping for sunny days. She's praying for rain. Richardson suffers from hay fever. Not the occasional sneeze and sniffle, but painful, miserable, relentless irritation. Like thousands of other sun-starved Brits, she and her partner and their four-year-old daughter Amy spent the heatwave weekend earlier this month at the seaside. She hoped the pollen count would be lower because of the sea breeze, but woke up with infuriatingly itchy eyes and throat, and didn't stop sneezing all day. Her partner also has hay fever, and they believe Amy has developed the disease. The family returned home feeling exhausted, headachey and utterly miserable. \"You get to the stage when you are weighing up whether it's worth leaving the house at all,\" she says. Hay fever, like the common cold, is one of those seasonal diseases we have to muddle through as best we can, hoping for a change in the weather. Where it differs from colds and flu is that only part of the population is vulnerable to it, those who have a specific allergy to pollen. That proportion, however, is increasing every year. In the past 20 years the number of GP consultations for hay fever has quadrupled. Up to a fifth of Britons may now have the allergy, many of them probably known only to their long-suffering colleagues and families and their local pharmacist. As British summers hot up and our nasal tracts get increasingly pollen-sensitive, hay fever could soon overtake the weather as the nation's favourite summertime gripe. For that unfortunate 20%, we are in prime griping season. Late June is the peak grass pollen season in the south of England - Wimbledon fortnight, ironically, is the worst time to be around grass. And this has been the worst year for a generation. \"With pollen counts over 50 grains per cubic metre, virtually every person with hay fever will be feeling the effects,\" says Professor Jean Emberlin, director of the national pollen research unit at Worcester university, which compiles the pollen count figures published in the media: 150, she says, is considered high. Last Monday Derby had a pollen count of 683, the highest since 1968. We tend to assume that environmental extremes are necessarily our fault, but while global warming may have had a part to play in muddling up flowering seasons, pollution does not cause hay fever. It may aggravate the symptoms and irritate an already streaming nose, but it's not the trigger. So what's to blame? Doctors themselves confess to being unsure as to what prompts the allergy. \"We think it's to do with the western lifestyle,\" says Dr Stephen Durham, professor of allergy and respiratory medicine at the Royal Brompton hospital in London. \"Things like immunisation and, ironically, hygiene, have been implicated. \"If you are a snotty-nosed kid running around with 10 siblings who all catch coughs and colds, you are probably more likely to be protected from hay fever in later life.\" Mollycoddling immune systems when we are children produces softies too enfeebled to fight off pollen allergies in their teens and 20s, the disease's peak years. The key to coping with hay fever, says Durham, is understanding how it works. Despite the name, grass pollen is not the only trigger - a minority of sufferers are affected by tree pollen or, most commonly, birch. Tree pollen allergy can be linked to asthma, and sufferers often experience a cross reaction when they eat apples and stone fruits like peaches. Because tree pollen peaks earlier, those who suffer symptoms in March and April are likely to have this type of allergy. \"Lots of councils plant birch trees because they are pretty,\" says Emberlin, \"but they don't realise that this has a big role in promoting hay fever.\" Sufferers also may not realise that their parents may be to blame. Before concerned mums and dads start rolling their toddlers in grime and pushing them out the door to catch a few colds and grow up hardy, they should pause to check if their own noses need wiping. The best thing you can do to avoid developing hay fever, says Durham, is choose your parents. The child of two parents who are sufferers has a 70-90% chance of developing the disease, which falls to 50% with one parent, and less than 20% if neither has the allergy. Nice thought, if hardly practical advice for the millions of sufferers. But there are steps you can take to avoid the disease. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and passive smoking as a child are known to contribute to the allergy's development in later life. Wearing sunglasses, keeping car windows shut and fitting a pollen filter to your car can also help, as can staying indoors in late afternoon, when the pollen count is at its highest - \" it's the last set of the day at Wimbledon that's going to set your hay fever off,\" says Durham. Emberlin counsels watching the pollen forecast carefully - her unit can supply information of counts on certain days. Useful if, for instance, you have suffered badly on the day of an A-level paper and want to appeal to the exam board. If all else fails, says Durham, try to take a holiday abroad or by the coast in the last two weeks in June. The reason for this year's record highs, ironically, is that the weather has been good but not good enough. Extended periods of very hot, dry weather suppress the pollen-releasing mechanism in plants, while wet drizzly weather dampens it down. It's when the weather is hot in bursts, then cool and damp for a few days, that pollen is at its worst. Just like this summer. Jill Richardson confesses to looking forward to September, when her six-month season of medication and misery finally comes to an end. At least she'll have a few months of respite before it all begins again. But the millions for whom the annual battle with pollen is a wearying one can at least console themselves that the most successful cure for hay fever is time.

They began to see themselves as people living more rounded lives. </p> <p>\"One man who has facial cancer now produces a photo of his portrait whenever a person says something about his face,\" says Farrant. \"He engages them in a surgical narrative of where he was and what has happened.

      "byline": "Dr Ann Robinson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Diabetes fear</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>If I eat more than a small amount of anything containing a lot of refined sugar, such as sweets, I experience the classic symptoms of hypoglycaemia (as opposed to hyperglycaemia). With all the recent publicity about the dangers of undetected diabetes, I have been wondering whether I ought to be worried. I'm 42, fit and not overweight.</p> <p> <strong> A</strong> When we eat a large sugar load the rising blood sugar level releases insulin from the pancreas. The insulin brings blood sugar levels back down to normal, and sometimes even a little below normal. Diabetics don't produce enough insulin and therefore run high sugar levels, which isn't good for blood vessels and organs. As you've experienced, the rapidly falling blood sugar level after insulin release can make some individuals feel rather shaky, sweaty, weak and hungry - all signs that diabetics get when their blood sugar falls too low (hypoglycaemia) because they've had too much insulin or anti diabetes drugs. I'm sure your GP would gladly check urine and blood for diabetes to reassure you, but I'd cut out sugar loads anyway. </p> <p><strong> Meningitis jab safety</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> My child is due for her meningitis vaccination next week. I'm worried by reports of serious side effects. Is there any risk of her developing meningitis? </p> <p> <strong>A</strong> The meningitis C vaccine isn't a live vaccine and can't cause meningitis or septicaemia (blood poisoning). It's made by combining the bacteria's sugar coating with a protein. The injection, which is safe for babies from two months upwards, gives long-lasting immunity. The jab can't kill your child but the infection can; 60,000 doses have been given worldwide without serious reactions and it's thought that 200 children's lives have been saved this year in the UK because of the vaccination campaign. If your daughter has a high temperature on the day or has had a previous serious reaction to any jab she shouldn't have one. You should discuss it first with your GP. Around 24% of children who have the jab have redness and swelling of the arm, and about 10% get a headache. Call the 24 hour helpline for information: 0845 600 0800 </p> <p><strong> Termination truths</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> I am going to see a gynaecologist for some tests. Is there any way that he/she will be able to tell that I have had an abortion? I didn't go through my own GP for the termination and would prefer that it remains private. </p> <p><strong> A </strong> In general, a gynaecologist couldn't tell for certain. I would advise anyone to be truthful, because it may be relevant in the future. For instance, if you and your partner want to have a baby and find it takes a while, it will be highly relevant that you have already \"proved\" your fertility. Most GPs and gynaecologists don't bat an eyelid when someone says they've had a termination. I would urge you to give a full and complete history so you get a better service from them. </p> <p><strong> Breast cancer risks</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q </strong> My mother developed breast cancer when she was only 42. Thankfully, she is still alive and well today. I'm now in my 30s and becoming increasingly worried that I'm going to get it too. What tests can I have and when?</p> <p><strong> A</strong> I think you'll find statistics more comforting than platitudes. All UK women without breast cancer in the family carry a 1 in 11 chance of developing it - usually in old age. Our risk of getting breast cancer in our 40s is 1 in 100. With one relative like your mother, who was over 40 when diagnosed, your risk goes up to a maximum of 1 in 8 over your lifetime, and a 1 in 50 chance in your 40s. That's definitely odds against, so you are far more likely not to get breast cancer than to get it, and you are considered to be at low risk. Mammograms from 35, and referral to a specialist genetics clinic are recommended for high risk groups, such as women with two relatives diagnosed in their 30s. You'll obviously want to be aware of your own breasts by checking them regularly and will be invited for regular mammograms from 50, like the rest of us. </p> <p><strong> Defeating dandruff</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>What works best for dandruff? My wife's always brushing my shoulders and buying me new shampoos from the chemist. It can be very embarrassing. </p> <p><strong> A </strong>Two shampoos available over the counter are worth a try; Selsun and Nizoral. They work in different ways so try one first and switch if you have no joy. If your dandruff is accompanied by scaly skin patches, you may have psoriasis. It's worth a visit to your GP to discuss options.</p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

      "bodyText": "Diabetes fear Q If I eat more than a small amount of anything containing a lot of refined sugar, such as sweets, I experience the classic symptoms of hypoglycaemia (as opposed to hyperglycaemia). With all the recent publicity about the dangers of undetected diabetes, I have been wondering whether I ought to be worried. I'm 42, fit and not overweight. A When we eat a large sugar load the rising blood sugar level releases insulin from the pancreas. The insulin brings blood sugar levels back down to normal, and sometimes even a little below normal. Diabetics don't produce enough insulin and therefore run high sugar levels, which isn't good for blood vessels and organs. As you've experienced, the rapidly falling blood sugar level after insulin release can make some individuals feel rather shaky, sweaty, weak and hungry - all signs that diabetics get when their blood sugar falls too low (hypoglycaemia) because they've had too much insulin or anti diabetes drugs. I'm sure your GP would gladly check urine and blood for diabetes to reassure you, but I'd cut out sugar loads anyway. Meningitis jab safety Q My child is due for her meningitis vaccination next week. I'm worried by reports of serious side effects. Is there any risk of her developing meningitis? A The meningitis C vaccine isn't a live vaccine and can't cause meningitis or septicaemia (blood poisoning). It's made by combining the bacteria's sugar coating with a protein. The injection, which is safe for babies from two months upwards, gives long-lasting immunity. The jab can't kill your child but the infection can; 60,000 doses have been given worldwide without serious reactions and it's thought that 200 children's lives have been saved this year in the UK because of the vaccination campaign. If your daughter has a high temperature on the day or has had a previous serious reaction to any jab she shouldn't have one. You should discuss it first with your GP. Around 24% of children who have the jab have redness and swelling of the arm, and about 10% get a headache. Call the 24 hour helpline for information: 0845 600 0800 Termination truths Q I am going to see a gynaecologist for some tests. Is there any way that he/she will be able to tell that I have had an abortion? I didn't go through my own GP for the termination and would prefer that it remains private. A In general, a gynaecologist couldn't tell for certain. I would advise anyone to be truthful, because it may be relevant in the future. For instance, if you and your partner want to have a baby and find it takes a while, it will be highly relevant that you have already \"proved\" your fertility. Most GPs and gynaecologists don't bat an eyelid when someone says they've had a termination. I would urge you to give a full and complete history so you get a better service from them. Breast cancer risks Q My mother developed breast cancer when she was only 42. Thankfully, she is still alive and well today. I'm now in my 30s and becoming increasingly worried that I'm going to get it too. What tests can I have and when? A I think you'll find statistics more comforting than platitudes. All UK women without breast cancer in the family carry a 1 in 11 chance of developing it - usually in old age. Our risk of getting breast cancer in our 40s is 1 in 100. With one relative like your mother, who was over 40 when diagnosed, your risk goes up to a maximum of 1 in 8 over your lifetime, and a 1 in 50 chance in your 40s. That's definitely odds against, so you are far more likely not to get breast cancer than to get it, and you are considered to be at low risk. Mammograms from 35, and referral to a specialist genetics clinic are recommended for high risk groups, such as women with two relatives diagnosed in their 30s. You'll obviously want to be aware of your own breasts by checking them regularly and will be invited for regular mammograms from 50, like the rest of us. Defeating dandruff Q What works best for dandruff? My wife's always brushing my shoulders and buying me new shampoos from the chemist. It can be very embarrassing. A Two shampoos available over the counter are worth a try; Selsun and Nizoral. They work in different ways so try one first and switch if you have no joy. If your dandruff is accompanied by scaly skin patches, you may have psoriasis. It's worth a visit to your GP to discuss options. \u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help. If you have a question for Dr Robinson, email drann@dircon.co.uk or write to her c/o The Health Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. She regrets that she cannot enter into personal correspondence.",

      "body": "<p>Last Saturday, in a newspaper that shall remain nameless, I saw an advertisement for a \"literacy agent\" and, later that same day, a publisher's blurb promising an \"exiting\" novel. Oh dear. If the so-called professionals can't get it right (it should, of course, have been \"literary agent\" and \"exciting\"), what hope for the rest of us?</p> <p>The news that one in five Britons is \"functionally illiterate\" (a strange piece of language in itself) comes as no surprise. I'm a novelist and I find myself wandering every now and then. Or should that be wondering? Still, even Homer nods and I'm in the best of company: Kingsley Amis once wrote to Anita Brookner pointing out 40 grammatical mistakes in two pages of one of her novels.</p> <p>Some writers, such as the poet Geoffrey Hill, make grammar the fulcrum on which their work rests, weighing heavy moral arguments in the placing of a semi-colon; others don't worry too much about it, relying on what's known as descriptive grammar - the notion that if people talk like that, then it's ok.</p> <p>There was a time when using \"ok\" would have been infra dig. We certainly don't have to write in that stuffy 1950s style any more. The important point is this: if there is a failure to communicate clearly, then we have a problem as a society.</p> <p>It doesn't look good - although it is also worth bearing in mind that illiteracy has been an issue since the dawn of writing. It is not as if (it never is) there has been some golden age of super-literate Britons.

      "bodyText": "Last Saturday, in a newspaper that shall remain nameless, I saw an advertisement for a \"literacy agent\" and, later that same day, a publisher's blurb promising an \"exiting\" novel. Oh dear. If the so-called professionals can't get it right (it should, of course, have been \"literary agent\" and \"exciting\"), what hope for the rest of us? The news that one in five Britons is \"functionally illiterate\" (a strange piece of language in itself) comes as no surprise. I'm a novelist and I find myself wandering every now and then. Or should that be wondering? Still, even Homer nods and I'm in the best of company: Kingsley Amis once wrote to Anita Brookner pointing out 40 grammatical mistakes in two pages of one of her novels. Some writers, such as the poet Geoffrey Hill, make grammar the fulcrum on which their work rests, weighing heavy moral arguments in the placing of a semi-colon; others don't worry too much about it, relying on what's known as descriptive grammar - the notion that if people talk like that, then it's ok. There was a time when using \"ok\" would have been infra dig. We certainly don't have to write in that stuffy 1950s style any more. The important point is this: if there is a failure to communicate clearly, then we have a problem as a society. It doesn't look good - although it is also worth bearing in mind that illiteracy has been an issue since the dawn of writing. It is not as if (it never is) there has been some golden age of super-literate Britons. On the other hand, the rise of televisual/video-game culture and the decline in reading as a pastime have clearly taken their toll in the last few years. But even there we can find some relief. People aren't less intelligent. It's just a different kind of intelligence, a different kind of grammar, one in which spatial and narrative awareness are more important than syntactic exactitude. You only need watch a couple of kids hunched over their consoles to see this in action. I'm not saying this is a cause for celebration. Words are my life. But there's a shower of pixels coming, piped into every living room in the land; and when it comes, it's those who aren't ready who will be described as functionally illiterate.",

      "bodyText": "A public inquiry into how serial killer GP Harold Shipman came to murder so many of his patients was vital \"to restore faith and confidence in GPs and the NHS\", the High Court has been told. The call for an open inquiry came as 113 relatives of those who died began their legal battle for the right to an investigation which was fully open to the press and public. Eight national newspaper and media groups joined them in the action triggered by the decision to hold the inquiry in private. Earlier this year Shipman, 54, was convicted at Preston Crown Court of murdering 15 patients, but he is suspected of killing nearly 200. Augustus Ullstein QC, appearing for the bereaved families, told two judges that throughout the Shipman affair the relatives had co-operated with the police and the coroner \"to a very marked degree\" despite the tragedy which had befallen them. In many cases, their grief was increased by having to go through the exhumation and re-burial of their loved ones. They had all been led to believe they were to have a public inquiry as a result of statements made in the House of Commons by Health Secretary Alan Milburn in February. He had said the inquiry would be conducted in public. But Mr Milburn had now made it clear he believed the inquiry should be in private, although its report would be made public, along with any evidence the inquiry team \"feel appropriate\" for publication. Mr Ullstein asked Lord Justice Kennedy, sitting with Mr Justice Jackson, to overturn Mr Milburn's decision. He argued the relatives, some 30 of whom were in court listening, had a \"legitimate expectation\" that the full inquiry would be in public - \"fairness and justice\" demanded an open inquiry.

      "body": "<p>These days only over-night sensations seem to count for much in cinema, so it's gratifying when an already established name steps into the limelight 12 years after her first feature. French director Claire Denis became a name to watch in 1988, with her first film Chocolat, an oblique study of colonial tensions in Africa. Since then she has made a series of audacious, low-budget features - six in all, none shown here - but now British fans have the chance to see her work once again. </p> <p>Her boldest film yet, Beau Travail has once more made critics in France and the US take notice. Beau Travail, many are saying, has thrown Denis into a new league of film-making. Some US critics have used jazz analogies: suddenly Denis's work has loosened up so dazzlingly that she's become a Charlie Parker, an Ornette Coleman. And when it comes to whipping up complex, unpredictable variations on a standard theme, Beau Travail is definitely up there with the bebop greats. Inspired by Billy Budd, Herman Melville's tale of jealousy and martyrdom on the high seas, Denis has set her story in a French Foreign Legion camp in Djibouti, framing the sweating shaven heads against stark salt flats, to extracts from Benjamin Britten's Melville-inspired opera. </p> <p>It's not as if France was going through a fashion for films about the Foreign Legion, a topic pretty much invisible on screen these days. \"It's not a taboo subject,\" Denis says. \"It just doesn't interest people. You can spend your whole life in France without ever thinking about the Legion.\" But Denis discovered analogies between the Legion and the naval universe of Billy Budd: \"a male world, with internal rules and codes of honour\". </p> <p>The rules in Beau Travail become a sort of abstract dance, the Legionnaires' manoeuvres suggesting something between samurai discipline and the limbering-up of a radical gay corps de ballet. It's not really a dance film, Denis says, although she worked with a choreographer, Bernardo Montet. That was the only way that she could create an \"ideal army\" on a minimal budget. \"We started with the motions of military training, and worked to form a coherent military unit using only 15 men. I played them the Britten opera, which I listened to while I was writing the script. But we never set out with the word 'dance' in mind. We just thought of work.\" </p> <p>Beau Travail is Denis's first return to Africa in a film since Chocolat, inspired by her own childhood as the daughter of a government functionary. The family frequently moved around west Africa, with the exception of a year in Djibouti, a French overseas territory in east Africa that gained independence in 1977. But Denis, 54 , stresses Beau Travail was not made in the spirit of autobiographical pilgrimage. \"I remember being dazzled by the beauty of the Red Sea, the desert. You don't forget a landscape like that. I always thought of Djibouti as a place where human history hasn't really begun yet - or perhaps it's already over. There's something in the landscape that's stronger than human civilisation. There's no agriculture, for example, and there are live volcanoes. And there's the Legion.\" </p> <p>Shooting in Djibouti contributed to the nervy, abstract quality of Beau Travail. \"I thought war might start again with Eritrea, or the French army might stop us shooting. I felt so insecure I said, 'We'll take it day by day, because tomorrow it might all be over.' That liberated some kind of energy.\" </p> <p>Any militaristic ideals of empire that still attach to the Legion in France are thoroughly skewed in Denis's film. Her \"ideal\" army looks futile and perverse, toiling away in a desert void. It's also a distinctly homoerotic world - inevitably, Denis says. \"If you film 15 men under the sun, in great physical shape and in uniform, it's bound to look homoerotic. That is the image of the Legionnaire - go to certain gay clubs in Paris and you'll see a lot of that imagery.\" </p> <p>What's unusual is that such a reverie of male physicality has been filmed by two women, Denis and her regular photographer Agn\u00e8s Godard. Denis can't deny that there is an erotic resonance for her. \"When you work with actors, they abandon themselves to the person filming in a way that's erotic in itself. But I'm not so much interested in images of male beauty, or female beauty. What I like is the idea of a group, even if it's just two people - the idea of solitude within a group.\" </p> <p>Many of Denis's films are close-up studies of male groups locked together in claustrophobic isolation - like the two black men embroiled in the cockfighting underworld in her brutally realistic S'En Fout La Mort (No Fear No Die), or the Cameroonian musicians Les T tes Brl\u00e9es, whose first French tour Denis filmed in her documentary Man No Run. </p> <p>There's a group within the group in Beau Travail: Melville's infernal triangle of beautiful recruit, lofty commander and embittered, jealous sergeant. The last is played by Denis Lavant, the savage-looking star of Leos Carax's first three films. In Beau Travail, he comes into his own as a tough, tender monster, dancing out his agonies in the final disco solo, like a Travolta burning in a private hell. \"That whole question of what it means to be a man and join the Legion: Denis Lavant had already thought about it himself, and it played a big part.\" </p> <p>Another star of the film is Michel Subor, the lead in Jean-Luc Godard's Le Petit Soldat in 1960. Both Subor and Lavant are new to Denis's world, but she tends to work repeatedly with the same actors, such as Beau Travail's Gr\u00e9goire Colin. \"I have very strong relationships with my actors when I'm shooting. When you love an actor's work, you always feel you have to go further and you make several films together. One film just gives you time to get acquainted.\" </p> <p>Denis's loose repertory cast also includes B\u00e9atrice Dalle, Alex Descas and US madcap Vincent Gallo, who all feature in the film she's currently completing, Trouble Every Day. It just might, Denis says, live up to its advance billing as a horror movie. </p> <p>Denis served her apprenticeship as assistant to an improbable range of major-league directors, among them Jim Jarmusch, Wim Wenders, Dusan Makavejev and especially the enigmatic new wave veteran Jacques Rivette. What she learned most of all was a particular attitude to filming. \"I never liked directors who simply shoot in order to translate a script into images. I was always interested in people who try to capture the moment on set, a piece of time. That's what I try to do. If the script wins, then nothing happens between me and the actors. I prefer to film the film: the relationship between myself, the location, the time passing and the characters.\" </p> <p>Probably the most consistently exciting director in France at the moment, Denis is certainly the one who does most to undermine the image of French art film as vaporous and talky. Even when her films look on the surface like straight realism, they have a way of locking you into a closed world and making you watch while things happen - sometimes things you can't believe any director would risk tackling. Take her 1993 film J'ai Pas Sommeil (I Can't Sleep). Inspired by a real case, this Paris-set story has a central character who is a gay, black serial killer of OAPs. It seems a perversely challenging starting point for a film Denis intended as a critique of the rightwing paranoia that she felt prevailed in Paris at the time. Or perhaps it's just an unusually rigorous example of \"capturing the moment\". </p> <p>\"For me, it was a testament of that period, of that city in the 90s,\" Denis says. \"I think it's important for cinema to be a witness to the times. You have to leave something behind you. Renoir said that you should film neighbourhoods that are about to be demolished, before they're forgotten. And that's what cinema is about - the need to leave traces.\"</p> <p>\u0095 The Guardian Interview with Claire Denis is on Wednesday at the NFT, London SE1 (020-7928 3232).

The popular image of A Student is still heavily influenced by The Young Ones and Withnail and I, both of which are at least 15 years old. And TV shows and magazine articles still rely lazily on this old student stereotype.</p> <p>Well, you can forget all that: students have moved on and closer to the once unimaginable - absolutely fabulous. </p> <p>\"I was expecting the whole just-got-out-of-bed look,\" says Raemen Meghji, who has just completed his first year in econometrics at the London School of Economics. </p> <p>\"But I was really surprised by how much some people here spend on clothes. You see serious labels around the place, like Armani and stuff like that.\" </p> <p>Jessica Loden, a first year at Edinburgh, agrees. \"It is quite smart here, and there does tend to be a bit of a uniform of pink pashminas, long black coats and designer labels.\" </p> <p>When living in a sea of 10,000 of your peers, the quickest - though maybe not cheapest - means of carving out your own identity (shorthand for proclaiming Who You Are) is through your clothes. </p> <p>Think of the heavy metal fans proudly wearing their Metallica T-shirts, or the university athletes, seemingly inseparable from their tracksuits. Now more mainstream designer labels seem as acceptable as the more youthful ones. Over the past decade designers such as Gucci, Prada and Alberta Ferretti have been attracting a younger customer, so it is not surprising that this is slowly being reflected in university campuses. </p> <p>Thanks to a highly fashion-conscious, young Hollywood (Gwyneth Paltrow, Brad Pitt, Uma Thurman, et al), designer clothes are no longer associated with staid middle-age or the equally off-putting image of Sloaniness. </p> <p>Nor does this trend seem to be limited to big city universities. Students at East Anglia, Warwick and St Andrews universities all mentioned, respectively, the recent popularity of Prada bags, Armani shirts and Joseph trousers. </p> <p>\"OK, we all have no money,\" says Dave Telfer, a student at Nottingham Trent. \"But clothes are so important at university, and some people are willing to sacrifice other things for the sake of clothes. People say it's especially so with girls, but I think it's with boys, too.\" </p> <p>Some learn to compromise between their diminishing bank account and love of fashion. \"You see people here wearing expensive trousers with an inexpensive T-shirt, or some other top they picked up in a thrift store,\" says Carl Wilkinson, a finalist at Oxford. </p> <p>Raemen suggests this is partly due to the increasing numbers of wealthy foreign students at British universities who will have been raised wearing a cut above the average high street fare. More students work during their gap year, and some continue while studying, giving them extra spending power. </p> <p>Also, thanks to influential lifestyle and fashion magazines such as i.D and Dazed and Confused, an interest in clothing no longer carries the stigma it once did, especially among male students. Magazines aimed at 18- to 35-year-olds celebrate designer clothing alongside more youthful, alternative labels. No longer is spending an inordinate amount of money on attention-grabbing and ostentatiously pricey clothing seen as laughable or vain. </p> <p>And if you feel uncomfortable with this fascination with designer labels, be grateful you're not at university in the States. Holly Heatherington, a sophomore at Princeton, describes her college's collective style as \"Ralph Lauren button-down shirts and pearls\". </p> <p>But how does this meld with the demands of university? Do students really go to the library wearing Donna Karan? \"It's just a nice little luxury, and one that will now give you some cred with your peers,\" says James Bates, a student at Manchester University. </p> <p>\"Students, particularly finalists, are really anxious about finding jobs when they finish and are becoming independent; if you dress in jeans and hooded tops all the time, you feel like a kid. Dressing up makes you feel a little less scummy and more confident, even if you live in a hell-hole full of festering plates of food. Also, you then always have something to wear to job interviews.\" </p> <p>Despite their growing presence at universities, however, designer labels are not, fortunately, de rigueur: you are unlikely to be mocked if your wardrobe is lacking in Valentino or Lacroix. For most students, such clothing is as out of reach as meeting every essay deadline. </p> <p>\"Despite the emphasis on appearance, students aren't fashion fascists, simply because there is such a range of styles,\" Carl explains. \"It's just that the old image of students - tracksuit bottoms, three-day-old plates of baked beans, watching Teletubbies all day - never did apply, and is perhaps even less true today. People, and that includes students, are just more fashion-conscious these days.\" </p> <p>\"There is an in-between,\" says James. \"But if you want to stand out from the crowd, as well as give yourself a bit more confidence - which you sometimes need at university - what better way than to wear amazing clothes? Students cannot live by combats alone, you know.\" </p> <p>Unless they're from Calvin Klein, presumably.</p> <p><strong>The Boutique Geek look that's open to all</strong></p> <p>Of course, not every student can afford Gucci or Pucci. But this does not mean they are relegated to fashion ignominy. On the contrary, students are known for making a pound stretch as far as possible which, for some, can furnish them with a whole new, much trendier wardrobe. </p> <p>Although the NHS specs look, popularised by the likes of Jarvis Cocker and Chris Evans, might be sooo 1997, their Geek Chic look lives on - but not as we knew it. Boutique Geek Chic is the sartorial expression of irony, just as lounge music is irony in a musical form. Small wonder, then, that this look is particularly beloved of teenage boys, who are probably also thrilled to have found an alternative to fairly mundane high street offerings. </p> <p>Roughly speaking, the staples of a Boutique Geek Chic wardrobe are as follows: loud Hawaiian shirts, old Sainsbury uniform shirts, T-shirts from concerts in the Eighties (Metallica, Rick Astley, Duran Duran), 30-year-old Savile Row suits, oddly patterned trousers, silk shirts, and anything else found in the 50p and under basket in the local charity shop. The lad who lists Oxfam, Scope and Cancer Research among his recreational activities may be exceptionally community-minded, but he might equally be a shopaholic. </p> <p>The benefits to Boutique Geek Chic are obvious: no one else will be sporting your outfit; your clothes express that you have an ironic, intelligent sense of humour; you get to wear fun clothes without looking effeminate, and it is dirt cheap. As to who wears the look, a safe rule of thumb is the lad who trawls through Sam's Crazy Records for hours on end in search of that elusive vinyl recording from 1972, or he who sifts through charity shop bins, looking for that perfectly hideous (or hideously perfect) Hawaiian shirt. </p> <p>This is not a look for the guys, but for the individual. Sadly for the Boutique Geek Chic geek, the look is no longer quite so individual. Just as designers such as Matthew Williamson and Jean-Paul Gaultier are mining a rich ethnic seam from Rajasthani Chic - once the preferred budget style of travellers to Goa and 14-year-old Camden Market devotees - so some are cashing in on the charity shop look, aka The Vintage Look. </p> <p>Prada's enormous seventies-style sunglasses, Gucci's huge floral prints and Paul Smith's Hawaiian shirts are all worryingly reminiscent of Boutique Geek Chic - tacky, yet somehow fascinatingly cool. </p> <p>Even worse, the high street has picked up on Boutique Geek Chic, with those bastions of homogeneity, French Connection and Next, stocking baggy smart trousers and loud summer shirts for men. For Heaven's sake, even Ant and Dec have adopted the look, and few 20-year-old, heterosexual males want to resemble Saturday morning kids' TV presenters. </p> <p>This all rather takes the fun out of Boutique Geek Chic, much in the way the mass CD market, the endless compilation tapes and car advertisements have firmly removed the irony from Burt Bacharach and Dean Martin. </p> <p>Once everyone else gets the joke, where's the excitement? Where's the individuality? Hopefully for debt-stricken, fashion-starved students, it can still be found somewhere for less than a pound.</p> <p>\u0095 Hadley Freeman</p>",

Also, thanks to influential lifestyle and fashion magazines such as i.D and Dazed and Confused, an interest in clothing no longer carries the stigma it once did, especially among male students. Magazines aimed at 18- to 35-year-olds celebrate designer clothing alongside more youthful, alternative labels. No longer is spending an inordinate amount of money on attention-grabbing and ostentatiously pricey clothing seen as laughable or vain. And if you feel uncomfortable with this fascination with designer labels, be grateful you're not at university in the States. Holly Heatherington, a sophomore at Princeton, describes her college's collective style as \"Ralph Lauren button-down shirts and pearls\". But how does this meld with the demands of university? Do students really go to the library wearing Donna Karan? \"It's just a nice little luxury, and one that will now give you some cred with your peers,\" says James Bates, a student at Manchester University. \"Students, particularly finalists, are really anxious about finding jobs when they finish and are becoming independent; if you dress in jeans and hooded tops all the time, you feel like a kid. Dressing up makes you feel a little less scummy and more confident, even if you live in a hell-hole full of festering plates of food. Also, you then always have something to wear to job interviews.\" Despite their growing presence at universities, however, designer labels are not, fortunately, de rigueur: you are unlikely to be mocked if your wardrobe is lacking in Valentino or Lacroix. For most students, such clothing is as out of reach as meeting every essay deadline. \"Despite the emphasis on appearance, students aren't fashion fascists, simply because there is such a range of styles,\" Carl explains. \"It's just that the old image of students - tracksuit bottoms, three-day-old plates of baked beans, watching Teletubbies all day - never did apply, and is perhaps even less true today. People, and that includes students, are just more fashion-conscious these days.\" \"There is an in-between,\" says James. \"But if you want to stand out from the crowd, as well as give yourself a bit more confidence - which you sometimes need at university - what better way than to wear amazing clothes? Students cannot live by combats alone, you know.\" Unless they're from Calvin Klein, presumably. The Boutique Geek look that's open to all Of course, not every student can afford Gucci or Pucci. But this does not mean they are relegated to fashion ignominy. On the contrary, students are known for making a pound stretch as far as possible which, for some, can furnish them with a whole new, much trendier wardrobe. Although the NHS specs look, popularised by the likes of Jarvis Cocker and Chris Evans, might be sooo 1997, their Geek Chic look lives on - but not as we knew it. Boutique Geek Chic is the sartorial expression of irony, just as lounge music is irony in a musical form. Small wonder, then, that this look is particularly beloved of teenage boys, who are probably also thrilled to have found an alternative to fairly mundane high street offerings. Roughly speaking, the staples of a Boutique Geek Chic wardrobe are as follows: loud Hawaiian shirts, old Sainsbury uniform shirts, T-shirts from concerts in the Eighties (Metallica, Rick Astley, Duran Duran), 30-year-old Savile Row suits, oddly patterned trousers, silk shirts, and anything else found in the 50p and under basket in the local charity shop. The lad who lists Oxfam, Scope and Cancer Research among his recreational activities may be exceptionally community-minded, but he might equally be a shopaholic. The benefits to Boutique Geek Chic are obvious: no one else will be sporting your outfit; your clothes express that you have an ironic, intelligent sense of humour; you get to wear fun clothes without looking effeminate, and it is dirt cheap. As to who wears the look, a safe rule of thumb is the lad who trawls through Sam's Crazy Records for hours on end in search of that elusive vinyl recording from 1972, or he who sifts through charity shop bins, looking for that perfectly hideous (or hideously perfect) Hawaiian shirt. This is not a look for the guys, but for the individual. Sadly for the Boutique Geek Chic geek, the look is no longer quite so individual. Just as designers such as Matthew Williamson and Jean-Paul Gaultier are mining a rich ethnic seam from Rajasthani Chic - once the preferred budget style of travellers to Goa and 14-year-old Camden Market devotees - so some are cashing in on the charity shop look, aka The Vintage Look. Prada's enormous seventies-style sunglasses, Gucci's huge floral prints and Paul Smith's Hawaiian shirts are all worryingly reminiscent of Boutique Geek Chic - tacky, yet somehow fascinatingly cool. Even worse, the high street has picked up on Boutique Geek Chic, with those bastions of homogeneity, French Connection and Next, stocking baggy smart trousers and loud summer shirts for men. For Heaven's sake, even Ant and Dec have adopted the look, and few 20-year-old, heterosexual males want to resemble Saturday morning kids' TV presenters. This all rather takes the fun out of Boutique Geek Chic, much in the way the mass CD market, the endless compilation tapes and car advertisements have firmly removed the irony from Burt Bacharach and Dean Martin. Once everyone else gets the joke, where's the excitement? Where's the individuality? Hopefully for debt-stricken, fashion-starved students, it can still be found somewhere for less than a pound. \u0095 Hadley Freeman",

In between the mindlessly dull and the smart-arsed, trying-too-hard-to-be-clever, lay the baldly enigmatic, \"Colin Dudley would have been proud of you\". </p> <p>So who, or what, is Colin Dudley? A trope out of Self's fiction? The doyen of London's literati? </p> <p>\"He was one of my English teachers,\" Self explains later. \"He was actually very good but it was his appearance that most caught the eye. He was flamboyantly bisexual, with a wig where the cr\u00eape showed through underneath, and he wore extremely tight jeans that displayed his tackle to maximum effect. For lessons, he'd play Donovan tapes and tell us how he used to take speed.\" </p> <p>For someone who has made a living out of the provocative bon mot, there is very little side to Self these days. He's a large man with an even larger presence, but his bad boy days are well and truly over. You still wouldn't ever mark him down as one of life's dabblers, but what you see is now pretty much what you get. The artifice is back where it belongs, in the fiction rather than his life. So when he says, \"I was the conformist of the family,\" you have to take him seriously. </p> <p>Conformity, it turns out, was a relative concept chez Self. His father was an academic, specialising in political science and town planning, and his mother was a liberal New York Jewish wiseacre. \"It was my brother who dropped out of school to go into business who was considered the rebel,\" he smiles. \"My dad thought he was d\u00e9class\u00e9 for turning to trade, while my mum thought he should have progressed beyond traditional Jewish mercantile pursuits.\" </p> <p>Self drew the family plaudits for his creativity, but they came with a high price. Most children get to fight with their parents at some stage, yet Self never had that luxury. </p> <p>\"There was nothing to react against,\" he continues, \"as my mother was always just that bit more anarchic than me. I remember my last day at my first school, Golders Hill. All those who were leaving were supposed to shake hands with the mannish Mrs Davies, but I told my mum that I wanted to tell her to get lost and that I hated her. My mum just said, \"Good idea. You kick her in the shins and tell her to piss off and I'll have the car waiting at the bottom of the steps with the door open and the engine running.\" </p> <p>\"So did you?\" </p> <p>\"God, no,\" he replies, horrified. \"But it was the same with my drug-taking. Until I started taking heroin, she positively encouraged it. She thought it was just a phase.\" </p> <p>\"A long phase.\" </p> <p>\"Yeah, 25 years,\" he guesstimates. \"You can see why I have such a confused attitude towards authority figures.\" </p> <p>Which might explain why the first teacher ever to make a positive impression on him was the complete antithesis of what you expect. University College Junior School was naice liberal Hampstead posh through and through. Mr Marston, the 5th form Latin teacher, wasn't. He was a former sergeant in the marines whose preferred mode of dress was the full Batman rig, complete with cane. </p> <p>\"He represented everything I hated,\" Self observes, \"but I came to like him and he came to like me.\" However, the mutual admiration almost certainly grew out of a shared sense of the macabre than out of family values. \"He was fond of telling us how one officer used to peer down the barrels of his platoon's rifles,\" he continues. \"He came to the last soldier and ordered him to pull the trigger. Which he did, and blew the officer's head off. Mr Marston told this as if it was a parable, but I'm still not exactly sure what the meaning is.\" </p> <p>Come secondary school, Self was moved to the local grammar, Christ's College. A few of the boys may have spoken like Derek and Clive, but it was by no means rough and for Self it was another non-experience, with little to kick against. He marked his territory in his second week when he wrote \"Down with Thatcher\" on the blackboard to celebrate the local MP and then minister for education's school visit, which earned him two weeks' toilet duties, but for the most part the school did nothing but show forbearance for Self's adolescent rebelliousness. </p> <p>His penchant for oddballs re-emerged in his two English teachers, Colin Dudley and Mike Smith. \"Smith was a wonderfully colourless man who gave nothing away about himself,\" Self says. \"We tried to track him on motorbikes and mopeds to find out more about him, but we failed abjectly. He was a great teacher, though; he was very good on exegesis and he introduced me to structural critical theory when I was 16.\" </p> <p>Smith recognised an intellectual precocity behind Self's frontiness and set out to nurture it. He advised Self against studying critical theory at Oxford, on the grounds that it would ruin any career he might have as a fiction writer, and steered him towards philosophy. All went according to plan, until Self arrived at Oxford, whereupon he disengaged academically and pursued applied pharmacology instead. </p> <p>Indeed his one novel contribution to ratiocination stemmed from his recreational interests. \"I advanced an Argument from Hallucination,\" he offers, \"whereby you could prove reality is real by taking a strong psychotropic drug. When you were coming down, you took another psychotropic drug and if you noticed the difference it proved there must be a substratum of reality on which the two drugs must be acting.\" </p> <p>He adds that his tutor, the philosopher Galen Strawson, was highly taken with this theory and you can sense that Self still reckons the argument has merit. These days, though, it's not one he wants to test empirically. It's been a long haul back to reality and the reward is not just his life, his kids and his marriage but also How the Dead Live, his best book since his very first. Which he also happened to write straight. </p> <p>So my guess is that the bloke in the gallery had it right. Colin Dudley would be proud of Self. As would Mr Marston and Mike Smith. But then they should be proud of themselves, too. Teaching Self must have seemed like a Ray Mears exercise in survival for the most part; to have ended with no casualties on either side is something of a result.</p>",

As Jeff Bezos, the company's youthful founder, bounds into the staff canteen clad in the regulation blue shirt and khakis of the dot.com executive, the only sign that this might not be the start of an ordinary weekend at Amazon is the television news crews thronging outside. But Bezos ignores them, focusing instead on the technicians setting up the music system for that evening's function. A blast of feedback shakes the room. \"I've got blood coming out of my ears, now, people!\" Bezos says, and laughs the laugh that nobody who meets him fails to remember: a sound - part hyena, part Mike Myers's Dr Evil - that erupts at the oddest of times, preceding him down corridors, derailing your train of thought. </p> <p>Most people were expecting blood on the carpet. For last Friday was one of the oddest days to hear Bezos's trademark guffaw, and the first time Amazon might justifiably have cancelled the staff shindig - probably the worst day in the history of the internet retailer that had become the shining success story of electronic commerce. The day had cost Bezos personally around a billion dollars. It began with a report from Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, warning that the company was haemorrhaging cash and might not survive. Analyst Ravi Suria highlighted Amazon's \"weak balance sheet, poor working capital management, and massive negative operating cashflow - the financial characteristics that have driven innumerable retailers to disaster through history.\" It was a day during which Amazon's shares lost 20% of their value, and 51m of them changed hands. A company worth about $40bn (\u00a325bn) just before Christmas had ended the day worth $12bn (\u00a37.5bn), and things did not improve during trading yesterday. </p> <p>Amid such dire warnings, few people expect the bunting to come out on July 15, the fifth anniversary of the company's launch. Except, perhaps, Bezos himself. The energetic 36-year-old takes an attitude to losing $1bn (\u00a3625m) in one day that is, to say the least, long term. </p> <p>\"Three years ago our stock was $1.50 a share, today it's $30-something. There have been many, many days when our stock has gone up 20% in a day\" - that laugh again - \"and if stocks can go up 20% in a day, they can go down 20% in a day. All internet stocks are volatile, including Amazon.com... we are nowhere near running out of cash, and we are not at all worried about it.\" (\"He is always like this,\" says Bezos's assistant, Lizzie Allen. \"Always optimistic.\") </p> <p>Amazon, taken to court two years ago for claiming to be the earth's biggest retailer, has unquestionably become one of its best-known brands. A company that started as an online bookseller has assiduously purchased the rising stars of e-commerce, and now offers music, videos, kitchenware, garden tools, DIY equipment and more. But even with his firm's vast product range and expanding customer base - 1.4m people in the UK alone - Bezos's optimism is beginning to look increasingly isolated. Despite the company's vigorous expansion and development, including proposed same-day delivery in some British city centres soon, the year that Amazon is expected finally to haul itself into the black grows ever more distant. Famed Wall Street analyst, Mary Meeker, predicts losses of $96m (\u00a360m) this quarter and $83m (\u00a351.8m) next, and the firm sacked 150 people in January, its first redundancies. This is a crunch time, and not just for Amazon: many dot.com stocks are already in freefall, and if the industry megalith hits trouble, many others will surely follow. The fate of a lot of paper fortunes will turn on what happens to Bezos next. </p> <p>Until the beginning of this year, the Amazon story had almost seemed too good to be true. The deification of Bezos - America's second-richest man under 40, with an estimated net worth of $4bn (\u00a32.5m) prior to last Friday - reached its high point at the end of 1999, when the Princeton graduate and self-confessed geek was selected as Time magazine's person of the year, an award previously given to Martin Luther King and the Queen. Bezos, to his credit, downplays the hero-worship. \"Sometimes I think Time magazine chooses somebody and really chooses that person, and sometimes I think it is really choosing somebody as a symbol for something much bigger,\" he says, \"and I would claim that's what it was in my case. They were not choosing me as much as they were choosing the internet and me as a symbol of e-commerce.\" </p> <p>Amazon has certainly symbolised the radical - many would say foolhardy - techniques of business development that have come to rule cyberspace. Its strategy of putting market share ahead of profits and taking on established offline players has entered the business lexicon: today, people use \"being Amazoned\" to refer to the fate of a company that is about to lose out to a younger, nimbler rival. Bezos's obsession with his company is key to the success of this approach: \"I know a lot about e-commerce,\" he says, \"but it's because I think about it all the time. I'm constantly thinking about Amazon.com, e-commerce and the internet. It's in my every waking moment and most of my sleeping ones.\" Bezos dismisses criticism of the notion of investment in future business to the exclusion of present-day profits. \"The internet truly is a big deal so it hasn't been over-hyped in that sense,\" he says. \"It will probably be a bigger deal than anyone realises. Long term, there is an irrational under-exuberance.\" </p> <p>It all began for Bezos when he was working as a technical expert for DE Shaw, a Manhattan hedge fund. His wake-up call, as he describes it, occurred when he read that use of the web was growing at a remarkable 2,000% a year. Within a few months, he had packed in his day job and left New York with his wife, MacKenzie, and their dog. His adoptive father, a Cuban native who married Jeff's mother when he was four, gave him a car and invested a total of $300,000 of his retirement money in the new venture. Jeff and MacKenzie, a writer, drove the car for five days across the country to Seattle, spending their first night at a motel and the second camping beside the Grand Canyon. He typed a business plan while his wife drove. \"I knew it wasn't likely to work,\" he says, when asked if he ever doubted the wisdom of his venture. \"The doubts are when you think it might work.\" And he laughs uproariously again. </p> <p>When Bezos talks about the early days - when he worked out of the converted garage of his new home with the company's first two employees - he sounds supremely happy. He once described his decision to give up a well-paid day job to start something which could easily have failed as part of the \"regret minimisation framework\". He did not want to look back and regret taking the easy way out. \"Most regrets are acts of omission, not commission,\" he says. \"Right now, I am very happy. I know that I will have absolutely no regrets about being focused on Amazon.com.\" </p> <p> Much of this early down- home atmosphere remains at Amazon's shabby Seattle offices. The Friday parties are just one aspect of this; to save on overpriced office furniture, the standard company desk still consists of a pine door, purchased from a DIY store and propped up on four pieces of timber. As in many other internet firms, employees are partly remunerated in company stock, giving them something of Bezos's sense of ownership - or, according to a more pessimistic reading, buying them off with paper money that, on a day like last Friday, can begin to look decidedly like Monopoly cash. </p> <p>But Amazon's finances have also raised eyebrows in far more fundamental ways. The company insists that the money flowing into it is being invested in its infrastructure. But US newspaper investigations reveal that the company is carrying more than $2.1bn of junk-bonds debts, supported by only $25.6m (\u00a316m) of equity - and that around 20% of the company's assets consist of balance-sheet \"goodwill\", sums that emerge when a company acquires another company for more than it is worth, writing off the difference against earnings. Far from being ploughed back into the business, critics point out, hundreds of millions of dollars of income is being used simply to service the company's enormous debts, frittering away an average of $10m (\u00a36.25) each month. And margins don't look like improving: any company, given an adequate marketing budget, can set up as a putative rival to Amazon simply by undercutting its prices. Such rivals make huge losses in the process, but given that huge losses are something of a status symbol in the online economy, this isn't necessarily an insurmountable obstacle. </p> <p>Time magazine describes Bezos as a visionary, a man who saw the future five years before the rest of us did. So great is his reputation that one analyst warned me not to waste our interview asking him about finances because \"he has so much else to offer\". Bezos is keen to exploit this reputation to keep his investors on side and focused on the future. \"What you see today and what you think of as e-commerce is so primitive,\" he says. \"Computers are not always on; people don't even have them in their kitchen or bedroom.\" He cheerfully imagines a day when the ubiquity of computers means that we will be ordering everything we need, not just books, or CDs, or pets, from Amazon. </p> <p>In the interim, Bezos insists the company has no plans to fire any more people to cut costs this year. It may slow down its rate of acquisitions, he says, because it finds little of interest in the etailers that are in dire straits. \"In most cases, unfortunately, we're not interested because it's a question of what would we be getting. We have great technology and a great brand name.\" But amid the confidence and laughter, Bezos sounds an almost unwitting note of warning. Talking of how he never expected to really make a go of Amazon.com in those early years as he drove across America, he says: \"Most start-up companies do fail, but most fail slowly. It takes six or seven years for them to fail, usually.\" As Amazon's fifth anniversary rolls around, Bezos may be wishing he hadn't said that.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.Amazon.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Amazon.com</a> </p> <p>Additional reporting by Oliver Burkeman</p>",

And Kournikova seems to positively revel in all the attention. </p> <p>So perhaps this is what the England women's cricket team needs. There has never been a female cricketing pin-up.

As a result, she was said to have been shunned by her peers and soon found herself out of the side.</p> <p>You can understand her team-mates' frustration. Why should a female cricketer have to take her clothes off to make the headlines? The Australian team were great, but only when one of them posed naked did they gain international headlines. </p> <p>Should sportswomen, and men, be judged on their looks? Of course not. But, as all that research showing that babies respond more positively to a conventionally beautiful face than an ugly one proves, the human race is aesthetically driven.

Senior officials are trying to put the blame on a UN press officer for the popular scorn directed at their operation. UN sources say the secretary general, Kofi Annan, is seeking to remove Major-General Vijay Jetley to try to restore credibility after hundreds of UN troops surrendered to rebels in recent weeks. They handed over quantities of weapons, including armoured cars, which were subsequently used to attack government forces. New York is also concerned that Gen Jetley is allowing UN policy in Sierra Leone to be held hostage to the fate of 21 Indian peacekeepers in rebel captivity, similar to the earlier abductions that paralysed the UN in Freetown, the capital. Sierra Leone's press ridicules the peacekeepers as cowards and questions what use they are. A popular column in one daily, For Di People, satirises Gen Jetley as General Tetley and his men as grazing water buffalo oblivious to what is going on around them. The UN secretary general's special representative in Freetown, Oluyemi Adeniji, called a press conference last week to denounce the local press coverage. The move backfired when Mr Adeniji described the UN as the \"victim\" of the conflict in Sierra Leone and said it lacked the power to protect the people. This instantly raised the question of why the UN force was there. Mr Adeniji is also at the forefront of a controversial attempt to defend his and Gen Jetley's leadership: a confidential report to UN headquarters in New York blames a press officer for the loss of faith in the UN among local people. The accusation stems from a dramatic incident in early May when Phillip Winslow, then spokesman for the UN mission in Freetown, announced that two large columns of rebel fighters were bearing down on the capital.

      "body": "<p>British films, it seems, are like British actresses of the Catherine Zeta Jones variety: they have to do well in the US before they're fully appreciated back home. The latest evidence? The most homespun of movies, Chicken Run, has already been released in the US to a massive $17.5m opening weekend take - a full week before British cinema-goers get to see it. Produced by the Aardman studio in Bristol - which, in Wallace and Gromit, has already invented national icons as comforting as tea cosies and woolly mufflers - Chicken Run taps into a similar vein of misty eyed nostalgia, being a sort of barnyard version of The Great Escape. </p> <p>Chicken Run, you might have imagined, is the perfect movie for Britain's increasingly beleaguered film industry to crow about. Especially as it comes hard on the heels of U-571, the submarine movie that is a particularly outrageous example of Hollywood rewriting history. Hackles will no doubt be rising among the overly patriotic - first they nick our espionage exploits, now they're nicking our lovable cartoon animals. </p> <p>But the decision to prioritise Chicken Run's US box-office run is determined by one simple factor: it is not really British at all. Like the large majority of the films by which mainstream British cinema defines itself, Chicken Run is bought and paid for by a foreign company. In Chicken Run's case, it is DreamWorks SKG, the US studio operated by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, which put up the $42m funding. It joins a long list that includes The Full Monty, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Shakespeare in Love and The English Patient. And every one of these films was released in the US before Britain. </p> <p>There's no doubt that, for all these movies, their success at the US box office had a significant impact on their reception in the UK. Four Weddings, especially, a landmark success in that pre-lottery era before British cinema's insane self-delusion set in, owed plenty to its US success in whipping up enthusiasm back in the UK. The Full Monty, conversely, dribbled around America like an old-fashioned sleeper hit, while clocking up astonishing business over here. In recent months, the pattern has changed somewhat, with Elizabeth and Notting Hill (both funded by the US studio Universal, through its deal with the British company Working Title) nudging their way into Britain's cinemas before America's. And two genuinely homegrown hits, Trainspotting and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, did impressive business in the UK many months before opening in America - to largely indifferent figures. </p> <p>But the issues surrounding our national cinema remain the subject of fierce and near-permanent debate. Lots of people have pointed out that since so many films are international co-productions, it hardly matters where most of them actually come from any more. That British films won't, or can't, be launched on to British audiences is part of a wider problem, and one that is actually much more important to legions of increasingly antsy UK film audiences. Britain is still so low down the list of international release territories that, in cinema terms, it is some sort of smalltime backwater. Every major release of the summer will be released in the US first - but what's extra galling is that a film like Mission: Impossible 2 will be released in some 30 countries - including Australia, Israel, Colombia, Turkey, New Zealand, Mexico and South Africa - before the UK. </p> <p>The old explanation used to be that we in this country had to make do with film prints recycled from a film's original US release, but that clearly doesn't apply to other English-speaking territories. In these days of internet-fuelled globalisation, when anyone with a modem can have instant access to every rumour of a project's production from pitch session to colour grading, Britain's lowly status has become more evident than ever. </p> <p>In the old days, movies used to be sold piecemeal across the globe, thereby contributing to a patchy, random release pattern. That system, to some extent, is still in use, largely at the small-money, independent end of the market. The big movies, the event releases, have long since been absorbed into mighty international corporations, with their own distribution offices in every principal territory, with the clear directive to co-ordinate release strategy on a global scale. The rough rule of thumb, incidentally, is that the US box-office takings will equal the rest of the world combined, so the primacy of the US audience is understandable and obvious. </p> <p>The big movies, too, are vehicles for whole chunks of ancillary income - merchandising, soundtracks, novelisations, websites, etc - lending more point than ever to the convergence of marketing, and the associated businesses that take care of these individual aspects. Hence the importance of a successful opening weekend, and the increasing amount of prints made up for a film's first appearance. A large chunk of Mission: Impossible 2's budget went into the 3,653 prints that ensured its monstrous $70m opening-weekend receipts. (Compare Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace which opened on 2,970 screens for $64m.) </p> <p>Complaining about the activities of such behemoth organisations is about as pointless as it gets: Britain isn't even the biggest market in Europe (we're third, after France and Germany). The marketing planners for the big movies are looking for a steamroller effect, spreading outwards from the US west coast. This delay actually suits the UK distributors just fine, as the US box office acts as a litmus test for their own product. Film distribution everywhere is a high-risk activity, and getting higher risk all the time as budget cost soar. If Titanic had gone the way of, say, Mission to Mars, it's possible that both 20th Century Fox and Paramount might no longer exist. It's an unarguable fact that there's no automatic equation between a film's quality and its box office, and that marketing campaigns simply reflect conventional wisdom about a film's monetary worth. Who would have predicted that American Beauty would do $130m in the US? Or John Travolta's Battlefield Earth, make barely $20m - on 3,000 screens. </p> <p>If the situation is difficult for the big-money films, then it's positively horrific for the small-but-good sector. Britain has just got hold of Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown - but he has already finished another one, Small Time Crooks, which has already been released in the US. They've lapped us. In distributor's language, Allen has a \"temperate\" audience, which means it is unaffected by any kind of marketing hysteria: it is small but guaranteed, so there is no incentive to change it. </p> <p>The only time it has deviated from this laggard schedule was when the life-imitates-art Husbands and Wives was released to capitalise on Allen's relationship difficulties - even though an earlier film, Shadows and Fog, was still unreleased. In truth, Britain's market for non-mainstream cinema is so small that independent distributors can rarely afford the prices demanded by films that have done well at the Sundance festival or wherever, and have to play a waiting game to get the price down. The delays and manoeuvres surrounding Kevin Smith's unexpectedly profitable (in the US) Miramax hit, Chasing Amy, meant that for a while it looked like it might not make it Britain at all. One Sundance winner, a film called Sunday starring David \"Poirot\" Suchet, never did. </p> <p>In the end, it's the consumer that suffers. But while Britain remains - relatively speaking - largely uninterested in the movies, it's unlikely that the situation will change. The recent enthusiasm for UK-made films has given distributors confidence in the product; unfortunately, that enthusiasm has often proved to be sadly misplaced. Meanwhile, if you're going to Jakarta tomorrow, don't forget to pick up that Mission: Impossible 2 ticket when you get there.</p>",

That British films won't, or can't, be launched on to British audiences is part of a wider problem, and one that is actually much more important to legions of increasingly antsy UK film audiences. Britain is still so low down the list of international release territories that, in cinema terms, it is some sort of smalltime backwater. Every major release of the summer will be released in the US first - but what's extra galling is that a film like Mission: Impossible 2 will be released in some 30 countries - including Australia, Israel, Colombia, Turkey, New Zealand, Mexico and South Africa - before the UK. The old explanation used to be that we in this country had to make do with film prints recycled from a film's original US release, but that clearly doesn't apply to other English-speaking territories. In these days of internet-fuelled globalisation, when anyone with a modem can have instant access to every rumour of a project's production from pitch session to colour grading, Britain's lowly status has become more evident than ever. In the old days, movies used to be sold piecemeal across the globe, thereby contributing to a patchy, random release pattern. That system, to some extent, is still in use, largely at the small-money, independent end of the market. The big movies, the event releases, have long since been absorbed into mighty international corporations, with their own distribution offices in every principal territory, with the clear directive to co-ordinate release strategy on a global scale. The rough rule of thumb, incidentally, is that the US box-office takings will equal the rest of the world combined, so the primacy of the US audience is understandable and obvious. The big movies, too, are vehicles for whole chunks of ancillary income - merchandising, soundtracks, novelisations, websites, etc - lending more point than ever to the convergence of marketing, and the associated businesses that take care of these individual aspects. Hence the importance of a successful opening weekend, and the increasing amount of prints made up for a film's first appearance. A large chunk of Mission: Impossible 2's budget went into the 3,653 prints that ensured its monstrous $70m opening-weekend receipts. (Compare Star Wars Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace which opened on 2,970 screens for $64m.) Complaining about the activities of such behemoth organisations is about as pointless as it gets: Britain isn't even the biggest market in Europe (we're third, after France and Germany). The marketing planners for the big movies are looking for a steamroller effect, spreading outwards from the US west coast. This delay actually suits the UK distributors just fine, as the US box office acts as a litmus test for their own product. Film distribution everywhere is a high-risk activity, and getting higher risk all the time as budget cost soar. If Titanic had gone the way of, say, Mission to Mars, it's possible that both 20th Century Fox and Paramount might no longer exist. It's an unarguable fact that there's no automatic equation between a film's quality and its box office, and that marketing campaigns simply reflect conventional wisdom about a film's monetary worth. Who would have predicted that American Beauty would do $130m in the US? Or John Travolta's Battlefield Earth, make barely $20m - on 3,000 screens. If the situation is difficult for the big-money films, then it's positively horrific for the small-but-good sector. Britain has just got hold of Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown - but he has already finished another one, Small Time Crooks, which has already been released in the US. They've lapped us. In distributor's language, Allen has a \"temperate\" audience, which means it is unaffected by any kind of marketing hysteria: it is small but guaranteed, so there is no incentive to change it. The only time it has deviated from this laggard schedule was when the life-imitates-art Husbands and Wives was released to capitalise on Allen's relationship difficulties - even though an earlier film, Shadows and Fog, was still unreleased. In truth, Britain's market for non-mainstream cinema is so small that independent distributors can rarely afford the prices demanded by films that have done well at the Sundance festival or wherever, and have to play a waiting game to get the price down. The delays and manoeuvres surrounding Kevin Smith's unexpectedly profitable (in the US) Miramax hit, Chasing Amy, meant that for a while it looked like it might not make it Britain at all. One Sundance winner, a film called Sunday starring David \"Poirot\" Suchet, never did. In the end, it's the consumer that suffers. But while Britain remains - relatively speaking - largely uninterested in the movies, it's unlikely that the situation will change. The recent enthusiasm for UK-made films has given distributors confidence in the product; unfortunately, that enthusiasm has often proved to be sadly misplaced. Meanwhile, if you're going to Jakarta tomorrow, don't forget to pick up that Mission: Impossible 2 ticket when you get there.",

      "body": "<b> Week 30</b> <p>Start antenatal classes. It says so in the NHS pregnancy book. If only it were that easy. Yoga is fully booked. \"Too many births this month. It's because of the eclipse,\" says the voice at the other end. The eclipse? \"We're suffering the knock-on effects,\" she says, solemnly. I decide not to enquire further. After all, I'm already booked into National Childbirth Trust classes. My midwife beat the rush for these by signing me up in week 10. \"You won't be wanting the hospital ones,\" she said, glancing round at my stack of pregnancy books, my copy of the Guardian, my organic veg box. </p> <p>Actually, I wasn't completely enthusiastic about the NCT. Every mother I know went to classes, mostly to make babysitting contacts, and I've heard a few horror stories about terrifying videos, or being reprimanded for falling off your bucket during squatting exercises, or threatened with expulsion for not taking cheek-stretching for men (to simulate birth pangs, you understand) with the proper gravity. </p> <p>And more serious stuff, too. The NCT still has its political side. I've heard of classes that began with the teacher saying: \"A quarter of you will have a caesarean and I want you to know you are giving your child a very, very bad start in life.\" I know women who took the whole drug-free message very seriously, then felt terrible failures when they gave in to medical help, or who put off an epidural until the last minute and then tore themselves up pushing the baby out because they couldn't feel anything, or who insisted on natural deliveries for heavy breech babies and ended up exhausted, with a caesarean and a bashed-up pelvic floor. </p> <p>In my local Oxfam, I even found an original copy of the book that started the whole movement off : Sheila Kitzinger's The Experience of Childbirth (1971), which famously pictures the author laughing as she gives birth to twins. We may think she has been blessed with a wide pelvis and particularly stretchy insides: the book instead has much to say about your inner psychosexual drama and definitely implies that the inability to give birth without drugs results from Freudian causes. </p> <p>On the other hand, it is from a different age. The Experience of Childbirth assumes that many \"girls\" giving birth were virgin brides, that they were not working, that, gloriously, their local council would send a cleaner round for a fortnight after a home birth. And, in that different age, the book and the NCT fought the good fight: against over-medicalised, paternalistic childbirth, against enemas, shaving, pethidine, paralysing painkillers, forceps, routine episiotomies and against all births happening uphill, in bed, with your feet in stirrups. I'm grateful for all this, but it does seem that, in my hospital at least, the battle has been won. There's a birthing pool, aromatherapy, beanbags and birth so active, you practically jog till you drop. </p> <p>I arrive at my first NCT class, in short, suspicious and ready to strop. But our teacher turns out to be calm, knowledgeable and entirely disarming. She begins by telling us that she will show no videos and recommend no birth plans. She quotes from the Lancet rather than Sheila Kitzinger and offers enticing information about both acupuncture and the particularly skilled, light epidurals now available. There are no buckets anywhere in sight. </p> <p>The class, many of whom came in with the same suspicious expressions as mine, relax. We even smile and start offering up our own experiences. The men, who arrived obviously terrified of being made to bond, address the odd remark to one another about technical matter such as TENS machines. </p> <p>Our teacher gets down to the nitty-gritty: how to cope with NHS maternity wards - these have, because of cuts, deteriorated beyond recognition since 1971 - and how to get out of them quickly. Also, which were the 50 most popular children's names last year. We all spring on these over tea, murmuring: \"No, we can't go for Samuel, it's as common as Joshua\" and we carefully do not betray our chosen names to the other couples in case we start a trend. It's all so sensible, I begin to wonder if it can be the NCT at all. </p> <p>But we have an interruption. One of the class wants to give birth live on the internet. She is wondering how she can best get the phone link and camera into the delivery room. I'm thrilled. Perhaps we are still on the cutting edge of childbirth practice after all. We chip in our own suggestions. Our teacher warns us that the hospital may be crowded. \"Oh yes,\" we all agree. \"Very. Because of the eclipse.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Week 30 Start antenatal classes. It says so in the NHS pregnancy book. If only it were that easy. Yoga is fully booked. \"Too many births this month. It's because of the eclipse,\" says the voice at the other end. The eclipse? \"We're suffering the knock-on effects,\" she says, solemnly. I decide not to enquire further. After all, I'm already booked into National Childbirth Trust classes. My midwife beat the rush for these by signing me up in week 10. \"You won't be wanting the hospital ones,\" she said, glancing round at my stack of pregnancy books, my copy of the Guardian, my organic veg box. Actually, I wasn't completely enthusiastic about the NCT. Every mother I know went to classes, mostly to make babysitting contacts, and I've heard a few horror stories about terrifying videos, or being reprimanded for falling off your bucket during squatting exercises, or threatened with expulsion for not taking cheek-stretching for men (to simulate birth pangs, you understand) with the proper gravity. And more serious stuff, too. The NCT still has its political side. I've heard of classes that began with the teacher saying: \"A quarter of you will have a caesarean and I want you to know you are giving your child a very, very bad start in life.\" I know women who took the whole drug-free message very seriously, then felt terrible failures when they gave in to medical help, or who put off an epidural until the last minute and then tore themselves up pushing the baby out because they couldn't feel anything, or who insisted on natural deliveries for heavy breech babies and ended up exhausted, with a caesarean and a bashed-up pelvic floor. In my local Oxfam, I even found an original copy of the book that started the whole movement off : Sheila Kitzinger's The Experience of Childbirth (1971), which famously pictures the author laughing as she gives birth to twins. We may think she has been blessed with a wide pelvis and particularly stretchy insides: the book instead has much to say about your inner psychosexual drama and definitely implies that the inability to give birth without drugs results from Freudian causes. On the other hand, it is from a different age. The Experience of Childbirth assumes that many \"girls\" giving birth were virgin brides, that they were not working, that, gloriously, their local council would send a cleaner round for a fortnight after a home birth. And, in that different age, the book and the NCT fought the good fight: against over-medicalised, paternalistic childbirth, against enemas, shaving, pethidine, paralysing painkillers, forceps, routine episiotomies and against all births happening uphill, in bed, with your feet in stirrups. I'm grateful for all this, but it does seem that, in my hospital at least, the battle has been won. There's a birthing pool, aromatherapy, beanbags and birth so active, you practically jog till you drop. I arrive at my first NCT class, in short, suspicious and ready to strop. But our teacher turns out to be calm, knowledgeable and entirely disarming. She begins by telling us that she will show no videos and recommend no birth plans. She quotes from the Lancet rather than Sheila Kitzinger and offers enticing information about both acupuncture and the particularly skilled, light epidurals now available. There are no buckets anywhere in sight. The class, many of whom came in with the same suspicious expressions as mine, relax. We even smile and start offering up our own experiences. The men, who arrived obviously terrified of being made to bond, address the odd remark to one another about technical matter such as TENS machines. Our teacher gets down to the nitty-gritty: how to cope with NHS maternity wards - these have, because of cuts, deteriorated beyond recognition since 1971 - and how to get out of them quickly. Also, which were the 50 most popular children's names last year. We all spring on these over tea, murmuring: \"No, we can't go for Samuel, it's as common as Joshua\" and we carefully do not betray our chosen names to the other couples in case we start a trend. It's all so sensible, I begin to wonder if it can be the NCT at all. But we have an interruption. One of the class wants to give birth live on the internet. She is wondering how she can best get the phone link and camera into the delivery room. I'm thrilled. Perhaps we are still on the cutting edge of childbirth practice after all. We chip in our own suggestions. Our teacher warns us that the hospital may be crowded. \"Oh yes,\" we all agree. \"Very. Because of the eclipse.\"",

As MPs on both sides of the Commons privately debated Lord Levy's \u00a35,000 tax bill on a strikingly low 1999 income - for a millionaire - of \u00a320,000, Downing Street sought to deflect public concern towards the privacy implications behind the Sunday Times' possession of the peer's tax return. But the Tory opposition smelled blood and pressed home with its double-headed campaign to discover more about both Lord Levy's financial and diplomatic status as Tony Blair's personal envoy to the Middle East. After the ruling at the weekend by Mr Justice Toulson that Lord Levy's status as a public figure associated with a party actively hostile to tax avoidance made him a legitimate object of press inquiry, MPs are braced for more tit-for-tat disclosures. Downing Street - which was happy to see the tax exile status of the Tory party treasurer, Lord Ashcroft, exposed to public criticism - took the view that \"people's tax affairs are a matter for them and the question here is how information which has appeared in a newspaper got there\". Labour MPs were also keen to point out that News Corp, the Murdoch-owned parent company of the Sunday Times, is famous for its tax-efficient practices which minimise tax liabilities around the world. However the shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, and aides to the Tory leader, William Hague, hammered home unanswered questions about Lord Levy. The music impressario who made a fortune after modest beginnings has insisted that his 1999 tax bill was low because he had been living off capital on which no tax was liable - and had done so for a single year after 30 years of paying up to \u00a3250,000 in tax each year. The Tories took that figure as a baseline from which to infer that Lord Levy needed \u00a31m of income a year to sustain his lifestyle. They aimed to goad the Labour peer into explaining in more detail his allegedly sophisticated tax planning arrangements. Lord Levy, who raised up to \u00a37m for Labour before the 1997 general election, insists that he has never engaged in the lawful tax-avoidance schemes favoured by the rich, let alone illegal tax evasion which is also widespread. Yesterday Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, also weighed in to defend Lord Levy and the role he had played in \"increasing British representation and influence\" in the Middle East.

Mr Cook's remarks about his \"key crucial role in getting the [peace process] talks going\" was in marked contradiction to Mr Blair's claims in the past that he was \"nothing more than a glorified messenger\".

They all are full of praise for the way he has increased British representation in these areas. \"I can also tell you that in a big key role to the peace process, he played a key crucial role in getting the talks going. He has done a good job and I think he will certainly continue to do that.\" Downing Street also continued yesterday to insist that Lord Levy enjoyed Tony Blair's full backing. A spokesman for the prime minister said: \"Lord Levy has paid tax. He has paid significant amounts of tax. What he has done in the year in question is live off the capital on which he has paid tax. \"The prime minister continues to have a high regard for Lord Levy.\"",

He was giving evidence on the opening day of an inquiry launched by Lord Neill, chairman of the committee on standards in public life. The inquiry is examining whether to tighten up the present Lords register of interests; limit the scope of lobbying and consultancies, including whether to outlaw paid advocacy by peers; and introduce a new code of conduct for peers. Lord Owen said: \"Quite simply, if someone who holds the directorship of a major lobbying company is approached to sit in the Lords, they should be told that perhaps they should no longer hold that post.\" He favoured a mandatory declaration of peers' business interests and the registering of single consultancies. But he was against setting up a Lords equivalent of Elizabeth Filkin, parliamentary commissioner for standards, to enforce the new register or investigate suspect cases, and did not see why peers should have to register all their paid trips, as MPs have to. Lord Owen, who sits as a crossbench peer, also backed the judge's decision that the Sunday Times was right to be able to publish details of the tax affairs of Lord Levy, Labour fundraiser.

      "bodyText": "The European Commission yesterday unveiled a record aid package worth almost \u00a33bn for Britain's poorest regions after a protracted negotiation which forced Tony Blair's government to parade its relative poverty. Announcing final approval of the package, officials in Brussels said that the money - to be shared between Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Wales and the Valleys and Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly - should generate tens of thousands of new jobs and pay to train new skills. But hard negotiation is far from over as the regions scramble to force Whitehall to provide the necessary matching funds, partly private, partly public, which EU rules require. The Treasury has already been accused of diverting away existing funds - one reason for the coup that ended Alun Michael's rule at the Welsh assembly - and ministries are hard pressed to find the kind of industry orientated project Brussels wants. According to commission projections, by 2010 the cash (provided under the \"objective one\" category) should generate 154,000 jobs and provide training for 420,000 people out of a total beneficiary population of 5m. But it is also an admission of failure. Despite repeatedly insisting that the UK economic model is right for Europe Mr Blair has had to admit that Britain is now 12th wealthiest member state in terms of GDP per head. With 8.9% of yesterday's EU-wide package it has the largest share and, together with Finland, is the only state to have aid to its poorest regions increased in the current round, rather than cut or maintained at previous levels. Coincidentally yesterday, a Labour leader from one of the poorer regions, Alan Donnelly, the north-east based leader of Britain's Labour MEPs until he quit in December, accused Gordon Brown of wanting to stifle debate on an issue of vital importance to the regions - UK membership of the single currency zone. Launching the US academic study which predicts 20% faster growth over 20 years inside the zone the Blairite Mr Donnelly joined fellow north east MPs, Peter Mandelson, Nick Brown and Stephen Byers, in saying that the promised referendum might be lost if the pro-euro case is not made now. The EU aid package was agreed at last summer's Berlin summit, which set spending plans until 2006. But yesterday's statement gives the green light for strategic targets and priorities. Actual projects are to be agreed locally later. The four objective one areas have been designated highest priority where development is lagging behind and per capita wealth is less than 75% of the EU average. South Yorkshire gets \u00a3700m to \"arrest the decline of the region\". The money will be used to steer the regional economy away from dependence on traditional sectors and focus on small and medium enterprises and information technology - a general EU preoccupation. Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly have the lowest average income of Britain's objective one areas and won its new status only after being separated from richer Devon. It will receive \u00a3300m \"to address the continuing weaknesses of a predominantly rural and tourist economy such as low wages, seasonal employment and a peripheral location\". West Wales and the Valleys get over \u00a31.1bn to tackle \"a great diversity of industrial, rural and social problems\". Merseyside gets more than \u00a3800m to continue the fight against high unemployment, a skills shortage and major industrial decline, especially of port-related activities.",

Europe issued a moral statement, and Austria was duly punished. But the policy has become self-defeating. It wasn't wrong, but it is no longer right. Now the EU probably has only until the end of this week to change it. A policy that once expressed broad European ideals urgently needs rescuing from the grip of narrow national politics. British liberals need to face the implications.</p> <p>The man who first set ostracism rolling was Austria's own head of state, President Thomas Klestil. Fearing he might be pressed to accept a new coalition including the neo-fascist Freedom party led by J\u00f6rg Haider, he privately encouraged other EU countries to send out warning signals. They agreed to do so. Austria, they said, would face sanctions if this happened. But it did happen. The threat did not work. At the political level, Austria has been ostracised for five months. When the foreign minister came to London the other day, the only public figure who would receive her was, fatally, Margaret Thatcher.</p> <p>The EU action wasn't deeply considered. National leaders were more engaged that foreign ministries, and the commission had no say. The gesture was abrupt and rather grand. Haider's party has a shocking record of Holocaust denial, immigrant-bashing and related Hitlerite taints. Its involvement as junior partner in the coalition cast the first shadow over the mutual trust and common values that have governed the EU for 40 years. Led by France and Belgium, which have kept their own burgeoning fascist parties out of government, the union agreed to assert the limits of tolerable political extremism.</p> <p>The message was to Austria, but also to aspirant members of the EU, especially those in the second tier such as Romania and Bulgaria with little democratic tradition. It was meant to lay down the standards of decency the EU would defend. Austria, to some extent, heard the message. Haider, of course, despised it. But before being sworn in, the new government averred more strongly than any predecessor Austrian complicity in Nazi crimes.</p> <p>It has since done nothing, as a government, to advance the worst of the Freedom party's baleful programme. It has not acted against minority rights, nor undermined democracy. Haider, albeit with subversive intent, has left the party leadership. The EU case against Austria remains, uncomfortably, in the realm of theory rather than practice.</p> <p>Like many acts deriving from political lunge more than diplomatic calculation, modes of exit from this one were not thought out. Now that exit seems necessary, it faces big obstacles. Though more an irritant than a scourge, the sanctions are building punitive consequences, all in the wrong places.</p> <p>In several EU countries, they're beginning to be seen as a threat to national political integrity. Tolerable, even admirable, as a temporary measure, they're growing into what looks like an indefinite assault on a country where 27% of voters, after all, did vote for J\u00f6rg Haider. Denmark, in particular, registers alarm at such an override of democracy. Even though \"Brussels\" had nothing to do with this, the Danish referendum on the euro could be determined by nightmare images of EU impositions on the democratic will, if the Austrians aren't restored to normality before September.</p> <p>From Austria itself, the effects could spread deep and wide. A plebiscite on sanctions is promised there, also in September. Though Haider's support hasn't grown much, indignation at the sanctions has. This is certain to excite more anti-EU feeling, producing a vote that asserts Austria's determination not to be bossed around. Haider's anti-immigrant rhetoric will become more not less resonant. Opposition to enlargement, by far the most important item on the EU agenda, will intensify and, since this requires a unanimous vote, could drive Austria, backed by a popular mandate, to block it altogether.</p> <p>Most players in the EU game now seem to understand this. Even those once most outraged by the Haider party's presence in government privately admit that sanctions ought to end. Austria, they say, mustn't be let off the hook, and must still be watched. But this can't go on indefinitely. She must be given the prospect of remission for good behaviour. Tony Blair takes this line. The question is: can the collective talents of 14 countries' diplomacy be mobilised in time to stop a spiralling diplomatic calamity? Or will a piece of genuine supra-national idealism be destroyed, ironically, by national politics?</p> <p>The key culprit here is the key originator: France. Which is where Portugal comes in. Next week France takes over from Portugal as president of the EU. For France the original desire not to encourage its own National Front vote - the objective was fair enough - has shifted into rivalry between President Chirac and prime minister Jospin as to which can outdo the other in proven dedication to the anti-fascist cause. The presidential election approaches. More immediately there are municipal elections, in which Chirac fears the National Front. It's commonly reckoned that, once France takes over the EU, the portcullis will come down against any Austrian deal, and may stay down during the next two presidencies, first Sweden then Belgium, both in the van of the anti-Austria campaign.</p> <p>Much rests, therefore, on the dying days of the Portuguese presidency. Portugal, it must be said, has not done well so far. Nor have the Austrians, with their propensity to blab about any private diplomacy that might be going on. But now the end game looms, and everybody knows it. A deal just might be done, whereby Austria achieves a suspension of sanctions, conditional on accepting a few months' invigilation of her conduct. She may have to promise to take part in EU anti-racist campaigns, which she hasn't yet done. Another idea is for more explicit anti-Nazi history teaching in schools. Exactly who would make the analysis of Austria's behaviour, and how long the transition would last, are sensitive questions. But it seems exceedingly important that Antonio Guterres, the Portuguese prime minister, gives what remains of his energy to pushing hard on both Paris and Vienna before Friday.</p> <p>Austria is a hard case. Hella Pick, in her penetrating new study Guilty Victim: Austria from the Holocaust to Haider (IB Tauris, \u00a324.50), says that Haider's very presence in politics casts doubt on the country's efforts over the last decade to portray itself as a mature democracy. But the EU has done as much as it practically can to lay its demands on the line. Indefinite sanctions, unremissible by any corrective action except the improbable de-election of the Freedom party, only make the problem worse. The best way to stop Haiderism is to end a punishment that has had its day.</p>",

Its involvement as junior partner in the coalition cast the first shadow over the mutual trust and common values that have governed the EU for 40 years. Led by France and Belgium, which have kept their own burgeoning fascist parties out of government, the union agreed to assert the limits of tolerable political extremism. The message was to Austria, but also to aspirant members of the EU, especially those in the second tier such as Romania and Bulgaria with little democratic tradition. It was meant to lay down the standards of decency the EU would defend. Austria, to some extent, heard the message. Haider, of course, despised it. But before being sworn in, the new government averred more strongly than any predecessor Austrian complicity in Nazi crimes. It has since done nothing, as a government, to advance the worst of the Freedom party's baleful programme. It has not acted against minority rights, nor undermined democracy. Haider, albeit with subversive intent, has left the party leadership. The EU case against Austria remains, uncomfortably, in the realm of theory rather than practice. Like many acts deriving from political lunge more than diplomatic calculation, modes of exit from this one were not thought out. Now that exit seems necessary, it faces big obstacles. Though more an irritant than a scourge, the sanctions are building punitive consequences, all in the wrong places. In several EU countries, they're beginning to be seen as a threat to national political integrity. Tolerable, even admirable, as a temporary measure, they're growing into what looks like an indefinite assault on a country where 27% of voters, after all, did vote for J\u00f6rg Haider. Denmark, in particular, registers alarm at such an override of democracy. Even though \"Brussels\" had nothing to do with this, the Danish referendum on the euro could be determined by nightmare images of EU impositions on the democratic will, if the Austrians aren't restored to normality before September. From Austria itself, the effects could spread deep and wide. A plebiscite on sanctions is promised there, also in September. Though Haider's support hasn't grown much, indignation at the sanctions has. This is certain to excite more anti-EU feeling, producing a vote that asserts Austria's determination not to be bossed around. Haider's anti-immigrant rhetoric will become more not less resonant. Opposition to enlargement, by far the most important item on the EU agenda, will intensify and, since this requires a unanimous vote, could drive Austria, backed by a popular mandate, to block it altogether. Most players in the EU game now seem to understand this. Even those once most outraged by the Haider party's presence in government privately admit that sanctions ought to end. Austria, they say, mustn't be let off the hook, and must still be watched. But this can't go on indefinitely. She must be given the prospect of remission for good behaviour. Tony Blair takes this line. The question is: can the collective talents of 14 countries' diplomacy be mobilised in time to stop a spiralling diplomatic calamity? Or will a piece of genuine supra-national idealism be destroyed, ironically, by national politics? The key culprit here is the key originator: France. Which is where Portugal comes in. Next week France takes over from Portugal as president of the EU. For France the original desire not to encourage its own National Front vote - the objective was fair enough - has shifted into rivalry between President Chirac and prime minister Jospin as to which can outdo the other in proven dedication to the anti-fascist cause. The presidential election approaches. More immediately there are municipal elections, in which Chirac fears the National Front. It's commonly reckoned that, once France takes over the EU, the portcullis will come down against any Austrian deal, and may stay down during the next two presidencies, first Sweden then Belgium, both in the van of the anti-Austria campaign. Much rests, therefore, on the dying days of the Portuguese presidency. Portugal, it must be said, has not done well so far. Nor have the Austrians, with their propensity to blab about any private diplomacy that might be going on. But now the end game looms, and everybody knows it. A deal just might be done, whereby Austria achieves a suspension of sanctions, conditional on accepting a few months' invigilation of her conduct. She may have to promise to take part in EU anti-racist campaigns, which she hasn't yet done. Another idea is for more explicit anti-Nazi history teaching in schools. Exactly who would make the analysis of Austria's behaviour, and how long the transition would last, are sensitive questions. But it seems exceedingly important that Antonio Guterres, the Portuguese prime minister, gives what remains of his energy to pushing hard on both Paris and Vienna before Friday. Austria is a hard case. Hella Pick, in her penetrating new study Guilty Victim: Austria from the Holocaust to Haider (IB Tauris, \u00a324.50), says that Haider's very presence in politics casts doubt on the country's efforts over the last decade to portray itself as a mature democracy. But the EU has done as much as it practically can to lay its demands on the line. Indefinite sanctions, unremissible by any corrective action except the improbable de-election of the Freedom party, only make the problem worse. The best way to stop Haiderism is to end a punishment that has had its day.",

A senior courtier said \"She snaked\", but Faith Quartermaine said \"She was stitched up.\" Quartermaine was then home editor of Women's Own, which ran The Little Princesses. Now 79, she is formidable to an entertaining degree, saying \"Oh, yes, it was quite dreadful!\" on the crest of a laugh as if surfing disaster. Buoyancy is useful in an editor. </p> <p>I was struck by how female the whole fuss was. It was always the queen's approval that was sought. The queen who wrote dashingly slapdash letters to Crawfie saying it would be all right if the information were not seen to come from her as \"People in positions of confidence with us must be utterly oyster.\" The queen who later said Crawfie must have gone off her head. Had we no king? The education of the princesses and all its rippling implications were clearly considered women's business. </p> <p>Crawfie's doctor in Aberdeen described her as very, very presbyterian, sitting with a blank face as her husband cracked barrack- room jokes. Crawfie had married George Buthlay, a banker. His niece thought him great fun. Her niece found him disturbingly attentive and wrote to her aunt about it. Crawfie, who had learned a thing or two from the royals, never spoke to her again. </p> <p>She was paid $85,000 for The Little Princesses. As her American publisher said, \"A hunk of money.\" It bought the nice house in Aberdeen where the Daimlers never stopped. </p> <p> <strong> In Defence</strong> (Granada) is another attempt on the part of ITV to get their money's worth out of Ross Kemp. They bought a strong personality with a muscled swagger and a face like a swinging fist. All this shouts villain. He is cast here as a barrister with a conscience like a salted snail, almost disabled professionally by sensitive misgivings. It is a well made and acted series, which may repay patience. </p> <p> <strong> Syndicate</strong> (BBC1) is a new quiz with the added ingredient, sadism. Contestants are cruelly traded for points by their captains. \"This is a struggle for mental supremacy, a fight for survival. At stake - humiliation and defeat\", says Nick Ross, who is cast rather against type as a tough egg. \"Understand?\" he grates. \"Yes, Nick\", they say meekly. Of course, they do. They are very bright indeed. They don't know the maximum untaxed income, but they do know George Washington had hippopotamus teeth. </p> <p>This seems hard on the hippopotamus.</p>",

Now 79, she is formidable to an entertaining degree, saying \"Oh, yes, it was quite dreadful!\" on the crest of a laugh as if surfing disaster. Buoyancy is useful in an editor. I was struck by how female the whole fuss was. It was always the queen's approval that was sought. The queen who wrote dashingly slapdash letters to Crawfie saying it would be all right if the information were not seen to come from her as \"People in positions of confidence with us must be utterly oyster.\" The queen who later said Crawfie must have gone off her head. Had we no king? The education of the princesses and all its rippling implications were clearly considered women's business. Crawfie's doctor in Aberdeen described her as very, very presbyterian, sitting with a blank face as her husband cracked barrack- room jokes. Crawfie had married George Buthlay, a banker. His niece thought him great fun. Her niece found him disturbingly attentive and wrote to her aunt about it. Crawfie, who had learned a thing or two from the royals, never spoke to her again. She was paid $85,000 for The Little Princesses. As her American publisher said, \"A hunk of money.\" It bought the nice house in Aberdeen where the Daimlers never stopped. In Defence (Granada) is another attempt on the part of ITV to get their money's worth out of Ross Kemp. They bought a strong personality with a muscled swagger and a face like a swinging fist. All this shouts villain. He is cast here as a barrister with a conscience like a salted snail, almost disabled professionally by sensitive misgivings. It is a well made and acted series, which may repay patience. Syndicate (BBC1) is a new quiz with the added ingredient, sadism. Contestants are cruelly traded for points by their captains. \"This is a struggle for mental supremacy, a fight for survival. At stake - humiliation and defeat\", says Nick Ross, who is cast rather against type as a tough egg. \"Understand?\" he grates. \"Yes, Nick\", they say meekly. Of course, they do. They are very bright indeed. They don't know the maximum untaxed income, but they do know George Washington had hippopotamus teeth. This seems hard on the hippopotamus.",

      "bodyText": "The report on the inspection of IRA weapons dumps by Martti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa: This report is being issued following our appointment as arms inspectors on May 6, 2000, and our first inspection of IRA weapons dumps. We accepted our appointment on the basis of terms of reference set out in a joint statement issued by the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach and the statement by the leadership of the IRA on May 6, 2000. In its statement of May 6, the IRA leadership pledged to initiate a process that will completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond use in the context of the statement made by the two governments on May 5, 2000. Besides undertaking to resume contact with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), the IRA leadership agreed to put in place within weeks a confidence-building measure to confirm that their weapons remain secure. We see our mandate as being the inspection of the contents of a number of IRA arms dumps, reporting to the IICD that we have done so, and re-inspecting these dumps regularly to ensure that the weapons have remained secure. In preparing for the first inspection visit, we were briefed by the British prime minister, the Irish foreign minister, the British secretary of state and the commissioners of the IICD. We also consulted most of the parties that have endorsed the Good Friday agreement. In addition, we consulted independent specialists in the field of arms control, who had previously participated in arms inspections elsewhere and had expertise in the area of verification. The purpose of these consultations was to help us develop credible methods for inspection and verification. We have now carried out our first inspection. We inspected a number of arms dumps. The arms dumps held a substantial amount of military material, including explosives and related equipment, as well as weapons and other material. We observed that the weapons and explosives were safely and adequately stored. We have ensured that the weapons and explosives can not be used without our detection. We are satisfied with the cooperation extended to us by the IRA to ensure a credible and verifiable inspection. All our requests were satisfactorily met. We plan to re-inspect the arms dumps on a regular basis to ensure that the weapons have remained secure. The process that led to the first inspection visit and the way in which it was carried out makes us believe that this is a genuine effort by the IRA to advance the peace process. The IRA statement: On May 6 the leadership of the IRA announced an unprecedented initiative which had the effect of breaking the impasse at that time in the peace process. In our statements we made it clear that our initiative was in the context of a series of commitments made by the two governments, especially the British government. We announced that we would: \u0095 Resume contact with the IICD (Independent International Commission on Decommissioning), and \u0095 Put in place a confidence building measure. We now wish to confirm that we have re-established contact with the IICD, and that a number of arms dumps have been examined by the two agreed parties. These dumps contained a substantial amount of material including weapons, explosives and other equipment. The leadership of the IRA have consistently sought to enhance the peace process. This initiative demonstrates once more our commitment to securing a just and lasting peace.",

We must, however, pick educational solutions that work. Sentence football louts to two to five years European community service, working in German hospitals, French old people's homes or Dutch asylums. This will provide the sort of learning experience that can never be achieved in a classroom.</p> <p>While we're about it, how about sentencing J\u00f6rg Haider and William Hague to similar educational experiences in each other's country?</p> <p><b>Chris Coverdale </b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 Billy Bragg highlights the important role of education in countering the hooligan mindset that continues to draw on the myth of Britain \"standing alone\" during the second world war. The new subject area of education for citizenship, introduced in English schools from September, will be an essential vehicle for addressing this issue in schools.</p> <p>For example, it requires the study of UK relations with the EU, the Commonwealth and UN; the origins and implications of the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the UK; and the need for mutual respect and understanding. What is now needed is the support and resources necessary for schools to successfully plan and deliver this work.</p> <p>While in Belgium or Holland the hooligans might have chanted \"if it wasn't for the English, you'd be Krauts\", its instructive to note that without the contribution of the 4m Commonwealth servicemen to the British war effort in 1939-45, this letter might well have been be written in German.</p> <p><b> Steve Brace</b><br> Commonwealth Institute, London</p> <p>\u0095 I agree with Billy Bragg that education plays an important role in enabling \"young people to understand... history and culture\". However his comments about contemporary history teaching are ill-informed. Teachers do not \"fail to enlighten\" students about the consequences of the past.</p> <p>This term my Year 8 classes have been studying Gandhi's non-violent protests again British control of India.

      "bodyText": "Billy Bragg's proposition that education will transform the eurosceptic psyche of British hooligans hits the nail on the head (Time to move on, boys, June 24). We must, however, pick educational solutions that work. Sentence football louts to two to five years European community service, working in German hospitals, French old people's homes or Dutch asylums. This will provide the sort of learning experience that can never be achieved in a classroom. While we're about it, how about sentencing J\u00f6rg Haider and William Hague to similar educational experiences in each other's country? Chris Coverdale London \u0095 Billy Bragg highlights the important role of education in countering the hooligan mindset that continues to draw on the myth of Britain \"standing alone\" during the second world war. The new subject area of education for citizenship, introduced in English schools from September, will be an essential vehicle for addressing this issue in schools. For example, it requires the study of UK relations with the EU, the Commonwealth and UN; the origins and implications of the diverse national, regional, religious and ethnic identities in the UK; and the need for mutual respect and understanding. What is now needed is the support and resources necessary for schools to successfully plan and deliver this work. While in Belgium or Holland the hooligans might have chanted \"if it wasn't for the English, you'd be Krauts\", its instructive to note that without the contribution of the 4m Commonwealth servicemen to the British war effort in 1939-45, this letter might well have been be written in German. Steve Brace Commonwealth Institute, London \u0095 I agree with Billy Bragg that education plays an important role in enabling \"young people to understand... history and culture\". However his comments about contemporary history teaching are ill-informed. Teachers do not \"fail to enlighten\" students about the consequences of the past. This term my Year 8 classes have been studying Gandhi's non-violent protests again British control of India. This has included discussing the British army's role in the massacre at Amritsar, British control of the salt industry and the army's violent response to protests at the Dharasana salt works. Part of the coursework for my GCSE humanities group is a comparative study of the Nazis' actions in the 30s and 40s and neo-Nazi groups in Britain, Europe and the US now. Year 9 will shortly be studying the second world war with a focus on the impact on women's lives, not using \"history books which concentrate on Spitfires and Hurricanes\". My school is hardly unusual in this respect. \"Blame the teachers\" is a Murdoch line, Billy, and you should know better. Louise Clarke Brighton louclarke@cwcom.net \u0095 Billy Bragg is right to assert that education is central to any move away from the traditional English xenophobic mindset. Let's not forget, however, the efforts of the Thatcher governments which introduced legislation expressly to de-politicise the young. Outlawing politics and social studies graduates from teaching degrees and politics from the curriculums of secondary schools has resulted in a generation lacking political knowledge or interest. Any \"political education\" is likely, therefore, to be the result of a diet of jingoistic tabloid headlines and footballers' pronouncements. It's certainly one aspect of Thatcherism which was 100% successful. D Mitchell Sheffield Dougie1@btinternet.com",

The keyhole method is hard to learn and carry out. Many doctors prefer to recommend a hysterectomy rather than attempt to remove the fibroids and polyps that afflict many of the 10% of women who have menstrual disorders. At the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference in Bologna yesterday, Mark Emanuel from Spaarne Hospital, Haarlem, described a new device which would speed up and simplify such operations. It consists of a rotating surgical blade inside a specially-designed endoscope - a thin tube set with a tiny camera which allows the surgeon to see inside the womb. The unwanted tissue is sucked into the tube and cut away. The current method of keyhole surgery used for the womb is called resectoscopy. The endoscope goes in through the cervix, but uses a wire loop electrode and electrical current to remove tissue. There are potentially dangerous side-effects, such as burns or damage from the special liquids that have to be used which can enter blood vessels and upset the balance of electrolytes in the blood. There have been cases of women who have sued for compensation after being left paralysed or blind. So far, 15 patients have been treated in the Netherlands using the new technique with no side effects. \"The most important aspect of the new method is its simplicity,\" said Dr Emanuel yesterday. \"Resectoscopy is effective but involves a large number of steps, is tiring, difficult to learn and to become expert at.

America's carmakers and many of their suppliers would like the number who buy via the net to increase dramatically, knocking their costs for six. </p> <p>Central to the strategy is Covisint - an online partnership between America's big three carmakers - General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler plus Renault-Nissan. The idea came out of the manufacturers' desire to use the net to order from suppliers.

That, according to Frank McKulka, president of BASF Corporation, part of the world's biggest chemicals company, which is mulling over whether to sign up, \"is where the big dollars are\". </p> <p>The automotive industry is not the only one looking at the B2B concept. Industries from aerospace to the utilities are getting in on the act. Last week, Anglo-Dutch group Corus announced that it was linking up with three rival European steelmakers - Thyssen Krupp, Usinor and Arbed - to set up an e-commerce marketplace. Yesterday Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, said it plans an online marketplace for chemicals. </p> <p>The impetus may come from buyers, as in the US motorindustry, from suppliers or from \"market makers\" - third party firms offering a service linking buyers and sellers in a single industry. </p> <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter argue that B2B e-commerce is \"the latest step in the evolution of the internet as a trading platform\". In a detailed study of the potential impact on a broad range of European industries they argue that, while the short term impact may be limited, B2B is likely to have \"a potentially very significant impact on procurement costs and work flows in the medium term\". </p> <p>Work flows are a crucial element for the motor industry. If buyers were to order over the net and manufacturers could deliver within a time scale, the customer would accept. If that happened, Covisint would not only be a B2B system, it would also become a huge forward order book for the industry. </p> <p>According to Mr McKulka, the US makes 17m to 18m cars a year. At any time about 3m can be in lots waiting to be sold - inventory against expected demand. At $20,000 a vehicle that comes to $60bn (\u00a340bn). Cut out that \"idle\" inventory and not only is the customer satisfied but the industry becomes more profitable. According to some calculations the system could save up to $3,560 on a $20,000 car, although Mr McKulka reckons just under half that might be closer to the mark. </p> <p>So why aren't the suppliers queueing to sign up? For some, like BASF Corp, which has a raft of businesses unconnected with the car industry, it is a question of which bits of which operations are to be brought under which umbrella. Its German parent company, for example, is part of a B2B exchange in the chemicals and thermo-plastics industries. Others are suspicious that this is just another wheeze by car manufacturers to squeeze suppliers. </p> <p><strong> Regulatory hurdles</strong><br> </p> <p> There are regulatory hurdles, too. The US federal trade commission is showing interest in Covisint. As one Detroit insider put it: \"When any of the big players in the motor industry mentions co-operation the trust-busters sit up and take notice.\" </p> <p>It is not only the motor industry that is coming under the regulatory spotlight in the American B2B market. The Senate's commerce committee plans to assess the implications of the exchange planned by the airline industry. The department of justice, fresh from its success against Microsoft, is showing interest in the B2B exchanges too. </p> <p>The European commission has yet to have found a B2B project referred to it but the indications are that, while it accepts there are big savings to be made, it will look hard at any competition issues it believes are being raised. </p> <p>But if the B2B companies can convince regulators that they are promoting, not stifling competition, the early players are likely to steal a march on their rivals. </p> <p>According to Morgan Stanley, \"once some of these exchanges actually start operating... early participants have the opportunity to improve their competitive edge significantly over slower moving competitors in terms of procurement cost savings through improved visibility on price and product availability\".</p>",

If that happened, Covisint would not only be a B2B system, it would also become a huge forward order book for the industry. According to Mr McKulka, the US makes 17m to 18m cars a year. At any time about 3m can be in lots waiting to be sold - inventory against expected demand. At $20,000 a vehicle that comes to $60bn (\u00a340bn). Cut out that \"idle\" inventory and not only is the customer satisfied but the industry becomes more profitable. According to some calculations the system could save up to $3,560 on a $20,000 car, although Mr McKulka reckons just under half that might be closer to the mark. So why aren't the suppliers queueing to sign up? For some, like BASF Corp, which has a raft of businesses unconnected with the car industry, it is a question of which bits of which operations are to be brought under which umbrella. Its German parent company, for example, is part of a B2B exchange in the chemicals and thermo-plastics industries. Others are suspicious that this is just another wheeze by car manufacturers to squeeze suppliers. Regulatory hurdles There are regulatory hurdles, too. The US federal trade commission is showing interest in Covisint. As one Detroit insider put it: \"When any of the big players in the motor industry mentions co-operation the trust-busters sit up and take notice.\" It is not only the motor industry that is coming under the regulatory spotlight in the American B2B market. The Senate's commerce committee plans to assess the implications of the exchange planned by the airline industry. The department of justice, fresh from its success against Microsoft, is showing interest in the B2B exchanges too. The European commission has yet to have found a B2B project referred to it but the indications are that, while it accepts there are big savings to be made, it will look hard at any competition issues it believes are being raised. But if the B2B companies can convince regulators that they are promoting, not stifling competition, the early players are likely to steal a march on their rivals. According to Morgan Stanley, \"once some of these exchanges actually start operating... early participants have the opportunity to improve their competitive edge significantly over slower moving competitors in terms of procurement cost savings through improved visibility on price and product availability\".",

According to a survey published yesterday, Londoners are in the unenviable position of living in the most expensive city in the European Union and the 10th most costly in the world. Even the price of a phone call to a bank to plead for an overdraft is three times more expensive in London than in Rome. And it's not just London: Birmingham and Glasgow are pricier than Berlin and Toronto, according to the annual cost-of-living rankings compiled by the management consultants William M Mercer. For one month's rent of a furnished three-bedroom house in Chelsea, you can rent two of the same in a good area of New York and four of the same in Lisbon. London has steamed 30 places ahead of Paris on the world scale, with rents, jeans and toothpaste double the price of their equivalents in the French capital. The survey compared the cost of more than 200 items and services across 146 countries, including petrol, full-time maid service, a box of 40 tampons, and a litre tub of vanilla ice cream.

Mr Kennedy will condemn Whitehall-set monitoring as a \"shocking\" bureaucratic burden on schools, and will propose the axeing of national monitoring measures, including Sats tests which measure pupils in maths, English and science and are used in the compilation of school league tables. \"Government targets assume a percentage of failure,\" Mr Kennedy will say. \"I want to see an education policy where every child matters.\" Since Labour took power in May 1997, a total of 4,585 targets has been set for schools, colleges and local education authorities, according to Lib Dem research. Targets are in turn broken down into 306,480,472 separate measures to be monitored, the party's study indicates. Mr Kennedy, addressing local councillors at the Local Government Association annual conference, will propose that this huge number of performance measures should be replaced with a single statutory requirement for schools to develop an individual education plan accountable to parents, the local education authority and the schools inspectorate Ofsted. Schools would no longer have to put pupils through national tests at seven, 11 and 14. There have been reports of growing concern among parents over stress suffered by youngsters sitting the tests. By attacking Whitehall interference in schools' running, Mr Kennedy will add to the mounting debate over how much freedom individual schools should be permitted. The government will be attacked on a second front at today's conference when Labour council leaders warn Tony Blair that he faces a widespread revolt if ministers remove education and social services functions from town hall control. In a bitter attack on the government today, Sir Jeremy Beecham, leader of the Local Government Association - which represents England's big councils - will signal a big campaign against Downing Street's so-called \"front line first\" policy. Sir Jeremy, a member of Labour's national executive who has traditionally been associated with the centre right of the party will tell the LGA's annual conference that transferring education and social care directly to schools and new trusts would be both \"unworkable and in terms of local democracy completely unacceptable\".",

Analysts suggest the business would be worth around \u00a3650m. </p> <p>A statement from RIM yesterday said it was undertaking a review of the options available with its adviser, Credit Suisse First Boston, including continuing along the path to a flotation later this year. </p> <p>It added that the company was in receipt of a number of other approaches which could lead to a trade sale. </p> <p>Chris Oakley, chief executive of RIM, said the approach had been \"an expression of interest\" rather than a firm offer. He added that the group would be in a position to make a further announcement some time in the autumn. </p> <p>Gannett entered the UK market in the middle of last year when it paid \u00a31.3bn for Newsquest, the third largest publisher of regional papers.

      "bodyText": "Regional Independent Media, which owns the Yorkshire Post newspaper, yesterday said it had received a takeover approach from acquisitive American media group Gannett. RIM, which was a buy-out from Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media in 1998, is one of the largest remaining independent regional newspaper groups in the UK. Its acquisition would be part of the rapid consolidation of the market. Analysts suggest the business would be worth around \u00a3650m. A statement from RIM yesterday said it was undertaking a review of the options available with its adviser, Credit Suisse First Boston, including continuing along the path to a flotation later this year. It added that the company was in receipt of a number of other approaches which could lead to a trade sale. Chris Oakley, chief executive of RIM, said the approach had been \"an expression of interest\" rather than a firm offer. He added that the group would be in a position to make a further announcement some time in the autumn. Gannett entered the UK market in the middle of last year when it paid \u00a31.3bn for Newsquest, the third largest publisher of regional papers. Last month it added Newscom for \u00a3444m. In the US, Gannett publishes 74 daily newspapers, including USA Today, and owns 22 television stations. Any acquisition of RIM would have to be approved by the trade secretary, Stephen Byers. Gannett said it intended to seek a rubber stamp ahead of a formal offer being made. Venture capital group Candover is the majority investor in RIM with 50% of the company. The other shareholders are Goldman Sachs and the Dutch venture capital group, Alpinvest. The business, which publishes daily and weekly titles throughout the north of England, was bought for \u00a3360m. The group publishes 101 titles, with the Yorkshire Post being one of the oldest in Britain - the newspaper was founded as the Leeds Intelligencer in 1754. RIM's other daily titles include the Yorkshire Evening Post in Leeds, the Star in Sheffield, the Lancashire Evening Post in Preston and the Wigan Evening Post. The company reported a 15% increase in pre-tax profits to \u00a332.8m during 1999 on a 6.1% rise in revenues to \u00a3156.3m. RIM also controls some 16 websites tied to its regional titles and is one of six regional publishing companies with a shareholding in Fish 4 - the regional press classified database which allows users to gain access to advertising for cars, jobs and property on the internet.",

Analysts believe that Corus's ability to cut costs and boost efficiency will be crucial to improving profitability. \"The company is being encouraged to be more efficient, for example to re-engineer its product delivery and optimise between sites. Corus really has more customers in continental Europe so it has to be able to deliver to them at the best revenue,\" according to Alan Coats, a steel analyst at Merrill Lynch. But Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham, pointed to the recent recovery in the euro against the pound and said he was concerned that Corus was in danger of creating a self-fulfiling prophecy basing its future strategy on a currency imbalance \"which is now moving in the steel industry's favour\". However, there was some more positive news from the group. It said: \"The market outlook for for carbon steel for the rest of 2000 appears to be generally strong, especially in the US and European markets, although concern remains about demand in the UK due to the relative strength of the pound.\" Corus shares yesterday closed down 4.5p at 97p.",

      "body": "<p>The estuary light is a shifting, uncertain tide, flooding in through the windows and skylights, filling the room then ebbing away. The weather at the Mersey's mouth and the weather in the rooms where the paintings hang. The paintings appraise blanched afternoon skies, flaring sunsets, luminous coastal vapours, Venetian and Swiss lake light. Here are stormy seas and blazing wrecks, floundering ships, drownings, an angel standing in the sun. </p> <p>The paintings belong to the first half of the 19th century, and also to a mythological time and space. The apocalyptic and the visionary are never far away in JMW Turner's work. He was not, as he is sometimes made out to be, an Impressionist. His paintings also belong emphatically to the here and now - this time, this place, a moment that seems to last forever. </p> <p>We are accustomed to seeing Turner's paintings surrounded by fancy gilded frames, and further removed from us by a pane of non-reflective glass. Or to seeing them in reproduction - cropped into hard rectangles with rulered edges, as flattened printer's ink pictures on a white page. In the exhibition The Sun Is God at Tate Liverpool, curator Mark Francis has both addressed and undressed the Tate's collection of Turners, and turned off the gallery lighting. Naked and unframed on the bare walls, the canvases hang in ordinary daylight - if a light so subtle and shifting as this can ever truly be described as ordinary. The light sometimes reveals too much, and just as often frustrates the eye. As it rakes across the surface of one work, all you can see is stark, shining reflection, the tracery of cracks, the cupped paint, the mat patches and the skating-rink shine. As the light changes - as though someone were playing with a dimmer switch - the surface disappears and the image reveals itself. </p> <p>Here they are, with all their wounds and scars. Out of the frames, you notice how many of the friable old canvases have been relined, glued with resins and wax to new, secondary layers of canvas. One can't always distinguish dirt and old, discoloured restoration from Turner's mucky, impastoed, knifed-on and dragged-over original paintwork. Or how much the aggressively sulphurous atmosphere of 19th-century London discoloured the lead pigments, or how unstable some of his new-fangled pigments - themselves the product of dirty industry - really were. But his touch and his intention remain clear. His painting is revealed as gloriously slovenly, a magnificent mess. He turned slops into atmosphere. The leavings and traces, like a real tide-margin, gave his work its meatiness and its veracity. His was a robust art, however diaphanous and insubstantial the effects he sought to capture. </p> <p>I think of the artist, looking at his own work at the day's end, as the light shifted to the red end of the spectrum. We look at Turner here as he would have seen his own paintings, while he worked on them and deliberated over them, watching as the light fell, seeing how one colour struck out and then receded, how the light in the painting persisted longest as the daylight went. The painter invents light, and the painting responds to light. This exhibition needs time - just as much an element of painting as space or light. Turner unframed, unlit, is still Turner. Perhaps he is even more palpably himself. </p> <p>Mark Francis has also curated the exhibition of Douglas Gordon's work at the same gallery. To reach both shows on the top floor, visitors are invited to use the service lift. There's no indication whether you are riding up or down, and the intention is to give the visitor the curious sense of arriving somewhere strange as the attendant drags the lift door open into the darkened space of Gordon's show. The skylights and windows here are blacked out, and the space has been turned into a pleasing labyrinth. </p> <p>But making any connection between Turner and Douglas Gordon requires a leap of the imagination. What do they share, apart from the fact that Gordon won a prize named after the dead painter in 1996? Is it a question of light - cinematic light v painted light - or something more furtive, to do with both artists' interest in the biblical, and especially in the Book of Revelation? </p> <p>Gordon is most famous for his works that pay homage to Hitchcock - 24 Hour Psycho and, more recently, Feature Film (based on the score of Vertigo), which was given another airing at the Royal Festival Hall last Saturday. Gordon's only film work here is a new piece, Deja Vu. This is a triple screening of DOA, a grim 1949 American film noir directed by Rudolph Mat\u00e9. It is a very dark film about a man who is poisoned and recounts the events leading up to his murder while the drug slowly takes effect. Mat\u00e9 began his career in Germany and France, where he worked as cameraman on Dreyer's La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc, in which Antonin Artaud played the young monk. DOA (dead on arrival) is projected on three abutted screens. Gordon runs the film a little fast (as it would be seen on television, snipping minutes from the film), at normal speed and slightly slowed down. The three projections slowly go out of synch, creating inadvertent yet fortuitous synchronicities. The story is told in a series of flashbacks, and the sense of premonition and deja vu is heightened by Gordon's manipulation of it. Gordon turns watching into a curious psychic experience. </p> <p>Gordon's show and the accompanying book - more a work in itself than a straightforward catalogue - are surprising for an audience who know him best from his film work. He even includes a text in homage to Turner, Afterturner, which plays on reversals and homophones. \"The sun is good... The son is bad... The sun is god... God is the son.\" There is something relentless about Gordon's work, which is nowhere clearer than in a 1996 work, From God to Nothing. Three lightbulbs hang at different heights in a room. Running around the walls is a continuous text, at eye-height, like a horizon. It is a horizon of fear: \"fear of god... fear of friends... fear of anal penetration... fear of teeth... fear of falling asleep and never waking up... fear of fear... fear of nothing.\" Almost any fear you've got is here. You walk around with an increasing sense of alarm, the lights casting eerie shadows before and behind you. Your own shadow looms, and you can't escape yourself. Coming to the fear of teeth, I knew my number was up. Reeling out, the next thing I saw was a photo of a black spot inked on to Gordon's hand, like Blind Pugh's dreaded Black Spot in Treasure Island. We're all marked, I thought. This is a major theme in Gordon's work. </p> <p>He takes us into a yellow room where we can listen to the jazz that was around when Gordon's mum was pregnant with the young Douglas, in 1966. Coltrane and Archie Shepp lilt from the speakers. An earlier version, sited in a blue room, played the pop of the era. </p> <p>Gordon's work is packed with references, and not only to film. His is a far more literary and literate art than his film appropriations alone might suggest. Its darkness is morbid, the reverse side of the Turner coin. Where Turner saw angels in the sun, Gordon writes of meeting the devil in a dingy bar. Scottish Calvinism and the influence of his mother's conversion to the Jehovah's Witnesses when Gordon was a child have marked him. His mum found Jehovah, and Gordon discovered Warhol and Duchamp. All the references in his work get inextricably mixed together. </p> <p>If Turner's paintings are a stew, so too is Gordon's mind, as the catalogue, even more than the show itself, demonstrates. What his work reminds us is that the books we read, the films we see, the music we listen to and the art we look at are not secondary experiences, but become as much a part of our lives as falling in love, broken hearts, or being dragged around housing estates as a kid to doorstep strangers with the Watchtower. And they all end up getting used in Gordon's work. Gordon has the word \"forever\" tattooed on his forearm (he wanted the black spot tattooed on to his palm, but the tattooist wouldn't do it). Forever? Nothing lasts forever. I take the thought with me back to where the Turners hang, in the disappearing daylight. </p> <p>\u0095 Douglas Gordon and JMW Turner: The Sun Is God are at Tate Liverpool (0151-702 7400) till October 1.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The estuary light is a shifting, uncertain tide, flooding in through the windows and skylights, filling the room then ebbing away. The weather at the Mersey's mouth and the weather in the rooms where the paintings hang. The paintings appraise blanched afternoon skies, flaring sunsets, luminous coastal vapours, Venetian and Swiss lake light. Here are stormy seas and blazing wrecks, floundering ships, drownings, an angel standing in the sun. The paintings belong to the first half of the 19th century, and also to a mythological time and space. The apocalyptic and the visionary are never far away in JMW Turner's work. He was not, as he is sometimes made out to be, an Impressionist. His paintings also belong emphatically to the here and now - this time, this place, a moment that seems to last forever. We are accustomed to seeing Turner's paintings surrounded by fancy gilded frames, and further removed from us by a pane of non-reflective glass. Or to seeing them in reproduction - cropped into hard rectangles with rulered edges, as flattened printer's ink pictures on a white page. In the exhibition The Sun Is God at Tate Liverpool, curator Mark Francis has both addressed and undressed the Tate's collection of Turners, and turned off the gallery lighting. Naked and unframed on the bare walls, the canvases hang in ordinary daylight - if a light so subtle and shifting as this can ever truly be described as ordinary. The light sometimes reveals too much, and just as often frustrates the eye. As it rakes across the surface of one work, all you can see is stark, shining reflection, the tracery of cracks, the cupped paint, the mat patches and the skating-rink shine. As the light changes - as though someone were playing with a dimmer switch - the surface disappears and the image reveals itself. Here they are, with all their wounds and scars. Out of the frames, you notice how many of the friable old canvases have been relined, glued with resins and wax to new, secondary layers of canvas. One can't always distinguish dirt and old, discoloured restoration from Turner's mucky, impastoed, knifed-on and dragged-over original paintwork. Or how much the aggressively sulphurous atmosphere of 19th-century London discoloured the lead pigments, or how unstable some of his new-fangled pigments - themselves the product of dirty industry - really were. But his touch and his intention remain clear. His painting is revealed as gloriously slovenly, a magnificent mess. He turned slops into atmosphere. The leavings and traces, like a real tide-margin, gave his work its meatiness and its veracity. His was a robust art, however diaphanous and insubstantial the effects he sought to capture. I think of the artist, looking at his own work at the day's end, as the light shifted to the red end of the spectrum. We look at Turner here as he would have seen his own paintings, while he worked on them and deliberated over them, watching as the light fell, seeing how one colour struck out and then receded, how the light in the painting persisted longest as the daylight went. The painter invents light, and the painting responds to light. This exhibition needs time - just as much an element of painting as space or light. Turner unframed, unlit, is still Turner. Perhaps he is even more palpably himself. Mark Francis has also curated the exhibition of Douglas Gordon's work at the same gallery. To reach both shows on the top floor, visitors are invited to use the service lift. There's no indication whether you are riding up or down, and the intention is to give the visitor the curious sense of arriving somewhere strange as the attendant drags the lift door open into the darkened space of Gordon's show. The skylights and windows here are blacked out, and the space has been turned into a pleasing labyrinth. But making any connection between Turner and Douglas Gordon requires a leap of the imagination. What do they share, apart from the fact that Gordon won a prize named after the dead painter in 1996? Is it a question of light - cinematic light v painted light - or something more furtive, to do with both artists' interest in the biblical, and especially in the Book of Revelation? Gordon is most famous for his works that pay homage to Hitchcock - 24 Hour Psycho and, more recently, Feature Film (based on the score of Vertigo), which was given another airing at the Royal Festival Hall last Saturday. Gordon's only film work here is a new piece, Deja Vu. This is a triple screening of DOA, a grim 1949 American film noir directed by Rudolph Mat\u00e9. It is a very dark film about a man who is poisoned and recounts the events leading up to his murder while the drug slowly takes effect. Mat\u00e9 began his career in Germany and France, where he worked as cameraman on Dreyer's La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc, in which Antonin Artaud played the young monk. DOA (dead on arrival) is projected on three abutted screens. Gordon runs the film a little fast (as it would be seen on television, snipping minutes from the film), at normal speed and slightly slowed down. The three projections slowly go out of synch, creating inadvertent yet fortuitous synchronicities. The story is told in a series of flashbacks, and the sense of premonition and deja vu is heightened by Gordon's manipulation of it. Gordon turns watching into a curious psychic experience. Gordon's show and the accompanying book - more a work in itself than a straightforward catalogue - are surprising for an audience who know him best from his film work. He even includes a text in homage to Turner, Afterturner, which plays on reversals and homophones. \"The sun is good... The son is bad... The sun is god... God is the son.\" There is something relentless about Gordon's work, which is nowhere clearer than in a 1996 work, From God to Nothing. Three lightbulbs hang at different heights in a room. Running around the walls is a continuous text, at eye-height, like a horizon. It is a horizon of fear: \"fear of god... fear of friends... fear of anal penetration... fear of teeth... fear of falling asleep and never waking up... fear of fear... fear of nothing.\" Almost any fear you've got is here. You walk around with an increasing sense of alarm, the lights casting eerie shadows before and behind you. Your own shadow looms, and you can't escape yourself. Coming to the fear of teeth, I knew my number was up. Reeling out, the next thing I saw was a photo of a black spot inked on to Gordon's hand, like Blind Pugh's dreaded Black Spot in Treasure Island. We're all marked, I thought. This is a major theme in Gordon's work. He takes us into a yellow room where we can listen to the jazz that was around when Gordon's mum was pregnant with the young Douglas, in 1966. Coltrane and Archie Shepp lilt from the speakers. An earlier version, sited in a blue room, played the pop of the era. Gordon's work is packed with references, and not only to film. His is a far more literary and literate art than his film appropriations alone might suggest. Its darkness is morbid, the reverse side of the Turner coin. Where Turner saw angels in the sun, Gordon writes of meeting the devil in a dingy bar. Scottish Calvinism and the influence of his mother's conversion to the Jehovah's Witnesses when Gordon was a child have marked him. His mum found Jehovah, and Gordon discovered Warhol and Duchamp. All the references in his work get inextricably mixed together. If Turner's paintings are a stew, so too is Gordon's mind, as the catalogue, even more than the show itself, demonstrates. What his work reminds us is that the books we read, the films we see, the music we listen to and the art we look at are not secondary experiences, but become as much a part of our lives as falling in love, broken hearts, or being dragged around housing estates as a kid to doorstep strangers with the Watchtower. And they all end up getting used in Gordon's work. Gordon has the word \"forever\" tattooed on his forearm (he wanted the black spot tattooed on to his palm, but the tattooist wouldn't do it). Forever? Nothing lasts forever. I take the thought with me back to where the Turners hang, in the disappearing daylight. \u0095 Douglas Gordon and JMW Turner: The Sun Is God are at Tate Liverpool (0151-702 7400) till October 1.",

Nick Ut's photograph of nine-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc running in agony and fear out of her village after a napalm attack in June, 1972, had an extraordinary impact around the world. </p> <p>While it certainly influenced attitudes to the Vietnam war, the image also rose above the detail of place and time, of witness and perpetrator, because it showed with terrible economy how war kills, damages and ruins children. There can hardly have been an adult in the world who has looked it then or since who did not instantly see their own daughter or sister running down that road in Kim Phuc's place. </p> <p>The psychological history of the war seems inconceivable without this image. Along with half a dozen other photographs, it helped at some deep level to shape the popular feelings which in turn influenced policy. Kim Phuc's moment of terror deepened the scepticism with which, by mid-1972, the war was being viewed. The fact that the napalm strike was a case of friendly fire, the result of a mistake by the South Vietnamese air force, reinforced that message. </p> <p>But the photograph only reached the world after passing through a gauntlet of human decisions and by means of a technology that now appears antique. The picture hung in the balance as Nick Ut, the 20-year-old Vietnamese photographer who took it, broke with standing instructions that film should be brought back without delay and drove Kim Phuc and other injured villagers to hospital, and again when an editor at the Associated Press bureau in Saigon rejected it on the grounds that it showed full frontal nudity. Horst Faas, the Austrian head of the bureau and himself a famous photographer, argued with headquarters in New York that an exception should be made. It was laboriously sent by photo transmitter to Tokyo, line by line. The image was so powerful that it was immediately appropriated by the Vietnamese communists for propaganda use. </p> <p>Now, in an exhibition at the Science Museum, that extraordinary picture will appear in its context, in a set of Nick Ut's photographs showing the plane attack and how the terrified girl was subsequently rescued by a TV film crew. </p> <p>Three years after those events, Nick Ut was flown out of Vietnam and has spent his life since mainly in North America, where he continues to work for AP. Kim Phuc has also settled in North America. She and her husband,Bui Huy Toan, defected in Canada while on a flight from Cuba to Moscow. Both of them will be at the Science Museum today, to meet the Queen when she launches the exhibition. </p> <p>\u0095 Making the Modern World, part of the Wellcome Wing project at the Science Museum, London SW7 (020 7938 8000), opens tomorrow.</p>",

Nick Ut's photograph of nine-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc running in agony and fear out of her village after a napalm attack in June, 1972, had an extraordinary impact around the world. While it certainly influenced attitudes to the Vietnam war, the image also rose above the detail of place and time, of witness and perpetrator, because it showed with terrible economy how war kills, damages and ruins children. There can hardly have been an adult in the world who has looked it then or since who did not instantly see their own daughter or sister running down that road in Kim Phuc's place. The psychological history of the war seems inconceivable without this image. Along with half a dozen other photographs, it helped at some deep level to shape the popular feelings which in turn influenced policy. Kim Phuc's moment of terror deepened the scepticism with which, by mid-1972, the war was being viewed. The fact that the napalm strike was a case of friendly fire, the result of a mistake by the South Vietnamese air force, reinforced that message. But the photograph only reached the world after passing through a gauntlet of human decisions and by means of a technology that now appears antique. The picture hung in the balance as Nick Ut, the 20-year-old Vietnamese photographer who took it, broke with standing instructions that film should be brought back without delay and drove Kim Phuc and other injured villagers to hospital, and again when an editor at the Associated Press bureau in Saigon rejected it on the grounds that it showed full frontal nudity. Horst Faas, the Austrian head of the bureau and himself a famous photographer, argued with headquarters in New York that an exception should be made. It was laboriously sent by photo transmitter to Tokyo, line by line. The image was so powerful that it was immediately appropriated by the Vietnamese communists for propaganda use. Now, in an exhibition at the Science Museum, that extraordinary picture will appear in its context, in a set of Nick Ut's photographs showing the plane attack and how the terrified girl was subsequently rescued by a TV film crew. Three years after those events, Nick Ut was flown out of Vietnam and has spent his life since mainly in North America, where he continues to work for AP. Kim Phuc has also settled in North America. She and her husband,Bui Huy Toan, defected in Canada while on a flight from Cuba to Moscow. Both of them will be at the Science Museum today, to meet the Queen when she launches the exhibition. \u0095 Making the Modern World, part of the Wellcome Wing project at the Science Museum, London SW7 (020 7938 8000), opens tomorrow.",

After leaving the army, he made a smooth transition to the film world, notching up early credits on such productions as Brazil, Greystoke, Memphis Belle and Mona Lisa.</p> <p>Terry was proud of his association with the SAS, but his views on Ireland were not what one might have expected from someone of this background. I first met him last November, when Rebel Heart's producer, Malcolm Craddock, introduced us at a lunch for director and cast.</p> <p>I was surprised at his enthusiasm for a drama about the Easter rising and war of independence, but I had not counted on the depth of Terry's affinity with all things Irish. From the set in Dublin, he sent me an outline for a script based on his experiences as a soldier in Ireland, and we arranged to meet after he got back to London from his base-jumping holiday in Norway.</p> <p>On the set of Rebel Heart, Terry, dressed as always in tracksuit and trainers, appeared cheerful. He had lost weight after a low spell following the break-up of his relationship with a young equestrian stuntwoman, and his sisters and friends thought he was getting over it. He was full of plans for the future, including setting up an equestrian centre to train stunt horses. However, those closest to him say he was still struggling with depression.</p> <p>It seems almost too pat to suggest that Terry's pursuit of extreme sports stemmed from a profound and long-term unhappiness, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion. There was, as Malcolm Craddock said, a gap in his life. Base-jumping is one of the world's most dangerous sports, with the participant parachuting from a fixed object - usually a bridge or mountain.</p> <p>In this case, it was a 3,000ft cliff - Kjerag, in Lysefjord, Norway. Terry made eight jumps with Allan Hewitt, a skydiving friend, but something went wrong on the final jump and he landed badly on a ledge 2000ft down. He signalled to a circling helicopter that his legs were injured, possibly broken.</p> <p>Allan and the team alerted mountain rescue, but some 10 hours later Terry was still stranded on the ledge and out of communication. It was cold and darkness was falling. Possibly believing he had been abandoned, Terry decided - characteristically - to sort the problem out for himself, and jumped from the ledge. There was, however, insufficient height for his parachute to open properly. Unknown to Terry, rescue was only an hour or two away.</p> <p>Terry Forrestal, film stunt coordinator, born May 13 1948; died June 10 2000</p>",

I was surprised at his enthusiasm for a drama about the Easter rising and war of independence, but I had not counted on the depth of Terry's affinity with all things Irish. From the set in Dublin, he sent me an outline for a script based on his experiences as a soldier in Ireland, and we arranged to meet after he got back to London from his base-jumping holiday in Norway. On the set of Rebel Heart, Terry, dressed as always in tracksuit and trainers, appeared cheerful. He had lost weight after a low spell following the break-up of his relationship with a young equestrian stuntwoman, and his sisters and friends thought he was getting over it. He was full of plans for the future, including setting up an equestrian centre to train stunt horses. However, those closest to him say he was still struggling with depression. It seems almost too pat to suggest that Terry's pursuit of extreme sports stemmed from a profound and long-term unhappiness, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion. There was, as Malcolm Craddock said, a gap in his life. Base-jumping is one of the world's most dangerous sports, with the participant parachuting from a fixed object - usually a bridge or mountain. In this case, it was a 3,000ft cliff - Kjerag, in Lysefjord, Norway. Terry made eight jumps with Allan Hewitt, a skydiving friend, but something went wrong on the final jump and he landed badly on a ledge 2000ft down. He signalled to a circling helicopter that his legs were injured, possibly broken. Allan and the team alerted mountain rescue, but some 10 hours later Terry was still stranded on the ledge and out of communication. It was cold and darkness was falling. Possibly believing he had been abandoned, Terry decided - characteristically - to sort the problem out for himself, and jumped from the ledge. There was, however, insufficient height for his parachute to open properly. Unknown to Terry, rescue was only an hour or two away. Terry Forrestal, film stunt coordinator, born May 13 1948; died June 10 2000",

      "bodyText": "Iran is witnessing the death and rebirth of its reformist press, with the closure of one of the country's last progressive newspapers but the prospect of a new law to help resurrect some 17 publications which were banned in April. Conservatives in a special hardline clerical court on Sunday closed the Bayan daily - one of the few major progressive newspapers to survive the recent purge - leaving the reform movement stripped of the powerful voice that had roused massive public support in recent years. But reformist MPs in the new national parliament began last week to reverse the damage by drafting a new law which will make it far more difficult for the courts to close newspapers arbitrarily. One provision in the draft law requires that legal action against a newspaper must be heard by general courts in open session in the presence of a jury. Another protection allows publishers of banned newspapers to open another title immediately. Reformers won a majority in February's parliamentary election, but conservatives in governmental bodies still have the power to overturn laws passed by parliament. Iran's progressive press, has increasingly pushed the limits of free debate. By the time most of the newspapers was shut down in April, photographs of women were appearing on front pages while comments by Iran's highest officials were pushed to the back, and editorials were riddled with stinging criticism of the establishment.",

      "bodyText": "PE Central **** Aimed at: teachers Only the fact that it is aimed at US PE teachers stops this site from receiving a five-star rating. The quantity and quality of information available is high; PE teachers send in tips and ideas and the range of lesson ideas is vast. Game Central Station *** Aimed at: teachers and parents Over 350 searchable games for all ages. Some would suit out-of-school activities (such as Scout and Guide meetings) as well as PE lessons. Netball Resources **** Aimed at: everyone The most comprehensive resource of its kind on the net and against the myth that netball is a woman's sport. Visitors will find drills, opportunities to join regional teams and leagues, and excellent links (including the All England Netball Association). Sport England ** Aimed at: everyone An efficient and well-organised site but, sadly, apparently one that is more concerned with outlining lottery expenditure than providing practical help and resources. But you can download various policy documents and a publications list, along with details of the Sportsmark awards for successful PE teaching. Sport Scotland *** Aimed at: everyone Much better than the English effort, Sport Scotland does the same thing but is more accessible. Non-traditional gym **** Aim: teachers A US site which, through a less rigid lesson structure, encourages children to become more aware of their own movements and more confident in gym lessons. A few key stage 1 and 2 plans are included but, if you have the equipment, any of the suggestions could be used in PE lessons. LTA Schools *** Aimed at: everyone Three useful sites for teachers, parents and children from the Lawn Tennis Association. The LTA can help with in-service training for teachers. Parents can contact its well-organised network of coaches for post-Wimbledon and summer holiday classes. Schools Athletics Assoc ** Aimed at: everyone A basic site which, as the webmaster points out, needs more contributions from visitors. Basic safety information and recent results are available, but much more could be done. English Hockey Assoc ** Aimed at: everyone Competitions and hockey news are the staple diet here. Visitors with a suitable homepage can link it to the Hockeyville network, but there is little chance for newcomers to learn more about the sport. For enthusiasts only. Get Your Kit On **** Aimed at: everyone To encourage youngsters to abandon their Playstations and make up for six weeks without PE lessons, the BBC and five sporting bodies are offering free taster sessions of tennis, golf, football and athletics for 11- to 16-year-olds. The site has details of venues and enthusiastic backing from Sara Cox and Tim Henman. You can also win one of five pairs of inline skates.",

      "body": "<p>The climate of Britain is changing. The 1990s were the hottest decade on record. Did you notice? Probably not, with a home to shelter in and a fridge in which to store your food. But around us, the natural world is feeling the heat. Scientists say a whole range of plant, insect and animal species are adapting their behaviour to fit in with the hotter conditions. </p> <p><strong> Why is the climate changing?</strong></p> <p> Among other causes, pollution from cars and the use of fossil fuels - gas, coal and wood - are being blamed for putting excessive amounts of gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases allow the sun's rays into our atmosphere but stop them bouncing back into space, and so the world is heating up. In Britain some scientists think that temperatures will rise by between 1 and 2C by 2050. </p> <p> <strong> Isn't that a tiny change?</strong></p> <p> No. Each one degree shift upwards in temperature is the same as Britain moving about 250km south. </p> <p> <strong> How is this affecting Britain's plants, insects and animals?</strong> </p> <p> Many species are very sensitive to temperature change. They respond in a number of ways. Some are starting to do things earlier in the year. Others are shifting further north and creatures that are not native to this country are starting to breed here. But not all are so flexible. Scientists are worried that some living things that can only survive in very specific environments may leave Britain entirely or face extinction as the climate alters. </p> <p> <strong> Who is out there looking for signs of change?</strong> </p> <p> Every year, the British Trust for Ornithology gathers information from its members about bird nests. Their observations over the past 25 years indicate that nearly a third of 65 species of birds are now laying their eggs earlier. Meanwhile, changes in butterfly behaviour and numbers have been spotted by the charity Butterfly Conservation. It relies on sightings by volunteers. </p> <p>The Institute of Arable Crop Research at Rothamsted focuses on aphids and has been collecting them in 40 foot-high traps for the </p> <p>last 30 years. And the evidence is that these insects are flying earlier. This matters greatly to farmers, who need to protect their crops earlier in the year against the aphids and the plant diseases they carry. At sea, since 1931 merchant ships have been dragging special silk nets for the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation, gathering information about plankton. The 200,000 samples taken in that time seem to indicate that warmer waters are causing dramatic changes in the microscopic life of the oceans around our shores. This may have a big knock-on effect for larger species of animals that rely on the plankton for food. </p> <p> <strong> Who wins and who loses?</strong> </p> <p> In the North Sea codfish will be big losers if temperatures rise. Even a 0.5C rise is enough to disturb them and send them north. Meanwhile a host of exotic sea species are heading into our coastal waters. These include leatherback turtles, trigger fish and giant sun fish which can grow as large as a small car.</p> <p>It is feared that mountain birds such as the dotterel will soon find life in the Scottish Cairngorms intolerable. Species such as the little egret have started laying their eggs on the south coast, far from their normal nesting sites in southern Europe. Some non-native species have escaped from captivity into the wild and they, too, are thriving. In the orchards of Kent, ring-necked parakeets are becoming a pest - taking just a bite from each fruit. </p> <p>Among the plant winners in a warmer Britain could be the rare lizard orchid, which has spread out from its narrow base around Sandwich Bay in Kent. Losers could be some very traditional plants, including woodland bulbs such as wild daffodils and bluebells. They may swamped by earlier-growing woodland weeds. </p> <p>The hotter times have helped the nettle-loving comma butterfly to spread its range. But pity the poor adonis blue, a butterfly that depends on the equally rare horseshoe vetch in south England's chalky heathland. If dryer conditions kill the vetch then it is all over for the adonis - there are no suitable sites further north. </p> <p> <strong> Is temperature change the only problem?</strong> </p> <p> Many other factors affect plants and animals - among them pollution and the destruction of particular habitats. For some things, temperature change could be the last straw.</p>",

Their observations over the past 25 years indicate that nearly a third of 65 species of birds are now laying their eggs earlier. Meanwhile, changes in butterfly behaviour and numbers have been spotted by the charity Butterfly Conservation. It relies on sightings by volunteers. The Institute of Arable Crop Research at Rothamsted focuses on aphids and has been collecting them in 40 foot-high traps for the last 30 years. And the evidence is that these insects are flying earlier. This matters greatly to farmers, who need to protect their crops earlier in the year against the aphids and the plant diseases they carry. At sea, since 1931 merchant ships have been dragging special silk nets for the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation, gathering information about plankton. The 200,000 samples taken in that time seem to indicate that warmer waters are causing dramatic changes in the microscopic life of the oceans around our shores. This may have a big knock-on effect for larger species of animals that rely on the plankton for food. Who wins and who loses? In the North Sea codfish will be big losers if temperatures rise. Even a 0.5C rise is enough to disturb them and send them north. Meanwhile a host of exotic sea species are heading into our coastal waters. These include leatherback turtles, trigger fish and giant sun fish which can grow as large as a small car. It is feared that mountain birds such as the dotterel will soon find life in the Scottish Cairngorms intolerable. Species such as the little egret have started laying their eggs on the south coast, far from their normal nesting sites in southern Europe. Some non-native species have escaped from captivity into the wild and they, too, are thriving. In the orchards of Kent, ring-necked parakeets are becoming a pest - taking just a bite from each fruit. Among the plant winners in a warmer Britain could be the rare lizard orchid, which has spread out from its narrow base around Sandwich Bay in Kent. Losers could be some very traditional plants, including woodland bulbs such as wild daffodils and bluebells. They may swamped by earlier-growing woodland weeds. The hotter times have helped the nettle-loving comma butterfly to spread its range. But pity the poor adonis blue, a butterfly that depends on the equally rare horseshoe vetch in south England's chalky heathland. If dryer conditions kill the vetch then it is all over for the adonis - there are no suitable sites further north. Is temperature change the only problem? Many other factors affect plants and animals - among them pollution and the destruction of particular habitats. For some things, temperature change could be the last straw.",

Their claims will be countered by Ufi leaders tagging along to make sure their side of the story is taken on board. </p> <p>A lot is at stake. The Ufi is, according to David Blunkett, \"right at the heart of our policies on lifelong learning\". It is getting over \u00a384m of government funding this year alone, to help create learndirect - the brand name for a national network aiming, by 2003, to have 2.5m people annually using its information and advice services, plus another one million tapping into dedicated learning materials. </p> <p>So far 56 \"hubs\" - local partnerships comprising colleges, local authorities, and businesses - have been set up. These are operating 251 development centres, many led by colleges, testing the delivery of over 200 on-line courses in subjects ranging from basic skills to business management. The centres have been chosen to, in the jargon, \"fit learning into life\". Hence they can be found in pubs, railway stations, football and rugby grounds, in addition to more orthodox places such as libraries and community centres. </p> <p>Part of the problem is that, as they embark on these local partnerships, colleges and the Ufi don't entirely see eye to eye over the best way to forge the new learning opportunities. Worse, the former, with their vast experience, don't feel they are being listened to or that they're party to full information about what is going on. </p> <p>Judith Norrington, Association of Colleges director of curriculum and quality, said colleges had a huge commitment to increase ways for people to learn. \"Which is why the association wants to help the Ufi 'walk and talk',\" she said. \"It needs to learn from things that have already happened in colleges. It would be naive to believe colleges don't have some of the answers.\" </p> <p>The questions being raised tomorrow will be technical and complicated, though the technology minister is not expected to be fazed by them. They range around funding and organisation, with some doubts thrown in over the quality of learning materials being offered by the Ufi and the hinterland of hubs, centres and \"access points\". Although not shared by all colleges, there's also a feeling that some of the new learning venues verge on gimmickry and possibly trivialise the serious business of education and training. </p> <p>Some colleges want contractual arrangements between the various groups more clearly spelt out, especially if they are to avoid being forced to venture, once more, down the now discredited franchising route. This is particularly important, they claim, if student number targets are not met and hideous costs are passed on to them to deal with. </p> <p>Of course, colleges are no strangers to being asked to repay money to the funding council halfway through a year, if they fail to enrol as many students as predicted. But it is a fairly straightforward, readily understood system. In the new Ufi regime, however, they don't reckon such certain ties will exist. They also want an appropriate pricing policy that doesn't harm community groups steadfastly refusing to charge any learning fees. </p> <p>Criticism is also being made about the quality and suitability of some of the learning packages. Some are only available on-line and can't be downloaded, forcing learners to run up bigger phone bills. And some centres have discovered the technical specifications too sophisticated to make sense of. </p> <p>There's worry, too, about Ufi products, designed to be competitive with those prepared by the formal further education sector, leading to a loss of college business. There might also be a falling out if some Ufi courses prove to have lower completion rates, because they had originally accepted all-comers in a drive to boost numbers. Colleges, on the other hand, might be more circumspect about who gets on an identical course - but blamed for not getting more learners in the first place. </p> <p>Maggie Chadwick, principal of Furness College, Cumbria, who'll be attending tomorrow's showdown, reflected: \"There are lots of practical difficulties and there were bound to be teething problems. But I don't think Ufi policy recognises the sort of infrastructure that's needed. Nor do they appear to know who their friends are. The lifelong learning agenda is much too important to get wrong and allow to sink without trace.\" </p> <p>Ufi chief executive Dr Anne Wright was in a positive mood when these points were put to her. \"We are looking forward to this meeting with the association and the minister,\" she said. </p> <p>The Ufi, with its partners, was making \"huge strides\" in setting up an entirely new learning network, she pointed out. \"Our approach is radical and innovative, and we are developing very fast.\" </p> <p>The organisation, which is covering England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a sister body being established in Scotland, claimed it would have up to 1,000 on-line learning centres and hundreds more on-line courses installed by spring next year, once theUfi and learndirect went fully operational in the autumn. It was confident it would stimulate, and meet, demands for lifelong learning, improve people's employment prospects and enhance business competitiveness. </p> <p>Dr Wright added: \"We are working closely with all our partners, including colleges, to develop the network, to make sure it builds on our partners' own expertise in open and distance learning, and to address, in discussion, exactly the kinds of issues which are now being raised.\"</p>",

Taking bitterness to levels unknown even within academia - no easy feat - Brown concluded with a swipe at science itself, \"for being a hollow spectre of what you should be.

Brown agreed to tone down some of the language, but refused to go further, and brought his case to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE), a pressure group co-founded by the high-profile civil liberties lawyer, Harvey Silverglate, to oppose what it sees as the scourge of \"political correctness\" on US campuses. </p> <p>In response, the university called in its lawyers - and so what began as a prank borne of frustration has escalated, over the past year, into a full-scale battle over the alleged trampling of Brown's rights to free speech. </p> <p>Last month, UCSB finally offered to award Brown his degree - but only after removing the offending pages itself.

Concerns that university councils can be influenced by hidden interests have resurfaced after a decision by Newcastle's governing body to turn down calls from some academics for governors to declare whether they were freemasons. As part of his attack on elitism, Chancellor Gordon Brown accused universities of still being governed by old school-tie networks. The education secretary David Blunkett last month, meanwhile, called for reforms to the \"quaint\" selection procedures for vice-chancellors, after highlighting the small numbers of women and staff from ethnic backgrounds who had been appointed as senior academic managers. In 1996 the then Nolan committee on standards in public life said that while the principle of academic freedom let individuals pursue research and express opinions without political pressure, \"it does not justify a lower level of accountability for higher education institutions\".

Under regulations that took effect from September 1999, resulting from the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, elections should have been conducted among parent governors for between two and five representatives to each committee. </p> <p>Within the context of local government modernisation, the authority has discretion over how many representatives and on which committees. </p> <p>The key issue is representation. Parent governor representatives are elected to represent parents, not governors. Education department literature boldly proclaims them as a \"new voice for parents\" who will represent the views of all parents in the area, but not represent the interests of any particular group, school, locality or political party. Representatives will be able to vote and contribute to discussion and debate. </p> <p>But how do they gauge the views of all parents? Are there not different interests at play here - perhaps to do with differential funding or the allocation of places? Representatives may have been elected on the basis of a geographical area or school type. If so, they need to be in touch with that \"constituency\" - perhaps holding local meetings. </p> <p>This is likely to be unfamiliar for parents, who are not known for their interest in public meetings. Local media may prove to be a better vehicle - especially for disseminating information. And the local authority should be able to make its methods of communication available - the governor newsletter or local education authority website, for example. </p> <p>All local authorities have resources allocated under the standards fund to support representatives - my guess is we will need every penny to kick-start the latest interesting development in local democracy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/parep/index.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">DfEE</a></p> <p>\u0095 Jane Martin is education officer (school governance and development) for Dudley local education authority.

      "bodyText": "All local authorities should by now have appointed parent governor representatives to committees dealing with education. Under regulations that took effect from September 1999, resulting from the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, elections should have been conducted among parent governors for between two and five representatives to each committee. Within the context of local government modernisation, the authority has discretion over how many representatives and on which committees. The key issue is representation. Parent governor representatives are elected to represent parents, not governors. Education department literature boldly proclaims them as a \"new voice for parents\" who will represent the views of all parents in the area, but not represent the interests of any particular group, school, locality or political party. Representatives will be able to vote and contribute to discussion and debate. But how do they gauge the views of all parents? Are there not different interests at play here - perhaps to do with differential funding or the allocation of places? Representatives may have been elected on the basis of a geographical area or school type. If so, they need to be in touch with that \"constituency\" - perhaps holding local meetings. This is likely to be unfamiliar for parents, who are not known for their interest in public meetings. Local media may prove to be a better vehicle - especially for disseminating information. And the local authority should be able to make its methods of communication available - the governor newsletter or local education authority website, for example. All local authorities have resources allocated under the standards fund to support representatives - my guess is we will need every penny to kick-start the latest interesting development in local democracy. DfEE \u0095 Jane Martin is education officer (school governance and development) for Dudley local education authority. She writes here in a personal capacity.",

He pushed me back and I hit the door and banged against the handle. I was lucky not to have gone through the glass.\" </p> <p>This was just one of a catalogue of incidents reported in a survey that today reveals alarming levels of violence against teachers. Four out of ten Birmingham secondary school teachers who responded to a questionnaire said they had suffered physical and verbal abuse, nearly two-thirds of them at least once a year. The yob culture that has been so painfully on display at Euro 2000 football matches is growing and thriving in the classroom. </p> <p>Equally worrying are complaints from staff that they are being left unprotected by their headteachers and that incidents are being hushed up to avoid bad publicity for the schools. The teacher who was slammed against the door continued: The boy \"was put in isolation for the day and his parents were involved. They didn't seem that bothered, as he lied over what had happened and they chose to believe him rather than me.\" </p> <p>One in 11 teachers said they had been threatened by a pupil with a weapon. Teenage boys between the ages of 14 and 15 are the main perpetrators of physical abuse. </p> <p>Two-thirds of the abused teachers were women. An equal number of men and women completed the survey distributed by the National Union of Teachers to members at all the city's secondary schools. Seventy per cent of teachers who had been assaulted had more than five years' experience. </p> <p>Response to the survey was comparatively small (116 usable replies) but the union is convinced they are typical. \"Everyone is aware that there is a significant problem but we were genuinely shocked by the scale of it,\" said Nigel Baker, the health and safety officer of the union's Birmingham association. This problem is in no way unique to Birmingham, and if similar surveys were carried out in other parts of the country, the same sort of results would be produced. </p> <p>He believes assaults are being under-reported, partly because teachers are afraid that they would be accused of being unable to control their classes if they admitted to such bad behaviour among their pupils. </p> <p>\"It is clear that in some schools, senior management appear not to take physical or verbal abuse seriously. There is a clear under-reporting of assaults by schools to their local education authority. No doubt one reason for this is the competitive climate schools are in, which means that, like teachers themselves, they are unwilling to admit to the scale of the problem, for fear that it will be used against them,\" Baker says. </p> <p>Physical abuse for the purposes of the study was defined as \"deliberate and inappropriate bodily contact such as pushing, pulling, grabbing, hitting and spitting with no regard to the physical well-being of the staff member\". </p> <p>In 17% of reported cases of deliberate assault, teachers said nothing at all had been done to discipline an offending pupil. A further one third received a verbal reprimand and/or detention, another third were excluded from certain lessons, but not excluded temporarily or permanently. Over half of the teachers surveyed, (56%), felt that the action taken to discipline such behaviour was ineffective. </p> <p>\"The lack of support from the heads of year, deputy heads and the headmaster add to the feeling that you are in a minority and fighting against the current trend,\" said one. </p> <p>The physical abuse of teachers is an issue that is apparently ignored by many senior management teams within secondary schools. Only 20% of incidents formally reported were handled by the headteacher. \"There should be 100% of headteachers involved in cases of physical abuse of teachers by pupils,\" said Baker. </p> <p>One teacher commented: \"I was appalled that management did not take it seriously and I was told to laugh it off.\" Another said: \"I felt totally alone when I complained about being assaulted. I was disgusted that the parents were not involved and that I was not seen to be important.\" </p> <p> Nearly 90% felt that ill-conceived government policies on exclusion were to blame and they also agreed that the loss of discipline was due to an erosion of the respect and authority of teachers, coupled with a lack of parental support in dealing with cases of bad behaviour. Placing highly disruptive pupils in mainstream schools was one of the main contributory factors. </p> <p>\"Some pupils should not be in mainstream schools for whatever reason. We are seen to be failing because they [the pupils] cannot cope with school life. You cannot accommodate such extreme cases of disruptive pupils.\" </p> <p>The sense of frustration and demoralisation was obvious from the study, with 60% of teachers saying they wanted to leave the school they worked in. Half of all the teachers surveyed said they wanted to leave the profession because of the poor level of discipline in schools. </p> <p>\"From friends who have completed the course with me, many are leaving after just two years of teaching. The threat of disruption in class and the worry of physical and verbal abuse makes the job very stressful.\" </p> <p>As from September 2000, schools will be fined \u00a36,000 and also lose a grant of approximately \u00a32,000 per pupil if a student is excluded. The financial incentive to keep highly disruptive pupils at school is huge, but supportive measures to deal with these pupils, such as the new learning support units, are not available in enough numbers. </p> <p>\"This makes me feel very sorry for the pupils who do wish to learn and have their education disrupted.\" </p> <p>\"The sooner a headteacher is taken to court for 'failure to provide a safe place to work' under the 1974 Health and Safety At Work Act, the better.\" </p> <p>A Birmingham local education authority spokeswoman said: \"We are, of course, extremely concerned at any instances where teachers' health and safety is under threat.

      "byline": "James Meek",

      "body": "<p><strong> What is the human genome?</strong> </p> <p>The collective name for the whole set of genes at the centre of most of the trillions of cells in every human on the planet. Genes, made from a chemical called DNA, are the recipes for the substances that create our bodies, so the human genome is like the recipe book for a human being. </p> <p><strong> Why is there a human genome project?</strong> </p> <p>Governments and a British charity, the Wellcome Trust, were persuaded by scientists that it was desirable to decode the genome - to decipher the 3bn bits of DNA containing our genes. This will greatly speed up the identification of individual genes, which should lead to medical breakthroughs. </p> <p><strong> How?</strong> </p> <p>Most diseases - perhaps all diseases - are caused by tiny mutations in our genes, like misprints, which means they give out the wrong instructions in cells. These misprints can be inherited, or caused by environmental factors like pollution or radiation. </p> <p>A single faulty gene can be enough to cause disease, but some of the biggest killers, such as heart disease and cancer, are thought to be the product of environment, lifestyle and a whole series of genes. If the genes involved can be identified, therapies can be developed. </p> <p><strong> When are we going to feel the benefits?</strong> </p> <p>The first successful gene therapies are already in trials. Treatments for Alzheimer's and possibly some forms of cancer are imminent but it could be decades before illnesses like heart disease can be successfully tackled. </p> <p><strong> What is the downside?</strong> </p> <p>If a new disease gene is discovered, a test can be developed for it. Difficult issues include potential insurance and employment restrictions on healthy people known to be genetically susceptible to disease; pre-natal screening of embryos, which could leave parents facing abortion decisions over events far in their child's future; an increasing healthcare gap between rich and poor countries; and excess control over lifesaving diagnosis and treatment options by private firms that have patented genes. </p> <p><strong> Whose genes are scientists reading?</strong> </p> <p>The DNA was donated as male sperm and female blood by many donors from all ethnic groups. Six to 12 samples were picked at random and deliberately mixed up. </p> <p>A follow-up project, studying variations in DNA from person to person, involves 24 anonymous individuals from a range of ethnic groups. It has been rumoured, though never confirmed, that among the samples used by Celera was DNA from the head of the company, Craig Venter. </p> <p><strong> People are different. How can there be one human genome for all of them?</strong> </p> <p>There are thousands of tiny variations between individuals, but the overall variation is no more than 0.2%. In the same way individual human eyes are different, but we can still talk about the working of the human eye in general. </p> <p><strong> Why announce a \"draft\" before the whole thing is finished?</strong> </p> <p>One answer is technical - the unfinished parts of the genome are particularly hard to read. Lots of crosschecking will have to be done to complete it, but the draft is ready for use now. </p> <p>The other reason has more to do with politics, finance and media pressure: the publicly funded human genome project feared that its thunder was going to be stolen by Celera finishing the genome first. The two sides decided to declare victory together at a fairly arbitrary point. </p> <p><strong> Is there any link between genetically modified foods and the consequences of the human genome project?</strong> </p> <p>GM plants and animals have artificially altered genes, and some researchers seeking to apply human genome knowledge to medicine seek to alter human genes. But there are two crucial differences. </p> <p>GM plants and animals are designed to pass their altered characteristics on from generation to generation, whereas gene therapy only affects the patient treated, not their subsequent offspring. </p> <p>Gene therapy seeks to restore \"natural\", working human genes to people who lack them, rather than to give them special powers borrowed from another species. </p> <p><strong> How much did the project cost?</strong> </p> <p>Less than expected - about \u00a3200m, less than the cost of a new hospital. </p> <p><strong> Is there a Nobel prize in this for anyone?</strong> </p> <p>Possibly, but the huge number of scientists and engineers working on this make it difficult to pick out individuals who deserve the credit. </p> <p><strong> Where can I read the genome?</strong> </p> <p>On the internet - but it would be heavy going. It consists of a 3bn letter string of four letters, representing the four amino acids of DNA - A, C, G and T: enough letters to fill 200 telephone directories. </p> <p><strong>Useful links:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis\">Human genome programme</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.celera.com\">Celera</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.genewatch.org\">GeneWatch UK: ethics and risks of genetic engineering</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nhgri.nih.gov\">US national human genome research institute </a></p>",

Genes, made from a chemical called DNA, are the recipes for the substances that create our bodies, so the human genome is like the recipe book for a human being. Why is there a human genome project? Governments and a British charity, the Wellcome Trust, were persuaded by scientists that it was desirable to decode the genome - to decipher the 3bn bits of DNA containing our genes. This will greatly speed up the identification of individual genes, which should lead to medical breakthroughs. How? Most diseases - perhaps all diseases - are caused by tiny mutations in our genes, like misprints, which means they give out the wrong instructions in cells. These misprints can be inherited, or caused by environmental factors like pollution or radiation. A single faulty gene can be enough to cause disease, but some of the biggest killers, such as heart disease and cancer, are thought to be the product of environment, lifestyle and a whole series of genes. If the genes involved can be identified, therapies can be developed. When are we going to feel the benefits? The first successful gene therapies are already in trials. Treatments for Alzheimer's and possibly some forms of cancer are imminent but it could be decades before illnesses like heart disease can be successfully tackled. What is the downside? If a new disease gene is discovered, a test can be developed for it. Difficult issues include potential insurance and employment restrictions on healthy people known to be genetically susceptible to disease; pre-natal screening of embryos, which could leave parents facing abortion decisions over events far in their child's future; an increasing healthcare gap between rich and poor countries; and excess control over lifesaving diagnosis and treatment options by private firms that have patented genes. Whose genes are scientists reading? The DNA was donated as male sperm and female blood by many donors from all ethnic groups. Six to 12 samples were picked at random and deliberately mixed up. A follow-up project, studying variations in DNA from person to person, involves 24 anonymous individuals from a range of ethnic groups. It has been rumoured, though never confirmed, that among the samples used by Celera was DNA from the head of the company, Craig Venter. People are different. How can there be one human genome for all of them? There are thousands of tiny variations between individuals, but the overall variation is no more than 0.2%. In the same way individual human eyes are different, but we can still talk about the working of the human eye in general. Why announce a \"draft\" before the whole thing is finished? One answer is technical - the unfinished parts of the genome are particularly hard to read. Lots of crosschecking will have to be done to complete it, but the draft is ready for use now. The other reason has more to do with politics, finance and media pressure: the publicly funded human genome project feared that its thunder was going to be stolen by Celera finishing the genome first. The two sides decided to declare victory together at a fairly arbitrary point. Is there any link between genetically modified foods and the consequences of the human genome project? GM plants and animals have artificially altered genes, and some researchers seeking to apply human genome knowledge to medicine seek to alter human genes. But there are two crucial differences. GM plants and animals are designed to pass their altered characteristics on from generation to generation, whereas gene therapy only affects the patient treated, not their subsequent offspring. Gene therapy seeks to restore \"natural\", working human genes to people who lack them, rather than to give them special powers borrowed from another species. How much did the project cost? Less than expected - about \u00a3200m, less than the cost of a new hospital. Is there a Nobel prize in this for anyone? Possibly, but the huge number of scientists and engineers working on this make it difficult to pick out individuals who deserve the credit. Where can I read the genome? On the internet - but it would be heavy going. It consists of a 3bn letter string of four letters, representing the four amino acids of DNA - A, C, G and T: enough letters to fill 200 telephone directories.
