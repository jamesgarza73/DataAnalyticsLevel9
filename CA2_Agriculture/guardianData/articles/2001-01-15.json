      "body": "<p>After Arsenal had slipped below second place for the first time in three months some of their less forgiving supporters booed Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's players off the field. Chelsea fans, however, have long since learned to appreciate the vagaries of performance which make the difference between a cheer and a jeer.</p> <p>In the four months since Claudio Ranieri took over from Gianluca Vialli Chelsea have maintained a metronomic habit of mood and form which their followers must find hypnotic. For much of the time this has amounted to nothing more complex than winning at home and losing away but on Saturday Ranieri's side managed to encapsulate the manic nature of their season within 90 minutes.</p> <p>Chelsea's capacity for lurching from the sublime to the ridiculous goes back way beyond the moment the club decided that the only way to succeed was to appoint coaches with surnames ending in the letter 'i'. Yet it warmed the heart to see the mercurial tradition so faithfully maintained here, even if this was more a case of sublimity following farce.</p> <p>In fact so well did Chelsea perform after coming in at half-time 1-0 down there was every reason to believe that not only were they about to achieve their first away league victory of the season but that they would also defeat Arsenal for the first time in 11 Premiership encounters.</p> <p>Had David Seaman, back after injury, not managed to grab a shot from Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink before it crossed the goalline, the ball having slipped under the Arsenal goalkeeper's body, or Sam Dalla Bona not dragged a clear chance wide, Chelsea might have won. Instead the supporters were left to ponder what could have happened had the formation which led to their team dominating the second half been employed from the kick-off.</p> <p>Ranieri now limits his post-match meetings with reporters to games which Chelsea lose, arguing that when they win or draw the players are entitled to take the credit. For Chelsea, then, a prolonged period of silence from their coach would be most welcome and already, since they have lost only one of their past eight fixtures, public pronouncements from I, Claudio have more or less dried up. </p> <p>All the same it would have been helpful to hear the logic behind the idea of starting with a formation which might have been designed to enhance what strengths Arsenal had available in the absence of Dennis Bergkamp, Nwankwo Kanu and Tony Adams.</p> <p>From the moment, in the third minute, that Robert Pires swung easily inside Dennis Wise and Dalla Bona before directing a precise shot into the far corner of the net it was obvious that on their right flank Chelsea's cover amounted to little more than a bead curtain. Thirteen years ago the success of Wise in stifling the threat of John Barnes on Liverpool's left was crucial to Wimbledon's 1988 FA Cup triumph but asking him to cope with Pires, Silvinho and Sylvain Wiltord surely risked a second transfer request from the Chelsea captain within a week of the first being withdrawn.</p> <p>Not only that, a system which exposed Frank Leboeuf to the pace of Thierry Henry, restricted the opportunities of Marcel Desailly to move forward from the back, relegated the influence of Wise from fulcrum to factotum and left Hasselbaink up front with scant support suggested an approach by their coach bordering on the fatalistic. </p> <p>Or maybe something had got lost in translation. Either way Ranieri switched to 4-4-2 for the second half with Albert Ferrer on at right-back, Wise returning to central midfield and the persevering Eidur Gudjohnsen joining Hasselbaink in attack. For Chelsea football became a pleasure again and after John Terry had headed them level, reacting quickly after Seaman had pawed at a corner from Wise, they looked the more likely winners. </p> <p>Terry, like Jon Harley, is a highly promising young English defender and a further sign that Chelsea's foreign policy is starting to ease in favour of domestic products. Yet the fact that by half-time they were still in the contest was largely down to the Italian goalkeeping of Carlo Cudicini, whose saves from Henry and Fredrik Ljungberg (twice) had Wenger bemoaning another failure to kill a game off.</p> <p>Arsenal have now taken six points out of a possible 18 and are under pressure from Ipswich for third place. Meanwhile Chelsea, at their present rate of improvement, could finish fifth and win the FA Cup, although the last time they did this the coach was sacked. No wonder Ranieri is not saying very much.</p>",

Chelsea fans, however, have long since learned to appreciate the vagaries of performance which make the difference between a cheer and a jeer. In the four months since Claudio Ranieri took over from Gianluca Vialli Chelsea have maintained a metronomic habit of mood and form which their followers must find hypnotic. For much of the time this has amounted to nothing more complex than winning at home and losing away but on Saturday Ranieri's side managed to encapsulate the manic nature of their season within 90 minutes. Chelsea's capacity for lurching from the sublime to the ridiculous goes back way beyond the moment the club decided that the only way to succeed was to appoint coaches with surnames ending in the letter 'i'. Yet it warmed the heart to see the mercurial tradition so faithfully maintained here, even if this was more a case of sublimity following farce. In fact so well did Chelsea perform after coming in at half-time 1-0 down there was every reason to believe that not only were they about to achieve their first away league victory of the season but that they would also defeat Arsenal for the first time in 11 Premiership encounters. Had David Seaman, back after injury, not managed to grab a shot from Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink before it crossed the goalline, the ball having slipped under the Arsenal goalkeeper's body, or Sam Dalla Bona not dragged a clear chance wide, Chelsea might have won. Instead the supporters were left to ponder what could have happened had the formation which led to their team dominating the second half been employed from the kick-off. Ranieri now limits his post-match meetings with reporters to games which Chelsea lose, arguing that when they win or draw the players are entitled to take the credit. For Chelsea, then, a prolonged period of silence from their coach would be most welcome and already, since they have lost only one of their past eight fixtures, public pronouncements from I, Claudio have more or less dried up. All the same it would have been helpful to hear the logic behind the idea of starting with a formation which might have been designed to enhance what strengths Arsenal had available in the absence of Dennis Bergkamp, Nwankwo Kanu and Tony Adams. From the moment, in the third minute, that Robert Pires swung easily inside Dennis Wise and Dalla Bona before directing a precise shot into the far corner of the net it was obvious that on their right flank Chelsea's cover amounted to little more than a bead curtain. Thirteen years ago the success of Wise in stifling the threat of John Barnes on Liverpool's left was crucial to Wimbledon's 1988 FA Cup triumph but asking him to cope with Pires, Silvinho and Sylvain Wiltord surely risked a second transfer request from the Chelsea captain within a week of the first being withdrawn. Not only that, a system which exposed Frank Leboeuf to the pace of Thierry Henry, restricted the opportunities of Marcel Desailly to move forward from the back, relegated the influence of Wise from fulcrum to factotum and left Hasselbaink up front with scant support suggested an approach by their coach bordering on the fatalistic. Or maybe something had got lost in translation. Either way Ranieri switched to 4-4-2 for the second half with Albert Ferrer on at right-back, Wise returning to central midfield and the persevering Eidur Gudjohnsen joining Hasselbaink in attack. For Chelsea football became a pleasure again and after John Terry had headed them level, reacting quickly after Seaman had pawed at a corner from Wise, they looked the more likely winners. Terry, like Jon Harley, is a highly promising young English defender and a further sign that Chelsea's foreign policy is starting to ease in favour of domestic products. Yet the fact that by half-time they were still in the contest was largely down to the Italian goalkeeping of Carlo Cudicini, whose saves from Henry and Fredrik Ljungberg (twice) had Wenger bemoaning another failure to kill a game off. Arsenal have now taken six points out of a possible 18 and are under pressure from Ipswich for third place. Meanwhile Chelsea, at their present rate of improvement, could finish fifth and win the FA Cup, although the last time they did this the coach was sacked. No wonder Ranieri is not saying very much.",

Then their manager Peter Taylor, England's erstwhile caretaker, sacrificed a striker for an extra defender, whereupon Ipswich won with two free headers in the last 10 minutes. </p> <p>The goal that ended a frosty stalemate was Marcus Stewart's sixth in as many matches, bringing his total for the season to 16 and convincing his admirers that Eriksson need look no further than the Bristol-born striker to lead England's attack. </p> <p>Whenever England get a new coach almost any uncapped player in form is assumed to have a chance of an international career. Eriksson was here primarily to run an eye over Richard Wright, Ipswich's once capped goalkeeper, although since Wright had so little to do he must have gone away more impressed by Simon Royce, whose saves kept alive Leicester's hopes of a point. </p> <p>As for Stewart, well, if he could bring with him the quality of passing and movement that surround him at Portman Road his case for England recognition might amount to something more than media gossip. </p> <p>In criticising the performance of his own side Taylor summed up Ipswich's style rather well. \"They moved around a lot more than us,\" he declared, \"passed the ball better than us and did exceptionally well closing people down. Simon Royce's goalkeeping was the only positive thing to come out of our own performance.\" </p> <p>Having already been impressed by Paul Robinson when Leeds United beat Lazio in the Champions League, Eriksson must be wondering what it is about the Premiership that produces second-choice goalkeepers of such a high quality. Royce, back in the Leicester side because of another injury to Tim Flowers, showed excellent agility and anticipation in keeping out headers from Alun Armstrong and Matt Holland as Ipswich increasingly dominated the match. </p> <p>Patience is one of the prime virtues of Burley's Ipswich side and Eriksson will doubtless have noted that this is one English team that believes good footballing habits will usually prevail. So it proved. </p> <p>Once Ipswich had created four clear chances early in the second half they never lost the initiative. They nearly went ahead in the 52nd minute when Armstrong met a cross from Jamie Clapham with a header that Stewart volleyed against the bar. </p> <p>After that a combination of Royce and poor finishing enabled Leicester to survive. Then Taylor decided to replace a striker, Trevor Benjamin, with a centre-back, Phil Gilchrist, for the last quarter-hour, only to see his defence fall apart. </p> <p>In the 60th minute Gary Rowett allowed Hermann Hreidarsson to slip past him near the byline. The Icelander laid the ball back to Armstrong, whose miscued shot was headed in by Stewart. </p> <p>With a minute plus stoppage time remaining, Scowcroft met a centre from Fabian Wilnis in like manner. By this time Eriksson had already left - none the wiser maybe but at least with a better idea of what he is up against.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sven-Goran Eriksson's first 48 hours of studying English football first hand has probably offered him little fresh insight into the job of producing a winning England team, but at least he has a better idea of why Manchester United are in a league of their own at the top of the Premiership. Having seen Sunderland move unspectacularly into second place on Saturday, England's new coach watched Ipswich go fourth here yesterday with a victory over Leicester that was a triumph of perseverence rather than inspiration. Leicester, keen to avoid their third league defeat in a row, appeared to be doing just that having withstood long spells of Ipswich pressure for most of the second half. Then their manager Peter Taylor, England's erstwhile caretaker, sacrificed a striker for an extra defender, whereupon Ipswich won with two free headers in the last 10 minutes. The goal that ended a frosty stalemate was Marcus Stewart's sixth in as many matches, bringing his total for the season to 16 and convincing his admirers that Eriksson need look no further than the Bristol-born striker to lead England's attack. Whenever England get a new coach almost any uncapped player in form is assumed to have a chance of an international career. Eriksson was here primarily to run an eye over Richard Wright, Ipswich's once capped goalkeeper, although since Wright had so little to do he must have gone away more impressed by Simon Royce, whose saves kept alive Leicester's hopes of a point. As for Stewart, well, if he could bring with him the quality of passing and movement that surround him at Portman Road his case for England recognition might amount to something more than media gossip. In criticising the performance of his own side Taylor summed up Ipswich's style rather well. \"They moved around a lot more than us,\" he declared, \"passed the ball better than us and did exceptionally well closing people down. Simon Royce's goalkeeping was the only positive thing to come out of our own performance.\" Having already been impressed by Paul Robinson when Leeds United beat Lazio in the Champions League, Eriksson must be wondering what it is about the Premiership that produces second-choice goalkeepers of such a high quality. Royce, back in the Leicester side because of another injury to Tim Flowers, showed excellent agility and anticipation in keeping out headers from Alun Armstrong and Matt Holland as Ipswich increasingly dominated the match. Patience is one of the prime virtues of Burley's Ipswich side and Eriksson will doubtless have noted that this is one English team that believes good footballing habits will usually prevail. So it proved. Once Ipswich had created four clear chances early in the second half they never lost the initiative. They nearly went ahead in the 52nd minute when Armstrong met a cross from Jamie Clapham with a header that Stewart volleyed against the bar. After that a combination of Royce and poor finishing enabled Leicester to survive. Then Taylor decided to replace a striker, Trevor Benjamin, with a centre-back, Phil Gilchrist, for the last quarter-hour, only to see his defence fall apart. In the 60th minute Gary Rowett allowed Hermann Hreidarsson to slip past him near the byline. The Icelander laid the ball back to Armstrong, whose miscued shot was headed in by Stewart. With a minute plus stoppage time remaining, Scowcroft met a centre from Fabian Wilnis in like manner. By this time Eriksson had already left - none the wiser maybe but at least with a better idea of what he is up against.",

      "body": "<p>The home partisans trundled home bellowing the name of Terry Venables as their coaching saviour continues to work his magic, ensuring Teesside remains engulfed in a sea of Cockney optimism.</p> <p>Even in a match which, for almost all of an insipid first half, lived up to its assumed billing as a goalless stalemate, El Tel conjured up a thumping victory. Middlesbrough's biggest win since October 1998 stretched their unbeaten run under the new coach to seven matches and propelled them out of the relegation zone; Derby, beaten for only the second time in seven themselves, slipped back into trouble.</p> <p>Boro are unrecognisable from the shapeless shambles that had lost eight out of nine matches before Venables arrived. Now his players, from being distinctly off-colour, are vibrant; Hamilton Ricard and Gianluca Festa have a spring in their stride and Christian Karembeu looks the World Cup winner he had forgotten he was. But the lease of life is apparently not all driven by East End inspiration. </p> <p>\"It annoys me when people keep saying it's Tel this and Tel that,\" said the home captain Paul Ince. \"It's not all down to Terry. Our gaffer [Bryan Robson] is still playing an integral part. Tel's come in and turned things around, but they are a partnership and the gaffer should get some credit. It worked at Euro 96 and it's working now.\" </p> <p>Robson's role may remain ambiguous, but he is clearly occupied behind the scenes. After Venables earmarked the Bradford City forward Dean Windass as a potential signing, it was Robson who approached the chairman Steve Gibson and prompted a \u00a31m bid last week. </p> <p>\"Bryan takes notice of what I have to say, but it's his decision in the end on signings,\" Venables said. </p> <p>Venables's impact has been felt most markedly in their defence. Boro have conceded only two goals in his seven games there - opponents have yet to score from open play against the Teessiders - and they restricted Derby to only two shots on target. </p> <p>\"We're not playing fantasy football, but you have to do the work we did in the first half to be able to play like we did after half-time,\" said Venables. \"We have worked a lot more through the team and, once we had earned it, we played with imagination and finished well.\" </p> <p>Derby, too, have discovered defensive stability since Colin Todd's arrival as their coach. The first half served notice of as much; neither side strayed from its rigid formation, the players ever conscious of their defensive roles. It may have had the coaches salivating in satisfaction but it made for a turgid match. </p> <p>Then, as the interval approached, Derby's solidity was undermined. Ricard crossed from the left and the referee Rob Styles deemed Darryl Powell's tug down on Alen Boksic illegal. The Croatian scored with ease. </p> <p>\"I honestly didn't think it was a penalty,\" said Powell. \"I was back marking Karembeu and Boksic pulled off so I went across to cover him. He felt me, but I don't know how he went down.\" </p> <p>A key factor in Derby's new-found obduracy has been their man-mountain Taribo West. With the Nigerian on international duty they buckled after the break; Ince's free-kick found Karembeu, whose perfect cross was headed home by Ugo Ehiogu before Boksic teased Chris Riggott and fired a third beyond Mart Poom. </p> <p>Ricard's penalty, his first league goal of the season, allowed Boro to score four in the Premiership for the first in 27 months. \"It's probably the first time this season that we have been able to enjoy the last few minutes of a game,\" Ince said. \"We looked like a good side. Now we've got to keep believing that.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The home partisans trundled home bellowing the name of Terry Venables as their coaching saviour continues to work his magic, ensuring Teesside remains engulfed in a sea of Cockney optimism. Even in a match which, for almost all of an insipid first half, lived up to its assumed billing as a goalless stalemate, El Tel conjured up a thumping victory. Middlesbrough's biggest win since October 1998 stretched their unbeaten run under the new coach to seven matches and propelled them out of the relegation zone; Derby, beaten for only the second time in seven themselves, slipped back into trouble. Boro are unrecognisable from the shapeless shambles that had lost eight out of nine matches before Venables arrived. Now his players, from being distinctly off-colour, are vibrant; Hamilton Ricard and Gianluca Festa have a spring in their stride and Christian Karembeu looks the World Cup winner he had forgotten he was. But the lease of life is apparently not all driven by East End inspiration. \"It annoys me when people keep saying it's Tel this and Tel that,\" said the home captain Paul Ince. \"It's not all down to Terry. Our gaffer [Bryan Robson] is still playing an integral part. Tel's come in and turned things around, but they are a partnership and the gaffer should get some credit. It worked at Euro 96 and it's working now.\" Robson's role may remain ambiguous, but he is clearly occupied behind the scenes. After Venables earmarked the Bradford City forward Dean Windass as a potential signing, it was Robson who approached the chairman Steve Gibson and prompted a \u00a31m bid last week. \"Bryan takes notice of what I have to say, but it's his decision in the end on signings,\" Venables said. Venables's impact has been felt most markedly in their defence. Boro have conceded only two goals in his seven games there - opponents have yet to score from open play against the Teessiders - and they restricted Derby to only two shots on target. \"We're not playing fantasy football, but you have to do the work we did in the first half to be able to play like we did after half-time,\" said Venables. \"We have worked a lot more through the team and, once we had earned it, we played with imagination and finished well.\" Derby, too, have discovered defensive stability since Colin Todd's arrival as their coach. The first half served notice of as much; neither side strayed from its rigid formation, the players ever conscious of their defensive roles. It may have had the coaches salivating in satisfaction but it made for a turgid match. Then, as the interval approached, Derby's solidity was undermined. Ricard crossed from the left and the referee Rob Styles deemed Darryl Powell's tug down on Alen Boksic illegal. The Croatian scored with ease. \"I honestly didn't think it was a penalty,\" said Powell. \"I was back marking Karembeu and Boksic pulled off so I went across to cover him. He felt me, but I don't know how he went down.\" A key factor in Derby's new-found obduracy has been their man-mountain Taribo West. With the Nigerian on international duty they buckled after the break; Ince's free-kick found Karembeu, whose perfect cross was headed home by Ugo Ehiogu before Boksic teased Chris Riggott and fired a third beyond Mart Poom. Ricard's penalty, his first league goal of the season, allowed Boro to score four in the Premiership for the first in 27 months. \"It's probably the first time this season that we have been able to enjoy the last few minutes of a game,\" Ince said. \"We looked like a good side. Now we've got to keep believing that.\"",

      "body": "<p>Wasn't it Queen Mary Tudor who had 'Calais 1558' written on her heart?\" asks Jimmy Hill. \"Well, when they finally open me up, they'll find 'Ministry of Labour, January 18, 1961' carved on mine.\" </p> <p>The good old boy, 73 this summer, still juts his anteater's jaw at you to emphasise every earnest point and opinion - which flow in torrents - and, after each, he breaks into the merry chortles that have always engagingly speckled his sporting progress from \u00a37-a-week Brentford inside-forward to broadcasting eminence. </p> <p>Wednesday January 18 1961 was as seminal for English professional football as June 1215 was for the English constitution or May 1660 for the English monarchy. On the steps of the ministry that evening, in time to be lead story for the BBC Home Service's seven o'clock Radio Newsreel, the bearded young chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association (by now a stalwart at Fulham) announced that the footballers of England would call off their strike, having successfully won the abolition of the iniquitous maximum wage of \u00a320 a week (\u00a317 in the summer). </p> <p>Hill made the patriarchal, cigar-chewing Football League president Joe Richards shake hands with him - as well as the Minister of Labour, John Hare, and the chairman of the TUC, Ted Hill - and in no time the pictures of the workers' triumph were circling the world. </p> <p>Of course, it was not actually as simple as that. The distraught league management committee and its reactionary and apoplectic club chairmen spent the following months prevaricating and repatching the agreement, hedging their bets and going back on their word - but to all intents the slim, athletic (and unlikely) luminary of that cold January evening remained the working-class hero, returning to Fulham to be cheered every time he touched the ball. </p> <p>By the start of the following season, even the combative league secretary Alan Hardaker was telling his remaining diehard chairmen to pipe down, for they had effectively been routed by Hill and the PFA's impressive realist of a secretary, Cliff Lloyd. Hardaker admitted that Hill's public relations skills had swung the debate decisively a week before that January 18 meeting - and triggered the involvement of a government fearful of having an electorate with no pools coupons to be filled in. </p> <p>With 344 players from the northern clubs packing the ballroom at Manchester's Grand Hotel, Hill made a stirring call for industrial action on Saturday January 21. Then, on the suggestion of the hawkish Blackburn winger and later Scotland manager, Ally MacLeod, he invited in around 50 waiting journalists to hear him demand: \"Is there any man in this room not prepared to strike on Saturday week?\" </p> <p>Remembers Hill, 40 years on: \"The unanimous no could have come from the Kop at its loudest.\" Rheumy eyes bright in reverie of his militant past, the slippered septuagenarian - four wives, five children, double-figures in grandchildren - is now an upright denizen of Surrey's stockbroker belt. He seems hardly to believe it himself. </p> <p>\"I was just a kid really. Of course, I was keen on working-class rights, but I wasn't really what you'd call a political animal. At Brentford I had been collecting the PFA's weekly subs and when they transferred me to Fulham it coincided with their PFA rep Norman Smith giving up the game. So I continued collecting the subs. The only other thing you were expected to do was try and get to the AGM in the summer.</p> <p>\"The first one I attended was in 1956 and for some reason I found myself defending the rather loose-cannon methods of our then chairman, Jimmy Guthrie of Portsmouth. \"If our opponents can't stand him he must be doing something right,\" I said. So as a penalty for not keeping my big trap shut, they promptly elected me to the eight-man committee of management.\" Within a year, Guthrie had gone and Fulham's Hill was elected PFA chairman. </p> <p>\"I can safely say those extraordinary four years, 1957 to 1961, irrevocably changed my life. Suddenly I was having to argue my case in different parliaments, deal with the media as well as my fellow men in the most delicate matters. A university degree in politics and philosophy couldn't have been more rewarding; the PFA simply gave me a crash course in life and maturity. </p> <p>\"League football had been set in its feudal time warp. January 18 was the watershed, but even in their shell shock the league and its chairmen looked to overturn the agreement. They had spent generations looking down their noses at players and now, even at that meeting at the ministry, they presumed to treat us as inferior beings. Being totally in charge of us was ingrained into their culture. And to find me, not a venerable ex-player but a lad who was still actually playing for a club they controlled, must have been anathema to them.\" </p> <p>Not that the young founder of the feast was able to cash in on the PFA's triumph. Fulham in 1961 had a popular and lively side, with Hill, the ungainly but effective Maurice Cook, the clever Graham Leggatt, and the two future internationals, George Cohen and Alan Mullery, all willingly perspiring around the cool captain of England, Johnny Haynes. The chairman was the comedian Tommy Trinder, and, as Hill's battles swirled around that winter, Trinder announced: \"Haynes is an entertainer like I am, and if the maximum wage is ever abolished, I will pay him what he is worth, which is \u00a3100 a week.\" </p> <p>The nation gasped - and, of course, after January 18, Trinder had to fork out. From his home in Scotland, Haynes remembers with a strained smile: \"It was just a Trinder publicity stunt really, but when Jimmy had led the troops to victory, Trinder was lumbered. I was into his office with my pen and solicitor's sheet of paper, and a couple of journalists outside, before Trinder could gulp. He had to sign, but I suppose he had the last laugh because I may have been the first \u00a3100-a-week player but I played for Fulham another eight years and never got another rise. I was on \u00a3100 a week till I packed up.\" </p> <p>Hill stayed on \u00a318 a week. He did not play long enough even to negotiate a new contract that September. He had injured his right knee at Luton in January 1960 - when Fulham, lying second in the First Division, had been leading 1-0. </p> <p>\"No substitutes then, and we lost 4-1. Still, we were to finish 10th, still Fulham's highest ever league position. And when my knee was patched up and after all the PFA disputes and triumphs, I was happily back in the first team. But it was only going to be a matter of time.\" </p> <p>On March 5 1961, the Sunday Times reported Fulham's 1-0 defeat against Everton: \"Brightest spot of the match was the effort of the bearded Hill. Tireless and covering acres of ground, he never gave up till two minutes from the end, trying to force an equaliser, he received a nasty knock.\" </p> <p>The \"knock\" was a severely torn cartilage in the same right knee. It was his last game as a professional. Fulham claimed \u00a310,000 insurance compensation on his injury - and kept it - so seeing as he had been bought from Brentford for \u00a35,000 eight years before, the club made a \u00a35,000 profit on Hill's 277 matches and 41 goals. </p> <p>The football-mad Boys' Brigade cornet player from Balham, whose first job at 16 had been as a clerk for the London &amp; Lancs insurance company, now prepared for an apprenticeship as a new-fangled \"sports agent\" with the Bagenal Harvey organisation. That September, however, one of the their clients, the England cricketer Jim Laker, introduced Hill to the chairman of Third Division sluggards Coventry City, Derrick Robins - who suggested lunch at Leamington Spa the next day. </p> <p>Hill steered Coventry to the First Division before, in 1967, becoming head of sport for London Weekend Television. Six years later, he was headhunted by the BBC, where he continued to point his chin at the nation and vibrantly pontificate on all matters football for more than a quarter of a century until the end of the 1998 World Cup when (like David Coleman) his contract expired and he left with not so much as a note of thanks, private or public. </p> <p>\"Perhaps they lost my address,\" he says, \"but more likely, in terms of manners and common decency, the BBC hierarchy needs some serious tutoring.\" </p> <p>Sky Sports now employs the spritely ancient - he has given up riding to hounds but still plays a mean three-setter at tennis - and on Wednesday he can be seen chewing over his great political triumph. Perhaps Sky has located that sepia reel of film from the spring of 1961 of Hill's deadly adversary, Hardaker, indulging in his hobby, fishing for shark off the Cornish coast at Looe. He hauls in a 100-pounder and the boatman gives the poor beast a vicious knobkerrie clout. \"Hit it again,\" demands Hardaker. \"It's got a chin like Jimmy Hill.\" </p> <p>He chuckles at that. \"Hardaker was a tough opponent, all right. I took him out to supper a few years later and he reckoned they would have won easily if only his bosses had offered a deal of, say, a \u00a310 rise and set a new maximum wage at \u00a330. As it was, they let loose a free-for-all. </p> <p>\"Not that I've ever changed my beliefs. The battle we fought was for a player to be free to negotiate for what he was worth with no restrictions. That holds good in 2001, and is nothing to do with the David Beckhams of this world being overpaid - he justifies, earns and deserves his money because a super-wealthy club like Manchester United can happily afford him. </p> <p>\"The stupidity which is rife is that outside the top eight or 10 ultra-rich clubs, there are others demanding, and getting, ludicrous salaries when the clubs simply cannot afford them. Even some Third Division players are on \u00a31,000 a week. For their clubs and directors that just means guaranteeing bank loans and consequent debt, debt, debt. Crazy. </p> <p>\"And then, doing their utmost, they get spat on by the fans for not spending more. I've been a director and chairman of three good, modest clubs - Coventry, Charlton and Fulham - and the abuse you get can be cruel and shameful. I've had a wonderful life, and wouldn't change a moment of it professionally - except that I should never have become a director.\" </p> <p>Nice: the old gamekeeper knows, deep down, he should never have jumped the fence; that he should have remained the militant poacher of his youth.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wasn't it Queen Mary Tudor who had 'Calais 1558' written on her heart?\" asks Jimmy Hill. \"Well, when they finally open me up, they'll find 'Ministry of Labour, January 18, 1961' carved on mine.\" The good old boy, 73 this summer, still juts his anteater's jaw at you to emphasise every earnest point and opinion - which flow in torrents - and, after each, he breaks into the merry chortles that have always engagingly speckled his sporting progress from \u00a37-a-week Brentford inside-forward to broadcasting eminence. Wednesday January 18 1961 was as seminal for English professional football as June 1215 was for the English constitution or May 1660 for the English monarchy. On the steps of the ministry that evening, in time to be lead story for the BBC Home Service's seven o'clock Radio Newsreel, the bearded young chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association (by now a stalwart at Fulham) announced that the footballers of England would call off their strike, having successfully won the abolition of the iniquitous maximum wage of \u00a320 a week (\u00a317 in the summer). Hill made the patriarchal, cigar-chewing Football League president Joe Richards shake hands with him - as well as the Minister of Labour, John Hare, and the chairman of the TUC, Ted Hill - and in no time the pictures of the workers' triumph were circling the world. Of course, it was not actually as simple as that. The distraught league management committee and its reactionary and apoplectic club chairmen spent the following months prevaricating and repatching the agreement, hedging their bets and going back on their word - but to all intents the slim, athletic (and unlikely) luminary of that cold January evening remained the working-class hero, returning to Fulham to be cheered every time he touched the ball. By the start of the following season, even the combative league secretary Alan Hardaker was telling his remaining diehard chairmen to pipe down, for they had effectively been routed by Hill and the PFA's impressive realist of a secretary, Cliff Lloyd. Hardaker admitted that Hill's public relations skills had swung the debate decisively a week before that January 18 meeting - and triggered the involvement of a government fearful of having an electorate with no pools coupons to be filled in. With 344 players from the northern clubs packing the ballroom at Manchester's Grand Hotel, Hill made a stirring call for industrial action on Saturday January 21. Then, on the suggestion of the hawkish Blackburn winger and later Scotland manager, Ally MacLeod, he invited in around 50 waiting journalists to hear him demand: \"Is there any man in this room not prepared to strike on Saturday week?\" Remembers Hill, 40 years on: \"The unanimous no could have come from the Kop at its loudest.\" Rheumy eyes bright in reverie of his militant past, the slippered septuagenarian - four wives, five children, double-figures in grandchildren - is now an upright denizen of Surrey's stockbroker belt. He seems hardly to believe it himself. \"I was just a kid really. Of course, I was keen on working-class rights, but I wasn't really what you'd call a political animal. At Brentford I had been collecting the PFA's weekly subs and when they transferred me to Fulham it coincided with their PFA rep Norman Smith giving up the game. So I continued collecting the subs. The only other thing you were expected to do was try and get to the AGM in the summer. \"The first one I attended was in 1956 and for some reason I found myself defending the rather loose-cannon methods of our then chairman, Jimmy Guthrie of Portsmouth. \"If our opponents can't stand him he must be doing something right,\" I said. So as a penalty for not keeping my big trap shut, they promptly elected me to the eight-man committee of management.\" Within a year, Guthrie had gone and Fulham's Hill was elected PFA chairman. \"I can safely say those extraordinary four years, 1957 to 1961, irrevocably changed my life. Suddenly I was having to argue my case in different parliaments, deal with the media as well as my fellow men in the most delicate matters. A university degree in politics and philosophy couldn't have been more rewarding; the PFA simply gave me a crash course in life and maturity. \"League football had been set in its feudal time warp. January 18 was the watershed, but even in their shell shock the league and its chairmen looked to overturn the agreement. They had spent generations looking down their noses at players and now, even at that meeting at the ministry, they presumed to treat us as inferior beings. Being totally in charge of us was ingrained into their culture. And to find me, not a venerable ex-player but a lad who was still actually playing for a club they controlled, must have been anathema to them.\" Not that the young founder of the feast was able to cash in on the PFA's triumph. Fulham in 1961 had a popular and lively side, with Hill, the ungainly but effective Maurice Cook, the clever Graham Leggatt, and the two future internationals, George Cohen and Alan Mullery, all willingly perspiring around the cool captain of England, Johnny Haynes. The chairman was the comedian Tommy Trinder, and, as Hill's battles swirled around that winter, Trinder announced: \"Haynes is an entertainer like I am, and if the maximum wage is ever abolished, I will pay him what he is worth, which is \u00a3100 a week.\" The nation gasped - and, of course, after January 18, Trinder had to fork out. From his home in Scotland, Haynes remembers with a strained smile: \"It was just a Trinder publicity stunt really, but when Jimmy had led the troops to victory, Trinder was lumbered. I was into his office with my pen and solicitor's sheet of paper, and a couple of journalists outside, before Trinder could gulp. He had to sign, but I suppose he had the last laugh because I may have been the first \u00a3100-a-week player but I played for Fulham another eight years and never got another rise. I was on \u00a3100 a week till I packed up.\" Hill stayed on \u00a318 a week. He did not play long enough even to negotiate a new contract that September. He had injured his right knee at Luton in January 1960 - when Fulham, lying second in the First Division, had been leading 1-0. \"No substitutes then, and we lost 4-1. Still, we were to finish 10th, still Fulham's highest ever league position. And when my knee was patched up and after all the PFA disputes and triumphs, I was happily back in the first team. But it was only going to be a matter of time.\" On March 5 1961, the Sunday Times reported Fulham's 1-0 defeat against Everton: \"Brightest spot of the match was the effort of the bearded Hill. Tireless and covering acres of ground, he never gave up till two minutes from the end, trying to force an equaliser, he received a nasty knock.\" The \"knock\" was a severely torn cartilage in the same right knee. It was his last game as a professional. Fulham claimed \u00a310,000 insurance compensation on his injury - and kept it - so seeing as he had been bought from Brentford for \u00a35,000 eight years before, the club made a \u00a35,000 profit on Hill's 277 matches and 41 goals. The football-mad Boys' Brigade cornet player from Balham, whose first job at 16 had been as a clerk for the London &amp; Lancs insurance company, now prepared for an apprenticeship as a new-fangled \"sports agent\" with the Bagenal Harvey organisation. That September, however, one of the their clients, the England cricketer Jim Laker, introduced Hill to the chairman of Third Division sluggards Coventry City, Derrick Robins - who suggested lunch at Leamington Spa the next day. Hill steered Coventry to the First Division before, in 1967, becoming head of sport for London Weekend Television. Six years later, he was headhunted by the BBC, where he continued to point his chin at the nation and vibrantly pontificate on all matters football for more than a quarter of a century until the end of the 1998 World Cup when (like David Coleman) his contract expired and he left with not so much as a note of thanks, private or public. \"Perhaps they lost my address,\" he says, \"but more likely, in terms of manners and common decency, the BBC hierarchy needs some serious tutoring.\" Sky Sports now employs the spritely ancient - he has given up riding to hounds but still plays a mean three-setter at tennis - and on Wednesday he can be seen chewing over his great political triumph. Perhaps Sky has located that sepia reel of film from the spring of 1961 of Hill's deadly adversary, Hardaker, indulging in his hobby, fishing for shark off the Cornish coast at Looe. He hauls in a 100-pounder and the boatman gives the poor beast a vicious knobkerrie clout. \"Hit it again,\" demands Hardaker. \"It's got a chin like Jimmy Hill.\" He chuckles at that. \"Hardaker was a tough opponent, all right. I took him out to supper a few years later and he reckoned they would have won easily if only his bosses had offered a deal of, say, a \u00a310 rise and set a new maximum wage at \u00a330. As it was, they let loose a free-for-all. \"Not that I've ever changed my beliefs. The battle we fought was for a player to be free to negotiate for what he was worth with no restrictions. That holds good in 2001, and is nothing to do with the David Beckhams of this world being overpaid - he justifies, earns and deserves his money because a super-wealthy club like Manchester United can happily afford him. \"The stupidity which is rife is that outside the top eight or 10 ultra-rich clubs, there are others demanding, and getting, ludicrous salaries when the clubs simply cannot afford them. Even some Third Division players are on \u00a31,000 a week. For their clubs and directors that just means guaranteeing bank loans and consequent debt, debt, debt. Crazy. \"And then, doing their utmost, they get spat on by the fans for not spending more. I've been a director and chairman of three good, modest clubs - Coventry, Charlton and Fulham - and the abuse you get can be cruel and shameful. I've had a wonderful life, and wouldn't change a moment of it professionally - except that I should never have become a director.\" Nice: the old gamekeeper knows, deep down, he should never have jumped the fence; that he should have remained the militant poacher of his youth.",

      "bodyText": "England's poorest areas are set to gain new \"neighbourhood managers\" charged with ensuring communities get the best deal out of the government's regeneration and funding programmes. Ministers believe that resources are not being well used in many areas, and that advocates who are accountable to their local communities can help direct funds to where they are most needed. The managers will also be charged with helping local organisations such as the NHS, police force and local councils tailor their work to meet the needs of residents, who ministers say are too often let down by service providers. The move is part of an action plan that the government today promised would turn the country's worst neighbourhoods around within the next two decades. The plan proposes a combination of investment, service targets in areas such as housing, education and unemployment, and better coordination of government services through partnerships between local people. Prime minister Tony Blair said: \"Too many people in deprived neighbourhoods lead lives blighted by joblessness, high crime levels, run down housing and poor health and education. We need to narrow the gap which separates their communities from the rest of society.\" The government is investing \u00a345m over the next three years to employ the neighbourhood managers. More than 80 councils will be able to apply to take part in the scheme by identifying neighbourhoods, and developing strategies to improve them. They have been selected because they contain more than one ward ranked among the 10% most deprived in England and do not already benefit from new deal for communities aid. It is likely that some neighbourhood managers will be recruited from local government. They will each cover areas of up to 5,000 households. The Conservatives, while not opposed to the measure, said the policy was an attempt to \"paper over the cracks\" of the government's failure to rejuvenate deprived areas. A spokesman said: \"This is no substitute for effective policing.\" The proposals are underpinned by the government's concept of \"local strategic partnerships\" - aimed at bringing residents, community groups and service providers together to focus attention on areas in need. Ministers will back these partnerships by making \u00a336m available to community groups to help them take part and \u00a350m in small-scale grants to promote community action. However, only groups in the 88 areas already earmarked for support from the government's \u00a3800m neighbourhood renewal fund will be able to benefit from the \u00a350m. The government claims the plan will: \u0095 Ensure no area has burglary rates three times higher than the national average by 2005; \u0095 Ensure at least 25% of pupils in every school and 38% in every local authority achieve five or more GCSEs at grades A* to C; \u0095 Eliminate substandard housing by 2010, and reduce it by a third by 2004; \u0095 Narrow health inequality (exact target to be set later); and \u0095 Raise employment in the 30 areas with the worst labour market problems and narrow the gap between these and the overall rate.",

This view was dismissed by the employers but they are anxious not to let the dispute drag on into the main exam season in the summer. Vice-chancellors are now being consulted on whether they want detailed talks on pay and conditions over the next two years to go ahead.",

Ken Williams, chief executive of Bedford Hospital, quit as NHS officials began to investigate why dead bodies were stored in a Chapel of Rest at the hospital after mortuaries became too full. It is unclear whether NHS officials put pressure on Mr Williams to go after a day of damaging and embarrassing press reports. Health secretary Alan Milburn was reported to have \"hit the roof\" when the stories appeared, while NHS chief executive Nigel Crisp called the situation \"entirely unnaceptable\". Mr Williams had initially put out statement apologising to relatives and said the incident \"would not happen again\". But a statement put out later this evening said that he had resigned. NHS investigators said they would be interviewing the clinicians and managers who were responsible for deciding to use the Chapel of Rest as a temporary mortuary. Their report is expected to be complete before the end of the week. Peter Houghton, regional director of NHS eastern region, said: \"The preliminary investigation shows that this was a failure of management in general and that no individual member of staff acted against management guidance. \"The chief executive Ken Williams has discussed the findings of the investigation with the chairman of the trust, Prof Andrew Blowers, and myself, and felt it right to stand down.

      "bodyText": "The government and the national assembly for Wales are preparing special concessions to steel group Corus over the climate change levy as part of a package worth up to \u00a320m to help keep open the Llanwern plant near Newport, Gwent. This emerged over the weekend as a new study warned that more than 2,000 of Britain's heavy industrial firms face a near-\u00a3100m hit from the levy, which takes effect on April 1. Corus, the Anglo-Dutch group, employs around 32,000 in Britain but has set in train 4,700 redundancies and is planning a further round of job losses and closures, possibly including Llanwern, to staunch losses on its UK carbon steel operations. These are likely to have been some \u00a3500m last year. The Department of Trade and Industry and the national assembly are drawing up a package of aid to Corus, one of the groups facing the heaviest charges under the climate change levy, to alleviate its costs. The package, worth between \u00a310m and \u00a320m and designed to escape European Union challenges over illegal state aid, would include grants to improve the environment around the south Wales plant which employs around 3,000 people. Llanwern is the Corus plant most vulnerable to closure under the restructuring plan due to be announced by Sir Brian Moffat, the steel group's chairman and acting chief executive, within the next few weeks. Its closure would be damaging to Labour in the run-up to a general election in May. Under the package being drawn up by Rhodri Morgan, first minister, and his deputy, Mike German, a Liberal Democrat, with DTI ministers, the national assembly would also buy up surplus land around the plant, ease or defer business rates, help finance research and development, and offer training grants. Senior assembly sources accepted yesterday that the package might not be enough to deter Corus from shedding jobs at the south Wales plant but could help prevent complete closure. Their argument has been buttressed by the recent strengthening of the euro which, Mr German estimates, has cut Corus's expected losses this year from \u00a3350m to \u00a3150m. Last week the Engineering Employers Federation said many manufacturing firms were now increasing exports to mainland Europe despite a squeeze on prices and margins. But the EEF warned last night that the climate change levy would cost 2,300 firms with an annual energy bill above \u00a3100,000 a net \u00a382m even after taking into account the 0.3% cut in national insurance contributions on offer. The EEF said the levy would damage competitiveness, prevent companies investing in energy efficiency and penalise those willing to sign challenging efficiency agreements. The EEF, which wants the Treasury to allow more firms to sign agreements in return for a cut in the levy, said that, if only half of the 2,300 signed up, carbon dioxide emissions would be cut by 1.5m tonnes. Martin Temple, director general, said: \"We have never opposed the need for action on climate change but believe the levy to be one of the mostly badly designed economic instruments in recent times. \"We fail to understand why the Treasury, having accepted the reliability of our data, will not accept alternative proposals which would be of greater benefit to the environment while supporting the competitiveness of manufacturing companies.\"",

Economic growth, unemployment, tax cuts: the accepted wisdom is that numbers win or lose elections. If a government gets those numbers right, adds a few emotive themes about yobs and asylum seekers - Bob's your uncle, you've got another five years.</p> <p>But bubbling away beneath these shibboleths of the political establishment, a radical rethink is gaining ground. Broadly summed up, it argues that happiness is a political issue. The Americans put happiness at the heart of their constitution. Jeremy Bentham's guiding principle was \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\". Then happiness dropped out of political debate. Nineteenth-century liberalism rigorously divided up what were issues of public concern and those that could be left to private deliberation. It was up to the individual whether you did or didn't find happiness. It was no business of the state.</p> <p>But that's wearing thin now. Can the state afford to ignore happiness? Five million people a year have some sort of depression-related illness that justifies medical intervention; that's a big bill for the NHS. A survey by the Mental Health Foundation, published last week, found that one in four adults suffers from depression and among students, the proportion has shot up to more than half. Stress levels, according to the economist Andrew Oswald, soared in the 90s, particularly among public-sector workers, leading to Britain having one of the lowest job-satisfaction rates - 36% - in the world. The links to lost days of work, decline in productivity and the exponential rise of those on sickness benefit are all self-evident.</p> <p>The cost of unhappiness is one of the reasons economists have begun to take happiness seriously. One of the most popular sessions at the annual American Economists Association, which finished last week in New Orleans, was all about the economics of happiness. Professor Oswald cites two other conferences on the same subject in the last year, and argues that it's the new big idea, a dramatic challenge to traditional politics.</p> <p>\"The most important thing expected of governments is to make us richer. But we're now so rich in historical terms that for the normal man or woman, more BMWs or beefburgers are not going to transform the quality of their lives. Material things don't make a difference.\" Economists can now talk about happiness, Oswald claims, because they now have reliable data on people's sense of well-being and life satisfaction going back 30 years. Over that period, our living standards have increased dramatically, but it hasn't made us happier. Oswald's research shows that rates of happiness in the UK have been absolutely static and have plunged in America.</p> <p>Depending on which research you plump for, we're either getting more miserable or staying the same; either could throw some light on our political culture of declining voter turnouts and party membership, and its profound cynicism. Doesn't it also begin to make some sense of the prevalent \"whatever I vote won't make any difference, they're all the same\" attitudes among voters? Such attitudes baffle and frustrate the government, prompting them to ever more attempts to get \"their message across\". But the message doesn't get through; this attitude is peculiarly impervious to any demonstration of facts, such as increased public spending or economic growth. It's a profoundly emotional reaction not susceptible to debate and persuasion. Election victory on May 3 for Tony Blair will not be a positive endorsement so much as a gesture of resignation, and even in some quarters, of despair.</p> <p>Into this territory come two new wonderfully subversive books. Firstly, David Boyle has taken on our Gradgrind obsession with measurement in The Tyranny of Numbers, Why Counting Can't Make Us Happy. We love measuring and statistics because it offers the illusion of control but, Boyle asserts, \"the closer you get to measuring what's really important, the more it escapes you. Because number-crunching brings a kind of blindness with it. When we measure life, we reduce it.\" He refers to EF Schumacher's argument in Small Is Beautiful, that cost-benefit analysis was destroying civilisation because it concentrated on differences in quantity while suppressing differences in quality. Boyle warns that, because of our desire to measure, \"we are now in a world that is designed to be measured, that praises and promotes people with hard measuring skills and downgrades those with human imaginative ones\". The result, he writes, is that \"Things that can't be measured - love, creativity, awe, religion, altruism - get forgotten ... and sometimes get ridiculed too.\"</p> <p>Boyle describes the unhappy pickle we've got ourselves into, rather than offering how we get out of it. The latter challenge is one taken up with relish by the second book, Politics On the Couch by Andrew Samuels. This is a hugely ambitious bid to recast political debate by a Jungian psychotherapist who explores how to reconnect the private, personal experience to the public realm. He challenges the 19th-century liberal division between public and private, arguing that the compartmentalisation makes no sense for individuals or society. Too many political issues are both; deeply emotional experiences, but influenced by and affecting society. Family policy is an obvious example, but so is equal opportunities, as it reflects the ambivalent and fraught issue of gender. So also is the environment, which, he claims, drawing from his clinical experience, has become a cause of profound anxiety. So is happiness, which is why he proposes a national emotional audit. Could such a suggestion find its way into Yvette Cooper's election manifesto in 2009?</p> <p>Samuels is bidding to drag psychotherapy back to its original ambition as conceived by Freud and Jung, not just to treat the neuroses of the individual but to grapple with the whole society, its politics and its organisation. His thesis is profoundly optimistic, arguing that the radical, reforming, idealistic political passions have not disappeared but gone underground into myriad personal projects, from alternative lifestyles and organic farming to personal development through psychotherapy. Reconnect these private endeavours to the public realm and it will be the source of renewal. The great illusion of the neo-liberal free marketeers that needs to be shattered is that of our individualistic separateness. What we need is a reappreciation of our connectedness - and of its political, emotional and spiritual elements. So he describes how you put the emotional and spiritual into politics, and the political back into the private.</p> <p>Both books challenge the rigidity of conventional politics with its unquestioned assumptions about what is and isn't possible, and accuse it of a failure of collective imagination. Many will argue back that happiness only becomes a political issue for someone when they have a job. True. Happiness is part of a new political terrain: let's call it the politics of depressed affluence. It's for when our economy is growing, and unemployment falling and we can afford to shift the focus from how to make two-thirds of society richer than ever before to how to achieve the greatest happiness of the greatest number - meeting emotional and needs as well as material ones. Then we start debating trust, morale, satisfaction, fulfilment and what it is that makes us happy.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "An imperturbable William Hague yesterday brushed aside fresh opinion poll gloom for the Tories and predicted that he would come from behind, as Edward Heath did in 1970, and win the general election expected in May. The Conservative leader coupled his optimism with a well-timed attempt to put Tony Blair on the spot over the prospect of a televised debate between the party leaders, by publicly abandoning his past rejection of a three-way debate involving the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy. \"I think there should be a debate between the party leaders, and I accept without any qualification the terms of the BBC/ITV proposal for two debates in the election campaign. I challenge him to accept that,\" Mr Hague said on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme. \"He needn't think about it for another 10 minutes. Let's have the debates agreed, straight away.\" Incumbent prime ministers who expect to win have always rejected debate challenges from underdogs in the past. And Mr Hague spoke as the Sunday Telegraph's Mori poll gave Labour a 21-point lead over the Tories (52% to 31%, with the Lib Dems on 11%). The Sunday Times's NOP poll reported a 48% to 33% Labour lead. Downing Street last night refused to budge from its ear lier formula that a TV debate is fine in principle but cannot be agreed until the details are finalised. Instead it led a scornful ministerial attack on Mr Hague for wasting his first TV interview of the year on the debate issue rather than on \"the things that really matter\". The Tory leader yesterday offered voters glimpses of what a Hague government might do when he spoke of \"giving people back their country\" after a Labour regime had handed it over to Brussels, to political correctness and to criminals. He dismissed Labour's claim that his tax-and-spend policies are billions of pounds adrift. He said he planned to cut Labour's promise of \u00a368bn extra public spending on key services to around \u00a360bn, which - the Tories say - is affordable and would help create room for tax cuts. Challenged by Sir David Frost, Mr Hague insisted that he could save public money by cutting back the extra \u00a31.8bn being spent on Whitehall, making housing benefit more efficient and diverting extra funds in the Home Office budget to pay for more police. Labour called his sums bogus. On Ann Widdecombe's proposal that new asylum seekers should be housed in secure centres, which Labour claims would cost \u00a33bn, Mr Hague said: \"It must follow from our proposals to be tougher about the asylum system that we would deter unwarranted applications for asylum and that costs would come down.\" Although he admitted that the Tories still had \"more work to do to win people over\", Mr Hague's tone astonished Labour and the Lib Dems, whose hopes of a fresh tactical voting squeeze against sitting Tory MPs Mr Hague had called \"a little arrogant\". The social security secretary, Alistair Darling, accused Mr Hague of \"making up policy on the hoof\" and getting confused. The Scottish secretary, John Reid, said Mr Hague had made no positive proposals. Despite defeatism on the Tory benches the Hague camp has been cheered by a string of local election wins. He also argued that the euro would be a crucial campaign feature. \"I'm in touch with thousands of people and it is because of that I know the next election is all there for the taking,\" Mr Hague said. \"Remember in the 1970 election Ted Heath faced a 14% Labour lead.

As for Mr Murray's \"they're due one\" comments, frankly I expect better of Scott; this is the sort of talk I expect in a dingy smoke-filled betting office in the stupider end of London not in the intellectual hotpot that is the Football Unlimited office.</p> <p>Hindsight is a wonderful thing, I know, but I have to think that a better market to play on in this case was the Asian handicap where Chelsea could be backed at evens not to lose. With a draw always more likely than a Chelsea win, in my eyes at least, this would seem to be the way forward in this case. </p> <p>But then, in view of his very healthy Blue Square account balance accrued through bets just like this one, who am I to argue with the legend that is Scott Murray. </p> <p><strong>Sean Ingle: </strong> Real Sociedad v Athletic Bilbao: Real Sociedad to win: \u00a310 at 11/8 </p> <p>Mr Ingle promises us a new beginning, a new Sean fulfilling his obvious potential and turning his season around a la Middlesbrough. Alas he hasn't got off to a winning start but just as Terry Venables will inevitably do better than the hapless Robson so the new Mr I will inevitably do better than the old Mr I given time. </p> <p>Value singles on obscure matches, what more could a punting mentor/ Chinese dictator ask for? Better luck next week Mr I. I will be cheering you on, honest.</p> <p><strong>Julian Rouche of the Football Unlimited Punters Collective: </strong> Rennes to win at Metz: \u00a35 @ 13/8 </p> <p>A valiant attempt by the inestimable Mr Rouche, a value single on an obscure match cruelly thwarted by an eighty-sixth minute equaliser. The name of Meyrieu will live long in the FUPC hall of infamy. Sadly the bankroll has now fallen below forty pounds, but with four months of punting left there's still time to get it all back. The important thing is not to panic; keep plugging away at the value and it will pay off.</p> <p>Don't I say that every week? And does it ever actually happen? Nevertheless I still believe it. This time next year, Rodney</p> <p><strong>Paul MacInnes: </strong> West Ham v Sunderland: Half-time/full-time draw/draw \u00a34 @ 4/1 </p> <p>Blimey, not a multiple to be found among our intrepid punters this week, what is the world coming to? Not a single winner either unfortunately, a bit of a kick in the mouth for the Murray doctrine of value singles but value is a long term strategy, Rome wasn't built in a day, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs and other more or less appropriate cliches.</p> <p>For Mr MacInnes, unfortunately, losers are becoming a serious matter but as I never tire of saying it is a marathon not a sprint and as long as one keeps one's discipline and self-belief the situation is retrievable. A little less flippancy and a little more cold hard logic might help but I understand Mr M is a busy man and we should, I guess, never forget we are in the entertainment business. Dull 0-0 draws may bring home the bacon but do they keep the customers happy? Probably, particularly if you've got a tenner on no goalscorer.</p> <p>But enough of this. With the NFL season drawing to an end the real gambling value is over until next September; betting on association football is always a struggle by comparison, but not an insurmountable struggle, and I will return next week to continue my 'value singles' crusade. </p> <p>Until then, happy punting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Current totals (from their initial \u00a3100 kitties): Scott Murray = \u00a3159.69, Sean Ingle = \u00a352.75, Football Unlimited punters collective = \u00a339.53, Paul MacInnes = \u00a333.35 Scott Murray: Arsenal v Chelsea: Chelsea to win: \u00a310 @ 10/3 An unbeaten home side takes on a team yet to win away - I know I say avoid the obvious but backing Chelsea is taking it too far I fear. As for Mr Murray's \"they're due one\" comments, frankly I expect better of Scott; this is the sort of talk I expect in a dingy smoke-filled betting office in the stupider end of London not in the intellectual hotpot that is the Football Unlimited office. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, I know, but I have to think that a better market to play on in this case was the Asian handicap where Chelsea could be backed at evens not to lose. With a draw always more likely than a Chelsea win, in my eyes at least, this would seem to be the way forward in this case. But then, in view of his very healthy Blue Square account balance accrued through bets just like this one, who am I to argue with the legend that is Scott Murray. Sean Ingle: Real Sociedad v Athletic Bilbao: Real Sociedad to win: \u00a310 at 11/8 Mr Ingle promises us a new beginning, a new Sean fulfilling his obvious potential and turning his season around a la Middlesbrough. Alas he hasn't got off to a winning start but just as Terry Venables will inevitably do better than the hapless Robson so the new Mr I will inevitably do better than the old Mr I given time. Value singles on obscure matches, what more could a punting mentor/ Chinese dictator ask for? Better luck next week Mr I. I will be cheering you on, honest. Julian Rouche of the Football Unlimited Punters Collective: Rennes to win at Metz: \u00a35 @ 13/8 A valiant attempt by the inestimable Mr Rouche, a value single on an obscure match cruelly thwarted by an eighty-sixth minute equaliser. The name of Meyrieu will live long in the FUPC hall of infamy. Sadly the bankroll has now fallen below forty pounds, but with four months of punting left there's still time to get it all back. The important thing is not to panic; keep plugging away at the value and it will pay off. Don't I say that every week? And does it ever actually happen? Nevertheless I still believe it. This time next year, Rodney Paul MacInnes: West Ham v Sunderland: Half-time/full-time draw/draw \u00a34 @ 4/1 Blimey, not a multiple to be found among our intrepid punters this week, what is the world coming to? Not a single winner either unfortunately, a bit of a kick in the mouth for the Murray doctrine of value singles but value is a long term strategy, Rome wasn't built in a day, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs and other more or less appropriate cliches. For Mr MacInnes, unfortunately, losers are becoming a serious matter but as I never tire of saying it is a marathon not a sprint and as long as one keeps one's discipline and self-belief the situation is retrievable. A little less flippancy and a little more cold hard logic might help but I understand Mr M is a busy man and we should, I guess, never forget we are in the entertainment business. Dull 0-0 draws may bring home the bacon but do they keep the customers happy? Probably, particularly if you've got a tenner on no goalscorer. But enough of this. With the NFL season drawing to an end the real gambling value is over until next September; betting on association football is always a struggle by comparison, but not an insurmountable struggle, and I will return next week to continue my 'value singles' crusade. Until then, happy punting.",

About half of the corpses were unidentified, he said. </p> <p>With aftershocks measuring up to 5.4 on the Richter scale rattling the unstable mass of soil and rubble, there was no safe place to keep the 182 bodies found in the area so far. </p> <p>Some corpses lay peacefully on the pavement as if the victims were sleeping. Some were covered in bin liners. </p> <p>El Salvador's president, Francisco Flores, has asked Colombia to send 300 coffins. </p> <p>Red Cross official Mildred Sandoval said 403 deaths had been confirmed across the central American country. Police also reported 2,000 injured, 4,692 houses destroyed and 16,148 damaged. Authorities said about 1,000 people were still missing, most in Las Colinas, six miles east of the capital, San Salvador. </p> <p>Saturday's earthquake off of El Salvador's coast was felt from northern Panama to central Mexico - a distance of more than 1,100 miles. Yesterday's aftershocks were centered within a few miles of the capital, according to local seismologists. </p> <p>Pope John Paul II urged international assistance for the nation of 6m. Offers of help came from Mexico, the United States, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, Britain, Panama, even Guatemala, which itself suffered six deaths in the quake. </p> <p>Unlike on Saturday night in El Salvador, when hundreds of survivors steered diggers to areas where their family members might be buried, markedly fewer people waited for relatives and friends to emerge from the immense landslide yesterday. </p> <p>\"Most of those that are under there now were with their families when they died,\" said police officer Rafael Hernandez. \"With everyone already dead, there is no one here to claim many of the bodies we find now.\" </p> <p>But as some gave up hope, one survivor was found from beneath tons of soil late last night. </p> <p>Workers rescued 22-year-old Sergio Moreno, who was trapped for 30 hours under slabs of concrete.

      "bodyText": "Authorities in El Salvador today said many of the 400 earthquake victims were buried in mass graves. A landslide triggered by the earthquake had wiped out entire families, making it impossible to identify many of the dead. Distraught relatives lined up yesterday at an improvised morgue in a bloodstained alleyway to identify some of those mangled and entombed in Saturday's quake, which measured 7.6 on the Richter scale. But the need to dispose of the mounting number of corpses cheated some of the chance for closure. One woman looking for a pair of missing cousins showed up at the morgue in the half-buried Las Colinas district, only to find out that two children who matched their description had already been sent to a mass burial. \"My cousins are similar to the ages of the ones you buried, and they are missing,\" 18-year-old Kenya Marbella told soldiers, who said it was too late to see the bodies. \"How could you just throw bodies in the ground like that? With no refrigeration facilities, and bodies and body parts piling up in the alley near the quake-triggered landslide that covered Las Colinas in a wall of dirt, there was little choice but mass burial, said coroner Mario Alfredo Hernandez. About half of the corpses were unidentified, he said. With aftershocks measuring up to 5.4 on the Richter scale rattling the unstable mass of soil and rubble, there was no safe place to keep the 182 bodies found in the area so far. Some corpses lay peacefully on the pavement as if the victims were sleeping. Some were covered in bin liners. El Salvador's president, Francisco Flores, has asked Colombia to send 300 coffins. Red Cross official Mildred Sandoval said 403 deaths had been confirmed across the central American country. Police also reported 2,000 injured, 4,692 houses destroyed and 16,148 damaged. Authorities said about 1,000 people were still missing, most in Las Colinas, six miles east of the capital, San Salvador. Saturday's earthquake off of El Salvador's coast was felt from northern Panama to central Mexico - a distance of more than 1,100 miles. Yesterday's aftershocks were centered within a few miles of the capital, according to local seismologists. Pope John Paul II urged international assistance for the nation of 6m. Offers of help came from Mexico, the United States, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, Britain, Panama, even Guatemala, which itself suffered six deaths in the quake. Unlike on Saturday night in El Salvador, when hundreds of survivors steered diggers to areas where their family members might be buried, markedly fewer people waited for relatives and friends to emerge from the immense landslide yesterday. \"Most of those that are under there now were with their families when they died,\" said police officer Rafael Hernandez. \"With everyone already dead, there is no one here to claim many of the bodies we find now.\" But as some gave up hope, one survivor was found from beneath tons of soil late last night. Workers rescued 22-year-old Sergio Moreno, who was trapped for 30 hours under slabs of concrete. He had drawn rescuers' attention by tapping on the concrete. Red Cross volunteer Lucio Castellano said Mr Moreno had suffered dehydration and a cut leg but was in good condition otherwise. Yesterday afternoon, a powerful aftershock caused more of the hillside to collapse, sending rescuers fleeing in panic. Nobody was injured. Specially trained dogs, sent in from the United States and Mexico, sniffed for the living and the dead under the blinding sun. One led authorities to the battered body of a Las Colinas man who was wearing nothing but a navy blue bathing suit when the earthquake killed him. His body went unclaimed. Meanwhile, those who could identify their dead held hundreds of funerals yesterday. \"Oh, mama, tell me how this could happen, tell me what else I could have done,\" stammered Jose Cruz Torres, who buried three sisters and three grandchildren yesterday. \"It's like the world here is upside down.\" Related articles Comment by George Monbiot Gallery: the story in pictures 15.01.2001: Damage delays aid as search continues 15.01.2001: Eyewitness: 'the mountain tumbled down' 15.01.2001: How the earthquake happened Relief appeal Oxfam in El Salvador Local media Teledos (Spanish) La Prensa Gr\u0087fica (Spanish) El Diario de Hoy (Spanish) El Salvador magazine (Spanish) La Naci\u0097n Useful links Digital world tectonic activity map explorezone.com: earthquakes USGS earthquake bulletins Are you ready for an earthquake?

This emerged over the weekend as a new study warned that more than 2,000 of Britain's heavy industrial firms face a near-\u00a3100m hit from the levy, which takes effect on April 1. Corus, the Anglo-Dutch group, employs around 32,000 in Britain but has set in train 4,700 redundancies and is planning a further round of job losses and closures, possibly including Llanwern, to staunch losses on its UK carbon steel operations. These are likely to have been some \u00a3500m last year. The Department of Trade and Industry and the national assembly are drawing up a pack age of aid to Corus, one of the groups facing the heaviest charges under the climate change levy, to alleviate its costs. The package, worth between \u00a310m and \u00a320m and designed to escape European Union challenges over illegal state aid, would include grants to improve the environment around the south Wales plant which employs around 3,000 people. Llanwern is the Corus plant most vulnerable to closure under the restructuring plan due to be announced by Sir Brian Moffat, the steel group's chairman and acting chief executive, within the next few weeks. Its closure would be damaging to Labour in the run-up to a general election in May. Under the package being drawn up by Rhodri Morgan, first minister, and his deputy, Mike German, a Liberal Democrat, with DTI ministers, the national assembly would also buy up surplus land around the plant, ease or defer business rates, help finance research and development, and offer training grants. Senior assembly sources accepted yesterday that the package might not be enough to deter Corus from shedding jobs at the south Wales plant but could help prevent complete closure. Their argument has been buttressed by the recent strengthening of the euro which, Mr German estimates, has cut Corus's expected losses this year from \u00a3350m to \u00a3150m. Last week the Engineering Employers Federation said many manufacturing firms were now increasing exports to mainland Europe despite a squeeze on prices and margins. But the EEF warned last night that the climate change levy would cost 2,300 firms with an annual energy bill above \u00a3100,000 a net \u00a382m even after taking into account the 0.3% cut in national insurance contributions on offer. The EEF said the levy would damage competitiveness, prevent companies investing in energy efficiency and penalise those willing to sign challenging efficiency agreements. The EEF, which wants the Treasury to allow more firms to sign agreements in return for a cut in the levy, said that, if only half of the 2,300 signed up, carbon dioxide emissions would be cut by 1.5m tonnes. Martin Temple, director general, said: \"We have never opposed the need for action on climate change but believe the levy to be one of the mostly badly designed economic instruments in recent times. \"We fail to understand why the Treasury, having accepted the reliability of our data, will not accept alternative proposals which would be of greater benefit to the environment while supporting the competitiveness of manufacturing companies.\"",

It was feared that many hundreds were still buried by the rubble in a suburb of the capital, San Salvador, and in rural areas throughout the country, and that the final death toll would be well over 1,000. As the death toll rose, El Salvador's president, Francisco Flores, said he had asked Colombia for 3,000 coffins. The earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.6, struck hardest at middle-class Las Colinas, where a landslide following the first tremors carried away whole houses, burying an estimated 400 of them. There were more deaths elsewhere in El Salvador, and in neighbouring Guatemala as aftershocks continued throughout the day. The effects were felt in Honduras and Nicaragua and as far away as Mexico City, 600 miles from the epicentre, where buildings swayed. President Flores immediately declared a national emergency and called for international help in the search and to assist survivors. \"We need support from experts in rescue, reopening communications, food and medicine,\" he said. \"I have received calls from various heads of state who are activating their assistance teams to help us in these difficult moments.\" The rescue operation was complicated by the closure of the only international airport. The entire country was without electricity for several hours and most of the telephones were out of order, making it hard to discover the extent of the damage in outlying areas, where at least 25 deaths were reported. A dozen bus passengers were reported to have been buried in a landslide. By noon at least 234 people were known to have been killed. Radio stations went off the air and businesses throughout the capital closed. In a bizarre touch, acrobats and other performers from a visiting circus continued to tour the city centre promoting their shows.. There are several aid organisations already in the country, some still helping the victims of Hurricane Mitch, and they were able to join in the rescue operation almost immediately.

By last night, it was supplying 40%of El Salvador's power, up from less than 10% normally. Britain pledged \u00a3100,000 to the Red Cross for use in El Salvador, and around \u00a334,000 in other emergency aid. Other help and offers of help came from France, Germany, Spain and Taiwan. The epicentre was in the Pacific about 20 miles off the southern coast of El Salvador and 65 miles from the capital, the US Geological Survey said. For El Salvador, the smallest country in central America with a population of 6.2m, it is the latest in a series of disasters which have included civil war and hurricanes.

It also says disk drives and directories on staff PCs will be routinely monitored \"You should not therefore have any expectation of personal privacy when using the department's IT facilities for personal use.\" The NHS IT strategy, called Building the Information Core, sets a target of giving net access to all NHS staff by April 2003, and warns that the NHS faces a \"major behavioural, culture changechallenge\" in becoming more e-savvy. A recent internal review of DoH plans for electronic government found that the department was generally unprepared to exploit the electronic revolution. It said: \"The benefits of e-systems are not generally fully understood at senior management level.\"",

The four-year strategy promises a electronic booking system for appointments, electronic medical records, video and tele-consultations for patients, and electronically transmitted laboratory test results. All doctors, nurses and clinical support staff will be hooked up to the net within two years, while remaining NHS staff will have workplace access to the internet and email within four years. Both professionals and patients will have access to \"trustworthy and clearly (NHS) branded advice and information\" on healthcare on the internet allowing staff to keep up to date with medical practice and enabling patients to be involved in their own care. The strategy, entitled Building the Information Core - Implementing the NHS Plan, promises a \"vibrant, networked\" NHS by 2005. But it warns that the NHS will have to undergo massive cultural change to the way it works if it is to take advantage of the internet. It warns: \"There is a major behavioural, cultural change and organisational development challenge in redesigning care services around the individual, and establishing a 'network NHS'. \"Everyone - individuals, multi-disciplinary teams and care organisations - will need to think through the way that they work.\" Ministers are convinced that increased use of electronic communications will cut out much of the delays and inefficiencies in accessing NHS care that frustrate patients. GPs will be able to book hospital appointments for their patients directly by internet at the time of their consultation, rather than though a protracted exchange of letters through the post. The strategy says this will give patients \"more choice and convenience, with less wasted time through cancelled operations and improved management of waiting lists\". Tele-links to hospital specialists from the GP surgery will allow patients to get on the spot expert advice on their condition, rather than having to travel into hospital. Laboratory test results will be ordered and received electronically, \"giving patients less delay and worry and clinicians less bureaucracy with earlier diagnosis and treatment and improved outcomes\". Electronic patient records - possibly held on \"smart cards\" - will be introduced, allowing staff access to individual medical histories \"to enable them to provide the highest quality care when and where it is needed\". Hospital trusts will be expected to provide varying levels of internet access to all staff, varying from desk top personal computers for medical secretaries to hand held mobile phones for community nurses. Health secretary Alan Milburn said the strategy would make technology central to patient care, rather than \"something to be left to the IT specialists\". Mr Milburn added: \"Patients will see a difference.

The strategy's solution is to draw up national lists of approved systems, from which hospitals can pick without unnecessary bureaucracy. The snag is that such lists take years to draw up, with IT firms fighting like ferrets in a sack to get onto them. In the meantime, technology moves on and the targets loom closer. There are no quick fixes.",

Um and ah when English Len is giving you first option on good-quality registration plates, for example, and you'll soon know the medical definition of procrastination.

The six main partners in the European project are: CERN, based in Geneva; CNRS, in France - Le Comit\u008e National de la Recherche Scientifique; ESRIN - The European Space Agency's Centre in Frascati (near Rome); INFN, in Italy - Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare; NIKHEF - The Dutch National Institute for Nuclear Physics and High Energy Physics, in Amsterdam, and PPARC.",

Adding to the feeling of being 'overwhelmed' by the web, 13% of those questioned said another reason for not shopping online was the fear of their presents not turning up on time.

      "bodyText": "Britain's county courts face an overhaul, under government plans announced today to cut costs and modernise the court system by allowing litigants to settle civil lawsuits over the internet. The court service aims to \"rationalise\" its 222 county courts and replace some of their services with a new website to administer civil claims normally made in person or by post. The plans, unveiled today by the Lord Chancellor's department, will update a court system that has hardly changed since the 1840s. A consultation paper, Modernising the Civil Courts, proposes a future of \"paperless court rooms\", where evidence is submitted electronically and writs settled entirely online. Annoucing the plans, David Lock, a minister in the Lord Chancellor's department, said that the courts are \"scattered through the country in a way which owes more to history than to logic or customers' needs today.\" Mr Lock said that the online system should result in cheaper and faster settlement of claims for litigants. \"We want internet technology to provide round the clock access,\" he said. \"It's very important that we receive the best elements of traditional and face-to-face justice in our courts while, at the same time, accessing the benefits of new technology.\" Preston county court will be the first to handle claims online. From 5 February, litigants will be able to use the internet to file an initial application to the court. The Lord Chancellor's office plans to introduce further elements of the claims process, such as straightforward money claims, at a later date. In addition, two pilot schemes of electronic centres offering advice on the court system are being set up in Shropshire. Some county courts in towns and cities could be closed to make sure centres for legal hearing are better spread through England and Wales - for example, two of London's 16 country courts are just one mile apart. Meanwhile, courts backroom workers could be centralised to cut costs, says the report, meaning that fewer staff will be needed. People who do not have access to a computer could still use the internet system through the Citizens' Advice Bureau, libraries and digital television, or use the traditional application methods in person at new legal hearing centres in existing buildings such as magistrates or coroners courts.

      "bodyText": "A new website backed by Labour peer Lord Hollick has been attacked by the Direct Marketing Association for breaching its guidelines on marketing to kids via the net. The DMA said Sub-Club.com - the newly launched kids portal backed by Lord Hollick's United Business Media - was wrong to target kids without having a foolproof way of obtaining parents' consent. Marketing to children is a particularly sensitive issue at a time when the new Swedish presidency of the EU is urging a pan-European ban on advertising aimed at children. Sub-Club.com is attempting to combine the e-commerce potential of a shopping mall with the interactivity of a chat room. It has teamed up with brands including Woolworths and Micro Skate Scooter to target seven to 18-year-olds. Chief executive Naomi Gibney said the site was fully compliant with the Data Protection Act and stressed that children were unable to stray into other sites. She claimed it e-mails parents to obtain permission before children complete transactions. However, Jo White, director of legal and public affairs at the DMA, said this was generally insufficient. \"I'm sure Sub-Club is a responsible company but our guidelines are clear on the issue,\" she said. \"If you're taking data from a child you must have explicit consent from a parent or guardian and at present this must be obtained offline to ensure it is genuine.\" Ms White said these guidelines were also the benchmark of TrustUK, the online marketing sector's self-regulatory body. Because Sub-Club is not a DMA member, it admits it can take no action other than express its disapproval.",

In one test, nursing students were put in a room and asked to choose between two T-shirts, one of which was laced with a pheromone. The study found that some were strongly attracted to the pheromone T-shirt, but others were put off by it.

But Australian academics at Southern Cross University have found that particular pheromones can produce very different reactions among women. In one test, nursing students were put in a room and asked to choose between two T-shirts, one of which was laced with a pheromone. The study found that some were strongly attracted to the pheromone T-shirt, but others were put off by it. The researchers are still convinced that pheromone sprays in shops could directly and subconsciously affect the purchasing decisions of females. Tests carried out at the University of Northumbria last year showed that women found ugly men more attractive when they were secretly exposed to the chemicals found in their armpits. Finally, scientists think they have got to the bottom of the major question in all sex surveys: why men report higher numbers of partners than women. Academics at the University of Washington found that studies about human sexual activity leave out one crucial factor: prostitutes. The researchers conclude that women working as prostitutes are under-represented in the surveys.",

The UK's biggest supermarket will appear before 15 European judges in a landmark legal battle with jean-maker Levi Strauss. Levi's is trying to control the distribution, and ultimately the premium status, of its jeans brand, which Tesco has been importing from cheaper countries outside the EU and selling at a discount to British shoppers. Brands such as Levi's believe they are protected by a 1998 case - known as the Silhouette judgement - which allows the brand owner to tell importers where, and to whom its products can be sold. But Tesco will argue that once a product has been bought, the new owner has every right to decide what to do with it. It claims brand owners are hampering free trade and deliberately keeping prices artificially high for EU consumers. Just before Christmas, Tesco smuggled in 2,500 Sony Playstation 2 consoles - the next consignment of which has been delayed by Sony - and put them on sale at the recommended retail price in its stores. It criticised Sony for deliberately restricting the popular toy from consumers.",

      "body": "<p>My worst present has to be bubble bath, which I often receive from several people, including my mother. What's wrong with that? Well for the last ten years I have lived in this house and we only have a shower! <br><strong>Lynn Mercer </strong></p> <p>A few years ago air plants were all the rage. My sister decided to buy me one, so she chose a very attractive plant, growing on a branch, which she lovingly and carefully wrapped up with a nice ribbon. A month later Xmas arrived, I opened up my beautifully wrapped present and was presented with a completely dead bit of mould on a dry twig. Air plants might not need food but they do need light apparently. <br><strong>Steve Palmer </strong></p> <p>My worst Xmas present was from a young man that I was seeing three years ago. We had been together for several months and the relationship was getting quite serious. I was hoping for anything that spelt romance - a ring or bracelet - to give me some clue as to how he really felt about me. I was therefore shocked and disappointed when the package he gave me, when unwrapped, revealed a frying pan. As an independent woman who does not picture herself as becoming a housewife, this was devastating as it showed me exactly how he perceived my future role. I had to dump him! <br><strong>Madeline Lewis </strong></p> <p>I got a month's supply of X-Fat - need I say more! <br><strong>Jackie Brennan</strong></p> <p>My two children (aged eight and eleven) spent their first Christmas with me since I separated from their mum three years ago. Christmas morning saw much giggling as I opened their present to me which was an inflatable head support for the bath - in the form of a pair of black lace clad boobs. They hadn't realised what they were for and thought I would wear them! <br><strong>Simon Wood </strong></p> <p>Upon grabbing a strange shaped squidgy package from my stocking, imagine my surprise and amusement as I eagerly ripped the paper off a pair of inflatable doggy slippers, that's right - blow-up slippers! As we rarely hoover the floor in our house I wonder how long it will be before I burst the puppies attached to my cold feet. <br><strong>Chris Hutcheon </strong></p> <p>My worst present was a broken picture. A friend sent a very cheap (pink plastic framed) landscape picture (he was unemployed at the time). Unfortunately the postman left the package in the garage as there was nobody at home. Unknown to me, my wife had found the package after driving over it with the car - she did not know she had done this. It had been bubble wrapped and taped up, wrapped in Xmas paper then packaged in brown paper so the effect of a large car driving over it was masked until I opened it on Xmas day! I must admit I felt sorry for our friend who had wasted his money to buy something. The picture was awful even if it had been undamaged. It got dumped rather rapidly in the bin. My friend was duly thanked for his generosity. I am always very careful now when driving into the garage especially in the dark during winter one never knows what might have been sent! <br><strong>John Lasocki </strong></p> <p>A couple of years ago whilst a student, I unwrapped at least five bad presents including floor cleaner, scouring pads, furniture polish, bleach and drain cleaner....nice. I think my mum was trying to tell me something. They made a significant pile under the tree and to say I was disappointed would be no lie. <br><strong>Dan Wright </strong></p> <p>I once received a garden spade from my husband, cunningly wrapped to look like... a spade, that was a real surprise!! That was only surpassed by the gift of a trowel the following year. Now I do like gardening, but I wasn't going to dig the flower beds in December. I think I would have preferred slippers, come to think of it, I think I got those a year later together with a natty pair of gardening gloves! <br><strong>Sally Rose </strong></p> <p>I have to say my worst Xmas present of all time was given to me this year. My aunty Sue sent me a pack of three men's briefs all in a highly attractive fleshy colour - considering the fact that I am of the fairer sex these are the most useless Xmas present ever. I can't even wrap them up again and send them to someone else as I don't know anyone who would even consider wearing a pair of fleshy pants - a real passion killer!!!!! I don't know how to thank her for this attractive gift either - I've been putting off writing a 'thank you' letter - any ideas??!! <br><strong> Jennie Agarwala </strong></p> <p>I mentioned that as a new year's resolution I'd try to lose some weight and wouldn't mind something at Christmas to help me in my quest. I open my present on Christmas Day expecting some weights or running shoes, but oh no... My wife had bought me a Rosemary Conley keep fit video! <br><strong>David Hopwood</strong></p> <p>I got my worst ever Christmas present this year - a pair of old fashion pyjamas four sizes too big. <br><strong>Madelaine Merriman </strong></p> <p>The worse Christmas present I got was a parcel from my family containing food and goodies from Norway, home made cookies, etc.. ( I was backpacking in Australia at the time). The parcel got delayed and forced me to stay in Cairns for an extra week (wrecking my budget in the process). I was charged a fortune to clear it through customs, who confiscated half of the food inside because it is was not allowed to be imported in to Oz, and the remaining food was inedible - the cookies were smashed to bits, a glass pot of herrings had leaked and I had to throw the whole lot in the bin! It was a total disaster, but I did not say anything to my folks, just thank you!! <br><strong>Frederic Degeilh </strong></p> <p>Having expensive taste and maxing out my credit cards, my friends joke that I'm the girl who has everything (even if I can't afford it all!) and they got together and bought me a belly-button brush for Christmas (to remove belly-button fluff, I presume). It was quickly discarded! <br><strong>Tracy Johnson </strong></p> <p>My worst and most least thought out present was from my father. He wrapped up a second hand Philips School Atlas as my Christmas present. I am 41 years old and have teenage sons (I am not a school teacher). He then had the audacity to write on it \"I thought the boys might get some use out of this\"! Up to that point we had not even fallen out! I think he has decided to take over from where his own mother left as she used to give out whatever she had in the house at the time. One year my whole family were the happy recipients of a tin of rice pudding: that is apart from my father who received a bowl of Kellogs Cornflakes - but then he was always her favourite. <br><strong>Phil Shelton </strong></p> <p>The worst present was this Christmas. I got a minidisc carrier. Sounds good, but I don't have a minidisc, my mother mistook it for something else and bought the wrong thing. The worst thing about it was that it was the first present I opened so until my mum explained I though I was actually getting a minidisc. Gutted. A Handspring Palm Top would ease the pain and torture though. <br><strong>Steve Hornby </strong></p> <p>The worst Christmas present I ever received was from a girl I was seeing around three years ago. I agonised over what would be a suitable present for her, as we hadn't been seeing each other that long and to be honest, I wasn't sure how much longer the relationship was going to last anyway. I finally settled on a rather sweet glass bowl, some of those floating candles and a copy of 'It's a Wonderful Life' on video. Nice. Anyway, I was out at a Christmas do and came back home to see that she had let herself into my flat (she had a key and everything...). She was sitting on the couch, wine in hand, presents in her lap and after a while we got round to opening the gifts. She seemed very happy with hers so I was made up. Then it came to opening mine. I suppose that I should've suspected something was amiss when she said \"I just know that you're going to hate this...\" I opened it up and looked at what it was. A metal atomiser was sitting in my hand with a star embossed on the front. It was a fragrance that I had never heard of before but I thought, I'm game, I'll see what it's like. The smell was so over-powering! There was an expectant look on her face. The only way I could play it was with pure honesty. I did not like it. \"Oh\" she said, \"well you're not going to like the other gift I've bought you then...\" It was the deodorant in the same brand. I felt like a right scrooge. Until... She went on to tell me how it was her favourite smelly stuff (God how it smelt) and if I didn't like it she would gladly take it off my hands as she loved it so. So technically I suppose this has to be the worst Christmas present I ever got, and then had taken back. Does that count?... <br><strong>John Sandy </strong></p> <p>An elderly aunt asked what I wanted for Christmas and knowing she wasn't particularly well off, I said 'just get me the Weekend Guardian'. She must have thought I had Val Doonican tendencies because lo and behold on Christmas Day I opened a lovely blue 'weekend' cardigan. <br><strong>Phil Sutcliffe </strong></p> <p>When I first married my husband 13 years ago, I was in dire need of a car to get to work. Christmas morning he said my chrissie present was in the garage, I just couldn't believe it I ran out to the garage to find.. a set of loft ladders wrapped with ribbon and bows!! Hubby said they would be really useful and I must say, HE has found them useful, but it really wasn't the present my heart desired. <br><strong>Sue Daniels </strong></p> <p>This year my teenage son (bless him) thought he'd really got me the ideal present. My husband wouldn't tell me what it was, even though I pestered before Christmas day. Imagine my surprise (!) when I opened this long awaited present. It was a cover that wrapped round my computer screen. Doesn't sound too bad does it? Until I tell you that it was black and white and in the shape of a cow. Yes, two big floppy ears hung down the sides and the most monstrous pair of horns sat perched on the top of the computer like a big game trophy. Wouldn't have been so bad if the computer was hidden away in an office or spare room. But, no. Not in our house. It sits loud and proud in the kitchen where everyone sits when they visit. I have now very quietly taken it back to the shop and exchanged it for something a little less 'glaring'!! <br><strong>Mrs Howson </strong></p> <p>What did Santa put in my stocking this year? Socks! Not just any new socks, but as an occasional golfer - golfing socks. Why do people insist on buying the latest, most tasteless or useless gifts for golfers? It wasn't the socks by themselves - there were 14 pairs all exactly the same! Black of foot with a brown, green and red pattern top. 14 pairs, that's more than I manage rounds of golf in a year. How could I possibly use them all? I suppose I could use them as club covers, maximum number of clubs 14, so that's one lot on the clubs and another set in the wash.. No chance of a penalty for the incorrect number of clubs in future! <br><strong>David Pollitt</strong></p> <p>My mother gave me a pair of heavy duty black rubber gloves with a clump of cloth- made flowers at the elbow end. Not sure what she was trying to tell me! <br><strong>Alison New </strong></p> <p>My sister Sue really excelled herself this year. Usually we exchange gifts of perfume or jewellery, but out shopping with her before Christmas I happend to say I could do with a metal ice cream scoop as the plastic one I had wasn't very strong. I thought nothing more of it until Christmas morning that is.. I got to Sue's prezzie which was in a box marked fragile - a delicate china ornament perhaps? I carefully opened the packaging and yes you guessed it, there, staring me in the face was a metal ice cream scoop. She'll be sorry this year you wait and see. <br><strong>Sheila Titley</strong> </p> <p>Imagine, I was 11 years old and my friends and I were talking about what games we would get for our spanking new Sega megadrives. I really wanted sonic the hedgehog, as I had been down the local shops and played on it in a store. Others wanted football games, tennis games and fighting games, but all I wanted was sonic the hedgehog. So Christmas Day came and when I went downstairs I saw it, a box about the same size as a Sega megadrive, I couldn't wait to rip it open. I had to open it last as that was the rule, open the best Christmas present last.</p> <p>I picked it up and thought to myself 'this is a bit heavy? They must have filled it with lots of games' I thought, so I ripped open the present with delight to reveal a shiny new...toolbox? \"Suprise!\" dad said, \"I thought you could make a kennel for the dog, he gets a bit cold in the winter\". Because I had great respect for my dad I didn't dare say how I really felt as I didn't want to hurt his feelings. So with tear filled eyes I said \"thanks dad, just what I wanted\". So for the remainder of Christmas I was outside, freezing, making this kennel for the dog while all my other friends were playing with their spanking new playstations. <br><strong>Jason Curzon </strong></p> <p>My Husband's grandmother is notorious for giving the tat she wins in the bingo as Christmas gifts. It's always a big laugh in our house during the holiday season. This year, however, she has really outdone herself. Under our tree were two giant Teletubbies Easter eggs, unwrapped, sitting in carrier bags. Next to those little gems was a set of really tacky ceramic cute-kitten-shaped salt and pepper shakers. Again, unwrapped. As if the gifts weren't bad enough, they absolutely stunk of fags. She is a heavy smoker and we know for a fact there is a room in the house where she leaves her bingo booty to fester throughout the year. Bless! <br><strong>Julie Wilson </strong></p> <p>A nasty dose of glandular fever - caught from someone I'd kissed under the mistletoe at the office Christmas party. Spending the whole of Christmas in a darkened room with lumps the size of tennis balls in my neck, and unable to eat, was not the sort of Christmas Present I'd had in mind!!! <br><strong>Sharon Clarke </strong></p> <p>My worst Christmas present was discovering my husband had a lover. She rang him on Christmas Day, I was eight months pregnant with twins! <br><strong>Anonymous </strong></p> <p>My turkey gift? Shania Twain (the platinum collection) video. I'm 54 with four adult kids and 3 granddaughters, but I love Freddie Mercury and Queen!! I'm open to offers for the unplayed vid, otherwise it goes to the charity shop! <br><strong>Karawl Dowds </strong></p> <p>The worst gift I have ever had has got to be from the firm I worked for. A couple of days before Christmas instead of getting our usual bottle of wine they gave us all our notice and told us that they were not paying us that month. <br><strong>Heather Tamworth </strong></p> <p>Here's my story about a particularly 'weird' Christmas gift... My nan, like a lot of women her age was an incredibly innocent and sheltered woman. So much so, my mum used to tell us not to swear in front of her or go out wearing short skirts when she came down to visit. So imagine our surprise a couple of years ago when she gave my dad some sort of 'caring for your horse' magazine (not that much of a strange gift, but he doesn't actually own a horse or have any interest in them) and I, who was only 14 at the time, received a 'Penis Grooming Kit' - complete with illustrations of the organ in question, modelling different..erm....'hair' styles. I didn't exactly know how to react when I opened my present on Christmas morning, but it was certainly one of my most interesting gifts! <br><strong>Laura Jones </strong></p> <p>My worst and most mind boggling Christmas present was from my boyfriend of two months. He bought me a giant catering size jar of pickled onions! Not exactly the romantic present I was expecting! To this day I'm still not entirely sure why?! But it took two years to get through them and he's now my husband so I can't have minded that much ! <br><strong>Sarah Ockwell-Smith </strong></p> <p>I once told my nan that I liked Robbie Williams. What a mistake that was! The following Christmas I got the video \"Mrs Doubtfire\". Then, on my birthday, the video \"Flubber\". On my graduation I got the video \"Patch Adams\". These films all starred ROBIN Williams, who I can't stand. No doubt I'll get a Mork and Mindy pencil case for Easter. In return, I'll be buying my Nan a new hearing aid. <br><strong>Emma Clarke </strong></p> <p>I received a potato peeler from my husband, yes I am not joking I only wish I was. He was beaming when I opened it as he thought it would be a great idea, as I was having a lot of visitors for Christmas dinner and my old peeler had seen better days. Luckily I managed to turn the whole situation around by getting him to help me peel the vegetables as we now had two peelers. How fortunate after all! <br><strong>Karen Wilson </strong></p> <p>I had a grapefruit knife (I have always hated grapefruit) from my mother-in-law (who likes to eat grapefruit whenever she comes round) and a plastic toilet-roll holder for the outside toilet fom my wife! <br><strong>Phil Nevard</strong></p> <p>The worst or most unusual present ever has to be the one received by my dad from his brother. We were all intrigued beforehand as it was small, round and rattled. You can imagine our surprise when we opened it and found a box of car travel sweets. <br><strong>Simon Penfold </strong></p> <p>As a Leeds United fan, I think my worst present must have been a pair of Everton boxer shorts which I received as a stocking filler from my own mother some years ago. When I chided her with regard to both her taste and knowledge of her only child she archly replied: \"Don't worry - no-one will ever see them!\" <br><strong>Lou George </strong></p> <p>I was 16 years old. Music, clothes and possibly something smelly might have gone down well for Christmas but my poor well meaning parents had never managed to master the art of giving. To be fair, we were living in Africa at the time and the selection of gifts to be had was pretty limited. Even so, not much could have prepared me for the gift my parents had selected. It was a rain gauge - one of those nasty plastic funnels you use to measure rainfall. Wow, all for me? My father was especially exited about the customised frame that held it in the garden and was just gagging to get out there and set it up. I have never prayed so hard for a drought in my life before. <br><strong>Gary Burgoyne </strong></p> <p>My wife bought me a do it yourself will kit for Christmas.We only got married this year.

      "bodyText": "My worst present has to be bubble bath, which I often receive from several people, including my mother. What's wrong with that? Well for the last ten years I have lived in this house and we only have a shower! Lynn Mercer A few years ago air plants were all the rage. My sister decided to buy me one, so she chose a very attractive plant, growing on a branch, which she lovingly and carefully wrapped up with a nice ribbon. A month later Xmas arrived, I opened up my beautifully wrapped present and was presented with a completely dead bit of mould on a dry twig. Air plants might not need food but they do need light apparently. Steve Palmer My worst Xmas present was from a young man that I was seeing three years ago. We had been together for several months and the relationship was getting quite serious. I was hoping for anything that spelt romance - a ring or bracelet - to give me some clue as to how he really felt about me. I was therefore shocked and disappointed when the package he gave me, when unwrapped, revealed a frying pan. As an independent woman who does not picture herself as becoming a housewife, this was devastating as it showed me exactly how he perceived my future role. I had to dump him! Madeline Lewis I got a month's supply of X-Fat - need I say more! Jackie Brennan My two children (aged eight and eleven) spent their first Christmas with me since I separated from their mum three years ago. Christmas morning saw much giggling as I opened their present to me which was an inflatable head support for the bath - in the form of a pair of black lace clad boobs. They hadn't realised what they were for and thought I would wear them! Simon Wood Upon grabbing a strange shaped squidgy package from my stocking, imagine my surprise and amusement as I eagerly ripped the paper off a pair of inflatable doggy slippers, that's right - blow-up slippers! As we rarely hoover the floor in our house I wonder how long it will be before I burst the puppies attached to my cold feet. Chris Hutcheon My worst present was a broken picture. A friend sent a very cheap (pink plastic framed) landscape picture (he was unemployed at the time). Unfortunately the postman left the package in the garage as there was nobody at home. Unknown to me, my wife had found the package after driving over it with the car - she did not know she had done this. It had been bubble wrapped and taped up, wrapped in Xmas paper then packaged in brown paper so the effect of a large car driving over it was masked until I opened it on Xmas day! I must admit I felt sorry for our friend who had wasted his money to buy something. The picture was awful even if it had been undamaged. It got dumped rather rapidly in the bin. My friend was duly thanked for his generosity. I am always very careful now when driving into the garage especially in the dark during winter one never knows what might have been sent! John Lasocki A couple of years ago whilst a student, I unwrapped at least five bad presents including floor cleaner, scouring pads, furniture polish, bleach and drain cleaner....nice. I think my mum was trying to tell me something. They made a significant pile under the tree and to say I was disappointed would be no lie. Dan Wright I once received a garden spade from my husband, cunningly wrapped to look like... a spade, that was a real surprise!! That was only surpassed by the gift of a trowel the following year. Now I do like gardening, but I wasn't going to dig the flower beds in December. I think I would have preferred slippers, come to think of it, I think I got those a year later together with a natty pair of gardening gloves! Sally Rose I have to say my worst Xmas present of all time was given to me this year. My aunty Sue sent me a pack of three men's briefs all in a highly attractive fleshy colour - considering the fact that I am of the fairer sex these are the most useless Xmas present ever. I can't even wrap them up again and send them to someone else as I don't know anyone who would even consider wearing a pair of fleshy pants - a real passion killer!!!!! I don't know how to thank her for this attractive gift either - I've been putting off writing a 'thank you' letter - any ideas??!! Jennie Agarwala I mentioned that as a new year's resolution I'd try to lose some weight and wouldn't mind something at Christmas to help me in my quest. I open my present on Christmas Day expecting some weights or running shoes, but oh no... My wife had bought me a Rosemary Conley keep fit video! David Hopwood I got my worst ever Christmas present this year - a pair of old fashion pyjamas four sizes too big. Madelaine Merriman The worse Christmas present I got was a parcel from my family containing food and goodies from Norway, home made cookies, etc.. ( I was backpacking in Australia at the time). The parcel got delayed and forced me to stay in Cairns for an extra week (wrecking my budget in the process). I was charged a fortune to clear it through customs, who confiscated half of the food inside because it is was not allowed to be imported in to Oz, and the remaining food was inedible - the cookies were smashed to bits, a glass pot of herrings had leaked and I had to throw the whole lot in the bin! It was a total disaster, but I did not say anything to my folks, just thank you!! Frederic Degeilh Having expensive taste and maxing out my credit cards, my friends joke that I'm the girl who has everything (even if I can't afford it all!) and they got together and bought me a belly-button brush for Christmas (to remove belly-button fluff, I presume). It was quickly discarded! Tracy Johnson My worst and most least thought out present was from my father. He wrapped up a second hand Philips School Atlas as my Christmas present. I am 41 years old and have teenage sons (I am not a school teacher). He then had the audacity to write on it \"I thought the boys might get some use out of this\"! Up to that point we had not even fallen out! I think he has decided to take over from where his own mother left as she used to give out whatever she had in the house at the time. One year my whole family were the happy recipients of a tin of rice pudding: that is apart from my father who received a bowl of Kellogs Cornflakes - but then he was always her favourite. Phil Shelton The worst present was this Christmas. I got a minidisc carrier. Sounds good, but I don't have a minidisc, my mother mistook it for something else and bought the wrong thing. The worst thing about it was that it was the first present I opened so until my mum explained I though I was actually getting a minidisc. Gutted. A Handspring Palm Top would ease the pain and torture though. Steve Hornby The worst Christmas present I ever received was from a girl I was seeing around three years ago. I agonised over what would be a suitable present for her, as we hadn't been seeing each other that long and to be honest, I wasn't sure how much longer the relationship was going to last anyway. I finally settled on a rather sweet glass bowl, some of those floating candles and a copy of 'It's a Wonderful Life' on video. Nice. Anyway, I was out at a Christmas do and came back home to see that she had let herself into my flat (she had a key and everything...). She was sitting on the couch, wine in hand, presents in her lap and after a while we got round to opening the gifts. She seemed very happy with hers so I was made up. Then it came to opening mine. I suppose that I should've suspected something was amiss when she said \"I just know that you're going to hate this...\" I opened it up and looked at what it was. A metal atomiser was sitting in my hand with a star embossed on the front. It was a fragrance that I had never heard of before but I thought, I'm game, I'll see what it's like. The smell was so over-powering! There was an expectant look on her face. The only way I could play it was with pure honesty. I did not like it. \"Oh\" she said, \"well you're not going to like the other gift I've bought you then...\" It was the deodorant in the same brand. I felt like a right scrooge. Until... She went on to tell me how it was her favourite smelly stuff (God how it smelt) and if I didn't like it she would gladly take it off my hands as she loved it so. So technically I suppose this has to be the worst Christmas present I ever got, and then had taken back. Does that count?... John Sandy An elderly aunt asked what I wanted for Christmas and knowing she wasn't particularly well off, I said 'just get me the Weekend Guardian'. She must have thought I had Val Doonican tendencies because lo and behold on Christmas Day I opened a lovely blue 'weekend' cardigan. Phil Sutcliffe When I first married my husband 13 years ago, I was in dire need of a car to get to work. Christmas morning he said my chrissie present was in the garage, I just couldn't believe it I ran out to the garage to find.. a set of loft ladders wrapped with ribbon and bows!! Hubby said they would be really useful and I must say, HE has found them useful, but it really wasn't the present my heart desired. Sue Daniels This year my teenage son (bless him) thought he'd really got me the ideal present. My husband wouldn't tell me what it was, even though I pestered before Christmas day. Imagine my surprise (!) when I opened this long awaited present. It was a cover that wrapped round my computer screen. Doesn't sound too bad does it? Until I tell you that it was black and white and in the shape of a cow. Yes, two big floppy ears hung down the sides and the most monstrous pair of horns sat perched on the top of the computer like a big game trophy. Wouldn't have been so bad if the computer was hidden away in an office or spare room. But, no. Not in our house. It sits loud and proud in the kitchen where everyone sits when they visit. I have now very quietly taken it back to the shop and exchanged it for something a little less 'glaring'!! Mrs Howson What did Santa put in my stocking this year? Socks! Not just any new socks, but as an occasional golfer - golfing socks. Why do people insist on buying the latest, most tasteless or useless gifts for golfers? It wasn't the socks by themselves - there were 14 pairs all exactly the same! Black of foot with a brown, green and red pattern top. 14 pairs, that's more than I manage rounds of golf in a year. How could I possibly use them all? I suppose I could use them as club covers, maximum number of clubs 14, so that's one lot on the clubs and another set in the wash.. No chance of a penalty for the incorrect number of clubs in future! David Pollitt My mother gave me a pair of heavy duty black rubber gloves with a clump of cloth- made flowers at the elbow end. Not sure what she was trying to tell me! Alison New My sister Sue really excelled herself this year. Usually we exchange gifts of perfume or jewellery, but out shopping with her before Christmas I happend to say I could do with a metal ice cream scoop as the plastic one I had wasn't very strong. I thought nothing more of it until Christmas morning that is.. I got to Sue's prezzie which was in a box marked fragile - a delicate china ornament perhaps? I carefully opened the packaging and yes you guessed it, there, staring me in the face was a metal ice cream scoop. She'll be sorry this year you wait and see. Sheila Titley Imagine, I was 11 years old and my friends and I were talking about what games we would get for our spanking new Sega megadrives. I really wanted sonic the hedgehog, as I had been down the local shops and played on it in a store. Others wanted football games, tennis games and fighting games, but all I wanted was sonic the hedgehog. So Christmas Day came and when I went downstairs I saw it, a box about the same size as a Sega megadrive, I couldn't wait to rip it open. I had to open it last as that was the rule, open the best Christmas present last. I picked it up and thought to myself 'this is a bit heavy? They must have filled it with lots of games' I thought, so I ripped open the present with delight to reveal a shiny new...toolbox? \"Suprise!\" dad said, \"I thought you could make a kennel for the dog, he gets a bit cold in the winter\". Because I had great respect for my dad I didn't dare say how I really felt as I didn't want to hurt his feelings. So with tear filled eyes I said \"thanks dad, just what I wanted\". So for the remainder of Christmas I was outside, freezing, making this kennel for the dog while all my other friends were playing with their spanking new playstations. Jason Curzon My Husband's grandmother is notorious for giving the tat she wins in the bingo as Christmas gifts. It's always a big laugh in our house during the holiday season. This year, however, she has really outdone herself. Under our tree were two giant Teletubbies Easter eggs, unwrapped, sitting in carrier bags. Next to those little gems was a set of really tacky ceramic cute-kitten-shaped salt and pepper shakers. Again, unwrapped. As if the gifts weren't bad enough, they absolutely stunk of fags. She is a heavy smoker and we know for a fact there is a room in the house where she leaves her bingo booty to fester throughout the year. Bless! Julie Wilson A nasty dose of glandular fever - caught from someone I'd kissed under the mistletoe at the office Christmas party. Spending the whole of Christmas in a darkened room with lumps the size of tennis balls in my neck, and unable to eat, was not the sort of Christmas Present I'd had in mind!!! Sharon Clarke My worst Christmas present was discovering my husband had a lover. She rang him on Christmas Day, I was eight months pregnant with twins! Anonymous My turkey gift? Shania Twain (the platinum collection) video. I'm 54 with four adult kids and 3 granddaughters, but I love Freddie Mercury and Queen!! I'm open to offers for the unplayed vid, otherwise it goes to the charity shop! Karawl Dowds The worst gift I have ever had has got to be from the firm I worked for. A couple of days before Christmas instead of getting our usual bottle of wine they gave us all our notice and told us that they were not paying us that month. Heather Tamworth Here's my story about a particularly 'weird' Christmas gift... My nan, like a lot of women her age was an incredibly innocent and sheltered woman. So much so, my mum used to tell us not to swear in front of her or go out wearing short skirts when she came down to visit. So imagine our surprise a couple of years ago when she gave my dad some sort of 'caring for your horse' magazine (not that much of a strange gift, but he doesn't actually own a horse or have any interest in them) and I, who was only 14 at the time, received a 'Penis Grooming Kit' - complete with illustrations of the organ in question, modelling different..erm....'hair' styles. I didn't exactly know how to react when I opened my present on Christmas morning, but it was certainly one of my most interesting gifts! Laura Jones My worst and most mind boggling Christmas present was from my boyfriend of two months. He bought me a giant catering size jar of pickled onions! Not exactly the romantic present I was expecting! To this day I'm still not entirely sure why?! But it took two years to get through them and he's now my husband so I can't have minded that much ! Sarah Ockwell-Smith I once told my nan that I liked Robbie Williams. What a mistake that was! The following Christmas I got the video \"Mrs Doubtfire\". Then, on my birthday, the video \"Flubber\".

Karen Wilson I had a grapefruit knife (I have always hated grapefruit) from my mother-in-law (who likes to eat grapefruit whenever she comes round) and a plastic toilet-roll holder for the outside toilet fom my wife!

Popstars, which moved to its regular early Saturday evening slot after debuting last Wednesday, had 6.7m and a 31% share from 5.55-6.55pm, according to unofficial overnights. Only Fools and Horses attracted 6.9m and a 32% share from 6-6.50pm. Popstars was also slightly below the average, of 6.8m and a 34% share, for the pre-Blind Date slot over the preceding four weeks. But among its target audience of 16-34 year olds, the show attracted a healthy 39% share. Channel 5's new reality entertainment format, The Mole, fared better on its Friday night debut, relatively speaking. The show, in which 10 contestants try to complete physical and psychological tests while working out who the mole in their midst is, took 1.4m and a 6% share, 8-9pm. In the past four weeks Channel 5 shows have averaged 1.1m and a 5% share in that Friday night slot. Channel 5 insiders were also pleased with The Mole's demographic profile. The show posted a 79% increase in 16-34 viewers compared with the average for its slot. It also doubled its percentage of ABC1s, which made up 46% of The Mole's total audience. BBC2's I Love the 80s series launched successfully on Saturday, suggesting that viewers' appetite for relatively cheap, archive-driven shows about recent pop culture history is far from exhausted. I Love the 80s, which opened with Larry Hagman - JR from Dallas - looking back at 1980, had a perky 3.5m and 15% share from 9-10.30pm. On Sunday night BBC2 dusted off factual dinosaur the World At War for yet another outing. The landmark 1970s history of the second world war, produced by Jeremy Isaacs and voiced by Laurence Olivier, drew a respectable 2.1m and 8% share from 8.10-9pm. It thrashed Channel 4 opposition Year One: a Snapshot of Britain in the 21st Century, which had just 0.8m. Proving the enduring appeal of grumpy northern blokes in anoraks, David Jason returned to ITV on Sunday night in a new Touch of Frost. The detective drama drew a majestic 14.2m and 57%, 9.10-10.40pm.

      "body": "<p>Film studios are, of necessity, adaptable buildings but the Gainsborough Studios, in Hoxton, London, have proved more versatile than most. In their film-production heyday, when Hitchcock made movies here, they served as everything from mad professor's laboratory to railway station, to 19th-century manor house to mermaid's lair. At various other times the building has also been a power station, avant-garde theatre and whisky store. But now it is preparing for another incarnation: a luxury residential development. </p> <p>At the start of its life, this enormous canalside brick construction wasn't a film studio, but an electrical power station for the East London railway line, built in about 1900. It entered the movie business after the first world war, when American studios were taking over impoverished London facilities to expand their empires. The property caught the eye of Jesse Lasky, head of Famous Players, who noted it was \"a location where heavy fog would collect even when the rest of London was in bright sunshine\". It was swiftly converted into a two-stage studio with workshops and offices, and began turning out films in 1920. Among the studio's first employees was a sign painter named Alfred Hitchcock. Four years later it was sold to Michael Balcon, who formed Gainsborough Pictures, using the building as one of his two London studios (in those days it was known as Islington Studios). </p> <p>Under Balcon's guidance, Hitchcock shot his first suspense thriller, The Lodger, there, as well as his 1926 masterpiece, The Lady Vanishes (using one train coach and plenty of back projections). Also to be found passing through the Islington compound over the next two decades were former music hall stars such as Will Hay, Gracie Fields and the Crazy Gang, horror veteran Boris Karloff, Third Man director Carol Reed and, later, James Mason, Phyllis Calvert and Stewart Granger, for the shooting of Anthony Asquith's Fanny By Gaslight. At the start of the second world war, however, the building's huge chimney was judged a liability in the event of an air raid, and production began to wind down, finally grinding to a halt when the studio was sold in 1949. </p> <p>For the next 50 years the building languished in obscurity but, as Hoxton's fortunes have risen, so it has become a hot property once more. Its combination of post-industrial urban chic, vogue-ish location (\"the birthplace of BritArt\" as the sales brochure puts it) and rich cultural history has proved highly marketable. Indeed, for a derelict building it has been remarkably busy of late. Last summer, to both theatrical and architectural acclaim, the main turbine hall was transformed into a temporary extension of the Almeida Theatre, where Ralph Fiennes led productions of Shakespeare's Richard II and Coriolanus. The architects knocked through a floor that had been added in the 1960s (when the space was a whisky store), to restore the hall's original triple-height volume, and put a massive raked concrete stage in the centre, surrounded by scaffold seating. Otherwise, the scarred interior was unchanged. \"At one time, we had to work around a film crew who had turned part of it into a boxing arena for Guy Ritchie's film Snatch,\" recalls architect Roger Watts of Haworth Tompkins. \"There was also a fashion show by Alexander McQueen just before we went in.\" It has hosted music awards ceremonies, cinema nights and contemporary music performances. On New Year's Eve it was the venue for a party for 3,000 people, featuring four Hitchcock-themed rooms. </p> <p>Under the new scheme, parts of the studios, including the large turbine hall, will be demolished later this month, though the main studio building will be retained. Around it will snake clean, elegant residential and office blocks, including a 12-storey tower sliced vertically by aluminium fins - an echo of the power station's original chimney, which is likely to become a conspicuous feature of the area. Buildings are mostly brick and steel, with plenty of glass and large X-beams supporting the lower floors - in other words, a rectilinear ultra-modern style which is sure to attract smart young punters. There will also be a nine-story wooden building facing the canal, a tribute to the original wharfside architecture. </p> <p>\"It's like taking a bit of Covent Garden, and putting it up in a brand-new environment,\" says Steve Marshall, of architects Munkenbeck + Marshall. (Marshall also worked on the restoration of the late Denys Lasdun's nearby Bethnal Green tower block Keeley House.) \"The planners were keen to put a very strong landmark here, so it makes sense to have a building that says goodbye to you as you leave Hackney and says hello to you as you come from the north.\" </p> <p> For those who resent the rampant gentrification of this part of London, the project is likely to become a prime target for scorn, though there are several other similar conversion schemes under way in the area. As fashionable as the area has become, complaining about its fashionability is even more fashionable. The critics' only consolation is that it could have been much worse. About five years ago, planning permission was granted to turn the site into a bingo hall, surrounded by car parking. That was replaced by another scheme for 100 luxury flats arranged around a private courtyard, which was also abandoned. This project will achieve a much higher density - about 300 flats - but makes several concessions to the public </p> <p>\"The way the planners worked was exceptional,\" Marshall explains. \"They said: 'If you keep the film use and you really promote this part of London as a media focus, we will allow you to build to a higher density, in line with the recommendations of Lord Rogers's Urban Task Force.' Unlike most planners, who would say six storeys was too high, they were saying, 'Go up to 12 storeys but give us a lot more that can be shared by the community'\". </p> <p>There will be the proportion of affordable housing (44 units) now required in new housing developments and a public walkway along the canal but, most importantly, the ground floor is given over to commercial space, which it is hoped will be occupied by film and media companies, most likely pre- and post-production companies - and a link with the site's heritage. A more explicit link is the 6.5 metre-high public sculpture planned for the central courtyard: a semi-abstract bust of Hitchcock's head rising from the ground. Whether it turns out to be a symbol of future cinematic regeneration or a kitsch finale for a development that knows its selling points remains to be seen.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Now you have joined the gym and started the diet, it is time to tart up the CV and find a new job. So how about working for a charity? They are in desperate need of fundraisers, according to an annual recruitment survey. \"It is certainly a fundraisers' market, and those with the necessary skills should be able to use this to their advantage in choosing the job they want,\" says Jennie Saunders, research manager at Charity Recruitment. </p> <p>Of the 100 charities surveyed, a third reported problems recruiting fundraisers, with 45% blaming the low pay on offer. However, a director of fundraising in a charity with a turnover of over \u00a325m can expect to earn an average of \u00a352,571. </p> <p>Stephen Perrett, chief executive of recruitment agency Execucare, said people in the commercial sector with PR, event management or communications skills can move across easily to the voluntary sector. \"People who understand what makes business tick and can manage corporate relationships will walk into a fundraising role.\" </p> <p>However, he advises that it is probably easier to move into a larger charity where \"a fundraising department will be big enough to take the risk of an employee struggling to adapt to voluntary sector culture\". </p> <p>Before taking the plunge to apply for a job, Susan Holliday, senior consultant at Charity Recruitment, recommends thinking hard about the type of fundraising you want to do - for example, corporate, trust or event fundraising - and then identify the charities that are growing and might need your skills. \"It is critical to research the organisation you are applying to and tailor your approach accordingly.\" </p> <p>Whether you are already in the charity sector or struggling to break in, there are a number of courses run by the Open University, Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, the Directory of Social Change, the South Bank University and an organisation called Working for a Charity. These can give a good insight and signing up shows commitment. There is also a selection of recruitment agencies specialising in the charity sector. Christian Aid and Imperial Cancer Research Fund are among the few charities that offer graduate training opportunities. Oxfam has a trainee programme but only pays expenses. </p> <p>Sara Naylor, 25, who graduated in 1999, is now employed as a fundraiser for Raleigh International's Youth Development Programme. Her advice to someone starting out is: \"Be prepared to work voluntarily or to take low-paid positions to gain the initial experience that employers are looking for. </p> <p>\"I found it useful to volunteer as a campaigns assistant for Oxfam to get extra experience while applying for jobs. Doing voluntary work also goes a long way toward showing genuine commitment to working within the sector. Competition for jobs is quite high and it helps just to 'get your foot in the door'.\" </p> <p>Sophie Morris, 27, warns that jobs in events can be short-lived. \"My last job at CSV started on July 31st, the event was on October 28th and my contract ended on that day. Many of the jobs in events are contract based, so an employer who is sceptical of someone who chops and changes can be put off when they see your CV.\" </p> <p>Yet Andrew Watt, spokesman for the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said: \"Fundraisers are the most fluid employees in the voluntary sector. The average time a fundraiser stays in a job is two years. There is a huge degree of sideways movement.\" </p> <p>This movement illustrates the flip side of job opportunities - the fact that charities are finding it hard to retain fundraisers. Ms Saunders, of Charity Recruitment, found in her research that 20% reported difficulties retaining staff. Respondents cited lack of career development and competition from other organisations. She warned: \"Charities will need to address the issues of salary levels and the provision of personal development opportunities for fundraisers if they are to strike gold.\"</p>",

They are in desperate need of fundraisers, according to an annual recruitment survey. \"It is certainly a fundraisers' market, and those with the necessary skills should be able to use this to their advantage in choosing the job they want,\" says Jennie Saunders, research manager at Charity Recruitment. Of the 100 charities surveyed, a third reported problems recruiting fundraisers, with 45% blaming the low pay on offer. However, a director of fundraising in a charity with a turnover of over \u00a325m can expect to earn an average of \u00a352,571. Stephen Perrett, chief executive of recruitment agency Execucare, said people in the commercial sector with PR, event management or communications skills can move across easily to the voluntary sector. \"People who understand what makes business tick and can manage corporate relationships will walk into a fundraising role.\" However, he advises that it is probably easier to move into a larger charity where \"a fundraising department will be big enough to take the risk of an employee struggling to adapt to voluntary sector culture\". Before taking the plunge to apply for a job, Susan Holliday, senior consultant at Charity Recruitment, recommends thinking hard about the type of fundraising you want to do - for example, corporate, trust or event fundraising - and then identify the charities that are growing and might need your skills. \"It is critical to research the organisation you are applying to and tailor your approach accordingly.\" Whether you are already in the charity sector or struggling to break in, there are a number of courses run by the Open University, Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, the Directory of Social Change, the South Bank University and an organisation called Working for a Charity. These can give a good insight and signing up shows commitment. There is also a selection of recruitment agencies specialising in the charity sector. Christian Aid and Imperial Cancer Research Fund are among the few charities that offer graduate training opportunities. Oxfam has a trainee programme but only pays expenses. Sara Naylor, 25, who graduated in 1999, is now employed as a fundraiser for Raleigh International's Youth Development Programme. Her advice to someone starting out is: \"Be prepared to work voluntarily or to take low-paid positions to gain the initial experience that employers are looking for. \"I found it useful to volunteer as a campaigns assistant for Oxfam to get extra experience while applying for jobs. Doing voluntary work also goes a long way toward showing genuine commitment to working within the sector. Competition for jobs is quite high and it helps just to 'get your foot in the door'.\" Sophie Morris, 27, warns that jobs in events can be short-lived. \"My last job at CSV started on July 31st, the event was on October 28th and my contract ended on that day. Many of the jobs in events are contract based, so an employer who is sceptical of someone who chops and changes can be put off when they see your CV.\" Yet Andrew Watt, spokesman for the Institute of Charity Fundraising Managers, said: \"Fundraisers are the most fluid employees in the voluntary sector. The average time a fundraiser stays in a job is two years. There is a huge degree of sideways movement.\" This movement illustrates the flip side of job opportunities - the fact that charities are finding it hard to retain fundraisers. Ms Saunders, of Charity Recruitment, found in her research that 20% reported difficulties retaining staff. Respondents cited lack of career development and competition from other organisations. She warned: \"Charities will need to address the issues of salary levels and the provision of personal development opportunities for fundraisers if they are to strike gold.\"",

      "bodyText": "Considering that the world's first colliery railway still runs in Leeds, merrily ferrying tourists rather than coal to the greened-over site of Middleton pit, the state of the city's \"real\" train station these last four weeks defies belief. Barred entirely to trains, apart from occasional diesels sneaking off to Skipton or Ilkley from a distant side platform, the place has been ringed instead by \"rail support coaches\", hired from places as far away as Sunderland and Carlisle. Puffing exhaust fumes into basement offices along Leeds' \"lawyer streets\" of Park Place, St Paul's Street and East Parade, these have become the accepted way of getting to England's biggest financial and legal centre outside London. Hunched in their cabs, the drivers pore over A-Z guides of how to get commuters to connecting stations at Wakefield, Garforth, Castleford and Huddersfield - since December 18, the nearest that trains have been able to get to Yorkshire's unofficial capital. Today, the grand rebuilding of the station was due to be finished at last, but the prudence of local newspapers turned out to be more than justified. \"Leeds City Station will open on Monday ... maybe\", said one prophetic headline. By 8am this morning, \"maybe\" was the operative word. Electrical faults, signal glitches and the all too predictable birth pains of a new \u00a3165m station meant that travellers' misery continued. \"It's incredible, incredible, incredible,\" said Linda Fellowes from Harrogate, shuffled to a bus for Wakefield after wasting over half-an-hour on a platform to which the grand re-opening train never came. \"At least they could have changed the signboards - they're all up the creek,\" commented a colleague of hers from Pudsey, who had been given three different messages by the rail phoneline, local news and the regional director of Railtrack, who gave a strangely buoyant interview on BBC Radio Leeds. The long siege will gradually end this week, he promised, between gulps at the mounting post-Hatfield bill for his company, whose details were coming out in bulletins before and after his slot. Too late, though, for city centre shops whose Christmas and new year sales have been the quietest for years, and for the organisers of scores of ill-attended seasonal events. There are always silver linings; and, on daily flights to London from Leeds/Bradford airport, the curtain dividing business from ordinary passengers has steadily moved down the plane, finally coralling only a handful of long pre-booked ordinaries in the last few seats. Last month's 14% rise in domestic air travel, announced yesterday, owes a lot to the 45-minute Leeds-London hop. Back at the station, the Railtrack signs still promote \"Leeds first\", the name of the rebuilding project which was meant to take only a fortnight over Christmas - the network's least busy time - to carry out the signal, track and platform work. \"If Leeds is first\", runs the local mordant query, pray devoutly that it isn't \"you next\".

The ALG is also calling on the government to offset the costs of expanding the capital's police force by releasing an extra \u00a317m to the GLA and providing extra money to pay for royal protection and anti-terrorism work. Mr Livingstone has come under further fire from the ALG, which is calling on the mayor to rein in increases for transport for London and to halve his budget for cultural initiatives.",

Israeli soldiers blocked roads into Gaza and shut the airport, preventing Palestinians from arriving at workplaces in Israel. The body of Roni Tsalah, a Jewish settler, was found in the Kfar Yam settlement in Gaza.

Palestinian police were put on alert after the shelling, Palestinian security officials said, as Israeli navy vessels circled off the Gaza coastline, in clear view of Mr Arafat's office. Israel has tightened restrictions on access to the West Bank and Gaza Strip since a Palestinian uprising erupted in September, allowing only essential supplies into Palestinian self-rule areas. Around 308 Palestinians, 44 Israelis and 13 Israeli Arabs have been killed since the uprising began. Today's cancelled negotiations are part of an attempt by Israel and the Palestinians to draft a document that would sum up agreements and differences, with US president Bill Clinton's peace proposals serving as a guide. The Palestinians are waiting for maps showing Israel's interpretation of Mr Clinton's plan, under which the Palestinians would establish a state in all of Gaza, 95% of the West Bank and Arab neighbourhoods of contested Jerusalem. In the West Bank, a 10-year-old Palestinian boy, who was critically wounded by Israeli army fire earlier this month, died yesterday of his injuries. He was shot by Israeli soldiers 10 days ago, during a clash near the West Bank town of El-Bireh The European Union expressed \"deep regret\" at Saturday's executions by the Palestinian authority of two Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, and called on Mr Arafat to consider a moratorium on the death penalty. Palestinian authorities said that more trials - and harsher punishment - were ahead for Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel. Two other men are are also facing execution after trials on Saturday. \"I also appeal to president Arafat to commute the death sentences handed down on Saturday against two persons in Bethlehem\", Swedish foreign minister Anna Lindh said in a statement issued late yesterday on behalf of the 15-nation EU. Sweden currently holds the EU's six-month rotating presidency. \"I encourage President Arafat to consider, as a first step, the introduction of a moratorium on the death penalty,\" she said. The executions in Nablus and Gaza City were only the fourth and fifth death penalties carried out in the more than six years of the Palestinian authority - and a dramatic bid to stop cooperation in weeks of Israeli killings of Palestinian militiamen. The two Palestinians executed - Alam Bani Odeh, 25, and Majdi Makawi, 28, - admitted aiding Israel in a car bombing and a checkpoint shooting in November that killed a Palestinian bombmaker and a leader of Mr Arafat's Fatah group. Palestinian attorney general Khaled Qidreh defended the trials, saying, \"We, as the Palestinian authority, implement the law, and we gave them the opportunity to have legal representation and an open trial.\" In the Palestinian West Bank village of Kfar Salem, troops surrounded a house from which shots were fired at a convoy of cars from the nearby Jewish settlement of Elon Moreh.

American culture, too, is dominated by images of grasping, greedy, mendacious big business, all the way from the westerns that have the lantern-jawed homesteader pitted against the ruthless rancher to the unpicking of 80s Wall Street in Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities. According to US research quoted by the IEA, more than half of all corporate chiefs depicted on TV commit illegal acts ranging from fraud to murder; 45% of all business activities are portrayed on TV as illegal; only 3% of TV businessmen engage in socially or economically productive behaviour; and hard work is usually ridiculed on TV as \"workaholism\" that inevitably leads to strained personal relationships. </p> <p>Like the IEA, the government sees these sort of attitudes as unhelpful.

Despite the best efforts of Dickens et al, the wheels of industry turn faster than ever. Of the 100 biggest economic entities in the world, 48 are countries and 52 are multi-national corporations, so there is very little evidence that corporate capitalism is being brought to its knees by the regular rubbishing it gets from the men and women of letters. Hollywood is willing to make a film like Erin Brockovich - one woman's fight against corporate malfeasance - precisely because the studios have big marketing budgets and know what the punters want.

It argues that the moral of the story is that capitalist societies \"consume literature and film to let off steam rather than to change the world\". There is something in this. For a start, some of the criticisms - particularly of big business - are naive. There is no evidence that large firms pay less than small firms, nor that they have worse health and safety records. Quite the reverse. Multi-national companies operating in developing countries often pay higher wages than indigenous firms. </p> <p>Even so, it is somewhat strange that an economic system which has produced a phenomenal rise in western living standards over the past two centuries is so routinely trashed by our great creative minds.

CIA has been hired to handle the bulk of the Pentland brief, including the international media business for Ellesse. Growth in UK ad spend slowed considerably in November, with dot.com revenues falling year-on-year for the first time. AW Media has won the media planning and buying task for David Lloyd Leisure, the gym and health club chain. Jonathan Bill, Real Media commercial director, is leaving the digital sales house at the end of the month to join Reuters Media. VNU Global Media has signed a deal to sell advertising for Ziff-Davis's worldwide portfolio of magazines. IPC Southbank is launching a handful of one-off titles - called Make It!, Your Health and Hair Ideas - as spin-offs from its Essentials brand. DoubleClick is forecasting its worldwide advertising revenues will plummet by 30-35% in the first quarter of 2001. Late deals with media agencies are thought to have contributed to the drop in ITV's January revenues.",

You know the one: Spanish-made; indeterminate-looking; smaller than you had been led to believe by the woman on the phone; air-conditioning that seemed to prefer to function as a heater, until it broke; sensationally under-powered. You had just managed to get it up to 60 miles per hour and the holiday was over. </p> <p>The last time I drove a Seat, I managed to crack its oil tank on a Greek rock. I was a long way up a mountain at a time, following a disastrously ignorant map-reading incident, and would have had to sleep out in the car if I hadn't been rescued by passing fire rangers. A Seat hatchback, I discovered, isn't really your best bet for mountain-hopping. You probably wouldn't want to sleep in one, either. </p> <p>You might, however, want to own one - at least if it was the new Seat Arosa Sport. Hitherto, one has been able to look at Seats and infer that the Spanish were to car building what the British are to bullfighting. But the company has shaken itself awake over the past two years, stirring its entire range (Ibiza, Cordoba, Leon) from a deep stupor, to the point where it can declare the new Arosa to be \"the car that epitomises youthful vitality\", and one merely smiles indulgently rather than laughing until one is sick. </p> <p>The new Arosa, we should be clear, comes in three other versions that don't have the word \"Sport\" in them, but the Sport would seem to me to be the fun one to have, arriving, as it does, with alloy wheels, a lowered suspension and, most important of all, a centrally mounted, chromed exhaust pipe that sticks out slightly from the back of the car and is all the better to annoy people with. By this means alone, what could have been for Seat an exercise in motorising a shopping trolley ends up yielding a cheeky, road-smoking magnet for the boy racer in your family, or for the boy racer in you. </p> <p>Interestingly stubby, daringly cheap and only available as a three-door, the Arosa is going to attract takers in two separate markets. There will be the families who own it as a second car and intend to nip around urban areas in it, safe in the knowledge that you could pretty much park this car in a space recently vacated by a moped. And then there will be the young buyers, perhaps first-time owners, who may have similar kinds of journeys in mind, but may additionally intend to convert the car into an enlarged boom-box by entirely filling its boot space with speakers. </p> <p>Especially in its Sport form, the Arosa has enough style - or rather, enough of the right kind of style - to bring young shavers on board, in the manner of the old-style \"hot hatches\". Driven around London in Ebony Black, this car drew covetous looks from boys in school uniform who may not yet have passed their driving tests but who could recognise, when they saw it, the potential for a little innocent, on-road mischief making. </p> <p>It's there in the Arosa's use of a strangely funky porthole motif: the rear lights are chunky and circular and their shape is mirrored in the air vents on the dashboard and the housing for the clocks. And it's there in the hip-hugging, rally-style seats with their black and red, go-faster cloth. </p> <p>The interior, which features a coolly tidy CD player, favours matt black and has, overall, something of the feel of a bachelor's bathroom. This theme, too, continues on the outside of the car, where the catch for the boot is actually a large, silver Seat badge which you have to depress, like the soap dispenser in a hotel that fancies itself. </p> <p>Strip these features out and you would have little more than a tame blob of bland Euro-metal. (You would have, indeed, the entry level Seat Arosa, which - hold on to your hats! - takes a sensationally meditative 17.7 seconds to crawl to 62 miles per hour.) Put those features in, though, and you have a joyrider's joy object, a dinky, head-turning piece of street culture, which was not exactly a future I readily envisaged for a Seat the last time I was up a Greek mountain with one. </p> <p>It's true that, at speed, the engine hums along in an almost entirely characterless manner. It is utterly without a signature note; you could be driving anything at all. But at least, along with the visual style, you get - in a rare conjunction - economy.

The warning comes after last week's publication of government guidelines for approving the BBC's proposed new digital TV services. John Hambley, chief executive of pay-TV channel Artsworld, said: \"There is a general feeling of disappointment that these guidelines are very, very little different to the original draft version that came out last summer.\" Another senior TV executive added: \"Chris Smith had six months to produce the final guidelines, but seems to have ignored virtually all the TV industry's concerns. \"I hope that we're not on a collision course with the government on this.\" Seven commercial broadcasters - BSkyB, Telewest, Artsworld, MTV, Nickelodeon, Discovery and Turner Broadcasting - wrote to Mr Smith just before Christmas asking for an urgent meeting amid deep concern that the government will just rubber-stamp the BBC's plans. Commercial rivals are worried that there will not be enough scrutiny of the potential impact of these new BBC services on their businesses before they are greenlit by the government. The letter said: \"We are extremely concerned that the BBC is behaving as if it had been given tacit consent to build their plans for new services without the proper process being adhered to.\" Their anger is further fuelled by the government's declaration last year that in future the BBC would be required to get prior approval before it launched any new services. The new rules were introduced following criticism that the BBC's former director general Lord Birt was diverting licence payers' money into an increasing number of services already provided by the market. The BBC is planning to launch two new children's services, as well as turning BBC Choice into youth-oriented channel, BBC3 and BBC Knowledge into high-brow arts, and a current affairs service on BBC 4. A senior TV insider said the approval guidelines published by Mr Smith has only three minor changes compared with the draft document issued last summer. The consultation period in which submissions can be made has been extended from 15 to 20 days; the BBC is now required to publish a \"description\" of each new service, rather than just a \"brief description\"; and the BBC board of governors is now entitled to satisfy itself that \"the new service represents value for money for licence fee payers\". Mr Hambley said: \"When Chris Smith first announced that he was going to have this approval process he said he was going to open up the BBC to more scrutiny. We're not confident this degree of external scrutiny is going to happen.\" But he added that he was hopeful the meeting with Mr Smith requested by the commercial lobbying alliance to discuss their concerns would take place.

      "bodyText": "Richard Tomlinson, the MI6 officer on the run in Europe for the past three years, said yesterday that a book he had written about the agency's activities was to be published in Moscow. The book, The Big Breach: From Top Secret to Maximum Security, contained nothing damaging, he said, and he denied reports that his publisher was linked to the Russian security and intelligence services. Speaking from Rimini in Italy where he has been working in a bar, he said: \"Basically the book is about how I was fired from MI6. It is the last fling of the dice.\" He said his contract allowed him to cancel publication if MI6 let him take his grievances to an industrial tribunal. \"Even if the book does go ahead, I have pledged to give all the royalties to charity and come back to the UK voluntarily to face the music,\" he said. However, he added: \"Again, only if MI6 let me take them to industrial tribunal first.\" An extract from the book published in yesterday's Sunday Times dealt with his escapades in Europe after his release in 1998 following a six-month sentence for breaking the Official Secrets Act. A Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday that Mr Tomlinson, 38, had a \"fairly long record of putting out sensationalist material\". He added: \"The fact that he has chosen to go to the lengths of publishing in Moscow further destroys his credibility. The serious point is that he claims that the book is going to describe the inner workings of the Secret Intelligence Service. That cannot be in the national interest.\" Mr Tomlinson signed an agreement in 1997 whereby he received \u00a325,000 in return for surrendering his copyright to anything relating to MI6 activites. He now describes the deal as \"absurdly one-sided\". Many of his allegations have been widely published; they include a plan to assassinate the former Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Tomlinson, whose training as an MI6 officer was abruptly ended in 1995, also operated in Moscow gathering information about Russian weapons systems.",

Liam Hamilton, managing director of Worldpop, said Mr Powell will become vice-chairman of the company, which offers music news, charts and reviews to companies who target the 12 to 17-year-old market. \"We will be looking for Charles to lead the third round of funding and we can get on with making money for the business,\" said Mr Hamilton. \"The corporate side has been getting more and more time-consuming and Peter would not claim that corporate financing is his bag.\" Mr Levison once headed up Virgin's TV interest and had a leading role in the ultimately ill-fated Super Channel - a \"best of British\" service set up by ITV companies in the 1980s. He is currently vice-chairman of the Chrysalis group and chairman of the SCI Entertainment group. Mr Hamilton added that the latest cash boost will be invested in a joint venture with direct mail company Trinity Street Direct, which has a 6m-strong database of pop fans. \"We will be using their data and consumer base to sell our services, and in turn we will push their services onto email and mobile phones,\" he said.

Rakesh Roshan, the director-father of India's latest male heartthrob, Hrithik Roshan, recently survived an assassination attempt. Rizvi was allegedly involved in another plot to kill Hrithik and other Bollywood stars. Shah's detention has cast a huge shadow over the future of 11 forthcoming Bollywood films, in which he has invested \u00a320m. \"We are still standing by our commitment, and films will be completed within the given schedule,\" his son Rajiv has said. But the long-term effects on the industry of Bollywood's richest backer languishing in prison are uncertain. Chori Chori's stars - Salman Khan, Preity Zinta and Rani Mukherjee - now await plod's knock on the door. One suspects that Shah may not remain in custody for long. He has many powerful friends among Bombay's political class. He is also popular within the industry that catapulted him to fame and fortune: diamonds. To show solidarity, India's diamond market organised a one-day strike after his arrest. Shah, after all, has a reputation for generosity. In the end, this may prove his salvation.

Does anyone realise how much swearing there is on these channels? November Official press launch. Bloody Matt Wells and his tiresome questions again. Review the draft E4 schedule for January and February. Looking good. Only trouble is what do we put in the other 10 months of the year? Sky Digital deal now... oh, never mind. January 20 2001 Channel on air. Launch night (Thursday 18) a ratings triumph. Press receptive. Marketing a triumph. Launch party (Friday 19) the hottest ticket in town. MJ pleased. Lygo tired, but happy. Must go. Barrymore's on the phone. (Sky Digital deal is in the building somewhere). \u0095 Kevin Lygo is head of entertainment for Channel 4 and controller of E4, which launches on January 18 on cable and ONdigital. Sky Digital has still to confirm whether it will carry the channel",

      "body": "<p>As variety-show villains go, Nigel Lythgoe is perfect end-of-the-pier material. And with his uncanny resemblance to the late Larry Grayson, casting himself as the put-down king in ITV's new cult reality show Popstars is surely the most inspired move of his career. </p> <p>With cruel jibes and withering stares, Lythgoe dispatches rows of talentless teenagers with sweet-edged sadism. The LWT entertainment chief insists that compared to most casting couches, his manner is positively cuddly - but to the kids who cower before his caustic command, he must appear the devil incarnate. </p> <p>Competing with PR \"guru\" and power-ego Nikki Chapman, Lythgoe groans and grimaces through the thousands of self-deluding wannabes whose determination to be the \"next big thing\" eclipses their desperate lack of basic musical tonality. </p> <p>It is a role that he has been playing for most of his professional career. From gyrating in the dance troupe Young Generation to nurturing the careers of Cilla Black and Michael Barrymore, he is Mr Light Entertainment down to the roots of his flouncy blond hair. In full Grayson mode, he even spots a draught in the room where we are talking, gets up and daintily shuts the door that his PA has left ajar. You couldn't make it up. </p> <p>So it is all the more bizarre that Lythgoe has suddenly been catapulted to fame as ITV's great youth hope. One minute he was the doyen of \"old ITV\" (Cilla, Barrymore, Brian Conley); the next he was spearheading the network's biggest-ever drive for youth, not only entrusted with Popstars but also handed the task of developing for Britain the coast-to-coast US sensation of last year, Survivor. </p> <p>In the same way that William Hague looked silly in a baseball hat, Lythgoe cuts a rather incongruous figure alongside the pop kids of Planet 24, where the Survivor project is being co-ordinated. Fortunately - like many of the 3,000 who auditioned for Popstars - he is blissfully unaware of this fact. Either that, or he just doesn't care. </p> <p>And who can blame him? Now, after a career behind the cameras, he is a star in front of them. And he is not only the undisputed king of Popstars, he is also the subject of its marketing campaign too (\"Nigel, pick me!\" implore the billboards and TV trailers). He is the talk of taxi cabs (my driver burst into laughter when he found out I was going to interview him) and student common rooms. He has been sent up on The Big Breakfast in a feature titled \"Nigel, pygmy\", where \"contestants\" were auditioned by a rather small man. Even if the series flops (and there is not much sign of that) he will still be a household name. </p> <p>Being part of the show as well as behind it is a new experience, says Lythgoe. \"I'm now involved, and I have to watch the rough cuts two or three times before I can get over the emotional attachment, my ego, and the temptation to say 'My hair looks terrible' or 'I didn't know I had those spots on my face'.\" </p> <p>Never mind that his hair looks terrible however much attention he spends on it, and that no amount of Est\u00e9e Lauder is going to get rid of those wrinkles, Lythgoe is revelling in his role. It's no accident that he's good at it: he has been in rehearsal all his career. In fact, he started out on talent shows - as a contestant - at the tender age of 11. </p> <p>Had it not been for a certain young woman named Melba Brunsdon, his life might have taken a different course. \"I did a song, but she did a song and a tap dance.\" He resolved to beat her the next year, and took up tap dancing lessons. Twelve months later, his routine perfected, he returned. \"I did my song and the tap dance, but Melba Brunsdon did a song, a tap dance and a ventriloquist's act. She beat me again.\" </p> <p>Now, recounting his tale, he is still performing. With a straight face and apparently no sense of irony, he compares his adolescence to Billy Elliot: \"My father was a Birkenhead docker, and I, much like Billy, had to go boxing - the Wallasey boxing club.\" His father only gave into the young Lythgoe's artistic leanings on the insistence of his mother. \"In those days, you weren't gay, you were a fairy. And my dad said: 'Well if he's a fairy, he's a fairy.'\" So, a star (if not a fairy - Lythgoe is married with kids) was born. </p> <p>After a spell in performing arts school, Lythgoe joined the BBC's Young Generation. For those whose memories have faded, YG was the group of crotch-hugging kids who provided the cheesy dance routines in such televisual delights as the Rolf Harris Show and Summertime Special. </p> <p>Here his production talents were spotted, and he was asked, at age 21, to be the group's choreographer. Then it was to ATV and The Muppet Show, choreographing the likes of Miss Piggy and the Swedish chef in the show's big musical numbers. </p> <p>From there to here, Lythgoe's career is a rollcall of the \"golden age\" of ITV variety. Producing shows for Cilla Black, Morecambe and Wise, Bob Monkhouse, Lionel Blair, Joe Longthorne and Brian Conley, he has worked with just about anyone who has been anybody in TV light entertainment. </p> <p>There was a wealth of talent, says Lythgoe, that simply is not around any more. \"I grew up through what people now call the golden age of television - and although I'm not sure there was really a golden age, there were certainly a lot more entertainment programmes around, and a lot more performers. We were doing something like 60 TV shows, most of them live. \"The performers are just not there today: the clubs have shut down, theatres are doing more musicals, whereas it used to be TV that did musical variety. Now, most of the talent is recording artists. That didn't really happen before.\" </p> <p>Despite the death of variety, Lythgoe has kept mass-market entertainment alive. By developing new formats for stars such as Barrymore and Black and importing Gladiators from the US, he has helped keep ITV at the forefront of Saturday night family viewing. </p> <p>But, in a career full of hits, there have inevitably been turkeys. There was a disastrous talent show with Lionel Blair (enough said), and he can boast that he was responsible for the only Bob Monkhouse show to bomb. (Anyone remember Bob's Your Uncle? Ouch.) </p> <p>His highest-profile disaster, though, was Ice Warriors. An alarm bell should have rung when the show's host Dani Behr somewhat overstated her skating abilities to Lythgoe (\"She told me that she was a great skater. She couldn't skate.\"). But they pressed on, believing this inexplicable piece of nonsense was great TV. </p> <p>\"On about show three, I realised that maybe I was deluding myself. I had been so engrossed in it that somewhere along the line we had forgotten to entertain people, to let them in on the joke.\" After the first series flopped, the irrepressible Lythgoe thought it could be rescued. The ITV network, fortunately, didn't give him the chance to try. \"It was a complete failure,\" he concedes. </p> <p> For some, this might have been a career-ending role. Fortunately, Lythgoe survived to carve out a role as the Mr Fixit of ITV entertainment. From his position of strength, he can afford to be disparaging of the opposition. \"I think entertainment over the past five years has been dominated by ITV. The BBC did reality documentaries very well - I think Hotel was a great programme - but a great deal of the BBC's entertainment is copied,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Star for a Night is basically Stars in Their Eyes; the Weakest Link, although I believe it is very good, is based on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?, Stars Sing the Beatles is based on Abbamania, and Hall of Fame is a rip-off of An Audience With... They just haven't moved on.\" </p> <p>But with Cilla Black still churning out endless series of Blind Date and Michael Barrymore still doing the same old act on My Kind of Music, Lythgoe appears to be throwing stones from the proverbial glass house. </p> <p>He disagrees. \"Remember, ITV has produced the biggest entertainment show, possibly in the world, with Millionaire. Michael Barrymore isn't doing the same thing as he did five years ago - I think he has moved on. Look at the Generation Game - now I think Jim Davidson is a great entertainer, but it doesn't exactly look like a lot of money has been spent on it. ITV is committed to big projects: Survivor is a big project.\" </p> <p>And he believes that the bankers will still do the business. \"Blind Date will still be on television when you and I are dead. It's the Coronation Street of entertainment, it will be there forever.\" Lythgoe is not a man given to understatement. </p> <p> <strong>From the Lulu Show to Survivor</strong><br></p> <p> In much the same way as Bob Monkhouse suddenly became cool about five years ago, Nigel Lythgoe's new-found cult status has emerged after a 32-year career in the field of light entertainment. From Bobby Davro to Freddie Starr, there is virtually no star of the London Palladium with whom he has not worked: </p> <p><strong> 1970s</strong> </p> <p>After three years with the BBC's dance group Young Generation, he was appointed choreographer in 1971. He worked on more than 500 television shows, including the Lulu Show, Morecambe &amp; Wise, The Two Ronnies, Vera Lynn, The Muppets and five Royal Variety Performances. </p> <p><strong> 1980s</strong> </p> <p>Choreographer and associate producer of Bud 'n' Ches; Tribute to Flanagan &amp; Allen and Dizzy Feet; choreographer and director of Summertime Special for TVS; producer and director on The Bobby Davro Show, The Joe Longthorne Show, A Kind of Magic with Wayne Dobson, and the Bruce Forsyth Show. </p> <p><strong> 1990s</strong> </p> <p>Joined LWT as producer and director in 1992, working on Gladiators, the Brian Conley Show, and Beadle's Daredevils. In 1994, he became head of entertainment, and later controller of entertainment. Oversaw the Audience With . . . series, The Big Big Talent Show, You Bet!, Barrymore, Ice Warriors, Bruce Forsyth at the London Palladium, Royal Tournament, Record of the Year and Abbamania. Lythgoe took on the United productions entertainment and comedy departments, and oversees Michael Barrymore's My Kind of Music, Don't Try This at Home!, Friday Night's All Wright, TV Nightmares, Kids Say the Funniest Things, Hidden Talents of the Rich and Famous, and Cilla Black's Moment of Truth. His department also produces Prickly Heat for Sky, and Spaced, a co-production with Paramount, for Channel 4. </p> <p><strong> The future</strong> </p> <p>Lythgoe is now on secondment to Survivor, the ITV reality show with \u00a31m prize-money.</p>",

He worked on more than 500 television shows, including the Lulu Show, Morecambe &amp; Wise, The Two Ronnies, Vera Lynn, The Muppets and five Royal Variety Performances. 1980s Choreographer and associate producer of Bud 'n' Ches; Tribute to Flanagan &amp; Allen and Dizzy Feet; choreographer and director of Summertime Special for TVS; producer and director on The Bobby Davro Show, The Joe Longthorne Show, A Kind of Magic with Wayne Dobson, and the Bruce Forsyth Show. 1990s Joined LWT as producer and director in 1992, working on Gladiators, the Brian Conley Show, and Beadle's Daredevils. In 1994, he became head of entertainment, and later controller of entertainment. Oversaw the Audience With . . . series, The Big Big Talent Show, You Bet!, Barrymore, Ice Warriors, Bruce Forsyth at the London Palladium, Royal Tournament, Record of the Year and Abbamania. Lythgoe took on the United productions entertainment and comedy departments, and oversees Michael Barrymore's My Kind of Music, Don't Try This at Home!, Friday Night's All Wright, TV Nightmares, Kids Say the Funniest Things, Hidden Talents of the Rich and Famous, and Cilla Black's Moment of Truth. His department also produces Prickly Heat for Sky, and Spaced, a co-production with Paramount, for Channel 4. The future Lythgoe is now on secondment to Survivor, the ITV reality show with \u00a31m prize-money.",

But for viewers the key test of its creative powers is more immediate: whether Live &amp; Kicking will be Dead &amp; Buried in a couple of months. </p> <p>Who else to ask but Nigel Pickard, the new head of CBBC? Last week the tabloids assured us the now low-rating three-hour show will definitely be laid to rest, poor Katy Hill eclipsed by Ant and Dec's SMTV on ITV. Pickard, 48, knows exactly what he's battling: he conjured up SMTV three years ago, revitalising children's programmes for ITV and turning the tables on BBC1. This fired up Greg Dyke to poach him. </p> <p>\"Clearly Saturday morning is in an interesting position,\" says Pickard. \"For the first time in 10 years ITV is doing very well, and Live &amp; Kicking is at a difficult stage - just when I don't want it to be!\" </p> <p>So is the show for the chop? \"Haven't decided yet.\" Is it on probation? \"No. Evolution.\" </p> <p>Pickard, ever the pragmatist, believes Live &amp; Kicking remains a strong brand. And it, or a replacement, must run 52 weeks a year on BBC1. So L&amp;K is currently the focus of intense off-screen development, designed to change it from a staid magazine show to a fizzy compendium of fun ideas and cartoons. </p> <p>L&amp;K can't pretend to be SMTV, he says, but the revamped show won't be interviewing Mo Mowlam or the BBC1 controller like the pre-Pickard version. \"We have nine months to see if can be tweaked,\" he reckons. </p> <p>Pickard believes that CBBC programmes should aim to capture 30% of the available children's audience, and viewers had a taste of his competitiveness last week. To stop kids zapping, Newsround was moved from 5pm to 5.30pm, before Neighbours, allowing Blue Peter and dramas such as Byker Grove to start at 5pm. </p> <p>Not that he's anti-Newsround: he regards it as a \"a major part of our new channel line-up\". He insists its agenda and target audience (11 year olds) are unchanged, though animal conservation stories seem to be crowded out by items on stress and mobile phones. But then, as he observes, children are older younger. </p> <p>Pickard's biggest initiative, coming in April, will be rebranding CBBC to keep adults out. \"CBBC has some fantastic programmes, but as a brand it doesn't punch its weight. CBBC should be the equivalent of a kid's bedroom, it should be exciting, a mess, somewhere you can go that's adult-free. It should feel like you're not being watched over. It should be your space. I don't think we've got that tone of voice right now, but the team are working hard towards it.\" </p> <p>Children's viewing habits \"are even more frenetic than a couple of years ago. We must be aware of the duration of programmes and links. We have to move in faster, engage them faster. We must ensure the action continues right to the end. I want them to feel they daren't leave us.\" </p> <p>Pickard's main task since joining has been planning two children's digital channels: Playbox, aimed at 2-to-5s and due to start this summer, and a second network for 6-to-13s, launching in winter 2002. The formal application went to Chris Smith for approval last Thursday, just two days after the culture secretary published detailed guidelines for new services. </p> <p>The BBC is to expand its annual spending on children from \u00a340m to more than \u00a390m. A quarter of the digital channel programmes will be new, but designed to be interchangeable with CBBC. The pre-school channel will have 90% British programming - Teletubbies, Tweenies, Noddy, Postman Pat - compared to 78% on the other channel. </p> <p>The plans are contentious. Paul Robinson, managing director of Disney TV UK, says there are 14 commercial channels already serving UK children - so Smith must ensure that the BBC's are pure public service. </p> <p>Will they be? \"Public service is at the core,\" Pickard says. \"These cannot be archive channels, they cannot be about exploiting libraries. We have got to create unique programming. As a proposition it's fantastic. That's why it is tough to argue against.\" </p> <p> Although Robinson says the BBC channels will favour children in multi-channel homes, Pickard insists that \"the product will be universally available. All these programmes will be platform-neutral. Certain programmes will premiere on the pre-school channel, but over time they will refresh CBBC1 and BBC2, which will remain our main portals.\" </p> <p>As for the commercial networks' grouse that they have been blocked from buying BBC library programmes, Pickard says: \"I don't think it's unreasonable if we are likely to launch a preschool channel. It's good business sense, and it's important that we don't dilute BBC brands.\" </p> <p>The two new channels will occupy the lion's share of BBC3 and BBC4. Playbox, on BBC4, will run from 6am to 7pm, and stress \"learning through play\", with online back-up and tips for carers and parents. Pickard has inherited seven new pre-school strands, seized on by critics as evidence that the BBC is jumping the gun, expecting a friendly government rubber stamp. \"This is called preparation,\" he retorts. \"Once we're given the green light we want to get on air quickly.\" Why the rush? \"It's important, with digital rolling out, that you need to be there. The Nickelodeons and the Disneys are way ahead, by seven or eight years.\" </p> <p>The plans contain no promise of audience levels, and there must be concern that the BBC's channels could be so public service that children won't watch.\"I think they will watch. Public service doesn't mean boring. It means fulfilling commitments about a range of programming not provided elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Bidding to bring teenagers back to CBBC, the channel for older children will run from 7am to 8pm on BBC3, later than expected, with three news shows a day. Other programme ideas include Blue Peter spin-offs and more cookery. It will profile bands but not make another chart show. </p> <p>\"We mustn't just perpetuate what we do. There are real opportunities for creating new programmes, not just clones,\" says Pickard, who is dead set against a teen soap. But a young teen comedy is in development. </p> <p>The new services, he says, are driven by ideas. \"This hasn't been done on the basis that we must achieve a 10% share, or a guaranteed target, that's the refreshing thing.

      "body": "<p>This is the strategy: if you can't fix things quickly, you must at least look as if you're trying. At the start of the long election campaign, this past week has been a good example of a hyperactive government media machine trying to mould news, good and bad, to its own advantage. The more troublesome the story, the more important the response. </p> <p>It began with a dramatic story on January 5 in the Times. Roland Watson, the paper's astute chief political correspondent, got an early glimpse of the Department of Health report which revealed that Harold Shipman may have killed up to 265 patients. The splash came with two pages of reports and an editorial. It was followed up in the later editions of its rivals, with the Daily Telegraph, Independent and Sun (an interesting combination) changing their front pages. The report was due to be published later in the day, so was this a case of news management? Watson, who says he had been on the trail of the story for some time, is understandably coy about the source. But he wrote, not too cryptically: \"Alan Milburn has been aware for a number of weeks of the likely scale of the findings.\" </p> <p>Purely coincidentally, of course, another announcement was planned for the following Monday - the creation of a national clinical assessment authority to monitor dodgy doctors. The story was briefed to all the Sundays. But the link between a mass murderer and clinical neglect is, to say the least, tenuous - as Alice Miles of the Times pointed out later that week. </p> <p>The trouble with giving a story in advance to journalists is that on the following day they tend to look for a different - and more critical - angle. On the Monday, the paper's health correspondent dwelt not on the advent of the NCAA, but of a government climbdown over so-called \"boot camps for doctors\". The paper also spent much of the week showing that 250 out of 700 hospital buildings are filthy. </p> <p>Elsewhere in Wapping, the News of the World claimed the government had disingenuously included 20,000 people registered for care at home in figures relating to hospital beds. It also had two damaging leader articles, one on the story about the figures, the other on the Shipman case, saying ministers had until now been \"fighting tooth and nail\" to keep the inquiries secret. The Sunday Mirror had a commentary from a luminary of the British Medical Association on the dire state of the NHS. But worse came in Monday's Daily Mail, with doctor-in- residence Anthony Daniels saying the creation of the NCAA was part of a Labour \"Leninist\" plot to \"turn doctors into obedient petty clerks\". </p> <p>On Wednesday, the Mirror announced pay rises for doctors and nurses. Alongside was another leaked piece of good news for Milburn, saying the forthcoming waiting list figures would show a sharp drop. Again, when the figures were actually published, they were drowned in Friday's tabloids by another story. The Mail and the Sun revealed that the NHS \"hires African nurses with HIV\". </p> <p>So, the verdict on the week was: bad, but it could have been much worse. The Downing Street plan - according to officials - is to offload as much of the difficult stuff as early as possible. But what an opportunity was missed on Monday, when the best story of the week appeared in the Telegraph. \"Fears of a new flu crisis at the NHS are receding,\" it said. The story was tucked away in the bottom righthand corner of page 6. Why did the government's spin maestros allow such a winner to be thrown away like that?</p>",

But he wrote, not too cryptically: \"Alan Milburn has been aware for a number of weeks of the likely scale of the findings.\" Purely coincidentally, of course, another announcement was planned for the following Monday - the creation of a national clinical assessment authority to monitor dodgy doctors. The story was briefed to all the Sundays. But the link between a mass murderer and clinical neglect is, to say the least, tenuous - as Alice Miles of the Times pointed out later that week. The trouble with giving a story in advance to journalists is that on the following day they tend to look for a different - and more critical - angle. On the Monday, the paper's health correspondent dwelt not on the advent of the NCAA, but of a government climbdown over so-called \"boot camps for doctors\". The paper also spent much of the week showing that 250 out of 700 hospital buildings are filthy. Elsewhere in Wapping, the News of the World claimed the government had disingenuously included 20,000 people registered for care at home in figures relating to hospital beds. It also had two damaging leader articles, one on the story about the figures, the other on the Shipman case, saying ministers had until now been \"fighting tooth and nail\" to keep the inquiries secret. The Sunday Mirror had a commentary from a luminary of the British Medical Association on the dire state of the NHS. But worse came in Monday's Daily Mail, with doctor-in- residence Anthony Daniels saying the creation of the NCAA was part of a Labour \"Leninist\" plot to \"turn doctors into obedient petty clerks\". On Wednesday, the Mirror announced pay rises for doctors and nurses. Alongside was another leaked piece of good news for Milburn, saying the forthcoming waiting list figures would show a sharp drop. Again, when the figures were actually published, they were drowned in Friday's tabloids by another story. The Mail and the Sun revealed that the NHS \"hires African nurses with HIV\". So, the verdict on the week was: bad, but it could have been much worse. The Downing Street plan - according to officials - is to offload as much of the difficult stuff as early as possible. But what an opportunity was missed on Monday, when the best story of the week appeared in the Telegraph. \"Fears of a new flu crisis at the NHS are receding,\" it said. The story was tucked away in the bottom righthand corner of page 6. Why did the government's spin maestros allow such a winner to be thrown away like that?",

      "body": "<p>Walsall was once famous for its leather industry - hence Walsall Football Club's nickname, the Saddlers. </p> <p>These days only a museum preserves the memory of the industry. Unemployment is high and low wages are rife. </p> <p>The West Midlands town, in the industrial Black Country, retains a tough working men's club culture, fuelled by bitters and baltis, in which too much attention to health can be seen as effete. </p> <p>It also has a large Asian population, with higher than average rates of heart disease. </p> <p>These factors may go some way to explain why the Walsall NHS trust has the highest death rates in the country, as found in the study by Sir Brian Jarman of Imperial College, London, published yesterday. </p> <p>But Sam Ramaiah, the trust's public health director, who has earned local notoriety for his vigorous assault on Walsall's \"curry and couch potato\" lifestyle, expressed astonishment that death rates were not weighted by social factors: \"I've been saying for a long time that deprivation has a major impact on health, and it certainly has on mortality rates.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, the finding of a link between staff levels and patient deaths has alarmed the trust, which runs Walsall Manor hospital. </p> <p>Trust sources indicated that the report could be used to put pressure on the government to provide more cash for recruitment. The hospital has 23 doctors per 100 beds, compared with an average of 35 per 100 beds in England. </p> <p>After a board meeting yesterday morning, the chief executive, John Rostill, acknowledged \"the broad suggestion that the number of doctors we employ has a direct bearing on mortality.

      "bodyText": "Walsall was once famous for its leather industry - hence Walsall Football Club's nickname, the Saddlers. These days only a museum preserves the memory of the industry. Unemployment is high and low wages are rife. The West Midlands town, in the industrial Black Country, retains a tough working men's club culture, fuelled by bitters and baltis, in which too much attention to health can be seen as effete. It also has a large Asian population, with higher than average rates of heart disease. These factors may go some way to explain why the Walsall NHS trust has the highest death rates in the country, as found in the study by Sir Brian Jarman of Imperial College, London, published yesterday. But Sam Ramaiah, the trust's public health director, who has earned local notoriety for his vigorous assault on Walsall's \"curry and couch potato\" lifestyle, expressed astonishment that death rates were not weighted by social factors: \"I've been saying for a long time that deprivation has a major impact on health, and it certainly has on mortality rates.\" Nevertheless, the finding of a link between staff levels and patient deaths has alarmed the trust, which runs Walsall Manor hospital. Trust sources indicated that the report could be used to put pressure on the government to provide more cash for recruitment. The hospital has 23 doctors per 100 beds, compared with an average of 35 per 100 beds in England. After a board meeting yesterday morning, the chief executive, John Rostill, acknowledged \"the broad suggestion that the number of doctors we employ has a direct bearing on mortality. Of course it's got to be a contributing factor, but I can't believe it's so strong. \"That's the sort of thing we've got to look at.\" He denied there were recruitment problems because of the town's unglamorous image. \"Clearly there are people who like to go to places that have a slightly different background. But it is quite offensive to our staff to say that nobody of calibre would want to work in Walsall. \"It's not a question of us having recruitment difficulty. It's a question of us identifying the funding to take on more staff.\" Mr Rostill stressed that on many other measures Manor hospital performed well, \"such as waiting lists, how quickly we deal with complaints and breast cancer care\". The trust and Walsall health authority are expected to announce a joint inquiry, looking at Sir Brian's methodology and identifying problems with local healthcare. Local people yesterday said they were proud of the hospital and had confidence in its doctors and nurses. Paul Woolley, 50, who was admitted 2 years ago after a stroke and was visiting the hospital's social club, said: \"I was as close to death as you will ever be. When I needed them, they were there. My mother-in-law had surgery for breast cancer here. Both my kids were born here, and the aftercare was absolutely brilliant. Out of 100 I would give them 95. \"Like everywhere else in the country, I think nurses have a raw deal for what they do and should be paid more.\" Benjamin Edwards, 72, was also treated for a stroke in 1998 and regularly returns to catch up with other former patients at the social club. \"It's a good hospital,\" he said. \"After my stroke they did a lot of therapy for me, and I'm much better now.

      "body": "<p>There were long queues at the immigration desk when I arrived at San Francisco's international airport on December 18 1999. Like thousands of other foreign workers converging on the city at the dawn of the third millennium I was about to join the internet industry. After working in British television documentaries for five years I was thrilled to imagine myself as a pioneer in a new medium, and I soon stumbled into a job at \"user-generated\" video site Eveo.com. </p> <p>Founded by French entrepreneur Olivier Zitoun, Eveo.com promised to revolutionise the entertainment industry by connecting film-makers directly with their audience via the internet. The company had raised more than $1m in seed capital with the slogan \"Everyone's a director\". Zitoun believed that the rapid growth of two industries, internet broadband and digital video, meant that millions of people would soon be making their own films, which they would be eager to distribute online. He spoke in charismatic terms about his desire to empower ordinary people to tell their own stories. Above all, as he said in an interview with film-maker community site IndieWire, \"the internet is about people\". I was seduced by the rhetoric. </p> <p>The Chocolate Building in San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square, an area thronged with seagulls and tourists, seemed an odd choice for the headquarters of an internet entertainment company. This feeling of oddity stayed with me as I walked into the Eveo office early last year, to face bare white walls and boxes of self-assembly desks. But as a newcomer to the brash culture of California start-ups, it was difficult to tell for sure that anything was wrong. I built my desk, plugged in my phone, and got to work. </p> <p>Critics of the internet gold rush have rightly assumed that one motive for dot.com employees was greed. But in late 1999 and early 2000, there was also a millennialist optimism sustaining the fervour of those who embraced the new technology. The promise of new technology is that it will improve the spiritual, as well as the material lot of humanity, and I am quite sure that, however naively, I invested Eveo with this world-improving faith. Along with the idea of working in a new medium, in a new century, came the thought that this was perhaps a new world. I was not alone in my optimism. At a company meeting, marketing manager Tammy Karpanko, described Eveo as \"video by the people, for the people\". Linda Olszewski, a Dreamworks executive hired as fiction and comedy channel manager, suggested that kids in the ghetto might stop shooting bullets, and start shooting films. </p> <p>As documentary channel manager my job was to get hold of as many short videos as possible before the site launched on February 20. Zitoun gave me a small budget for commissions, and I made some films myself, but my main task was to encourage submissions from aspiring video-makers. The company promised to pay $100 for every video received before the launch date, regardless of quality, in the hope that they could sell some of these films to other websites, or even to television. It seemed unlikely, but I reminded myself that I was part of a revolution, and kept my doubts to myself. \"You don't need to worry about that,\" the vice-president Marc Ruxin reassured me, when I asked him how the company intended to make money. So, like all the other workers joining start-ups without clear revenue models, and the investors who gambled on them, I allowed myself to believe that the traditional laws of economics had been miraculously suspended. </p> <p>The oddities multiplied. I tried not to worry, as Ruxin suggested, but it was difficult. In February I attended the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The company had spent several thousand dollars on an advert in one of the festival catalogues. \"A truly inspirational thought for genuine artists,\" the copy declared, \"sub-five-minute shorts can now make you serious bucks.\" A company flyer depicted an Eveo logo in the style of the giant Hollywood sign in the hills above Los Angeles, a tactic so self-important that some people took it as irony. </p> <p>On my return to Ghirardelli Square, I expressed my concerns about the company's public relations strategy to Zitoun. He reassured me that it was early days. We soon began receiving videos in the post. The films ranged from excellent 16mm shorts by young directors to amateur footage of students being sick. Many people in the company began to suggest it should encourage the good material, and reject the bad. Zitoun disagreed. Shortly after the site's launch in March, venture capitalists gave the company $15m. I started getting phone calls from angry film-makers who had not received their $100. </p> <p>Later that month, Zitoun rewarded our hard work with a company boat trip to Angel Island. It was during our games there that I had an epiphany about the way Eveo worked and why I had been feeling so strange. The games were random. People divided into small groups, which then divided into still smaller groups, before re-forming in new allegiances, with footballs and frisbees flying back and forth arbitrarily. It struck me that life in the office was scarcely different: emails flew back and forth, projects emerged and then vanished, people came and went without explanation or consequence. It was chaos. </p> <p>In April I helped to produce a DVD, featuring the best work on the site, which the company gave away as a promotional tool at the Cannes Film Festival. A few days after packing the discs into boxes and sending them out into the world, Karpanko received an anxious phone call from Max Frankston, a New York film-maker and winner of an Eveo contest for a short documentary he directed about his son, which was meant to feature on the disc. Frankston had invited relatives to watch the film at his home, and was calling Karpanko to say that he had received the \"wrong\" DVD. </p> <p>The disc had an Eveo label, and was packed in an Eveo box, but did not feature Eveo material. Instead, the DVD contained a hardcore porn film called Blackballers II, about a gang of black men who abduct and rape young white boys. Frankston was not alone in receiving Blackballers II, and Eveo film editor Marcy Charap spent several painful hours calling bewildered film-makers to apologise for the mysterious mix-up in the DVD pressing plant, which was never explained. </p> <p>I might have seen the funny side, but I'd started making promises I could not keep, to people I respected. The angry phone calls from unpaid film-makers got angrier. The oddities multiplied to a surreal level, and I sank into depression. In February, I began talks with Colin Luke and Adam Alexander of the UK indepen dent production company Mosaic Films. The talks were still continuing when I left the company almost five months later. </p> <p>In April I went to a film festival in Taos, New Mexico, and met Haskell Wexler, the Oscar-winning cinematographer of Days of Heaven. Listening to my pitch about global democracy, he agreed to give the company his video about Gladys Knight and Burt Bacharach in Cuba. But I no longer believed what I was saying, and Wexler's generosity shamed me. </p> <p>Later that month, the Nasdaq slumped, and a string of internet companies went bust. But it was the end of the millennial optimism, not the stock market downturn, which led to my resignation on June 30. Like the investors who lost their shirts on overvalued stocks in April, I lost my innocence about the corporate world, and my naive faith in the internet. </p> <p>Eveo survives today with a new business plan, based on licensing its services to other companies. But, for me at least, the idealism is over.</p>",

After working in British television documentaries for five years I was thrilled to imagine myself as a pioneer in a new medium, and I soon stumbled into a job at \"user-generated\" video site Eveo.com. Founded by French entrepreneur Olivier Zitoun, Eveo.com promised to revolutionise the entertainment industry by connecting film-makers directly with their audience via the internet. The company had raised more than $1m in seed capital with the slogan \"Everyone's a director\". Zitoun believed that the rapid growth of two industries, internet broadband and digital video, meant that millions of people would soon be making their own films, which they would be eager to distribute online. He spoke in charismatic terms about his desire to empower ordinary people to tell their own stories. Above all, as he said in an interview with film-maker community site IndieWire, \"the internet is about people\". I was seduced by the rhetoric. The Chocolate Building in San Francisco's Ghirardelli Square, an area thronged with seagulls and tourists, seemed an odd choice for the headquarters of an internet entertainment company. This feeling of oddity stayed with me as I walked into the Eveo office early last year, to face bare white walls and boxes of self-assembly desks. But as a newcomer to the brash culture of California start-ups, it was difficult to tell for sure that anything was wrong. I built my desk, plugged in my phone, and got to work. Critics of the internet gold rush have rightly assumed that one motive for dot.com employees was greed. But in late 1999 and early 2000, there was also a millennialist optimism sustaining the fervour of those who embraced the new technology. The promise of new technology is that it will improve the spiritual, as well as the material lot of humanity, and I am quite sure that, however naively, I invested Eveo with this world-improving faith. Along with the idea of working in a new medium, in a new century, came the thought that this was perhaps a new world. I was not alone in my optimism. At a company meeting, marketing manager Tammy Karpanko, described Eveo as \"video by the people, for the people\". Linda Olszewski, a Dreamworks executive hired as fiction and comedy channel manager, suggested that kids in the ghetto might stop shooting bullets, and start shooting films. As documentary channel manager my job was to get hold of as many short videos as possible before the site launched on February 20. Zitoun gave me a small budget for commissions, and I made some films myself, but my main task was to encourage submissions from aspiring video-makers. The company promised to pay $100 for every video received before the launch date, regardless of quality, in the hope that they could sell some of these films to other websites, or even to television. It seemed unlikely, but I reminded myself that I was part of a revolution, and kept my doubts to myself. \"You don't need to worry about that,\" the vice-president Marc Ruxin reassured me, when I asked him how the company intended to make money. So, like all the other workers joining start-ups without clear revenue models, and the investors who gambled on them, I allowed myself to believe that the traditional laws of economics had been miraculously suspended. The oddities multiplied. I tried not to worry, as Ruxin suggested, but it was difficult. In February I attended the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The company had spent several thousand dollars on an advert in one of the festival catalogues. \"A truly inspirational thought for genuine artists,\" the copy declared, \"sub-five-minute shorts can now make you serious bucks.\" A company flyer depicted an Eveo logo in the style of the giant Hollywood sign in the hills above Los Angeles, a tactic so self-important that some people took it as irony. On my return to Ghirardelli Square, I expressed my concerns about the company's public relations strategy to Zitoun. He reassured me that it was early days. We soon began receiving videos in the post. The films ranged from excellent 16mm shorts by young directors to amateur footage of students being sick. Many people in the company began to suggest it should encourage the good material, and reject the bad. Zitoun disagreed. Shortly after the site's launch in March, venture capitalists gave the company $15m. I started getting phone calls from angry film-makers who had not received their $100. Later that month, Zitoun rewarded our hard work with a company boat trip to Angel Island. It was during our games there that I had an epiphany about the way Eveo worked and why I had been feeling so strange. The games were random. People divided into small groups, which then divided into still smaller groups, before re-forming in new allegiances, with footballs and frisbees flying back and forth arbitrarily. It struck me that life in the office was scarcely different: emails flew back and forth, projects emerged and then vanished, people came and went without explanation or consequence. It was chaos. In April I helped to produce a DVD, featuring the best work on the site, which the company gave away as a promotional tool at the Cannes Film Festival. A few days after packing the discs into boxes and sending them out into the world, Karpanko received an anxious phone call from Max Frankston, a New York film-maker and winner of an Eveo contest for a short documentary he directed about his son, which was meant to feature on the disc. Frankston had invited relatives to watch the film at his home, and was calling Karpanko to say that he had received the \"wrong\" DVD. The disc had an Eveo label, and was packed in an Eveo box, but did not feature Eveo material. Instead, the DVD contained a hardcore porn film called Blackballers II, about a gang of black men who abduct and rape young white boys. Frankston was not alone in receiving Blackballers II, and Eveo film editor Marcy Charap spent several painful hours calling bewildered film-makers to apologise for the mysterious mix-up in the DVD pressing plant, which was never explained. I might have seen the funny side, but I'd started making promises I could not keep, to people I respected. The angry phone calls from unpaid film-makers got angrier. The oddities multiplied to a surreal level, and I sank into depression. In February, I began talks with Colin Luke and Adam Alexander of the UK indepen dent production company Mosaic Films. The talks were still continuing when I left the company almost five months later. In April I went to a film festival in Taos, New Mexico, and met Haskell Wexler, the Oscar-winning cinematographer of Days of Heaven. Listening to my pitch about global democracy, he agreed to give the company his video about Gladys Knight and Burt Bacharach in Cuba. But I no longer believed what I was saying, and Wexler's generosity shamed me. Later that month, the Nasdaq slumped, and a string of internet companies went bust. But it was the end of the millennial optimism, not the stock market downturn, which led to my resignation on June 30. Like the investors who lost their shirts on overvalued stocks in April, I lost my innocence about the corporate world, and my naive faith in the internet. Eveo survives today with a new business plan, based on licensing its services to other companies. But, for me at least, the idealism is over.",

The Creative Collective, a partnership of black and Asian journalists that includes former Pride editor Joy Francis and BBC London Live broadcaster Henry Bonsu, has secured \u00a310,000 from the Freedom Forum in Washington for three media internships. The three-month paid internships will be offered on national and local newspapers and magazines. The Big Issue and the Nottingham Evening Post have already signed up and the London College of Printing will distribute grants for the programme. Recruitment starts this week and the scheme will launch in July. The initiative is being launched in the week following BBC director general Greg Dyke's outburst in a BBC Radio Scotland interview in which he described the corporation as \"hideously white\". Joy Francis, founding director of the Creative Collective, said that Mr Dyke's timing had been very good for the Coalition. She said, however, that there was a far greater urgency in attracting recruits from the ethnic minorities to the press than broadcasting, which tended to be more progressive.

As union leaders headed for Zurich to plead with General Motors to reprieve its factory at Luton, the head of Ford of Europe made a rare foray into party politics. Nick Scheele challenged William Hague to rethink the Tory policy of ruling out British membership of the euro in the next parliament, warning that Ford's strategic planning - on which 50,000 UK jobs rest - was based on euro-entry by the middle of the decade. Unless sterling has joined the euro by 2006 further serious damage will be done to manufacturing, both sides of industry agree. Ford, GM and Nissan, whose highly productive Sunderland plant employs 5,000 people, are all cutting back. Last night Downing Street confirmed that Mr Blair, a local MP, had had direct talks with Nissan about its threat to move production of the new model Micra to France because of the pound's strength. Sir Ken Jackson, leader of the engineers' union, the AEEU, and one of today's TUC delegation to Zurich, yesterday accused Mr Hague of being ignorant of industry's needs. AEEU officials will fly to Brussels today to persuade the European commission to sanction \u00a340m of government aid that would keep Nissan's investment for the Micra in the region. Mr Scheele spoke out for the industry when he protested that more than 60% of Ford's UK output went to the EU - at a 30% disadvantage since the euro's collapse against the pound. Early entry into the euro zone was the answer, he suggested. \"Our strategic planning has always been on the basis that Britain would ultimately enter the euro,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "A Palestinian youth of 18 described by his father as \"simple-minded\" may be publicly executed by firing squad in Bethlehem within the next few days after a short military trial convicted him of collaborating with Israel. At his two-hour televised trial on Saturday, Hussameddin Moussa Hmeid Eslini, 18, was said to have been paid $200 (about \u00a3130) to photograph and record the movements of a local commander of Yasser Arafat's Fatah militias, Hussein Abayat, who was assassinated by Israel on November 9. There is no appeal, though Mr Arafat can commute the sentence, and in the family home near Bethlehem the condemned man's mother went into premature mourning yesterday. His father, Moussa, also wept, shaking his head in disbelief that his barely literate son could be capable of treason. \"He is too simple-minded. I can't believe any of this about him. If they can do this to Hussam, what about my youngest son?\" he said, clutching the 10-year-old to his side. Eslini was one of two men condemned on Saturday - two others were given life terms - and he could go before a firing squad within days, the Fatah leader in Bethlehem district, Kamal Hmeid, said. He has asked Mr Arafat to approve a public execution, possibly near Manger Square. Two convicted earlier were executed on Saturday, Allam Beni Odeh in front of 5,000 people Nablus on the West Bank and Majdi Mikkawi in a police station in Gaza. Up to 40 other suspected collaborators are believed to be held in the Bethlehem area alone. \"It is useful for the Palestinian people to see what happens to big criminals who are responsible for the killing of a big leader,\" Mr Hmeid said. Eslini, an unemployed building worker with a bad stammer who can barely write his own name, was given a swift trial. His lawyer had 30 minutes to prepare a defence and uttered one sentence, asking for a delay. There was a single witness, the prison doctor, who testified that Eslini was treated well in captivity. Eslini stammered a few words about his innocence. Abayat was the first to die in what the Israeli government has since admitted was a policy of systematically liquidating Palestinian leaders. Its hit squads rely on thousands of informers. \"A whole network of eyes is following everyone,\" Mr Hmeid said. Two of the men sentenced on Saturday were said to have plotted his assassination. Critics say the executions are meant to distract attention from Mr Arafat's efforts to step back from the 16 weeks of unrest, which many in Fatah see as a betrayal.

David Cairns, selected by the local party to defend a 13,040 majority in the Greenock and Inverclyde constituency, has lobbied for the law to be changed after learning that he would be unable to represent the constituency, because until 1994 he had been a priest. Any former clergymen ordained by a bishop are prevented from representing parliamentary constituencies, except those ordained by the Church of England after an exception was made in 1870. The anti-Catholic laws were adopted in an era when discrimination was widespread. Mike O'Brien, a Home Office minister, is expected to present the move as a non-controversial \"tidying up\" move when the intention to repeal is announced, possibly today. The government is hoping for cross-party support for a measure that also applies to a number of other Christian faiths such as the Greek and Russian Orthodox churches. Bruce Kent, the former chairman of CND and an ex-priest, would have been banned from the Commons if he had won when he stood in Oxford for Labour.

      "body": "<p>People in Britain's richest areas have gained most from the strong economy since Labour came to power, with areas reliant on farming and manufacturing gaining least, according to a survey released today.</p> <p>Household income in Surrey rose by 12% over the past two years, well above inflation, while Cornwall's grew by 1.7%, well below inflation, now at 3.2%, meaning that its economy is, in effect, in recession.</p> <p>The fabled north-south divide is too simplistic to describe differing income levels, with the poorest regions being the south-west, East Anglia and Wales as well as the north.</p> <p>Overall incomes have risen, with the average household earning \u00a323,200 a year, a growth of 8.6% since the last survey two years ago by the market analysts CACI, and a rise of 19.6% since 1996.</p> <p>Comparing counties, household income in Surrey is 88% higher than the level in Cornwall, and 80% higher than Tyne and Wear.</p> <p>In Surrey, the richest county, the average income was \u00a333,400 followed by Berkshire with \u00a331,700, with the rest of the top 10 comprising London and the home counties. Bottom of the county list was Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly where average household income is \u00a317,700.</p> <p>But even within counties there are huge disparities which the study can highlight by providing a breakdown of income by postcode. Merseyside, one of the poorest, contains the seventh richest neighbourhood in the UK, which is Heswall, Wirral, where the average household income is \u00a346,600.</p> <p>But nearby Liverpool contains four of the 10 poorest postcode sectors. The Vauxhall, central, Seaforth and Kirby areas of the city have an average income as low as \u00a39,100.</p> <p>The survey also highlights deprived areas enjoying a boom. One of Britain's poorest boroughs, Hackney, north-east London, experienced a 22.5% income growth in two years taking its average to \u00a326,000. This is believed to be due to the \"gentrification\" of the area with professional and middle-class people moving in after finding property prices in neighbouring Islington too high.

      "bodyText": "People in Britain's richest areas have gained most from the strong economy since Labour came to power, with areas reliant on farming and manufacturing gaining least, according to a survey released today. Household income in Surrey rose by 12% over the past two years, well above inflation, while Cornwall's grew by 1.7%, well below inflation, now at 3.2%, meaning that its economy is, in effect, in recession. The fabled north-south divide is too simplistic to describe differing income levels, with the poorest regions being the south-west, East Anglia and Wales as well as the north. Overall incomes have risen, with the average household earning \u00a323,200 a year, a growth of 8.6% since the last survey two years ago by the market analysts CACI, and a rise of 19.6% since 1996. Comparing counties, household income in Surrey is 88% higher than the level in Cornwall, and 80% higher than Tyne and Wear. In Surrey, the richest county, the average income was \u00a333,400 followed by Berkshire with \u00a331,700, with the rest of the top 10 comprising London and the home counties. Bottom of the county list was Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly where average household income is \u00a317,700. But even within counties there are huge disparities which the study can highlight by providing a breakdown of income by postcode. Merseyside, one of the poorest, contains the seventh richest neighbourhood in the UK, which is Heswall, Wirral, where the average household income is \u00a346,600. But nearby Liverpool contains four of the 10 poorest postcode sectors. The Vauxhall, central, Seaforth and Kirby areas of the city have an average income as low as \u00a39,100. The survey also highlights deprived areas enjoying a boom. One of Britain's poorest boroughs, Hackney, north-east London, experienced a 22.5% income growth in two years taking its average to \u00a326,000. This is believed to be due to the \"gentrification\" of the area with professional and middle-class people moving in after finding property prices in neighbouring Islington too high. But even in Islington, affluence and poverty sit side by side. One postcode in the Highbury area enjoys an average household income twice as high as one less than 100 metres away. The highest earning postcode is west London, with an average income of \u00a334,200, up 13.4% since 1998. The lowest is Sunderland, with an average income of \u00a317,000 per household, an increase over two years of 5.8%. The highest earning postal code areas are in London and the south-east, and this is where the biggest rise in incomes over the past two years is concentrated. The survey does not detail the causes behind why those areas that have the most wealth are doing best. But London and the south-east are where more people work in sectors such as IT, financial services, consulting, higher skilled service sector jobs, and non-public sector professions. Highest earning area by postcode sector: South Kensington, London, average household income \u00a347,700. Poorest: Vauxhall, Liverpool, \u00a39,100. Ave household income in the constituencies of Tony Blair (Sedgefield) \u00a318,700; William Hague (Richmond) \u00a322,200; Charles Kennedy (Ross, Skye and Inverness) \u00a320,800.",

      "bodyText": "Defence ministers will come under renewed pressure today to reveal what they know about the medical risks posed by depleted uranium in the face of fresh evidence of its potentially serious dangers to health. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, who will be questioned by MPs today, admitted yesterday there was a \"limited risk\" associated with DU ammunition but insisted there was no proof it had actually caused illnesses. \"We've always recognised that there was a limited risk to the use of depleted uranium weapons and we have always instructed members of the armed forces accordingly,\" he said. \"But beyond that particular specified risk there are no risks associated with the use of depleted uranium, and certainly no proven link between its use and any illness\", he told Sky television. Lord Morris, parliamentary adviser to the British Legion, which wants a public inquiry into the handling of health problems faced by Gulf war veterans, will raise the issue in the Lords. He said: \"The Gulf veterans feel provoked to say it is shameful that Britain can stand by and watch other countries taking the lead in this issue when we were among the first to use depleted uranium.\" On the eve of the 10th anniversary of the conflict, Shaun Rusling, of the Gulf War Veterans and Families Association, also called for an inquiry and appealed for public support to help fund \"proper testing and proper medical care\". More than 450 British service personnel have died since the war, more than 130 of them from cancer, including leukaemia. A high incidence of the illness among Italian Balkan veterans has led to demands for special screening among Britain's European allies. The navy knew 10 years ago of the dangers when it warned firefighters tackling a fire in a DU store to use nuclear, biological and chemical warfare protective suits. In a separate report it emerged yesterday that a report by the UK Atomic Energy Authority in 1991 warned of a \"significant problem\" of DU radioactivity. Referring to use of the weapons in Kuwait, it said: \"The problem will not go away and should be tackled before it becomes a political problem created by the environmental lobby.\" The shadow defence secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, said: \"It is necessary now for the government to make a clear statement about the position of depleted uranium, given all the evidence that has been coming out in dribs and drabs.\" Useful Links: MoD paper on DU Laka anti-nuclear centre paper on DU risks DUlink, forum for US veterans MoD veterans advice unit US military report on DU in the Gulf Serbian information centre article on DU",

Peering through the curtains, she saw the outline of a man wearing a balaclava and holding a gun.</p> <p>Richard Watson, 55, had been murdered by a hitman. That proved to be the start of a long and traumatic ordeal for Miss London-Williams, now 25, and her mother Linda, now known as Linda Henderson.</p> <p>The two women, who were in a state of shock, were left alone inside the house while police kept at a safe distance and waited 50 minutes for an armed support unit to arrive from Brighton. Although a doctor arrived at the house by car he immediately reversed away again. Neither he nor an ambulance team were allowed to treat Watson.</p> <p>Subsequently family friends, summoned by telephone, arrived, and it was they who broke the news to Linda Watson that her husband was dead.</p> <p><b> Screamed</b><br></p> <p>The police complaints authority concluded that there had been \"a breakdown in communication aggravated by various staff failings\".</p> <p>When the police did enter the house, Mrs Henderson was hurt by the offhand way in which members of the family were treated. Although full details had been given over the phone, the police still had no idea who owned the house.</p> <p>One officer gestured to the body and said: \"Is that the landlord?\"</p> <p>Mrs Henderson recalled: \"I screamed at him, 'He's my husband and' - pointing at Mandy - 'her father.' He actually said 'Oh, shit.' The only compassion shown through all of this was a message of apology from one of the uniformed police and the ambulance men, who had wanted to help that evening but were not allowed to.\"</p> <p>The PCA told the women: \"There is evidence to support some of the allegations you make of incivility towards you.\"</p> <p>The inquiry also found that the initial mistakes jeopardised the entire investigation, explaining that \"potential forensic evidence may have been lost as a result of a lack of leadership and poor communications at the scene\".</p> <p>The family were taken to a local hotel, the Copthorne, and given rooms on the ground floor. Mrs Henderson was alarmed to notice that the police entered their correct personal details in the register. \"I was petrified that this person had seen Mandy and was going to come back to get her,\" she said. \"They then said they had to release details to the press. I asked the police please not to put out Mandy's name. I was then abruptly and coldly told, four hours after losing Richard, 'Look, I know you have had a hard night, but would you just shut up?'</p> <p>\"This was where I came unstuck with the police, because I criticised them very strongly. They don't like strong women.\"</p> <p>From that point the two women were regarded as prime suspects, and interviewed at length.</p> <p>Miss London-Williams was only present at the house that evening because she had just been seriously ill with food poisoning. She was awaiting a brain scan and, according to her solicitor, Jeff Hide, was \"in a state of almost total collapse\". On receiving information about the murder her GP recommended that a clinical psychologist should be on hand, and personally arranged for Nigel Gordon to attend her. But although Mr Gordon waited for more than four hours, the police refused to allow him to see either of the women.</p> <p>The PCA found that this part of the complaint was substantiated, and pointed to the \"clear evidence\" that the interviews with Miss London-Williams were in breach of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.</p> <p>\"The cruelty was terrible,\" said Mrs Henderson. \"To mentally damage people to the extent that they have done with Mandy and I - they shouldn't be allowed to do that.\"</p> <p>Mrs Henderson sold the house: she knew she could not live there again. But no sooner had she and her daughter moved into their new house than 14 officers arrived early one morning. She was arrested and taken to East Grinstead police station. It was only later she found out that her daughter had also been arrested and taken to Haywards Heath. They were held in custody for five days before being released without charge.</p> <p>They subsequently found out that police had planted listening devices in their new home. Builders saw men breaking into the house, and apprehended them. When the builders threatened to call the police, the intruders had to admit that they were the police: they had broken in to remove the bugging devices. The builders gave statements to defence solicitors.</p> <p>Had the trial gone ahead, however, it is likely that the police would have tried to suppress this through the use of public interest immunity certificates.</p> <p>Although solicitors for the two women had made it clear that their clients were willing to answer further questions at any time, the two women were then arrested in a public and humiliating way - Mrs Henderson as she arrived back at Gatwick airport from a trip to Scotland, and her daughter as she was walking in Brighton.</p> <p>One of the major grounds of criticism of police conduct was that by this time Watson's body had finally been released to his wife. She went ahead with the funeral and had him cremated.</p> <p>At that stage, she had no idea that she and her daughter would have to face murder charges. By releasing the body at that juncture the police deprived the defence of the opportunity to have an independent postmortem examination performed on the body.</p> <p>The PCA told the women its investigation had found that \"at the time you were documented as suspects. Your allegation is substantiated.\"</p> <p>The PCA did not find evidence in favour of the women on every allegation. As evidence of the animus of Sussex police against them, Mrs Henderson cited officers' reactions when she and her daughter were sent to Holloway. \"There were shouts of 'Yes!' from the detectives present,\" she said. \"They raised their arms in a cheering gesture, like football hooligans.\" The PCA reported that the officers \"refuted the allegation and the evidence of an independent witness supports their account\".</p> <p>There were many other leads that could have been pursued in the murder inquiry. Watson, whose company had helped to install the main telephone exchange in Moscow, had some shady business contacts, both in this country and overseas. Moreover, he had been the victim of a stun-gun attack, by two men wearing balaclavas, only a month before he was murdered.</p> <p><b> Concealed</b><br></p> <p>Crown lawyers halted the prosecution late on Friday June 5 1998, with the trial due to start on the Monday. The entire prosecution depended on the theory that the two shots that killed Watson were fired from the balcony of the house, and thus the gunman had been aided by those inside. Yet the very first scientific report made it clear that it was \"not possible to determine positively from where each shot was fired\".</p> <p>One of the women's complaints was that throughout the inquiry the police had concealed the weakness of their case from the crown prosecution service. The PCA found that: \"Too much significance was placed upon the belief that Richard Watson had been shot from the balcony. The evidence did not justify the scenario. The papers submitted by officers to the CPS overstated this issue and, although there was no evidence of malice, the investigation concludes that your prosecution was ill-founded as a result.\"</p> <p><b>Related story</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,422392,00.html\">Police slated for murder case failings</a></p>",

The two women, who were in a state of shock, were left alone inside the house while police kept at a safe distance and waited 50 minutes for an armed support unit to arrive from Brighton. Although a doctor arrived at the house by car he immediately reversed away again. Neither he nor an ambulance team were allowed to treat Watson. Subsequently family friends, summoned by telephone, arrived, and it was they who broke the news to Linda Watson that her husband was dead. Screamed The police complaints authority concluded that there had been \"a breakdown in communication aggravated by various staff failings\". When the police did enter the house, Mrs Henderson was hurt by the offhand way in which members of the family were treated. Although full details had been given over the phone, the police still had no idea who owned the house. One officer gestured to the body and said: \"Is that the landlord?\" Mrs Henderson recalled: \"I screamed at him, 'He's my husband and' - pointing at Mandy - 'her father.' He actually said 'Oh, shit.' The only compassion shown through all of this was a message of apology from one of the uniformed police and the ambulance men, who had wanted to help that evening but were not allowed to.\" The PCA told the women: \"There is evidence to support some of the allegations you make of incivility towards you.\" The inquiry also found that the initial mistakes jeopardised the entire investigation, explaining that \"potential forensic evidence may have been lost as a result of a lack of leadership and poor communications at the scene\". The family were taken to a local hotel, the Copthorne, and given rooms on the ground floor. Mrs Henderson was alarmed to notice that the police entered their correct personal details in the register. \"I was petrified that this person had seen Mandy and was going to come back to get her,\" she said. \"They then said they had to release details to the press. I asked the police please not to put out Mandy's name. I was then abruptly and coldly told, four hours after losing Richard, 'Look, I know you have had a hard night, but would you just shut up?' \"This was where I came unstuck with the police, because I criticised them very strongly. They don't like strong women.\" From that point the two women were regarded as prime suspects, and interviewed at length. Miss London-Williams was only present at the house that evening because she had just been seriously ill with food poisoning. She was awaiting a brain scan and, according to her solicitor, Jeff Hide, was \"in a state of almost total collapse\". On receiving information about the murder her GP recommended that a clinical psychologist should be on hand, and personally arranged for Nigel Gordon to attend her. But although Mr Gordon waited for more than four hours, the police refused to allow him to see either of the women. The PCA found that this part of the complaint was substantiated, and pointed to the \"clear evidence\" that the interviews with Miss London-Williams were in breach of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. \"The cruelty was terrible,\" said Mrs Henderson. \"To mentally damage people to the extent that they have done with Mandy and I - they shouldn't be allowed to do that.\" Mrs Henderson sold the house: she knew she could not live there again. But no sooner had she and her daughter moved into their new house than 14 officers arrived early one morning. She was arrested and taken to East Grinstead police station. It was only later she found out that her daughter had also been arrested and taken to Haywards Heath. They were held in custody for five days before being released without charge. They subsequently found out that police had planted listening devices in their new home. Builders saw men breaking into the house, and apprehended them. When the builders threatened to call the police, the intruders had to admit that they were the police: they had broken in to remove the bugging devices. The builders gave statements to defence solicitors. Had the trial gone ahead, however, it is likely that the police would have tried to suppress this through the use of public interest immunity certificates. Although solicitors for the two women had made it clear that their clients were willing to answer further questions at any time, the two women were then arrested in a public and humiliating way - Mrs Henderson as she arrived back at Gatwick airport from a trip to Scotland, and her daughter as she was walking in Brighton. One of the major grounds of criticism of police conduct was that by this time Watson's body had finally been released to his wife. She went ahead with the funeral and had him cremated. At that stage, she had no idea that she and her daughter would have to face murder charges. By releasing the body at that juncture the police deprived the defence of the opportunity to have an independent postmortem examination performed on the body. The PCA told the women its investigation had found that \"at the time you were documented as suspects. Your allegation is substantiated.\" The PCA did not find evidence in favour of the women on every allegation. As evidence of the animus of Sussex police against them, Mrs Henderson cited officers' reactions when she and her daughter were sent to Holloway. \"There were shouts of 'Yes!' from the detectives present,\" she said. \"They raised their arms in a cheering gesture, like football hooligans.\" The PCA reported that the officers \"refuted the allegation and the evidence of an independent witness supports their account\". There were many other leads that could have been pursued in the murder inquiry. Watson, whose company had helped to install the main telephone exchange in Moscow, had some shady business contacts, both in this country and overseas. Moreover, he had been the victim of a stun-gun attack, by two men wearing balaclavas, only a month before he was murdered. Concealed Crown lawyers halted the prosecution late on Friday June 5 1998, with the trial due to start on the Monday. The entire prosecution depended on the theory that the two shots that killed Watson were fired from the balcony of the house, and thus the gunman had been aided by those inside. Yet the very first scientific report made it clear that it was \"not possible to determine positively from where each shot was fired\". One of the women's complaints was that throughout the inquiry the police had concealed the weakness of their case from the crown prosecution service. The PCA found that: \"Too much significance was placed upon the belief that Richard Watson had been shot from the balcony. The evidence did not justify the scenario. The papers submitted by officers to the CPS overstated this issue and, although there was no evidence of malice, the investigation concludes that your prosecution was ill-founded as a result.\" Related story Police slated for murder case failings",

With less than a week of his presidency remaining, Mr Clinton has done what Republicans have pressed him to do for more than two years and has submitted a plan to Congress to help opposition groups administer $12m (\u00a38m) in humanitarian relief aid inside Iraq. The new plan involves the distribution of food, medicine and other forms of relief through the Iraqi National Congress, the main umbrella opposition group in the north of the country. Difficult though such clandestine distribution may be in an area controlled by Baghdad, the still more challenging aspect of the plan is that it implicitly involves the US in providing military and security assistance to the INC in plans to re-establish a US-protected \"safe area\" inside Iraq. That commitment seems certain to cause an early dispute within the Bush administration between the new secretary of state, Colin Powell, who is known to be sceptical about the Iraqi opposition's capabilities, and the new Pentagon chief, Donald Rumsfeld, who heads a powerful conservative lobby in the new team committed to more aggressive US engagement. Mr Clinton has been forced to act now by the Republican controlled Congress, which favours a more aggressive US approach in efforts aimed at the ultimate overthrow of President Saddam's regime. Under the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which Mr Clinton signed only reluctantly, the administration was authorised to provide the Iraqi opposition with $97m (\u00a365m) worth of arms and military training as part of the effort to oust Saddam.

      "bodyText": "Worries about food safety problems linked with mad cow disease have now spread across Europe with near panic in Germany and Greece, according to the exclusive Guardian/ICM poll of public opinion across eight European countries. The poll shows that in Germany, where two government ministers have just resigned over BSE, 86% of the public say they are worried about the disease. The public is equally concerned in Greece and there are high levels of anxiety in the Netherlands and Italy. The major exception is Britain with only 54% saying they are in any way concerned. Across Europe the poll shows that voters feel that the problems of food safety would be dealt with more efficiently if the EU was given stronger powers over member states to tackle the issue. This view is echoed by two-thirds of voters in Britain. Indeed a common theme which emerges from the poll, which canvassed views in France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK, is that the public wants to see the EU given far greater powers.

Local groups protested outside a new branch of Eduard Kettner's, France's largest hunting accessory retailers, only two months after a 14-year-old boy was killed with a shotgun nearby as the result of a feud between rival gangs. But nearly 50 hunters, organised by the pro-hunting CPNT party (which stands for Chasse, Peche, Nature, et Tradition; or Hunting, Fishing, Nature and Tradition) gathered to give their support to the shop's arrival at the Tarterets housing estate in Corbeil-Essonnes, south of Paris. More than 400 guns, mostly hunting rifles, have been put on sale at the store.

      "bodyText": "Already under pressure because of his foreign minister's street-fighting youth, Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der was embroiled in a new drama last night by claims about the past of one of the newest appointments to his cabinet. The tabloid Bild am Sonntag reported that Ulla Schmidt, the incoming health minister, had worked in her student days as a part-time waitress in red light bars, and had later run into serious financial problems trying to help out a colleague. It said her finances became entangled with those of a friend arrested for trying to exchange counterfeit money. As a result she had to pledge half her MP's salary to a bank. It quoted Ms Schmidt, 51, as saying: \"This has all been chewed over a hundred times. Every time I try to take a step forward, an attempt is made in this way to put obstacles in my path.\" Her past has already been used in an extortion attempt, it reported. A government spokesman said: \"The chancellor has not the slightest doubt as to Ulla Schmidt's integrity\". But the allegations, in particular those about her financial difficulties, are bound to lead to her suitability to head a high-spending government department being questioned. They also revive the issue of Mr Schr\u00f6der's judgment in dealing with ministers. Ms Schmidt, a member of the Social Democrat party (SPD), and the co-leader of the Greens, Renate K\u00fcnast, were appointed last week to replace two ministers accused of botching the government's handling of the BSE crisis. Mr Schr\u00f6der's decision to stand by his colleagues until days before their departure on a tide of media and public dissatisfaction has earned him widespread criticism. Bild am Sonntag reported that before her appointment was made public Ms Schmidt warned the chancellor, the general secretary of the SPD and the leader of its parliamentary party that details from her past were likely to emerge if she joined the cabinet. That means Mr Schr\u00f6der decided to brave the inevitable row at a time when he already knew that his foreign ministerwas under pressure. Earlier this month photographs were published of Joschka Fischer beating a fallen policeman during a demonstration. Mr Fischer admitted yesterday that he had seen fear in the eyes of the officer. Tomorrow he is due to give evidence at the trial on terrorism charges of an old friend from the 1970s. Some of the ghosts that have returned to haunt Ms Schmidt were conjured up from the same tumultuous decade. At the end of the 70s she worked in her native Aachen as a waitress in two bars owned by her elder sister. One of them was raided by the police, who took away 14 pornographic films, Bild am Sonntag said. The police took Ms Schmidt's personal details but no charges were brought against her. In an interview with Der Spiegel to be published today, the divorced Ms Schmidt is quoted as saying: \"I was a student and single mother and I had to earn money. So I was happy that once a week I could work as a waitress in my sister's place\". After she stood for parliament in 1990 a former partner of her sister was prosecuted for blackmail after threatening to reveal details of her past. Four years later she faced difficulties on the arrest of a Social Democrat MEP who had become involved in a counterfeiting scam after running up gambling debts. Ms Schmidt was found to have guaranteed a number of loans to her friend, for which she then became liable. Bild am Sonntag said she was forced to pledge DM10,000 (\u00a33,200) from her monthly salary to one bank and hand over two insurance policies and her BMW car to another. Ms Schmidt made her name as a leading figure in the tough and still-unresolved negotiations to reform Germany's pension system. Her appointment, and that of Ms K\u00fcnast as agriculture minister, were seen as Mr Schr\u00f6der's attempt to use women to restore public trust. The arrival of BSE in November has had a traumatic effect in a country of big meat eaters repeatedly assured by the government that German farms were free of it.",

      "body": "<p>Between now and May all domestic politics will be pushed out of shape by the impending election, but nowhere will this deformation be worse than in Northern Ireland. The tightrope act of keeping the peace process alive will be made doubly precarious by Ulster unionism's growing tensions and competition for votes between the SDLP and Sinn Fein.</p> <p>There is another piece of bad luck so far as timing is concerned. The run-up to the election coincides with one of the most crucial stages of peace process choreography: the implementation of the changes in the policing of Northern Ireland recommended by Chris Patten and his commission. That was always going to be hard. It may prove impossible to achieve at a time of political grandstanding.</p> <p>The dilemma facing nationalists is whether to endorse the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which - while a huge advance on the Royal Ulster Constabulary - is in many respects a watered-down version of what Mr Patten and his team had in mind. The commission members themselves seem to be divided on whether the new arrangements are acceptable. One of them, Clifford Shearing, stated plainly last November that the police bill \"does not fulfil the hopes and vision of the Belfast agreement... it is not a new beginning. It will not serve the people of Northern Ireland.\" Mr Patten, while not endorsing every element of the act, urged all parties to encourage people in their communities to join the new police service and to make it work. His words were echoed by another commission member, Maurice Hayes, who said to the SDLP and Sinn Fein: \"It is not leadership to retire into a cul-de-sac.\"</p> <p>Mr Hayes's words will fall on deaf ears in Sinn Fein, which continues to reject the new force. The position of the SDLP thus becomes crucial. Were its leaders also to counsel young Catholics against joining the new police service it would make it all but impossible to achieve the bill's requirement of police recruitment on a basis of 50/50 Protestant/Catholic.</p> <p>Electoral politics kick in at this point. SDLP leaders fear that appearing to be out-hawked by Sinn Fein - which is stronger than at at any time since the hunger strikes - will cost them votes. They are unhappy about a number of organisational issues, including the future of the Gough Barracks interrogation centre and the timetable for merging Special Branch and CID and the phasing out of the full-time reserves.

      "bodyText": "Between now and May all domestic politics will be pushed out of shape by the impending election, but nowhere will this deformation be worse than in Northern Ireland. The tightrope act of keeping the peace process alive will be made doubly precarious by Ulster unionism's growing tensions and competition for votes between the SDLP and Sinn Fein. There is another piece of bad luck so far as timing is concerned. The run-up to the election coincides with one of the most crucial stages of peace process choreography: the implementation of the changes in the policing of Northern Ireland recommended by Chris Patten and his commission. That was always going to be hard. It may prove impossible to achieve at a time of political grandstanding. The dilemma facing nationalists is whether to endorse the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which - while a huge advance on the Royal Ulster Constabulary - is in many respects a watered-down version of what Mr Patten and his team had in mind. The commission members themselves seem to be divided on whether the new arrangements are acceptable. One of them, Clifford Shearing, stated plainly last November that the police bill \"does not fulfil the hopes and vision of the Belfast agreement... it is not a new beginning. It will not serve the people of Northern Ireland.\" Mr Patten, while not endorsing every element of the act, urged all parties to encourage people in their communities to join the new police service and to make it work. His words were echoed by another commission member, Maurice Hayes, who said to the SDLP and Sinn Fein: \"It is not leadership to retire into a cul-de-sac.\" Mr Hayes's words will fall on deaf ears in Sinn Fein, which continues to reject the new force. The position of the SDLP thus becomes crucial. Were its leaders also to counsel young Catholics against joining the new police service it would make it all but impossible to achieve the bill's requirement of police recruitment on a basis of 50/50 Protestant/Catholic. Electoral politics kick in at this point. SDLP leaders fear that appearing to be out-hawked by Sinn Fein - which is stronger than at at any time since the hunger strikes - will cost them votes. They are unhappy about a number of organisational issues, including the future of the Gough Barracks interrogation centre and the timetable for merging Special Branch and CID and the phasing out of the full-time reserves. They distrust the arrangements for settling the so-called \"cultural\" issues of cap badges and flags. There are many bits of unfinished business they want to see rigorously investigated, such as the murders of Rosemary Nelson, Pat Finucane and Robert Hamill. The SDLP leadership will - and should - continue to press for concessions on these and other points. In the end, though, they will be faced with the decision of whether to nor to nominate political representatives to the police board, which is due to be in place by the end of the month. Unsatisfactory though the Police Act was, it is doubtful that a boycott of the new policing service would achieve anything beyond further destabilisation of the peace process. The SDLP should fight the nationalist corner, but it should do so from inside the tent. Electorally, it can point to the concessions it has already won by democratic engagement and legitimately demand of Sinn Fein what that party has achieved by pure rejectionism.

Like the latest PlayStation or the newest Man U strip, there is always \"progress\": which means that there will be a Son of Star Wars. It is not, of course, going to be an easy sell - especially here. The original version, with Ronnie playing Luke Skywalker and Gorbachev bizarrely cast as Darth Vader, was always a public relations disaster here (like Frankenstein foods). George W is not, perhaps, the \"son\" most immediate residents of Fylingdales would have in mind - nor William Hague his ideal uncle. But it is also time to be realistic. The question is no longer whether, just when and how. The hanging chads have settled it.</p> <p>Donald Rumsfeld, George Bush's defence secretary, was chairman, three years ago, of the definitive National Missile Defence commission which spurred Bill Clinton into half-hearted action. To see him emerge, second time round, on top of a Republican Pentagon is to see the future laid out before us. Rumsfeld believes in the clear, present or imminent, danger of \"rogue states\" - North Korea, Iran, Iraq - with nuclear missiles. Accordingly, America must have NMD. The anti-ballistic missile treaty of 1972 that stands in the way is, as he told his Senate confirmation hearing, \"ancient history\".</p> <p>An interesting phrase, cutting both ways. Lord Roy Mason of Barnsley was Harold Wilson's defence secretary in the long ago when Gerald Ford first gave Rumsfeld the job. Even so, it's fair enough to indulge in a little archeological excavation. The ancient world of 1972, of Warsaw pact and Nato, has vanished just as surely as the world where the Shah and Saddam were the staunchest of western allies.</p> <p>Why, indeed, not think afresh? That's what Tony Blair, learning the bitter lessons of the Balkans, has done over a European rapid reaction force. (Rumsfeld says American troops are coming out of Kosovo: \"I've concluded over a period of years that the US isn't a good peacekeeper.\") Why, indeed, not adjust to a 21st century in which the European Union is an economic competitor of Washington whose defence concerns cannot be wholly ordained from inside a distant beltway?</p> <p>Why? Because any revised thinking in such areas is complicated, liable to disturb fustian concepts like the \"special relationship\" (words you curiously never hear invoked in DC). Ronald Reagan, perforce, had a better way. If you're selling anything new, if you're piling on extra billions of tax dollars, you have to keep it simple. Star Wars, in his bumbling, picket-fence version, was simple: a hi-tech security blanket that would keep Americans safe from alien harm. Son of Star Wars precisely replicates that pitch.</p> <p>It discerns a threat - from North Korea sometime in the next 10 years, from Iran in the next 15, from Iraq in 20 (Rumsfeld commission figures) - and provides a response. It does not explicitly say that Russia, China and the Ukraine might lurk somewhere behind that thinking because, in a world conditioned by manic Hollywood villains, that would be complicated. It does not pause to explain why Pakistani or Indian nukes should always be friendly ones, and thus excluded from the reckoning.</p> <p>Keep the threat simple. Make it - as Rumsfeld does - the technological alternative to deploying American boys in overseas wars, where they might get sponged by their own depleted uranium. See how cheaply such safety may be bought? \"I don't personally believe that it involves much financial implication -\" What's $60bn when AoL-Time Warner is worth double that? A few gallant souls on Capitol Hill have their objections, of course. They point out that North Korea is changing hugely, that any self-respecting terrorist state would probably ship its bombs to Chicago in a suitcase, that the moment you set up a small shield is the moment your enemies (if any) seek ways to find ways around it. They preach of self-delusion. But we ought to be clear that the two central arguments currently deployed against NMD aren't going to run.</p> <p>One (with a long history of embarrassing failure) says the technology isn't there yet. It won't work. But Americans believe in making things work: the argument is a spur to greater effort, not a blocker. The other (with an equally long and dismal record) says Rumsfeld is wrong and that the project will, in reality, cost squillions. Of course. But that cash will go to some of the Republicans' biggest corporate donors - and to the interests served on Pork Barrel Hill. Start, and they won't stop.</p> <p>In sum, if Tony Blair believes that somehow this Son won't happen, that the question about Fylingdales will never be put, he deludes himself. William Hague's pygmy interventions - snuggling up to George W, driving another surrogate stake into the European Union - are only the beginning. Mute delay isn't an option. Mr Blair must see (already) how tempting the supposed security blanket can be made to sound. Graciously extend it to cover us and we're happy. Instead, he needs to say something early - and simple.</p> <p>Not impossible. 1972 may be ancient history, but Russia's 6,000 strategic missiles aren't. Abrogate the ABM treaty and bang goes Start 2 (article two, paragraph two), which is an umbilical part of the process reducing those warheads. Who wants to jettison Start 3 and the reduction to 2,000? Where's the security in that? Who can blame not just Britain, but all western Europe, for backing the idea if - and only if - Russia accepts NMD? And, of course, no one wants to cling barrenly to a hoary treaty conceived in quite other times. Let there be a new treaty which deals with the realities of a new millennium. Call for Colin Powell.</p> <p>Rogue states, for what they're worth? Why not (as Senator John Kerry asks) go the US Navy way with theatre- wide defence systems that could specifically knock out Taepo-Dong Two's as they left North Korea - not rely on catching up with them much later? Easier, though not yet fully developed, technology: a specific response to a specific threat.</p> <p>If security is the aim, if like most Americans you want and will pay for such security, then this is the way forward. A big tent, not a narrow blanket. Does any of it make your heart leap with joy? Not really. But observe how the weevils work, how our MoD is already reportedly \"more enthusiastic\" about NMD than our Foreign Office. Boys need their toys. Voters need their palliatives. George W Bush and Donald Rumsfeld will have their inquiries, their plans and their \"great debate\". That's a debate - for Europe and for Russia - that we can't bow out of. It's starting. Can we please begin clearing our throats?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

They preach of self-delusion. But we ought to be clear that the two central arguments currently deployed against NMD aren't going to run. One (with a long history of embarrassing failure) says the technology isn't there yet. It won't work. But Americans believe in making things work: the argument is a spur to greater effort, not a blocker. The other (with an equally long and dismal record) says Rumsfeld is wrong and that the project will, in reality, cost squillions. Of course. But that cash will go to some of the Republicans' biggest corporate donors - and to the interests served on Pork Barrel Hill. Start, and they won't stop. In sum, if Tony Blair believes that somehow this Son won't happen, that the question about Fylingdales will never be put, he deludes himself. William Hague's pygmy interventions - snuggling up to George W, driving another surrogate stake into the European Union - are only the beginning. Mute delay isn't an option. Mr Blair must see (already) how tempting the supposed security blanket can be made to sound. Graciously extend it to cover us and we're happy. Instead, he needs to say something early - and simple. Not impossible. 1972 may be ancient history, but Russia's 6,000 strategic missiles aren't. Abrogate the ABM treaty and bang goes Start 2 (article two, paragraph two), which is an umbilical part of the process reducing those warheads. Who wants to jettison Start 3 and the reduction to 2,000? Where's the security in that? Who can blame not just Britain, but all western Europe, for backing the idea if - and only if - Russia accepts NMD? And, of course, no one wants to cling barrenly to a hoary treaty conceived in quite other times. Let there be a new treaty which deals with the realities of a new millennium. Call for Colin Powell. Rogue states, for what they're worth? Why not (as Senator John Kerry asks) go the US Navy way with theatre- wide defence systems that could specifically knock out Taepo-Dong Two's as they left North Korea - not rely on catching up with them much later? Easier, though not yet fully developed, technology: a specific response to a specific threat. If security is the aim, if like most Americans you want and will pay for such security, then this is the way forward. A big tent, not a narrow blanket. Does any of it make your heart leap with joy? Not really. But observe how the weevils work, how our MoD is already reportedly \"more enthusiastic\" about NMD than our Foreign Office. Boys need their toys. Voters need their palliatives. George W Bush and Donald Rumsfeld will have their inquiries, their plans and their \"great debate\". That's a debate - for Europe and for Russia - that we can't bow out of. It's starting. Can we please begin clearing our throats? peter.preston@theguardian.com",

This argument currently has three flaws: first, the secretary of state would in all likelihood use public interest immunity to prevent the critical documents being made available to the courts. Second, the government would continue to injunct any newspaper from telling this story.Third, despite a commitment to reform Northern Ireland's criminal justice system, the government refuses to contemplate any reform of the Diplock no-jury courts, let alone restore the right to trial by jury. This is why relatives of Pat Finucane, the Irish government and the international human rights community continue to demand an independent judicial inquiry with the power to establish the truth and end the culture of impunity that has feather-bedded the security services.

The big blonde shook her bosom. \"No, the man who bothered me was better-looking than him and he was dressed smarter.\" Frost appeared torn between relief and offence. </p> <p>It was like an off-colour version of Snow White. </p> <p>The fake Frost's activities may have been more serious than we supposed. At the end of the first episode, a girl (last seen leaving Coronation Street with a strange cult ) arrived saying \"From what Mum told me, I think you're my Dad.\" Mum was surely mistaken. Frost, though chummy enough, is like a prisoner in solitary confinement. Something about him, as the title suggests, has been blasted, stunted, scorched by a killing frost. Perhaps it was the bullet in the head. He often unconsciously touches the scar.

The man is 90% batty with flashes of astuteness. Yesterday, when interviewing a prospective ranger, he suddenly said shrewdly, \"I don't believe all this flannel.\" </p> <p>None of us do. Monarch of the Glen is 100% tartan flannel. The Highlands are heart-stoppingly lovely. The castle looks as if it is twirled out of barley sugar.

Could I have a closer look at the scar just to check his references? A great deal of golden production has been poured over this, like syrup on waffle, so it should suit a sweet tooth or a satiric eye. </p> <p>In Arthur C Clarke's garden in Sri Lanka is a flat, black slab, the baby brother of the mysterious monolith in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. A monkey was making repeated efforts to climb it, failing to find a paw-hold on the smooth surface and falling back. Remembering the opening of the film... the monolith... the apes... I found this downright eerie but, then, most people don't have monkeys and monoliths in their garden. </p> <p>In <strong> 2001 - The Making of a Myth</strong> (Channel 4), Clarke, who wrote the original story, was talking about Hal, the psychotic computer. He said \"Everyone who's had a laptop knows perfectly well computers can have a personality. Will a computer become conscious? I think, therefore I am... I think.\" Clarke, like Hal, can sometimes sound a little disturbing. \"All that happens if you're exposed to space is that you feel a freezing sensation.

The extent to which he ground the sausage was, I thought, a little excessive.\" </p> <p>Doug Trumbull helped create that waltzing world and is now one of the world's greatest special effects artists. Sitting beside the sea, he said \"I miss him a lot. It never occured to me that Stanley would die, that I would have to be on this planet without Stanley in 2001.\" </p> <p>You could engrave that poignant human cry on a black monolith to puzzle future space travellers. \"It never occured to me that Stanley would die.\"</p>",

Evans, who died aged 75 in 1988, was the genie of jazz arrangement, whose methods were as elusive as his own wraith-like occupation of a stage. Miles Evans led the group in London last week with an awesome obligation on his quarterback's shoulders. </p> <p>Gil Evans's orchestral projects with Miles Davis (Porgy and Bess, Sketches of Spain, Miles Ahead) are some of the best-known and best-loved pieces of 20th-century music. And if this self-effacing conjuror's recorded output on his own account was sparse, his work from the late 1960s was nevertheless full of sublime balances of the arts of improvisation and arrangement - as well as exhilarating showcases for the thwarted potential of the late Jimi Hendrix as a composer. </p> <p>Several former sidemen from the Evans ensembles of the 1980s were present in the band that played Ronnie Scott's last week - including alto saxophonist Chris Hunter, trumpeter Lew Soloff, and trombonist Dave Bargeron. The UK's Andy Sheppard also added an exuberance reminiscent of his whirlwind emergence 15 years ago. There is, of course, one piece of essential magic they could never recapture, since Evans's influence resided so significantly in the man himself rather than in what he casually scribbled on a score-sheet. </p> <p>But though the orchestra sounded occasionally as if it was echoing the ragged qualities of an old Evans live show by accident rather than by intuitive spontaneity, and the greatest-hits programme replaced much of the open, drifting impressionism that would often roll across the stage like a morning mist at the maestro's gigs, the musicians still exemplified the Evans approach, and the repertoire is one of the most uplifting in contemporary jazz. Reckless, go-for-it solos sometimes sprayed such drama and turbulence over the gathering storms of those rich arrangements and the impassioned drumming by Kenwood Dennard that the crowd burst into wild, in-the-groove shouts as if they were at a holy-rolling church service. </p> <p>Lew Soloff, the witty, diminutive New Yorker with vaudevillians for parents, has been the Evans band's lead trumpet from the late 1960s, and his flame-throwing solos are still among its big attributes. Soloff was a nervous 22 when he first worked for Evans, but found his feet when he realised that Gil \"didn't care whether what was written on the score was interpreted literally or not. He wanted the human-ness in it.\" </p> <p>Evans had the lightest touch of all jazz composers, even including Duke Ellington, and would infuse a band with his whimsically visionary presence while allowing his players - and the audience - to half-believe that the glowing soundscape they had travelled through had simply risen up out of the ground. Like Ellington, Evans had a delicate antenna for the unique musical personalities of his players. The result was that, unlike the parade-ground crackle and shout of the conventionally disciplined big band, Evans's written parts sounded improvised, and the improvisers would often play above themselves in this loose, organic setting. </p> <p>\"A lot of this has to do with Gil's sense of unison,\" Soloff says. \"That was a quality he shared with Ellington. A lot of people naturally hear a pitch a little high or a little low. A lot of more tightly disciplined bands blend that quality out, but Gil wanted to hear it, he wanted that rougher kind of unison of the individual voices together.\" </p> <p>Though the Evans legacy band is inevitably a tighter unit, Soloff pays credit to Miles s sympathetic protection of his father's legacy, and says now that \"to be as undisciplined as Gil would be next to impossible for somebody else\". From the start, last week's show was a well- conceived tableau of the Evans story. A rich, complex reworking of the Porgy and Bess classic Gone Gone Gone appears as Orgone, the original percussive theme interpreted though a fast-moving succession of propulsive riffs mixing old and new. Soloff will subvert the expected by opening a solo on uptempo bebop with an astonishingly prolonged single note instead of the expected hailstorm. Hendrix's yearning Little Wing (an Evans-band staple since the 1970s) has its sublime moments in its heaving harmonies and Mark Egan's bass overture, and its shakier ones in Dennard's soul vocal. But that's an Evans band - not everything works and, most of the time, it doesn't matter. </p> <p>\"Gil would also never tell you how to play,\" Soloff recalls. \"Though he might just have a preference for a particular soloist to go first on a particular piece, generally, he allowed anybody to solo whenever they wanted to, and he wouldn't tell them when to stop either. Sometimes it was great, sometimes it would cause havoc. People might go on too long, or else three people might jump up at once and just battle it out until the last one was left standing. </p> <p>\"But the guitarist Hiram Bullock brilliantly said once in an interview in Downbeat that Gil instilled a certain 'voluntary discipline' in everybody. It wasn't imposed, but the respect of all the musicians for him was so great that, mostly, they'd impose it on themselves. What he allowed to happen was a difficult and dangerous thing, and it didn't always work. But when it did, it was the best band I ever played in in my life.\"</p>",

Soloff will subvert the expected by opening a solo on uptempo bebop with an astonishingly prolonged single note instead of the expected hailstorm. Hendrix's yearning Little Wing (an Evans-band staple since the 1970s) has its sublime moments in its heaving harmonies and Mark Egan's bass overture, and its shakier ones in Dennard's soul vocal. But that's an Evans band - not everything works and, most of the time, it doesn't matter. \"Gil would also never tell you how to play,\" Soloff recalls. \"Though he might just have a preference for a particular soloist to go first on a particular piece, generally, he allowed anybody to solo whenever they wanted to, and he wouldn't tell them when to stop either. Sometimes it was great, sometimes it would cause havoc. People might go on too long, or else three people might jump up at once and just battle it out until the last one was left standing. \"But the guitarist Hiram Bullock brilliantly said once in an interview in Downbeat that Gil instilled a certain 'voluntary discipline' in everybody. It wasn't imposed, but the respect of all the musicians for him was so great that, mostly, they'd impose it on themselves. What he allowed to happen was a difficult and dangerous thing, and it didn't always work. But when it did, it was the best band I ever played in in my life.\"",

      "body": "<p>Why should artists have the last word about their work? What the spectator sees in a painting, and what they say about it, can be just as engaging. Some-times more so. </p> <p>\"Often when people come into a museum they feel restricted rather than encouraged,\" says the American painter Ken Aptekar. \"I am trying to show that I recognise that and want to change it.\" What Aptekar has done, in a project called Q&amp;A, is take works of art from the Victoria and Albert Museum's European collection - \"I chose everything from the most anonymous, dusty crap languishing in the vaults to the great masterpieces\" - and show them to a series of focus groups. The responses were videotaped and transcribed, with the most interesting quotations sandblasted on to sheets of glass. Then he painted copies of details from the pictures discussed and attached the glass sheets to them. The result - to be shown at the V&amp;A - is a series of artworks that amounts to a collaboration between Aptekar, the focus group, and perhaps even the original artists themselves, in which the spectators get to talk back to the paintings. </p> <p>\"I had all sorts of preconceptions about the English, and Londoners in particular, and that was reflected in my choice of focus groups. I really wanted to get a group of London cabbies to spend a couple of hours in the gallery, giving me their responses. But we just couldn't get them to take the time off work. And I was really keen to get a group of gardeners to spend an afternoon with me looking at landscape paintings. In the end, we put together a focus group of gardeners with learning disabilities, which was fascinating and exasperating. One guy took about 12 minutes to give me his response to a painting, with 10 to 15 seconds between each word. But I really respected the importance he attached to getting his response over to me.\" </p> <p>Other focus groups included redheads (\"I'm a redhead myself, so I really wanted their responses\"), Afro-Caribbean women (\"I wanted people outside the European art tradition and museum culture\"), art students (\"And those who often aren't\"), and middle-aged Spanish immigrants (\"I wanted people whose first language wasn't English. And what I found was that, although their spoken English may not have been grammatically perfect, it was immensely expressive and more engaging as a result\"). \"Generally, I wanted to reflect the diversity of Londoners.\" </p> <p>But the unexpected responses, which themselves subvert some of Aptekar's pat notions about London and Londoners, give the exhibition its vitality. One woman was shown a picture of a supposedly haunted house, and told Aptekar she had a ghost in her own home. Each night for 10 years she lit a candle to placate it. She told Aptekar that one morning the ghost came up behind her and said it didn't like tea, to which the woman replied: \"It's my house now.\" Aptekar used this story, sandblasted the quotations and superimposed them, not on the picture of the house, but over a still-life canvas of a tea service, illuminated by several candles. </p> <p>Aptekar's exhibition consists of four galleries, each with a purportedly British theme. Thus, one is called A Landscape Short on Land and consists of paintings of landscapes in which sea and sky dominate. Another is called Man's Best Friend (dog paintings); another, Who's Who, consists of portraits and figures. The final gallery is called The Thing About Tea and includes genre scenes and still lives of tea services. </p> <p>Aptekar produced a similar exhibition called Talking to Pictures at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC a couple of years ago, which drew the attention of the Harvard professor of art history, Norman Bryson. He put Aptekar's work in the context of the death-of-the-author thesis extolled by the likes of Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault. Bryson said there had been a shift from the production of art to its reception, from the death of the author to the birth of the reader/viewer. Or, at least, we thought there had been. </p> <p>\"We say that such a shift took place,\" wrote Bryson in his analysis of the exhibition for the magazine Art in America, \"but doing so may prevent us from seeing how little of the radical potential of the death-of-the-author idea has, in fact, been historically realised. If the turn from makers to receivers had truly been allowed to develop, surely by now we would have had a generation of studies analysing how viewers actually go about their business.\" </p> <p>But because these investigations have not happened and because the artist's mystique remains intact, Aptekar's exhibitions at the Corcoran and now the V&amp;A are explosive affairs. They roll a grenade into museums, in which, too often, only responses acknowledged as appropriate by the institution are regarded as worthwhile. </p> <p>There has always been another story of art - the spectators' personal, sometimes perverse, responses. Aptekar's projects call on spectators to respond to works of art idiosyncratically, rather than encouraging them to check in their subjective perspectives and tastes before entering the gallery. In so doing, Aptekar hopes to change the balance of power between artist and spectator. </p> <p>But why should Aptekar have the last word on that? What his V&amp;A exhibition cries out for is for visitors to talk back to his paintings, to have their own idiosyncratic responses to his artistic project. And then to mount an exhibition of their own, which would be talked back to by other visitors, and then another . . . It could go on for ever.</p>",

This means new medical records, national insurance number and bank accounts so that there is a minimal chance of some one stumbling by chance on the person's true identity. If they want, the person with a new identity will be given a \"panic button\" that alerts the local police and a mobile phone programmed to bring help with one touch. The police also provide advice on constructing a past that is easy to memorise, and will offer a minder attached to the nearest police station.

There are such people with new identities currently in Australia, the US and Canada.</p> <p>Hundreds of new identities have been granted since 1978 when records of them first started to be kept. Only a few of those given new names and homes have since been spotted and police say that where they have, it has almost always been because the person concerned has not followed their advice and has been unable to resist a journey back to old haunts. This will be less of a temptation for Venables and Thompson, who were only 11 when they were sent away to secure units elsewhere. A survey on relocated witnesses carried out last year by the University of Strathclyde showed that homesickness was one of the key problems faced by those with new identities who were moved out of Scotland.</p> <p>\"One of the problems after a while is remembering which parts of your past you can talk about,\" said 'Peter'. \"When you meet someone new and you like them you want to be able to tell them about yourself but you can't.\"</p> <p>A parallel with the Venables and Thompson case is the case of two teenage New Zealand girls, Juliet Hulme and Pauline Parker, who were convicted in 1954 of killing Pauline's mother in Christchurch. Pauline, then 16, had been suicidal at the prospect of parting from her 15-year-old friend, Juliet, who was due to go back to England. Pauline's parents refused to let her join her friend. Released after five and a half years, both eventually made their way to Britain and might have lived their lives in quiet anonymity had it not been for Heavenly Creatures, the 1994 film that told their story. It transpired that Juliet Hulme had become the successful historical mystery writer Anne Perry, living in a village near Inverness. Three years later, Pauline Parker, now known as Hilary Nathan, had her anonymity exposed in a village in Kent. She had been working as a teacher of children with special needs.</p> <p>Both women had been able to support themselves and make new friends without arousing suspicion and, had it not been for the film, they might never have been traced. Unlike Thompson and Venables, the women were not protected from media intrusion by a court injunction.</p> <p>Until the Human Rights Act came into force last October, the courts had no power to grant such an injunction to protect an adult. The injunction which protected that other notorious child killer, Mary Bell, was in fact granted to protect her daughter, who was made a ward of court.</p> <p>Bell was convicted of killing two little boys in 1968 when she was 12 and was released in 1980. With the assistance of the probation service she constructed a new identity. When she had a daughter in 1984, Northumbria county council successfully sought a high court injunc tion that protected the child from being identified. But someone leaked news of the birth and Bell's new identity to the News of the World, although it was not until many years later that she was finally exposed in the press. This followed the publication of Gitta Sereny's book, Cries Unheard, in 1998, when the news that Bell had received some of the advance payment prompted a hunt to find her. She was tracked down to a seaside town in the south of England and had to tell her teenage daughter for the first time of her past.</p> <p>Bell's error may have been to assist in the writing of a book which was bound to raise fresh interest in her case.

Bank robber Maurice O'Mahoney, who parlayed his way out of a long sentence by turning informer in 1974, was granted a new identity but later rang the Guardian to complain that the easy life had come to an end. \"They've told me to go out and get a job. The only trade I know is how to rob banks. I'm in a terrible state. I could go round the corner and cry.\"</p> <p>In fact, O'Mahoney, who took on a new identity as Peter Davies, did find himself work and was a security man on such high-profile events as David Bowie and Rick Wakeman tours.

      "bodyText": "The family of the ousted Yugoslav president and indicted war criminal, Slobodan Milosevic, apparently staged a family reunion in Moscow over the weekend. While Mr Milosevic is wary of travelling out of Yugoslavia since foreign authorities would be obliged to arrest him under United Nations rules, his wife, son, and brother were believed to have enjoyed an Orthodox New Year family get-together in Moscow. Mr Milosevic's infamous wife, Mirjana Markovic, dubbed the Lady Macbeth of the Balkans, left Belgrade on Friday on an Aeroflot flight, Belgrade airport officials told the Beta news agency. The day before, Borislav Milosevic, the former president's elder brother and recently fired Yugoslav ambassador to Russia, hosted a lavish farewell party at the Yugoslav embassy in Moscow attended by the Russian elite. The reception turned into a west-bashing event, indicating the lingering fondness for the Milosevic regime among senior figures in Russia. Mrs Markovic was believed to have travelled to Moscow to see her son, Marko, an underworld leader who fled his homeland in the wake of his father's overthrow last October. Regarded as an indispensable adviser to her husband throughout his 13-year rule in Serbia, she was expected to be back in Belgrade this morning for a meeting of the executive of her hardline United Left party which failed to win a single seat in the new democratic Serbian parliament. She remains a member of the Yugoslav federal parliament. Her trip triggered conflicting responses in Belgrade. Zoran Dzindzic, expected to be the new Serbian prime minister, accused her of breaking the law by evading officials at Belgrade airport. But the Yugoslav interior minister, Zoran Zivkovic, said she was a free agent who could go where she liked. By contrast, her husband's movements are severely circumscribed, though he may take comfort from weekend assurances from his nemesis, President Vojislav Kostunica, that he will not be turned over to the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague - which has indicted Mr Milosevic for war crimes in Kosovo and is investigating him for crimes committed in Bosnia. Mr Kostunica met Mr Milosevic at the weekend in what was believed to be the first such encounter since October and then made a robust statement in defiance of the Hague tribunal - ahead of the expected arrival in Belgrade next week of Carla Del Ponte, the tribunal's forceful chief prosecutor. Mr Kostunica's assurances would appear to rule out Mr Milosevic's extradition to the Hague, an issue that is dividing the new Serbian and Yugoslav leaderships. But the Yugoslav justice minister, Momcilo Grubac, countered that Mr Milosevic could be sent to the Hague since the tribunal was a UN institution and not a court of a foreign country.",

      "body": "<p>The Rainbow Theatre in north London can hold several thousand people, but only about 100 are gathered on this chilly Friday morning. Once it was one of Britain's top rock venues, resounding to the screams of teenage fans of the Beatles, David Bowie and the Osmonds. Now it belongs to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, a global evangelical church which originated in Brazil in the 1970s; and assistant bishop Wellington Marcelo is pacing the stage bellowing gospel tunes, leading a \"deliverance service\" which offers protection from \"voodoo, black magic and witchcraft\".</p> <p>Marcelo's pastors, cleancut young Brazilian men in neatly ironed shirts, march up and down the aisles like cheerleaders, singing along loudly. The congregation is ordered to form a circle before the stage, and we all hold hands. The preacher is in the middle.</p> <p>\"Are there any evil spirits tormenting you? Stopping you sleeping?\" he cries. A young woman who is making the loudest noise is brought to the middle of the circle. The preacher is shouting now, asking Jesus to \"send his fire - burn the evil spirits!\"</p> <p>\"Burn! Burn! Burn!\" the worshippers shout in response, stamping their feet. Marcelo takes hold of the young woman, clasping her neck in what looks like a wrestling grip, and tells everyone a devil is inside her.</p> <p>Marcelo shouts at the devil to leave her and she gets more hysterical, hitting him with her fists and making a growling sound. He calms her down and gives her a cup of water that he has blessed in the names of the Holy Trinity. She says that she is from the Congo, a mother of three and a care worker. In front of the now hushed congregation, she reveals that she attempted suicide that morning.</p> <p>Marcelo asks her what her problem is. \"Marriage problems,\" she says. \"No,\" he says, \"spiritual problems.\"</p> <p>The care worker again says that she is going through problems with her husband. He disagrees. Like an impatient teacher with a slow child, he gets her to repeat that she has \"spiritual problems\", before letting her go back to her place in the circle.</p> <p>The Universal Church has already got into trouble over its claim that evil spirits are the cause of people's woes. In 1997, the Advertising Standards Authority banned a church poster that said: \"Constant headaches, depression, insomnia, fears, bad luck, strange diseases . . . These are just a few symptoms caused by demons.\"</p> <p>But now the deliverance service has dragged the church into its darkest controversy yet. It was to one of these services that eight-year-old Anna Climbie, the little girl who died of hypothermia after being tied up in a bathtub in one of Britain's worst ever cases of child abuse, was to have been taken by her adoptive mother, Marie Kouao.</p> <p>Kouao, who - along with her boyfriend, Carl Manning - was last Friday convicted of Anna's murder, had taken her to various churches, believing that the girl was possessed by demons. Throughout her trial at the Old Bailey, Kouao held on to a Bible.</p> <p>Giving evidence, Alvero Lima, a 21-year-old assistant pastor of the Universal Church at Finsbury Park, told the jury about a conversation he had had with the girl in the week before her death. \"[Anna] said she had a vision at night when the devil, in the form of a snake, told her to do these things [injure herself] and she was unable to stop. She said Satan made her do it. She said she hated me because I prayed for people. I told the mother I thought it was a spiritual problem. The Bible says there are evil spirits that leave people's bodies through fasting. I told her I and others would pray and fast all week.\"</p> <p>Lima told Kouao that the congregation's efforts would culminate in exorcism of the devil from Anna at a deliverance service. The day before the scheduled service, Kouao brought Anna, who was then very cold and barely conscious, in for exorcism. A shocked Lima, to his credit, urged Kouao to take the child to hospital immediately. She died two days later, on February 25.</p> <p>Kouao's barrister Michael Gledhill asked Lima: \"What you were doing was playing with fire, wasn't it?\" \"No,\" he replied. Asked if he felt \"at all responsible for this child's death,\" Lima again answered: \"No.\"</p> <p>The court case has turned the spotlight on the church's beliefs, and on the swath of society towards which its ministry is directed.</p> <p>At the deliverance service I attend, almost everyone is from an African or Afro-Caribbean background. Judging by their dress, the people do not seem wealthy. Another clue to the economic realities of these people's lives appears in the church's free newspaper, City News, where an advert declares: \"If money is your problem, come to the richest person in the world - God.\"</p> <p>The church seems to be a one-stop shop for every social ill: on Monday there is a service for financial and immigration problems (\"bring your CV, passport etc\"); Tuesday's speciality is health and Thursday's is family problems. On Saturday there is a prayer for prosperity - \"bring your Bible and learn how to be prosperous\".</p> <p>All this is brought into sharp focus at the end of the service when the preacher turns to the subject of fundraising. Drug dealers have plenty of money, Marcelo says. New nightclubs are built every day. But there is never enough money for God's work. \"We need offerings to build more churches,\" he says. \"Is there anyone here who will give \u00a350 or more?\"</p> <p>A woman goes to the front and writes out a cheque. An extraordinary Dutch auction commences as the assistant bishop asks: \"Is there anyone who will give \u00a330 or more? \u00a320? Anyone who will take an envelope and come back next week?\"</p> <p>He gives Bibles in exchange for the big donations. Then he asks for anything people have - even as little as 50p. No one seems to find this strange.</p> <p>This fundraising has proved hugely successful. The Universal Church, which claims to have 4,500 members regularly attending its services in London and the west midlands, raised \u00a32m from donations at services in 1999, the last year for which figures are available.</p> <p>On its website, the church discloses that it committed \u00a3569,000 to \"direct charitable expenditure\" in the financial year 1998-1999, and describes some of the work it carried out: an outreach service supplying shoes, blankets and Bibles to prisoners, and a lending library of taped services for the housebound elderly. Some \u00a3330,000 was spent on \"fundraising and publicity\", while management and administration costs were \u00a3246,000. At the time the records were filed, the church had a bank balance of \u00a33.3m, including income saved from previous years.</p> <p>Church spokeswoman Christoulla Boodram says the main objective of the church, as a charity, is to advance the Christian faith. \"This is done by means of spreading the gospel through opening churches, literature, evangelism, radio programmes etc. The donations raised during church services are spent to pursue these objectives.\"</p> <p>Last August, further evidence of the church's wealth and ambition emerged when a company part-owned by its Portuguese branch bought Liberty Radio, a London-based speech and music station, from Mohamed Al Fayed, the Harrods owner.</p> <p>Observers of the church say that it seeks media investments both for commercial reasons and to obtain a platform. In Brazil, where it was founded by a former lottery shop assistant, Edir Macedo, in 1977, the Universal Church is far more than a spiritual organisation; it is a powerful political, financial and media force. It owns one of the main terrestrial television channels, about 20 other TV stations, 50 radio stations, a football team renamed Universal and a newspaper with a weekly circulation of 1.3m.</p> <p>It is estimated to have an annual turnover of \u00a3700m - which would put it in the top 100 Brazilian companies - and is the country's fastest-growing religion, with an estimated 8,000 churches and eight million followers. The church also has 18 elected deputies affiliated to it in the Brazilian congress, giving it a political clout that outweighs its size. In the early 1990s Brazil's attorney general ordered an investigation, which is still in progress, into Macedo and the church over allegations of charlatanism.</p> <p>The vast majority of Macedo's followers in Brazil are from the poorest communities. They, like the members of other churches in a country where there is no national health service, are attracted by the promise that true believers will be able to find the cure for any disease. Followers are expected to donate 10% of their earnings. Many priests who have left the fold have accused the church of only being interested in making money.</p> <p>Boodram says: \"In Brazil, the church is a very large organisation and recognised by its active role in helping the poorest and destitute in society. It seeks to play the same role in Britain.\"</p> <p>But the death of Anna Climbie has exposed the church's practices to unwelcome publicity that could hamper its ambitions in Britain.</p> <p>\"We were very shocked and saddened by the suffering and subsequent death of little Anna,\" said Boodram. \"This must be a terrible time for Anna's family and our thoughts and prayers go out to them, especially her parents in Ivory Coast.\"</p> <p>She insisted that \"the value of prayer in positively affecting a person's health has already been acknowledged by several medical studies\", and added: \"It is the practice in our church to always advise people to keep to their medical treatment and follow doctor's instructions.\"</p> <p>She also says that, as well as offering up prayers for prosperity, it refers seriously indebted people to debt advisory services. But this defence is somewhat undercut by the preacher's insistence, at the service I attended, that the troubled young woman's problems were spiritual. It is also undermined by its free newspaper, the pages of which are filled with stories of prayer curing afflictions deemed incurable by conventional medicine.</p> <p>For now, the Universal Church and its pastors will have to tread carefully with everyone they advise. After Anna's death, the accusation that they are \"playing with fire\" could yet come back to haunt them.</p>",

Yet the Indonesian occupying army, which killed an estimated 200,000 people in its 24 years there, has gone, driven out by the UN cavalry over a year ago.</p> <p>The tragedy for the women of East Timor is that those killed in the machete attacks were murdered by their own husbands or brothers. In a country with a population estimated at around 720,000 - roughly the same as that of Leeds - it is a shocking statistic.</p> <p>After years of a cruel and brutal conflict, the violence learned by the revolutionaries has now been turned on their women. Domestic violence has soared in the past year, according to Milena Pires, 34, a Timorese political lobbyist funded by the Catholic Institute for International Relations. Last year, 169 cases were documented and domestic violence is now the country's prevalent crime, making up 40% of all offences.</p> <p>\"It may simply be that women are speaking out about it for the first time - but it is probably the single most important issue facing Timorese women today,\" Pires says. \"In the summer we had our first women's conference and it was the thing that came up again and again.\"</p> <p>The problem lies in the tensions that have arisen following East Timor's return to an independent state. In the autumn of 1999, violence erupted throughout the territory following a victory for the independence movement in a UN-organised referendum. Supporters of the Indonesian regime ran amok and hundreds were killed or forced into camps across the border in west Timor. By the time the Indonesian army had left, almost everything had been destroyed.</p> <p>After the immediate violence abated, deeper, more lasting tensions were revealed as the men of East Timor's rebel army, the Falantil, returned to the homes they hadn't seen since 1975. When Indonesia invaded, they left their families behind in the towns and on the farms, and headed for the mountains and jungles. Five hours' drive from the capital Dili, in the Ulimori valley, the battle for an independent East Timor was fought by men surviving on a diet of deer, buffalo, monkey and fruit. On a visit there in the last days of the Indonesian occupation, servile silent women served me a dinner of what looked like grey cannelloni - buffalo intestines with tomatoes. The year before they had been roasting dog at a camp built entirely of bamboo. Codes of behaviour were strict - no sex for revolutionaries and the only women present were cooks.</p> <p>Among the men who joined the fight was Adtik Lintil, who admits he barely saw his wife and children in the 17 years he was with the Falantil. \"I don't have any regrets,\" he says. \"We had to fight for what was right.\"</p> <p>Now, after 24 years of Indonesian occupation, men like Lintil are returning home, to a world that has moved on. While the men were in hiding in the mountains, Timorese women were either furthering their education in exile or holding the fort at home, just as British women had done during two world wars. \"Women were involved at every level,\" says Pires, whose own family went into exile when she was nine years old and who subsequently studied sociology and English literature in Australia. \"They helped run the camps, sent supplies, smuggled information. And now, as the men come out of hiding, they don't want to return to their traditional roles.\"</p> <p>Inevitably there are problems. Last month, five women wearing short-sleeved T-shirts were stoned in the central market of Dili for dressing inappropriately and talking on mobile phones. And only last week, violence broke out on a family beach when a gang of young men attacked two women dressed in bikini tops and sarongs.</p> <p>\"It is a very traditional Catholic society which has been frozen by the years of war,\" Pires says. \"The men are trying to reassert their authority.\"</p> <p>In the past year, over a dozen organisations have been set up in East Timor to tackle this growing violence towards women. \"It is a time when we have to be very, very sensitive,\" Pires says.</p> <p>Last week, she was in London seeking support for pro-women measures she hopes to see put in place when the UN hands over to the new East Timorese government next year. Her aim is to help create a society in which 30% of parliamentarians and 30% of public servants are women. The carrot Britain has is money. Pressure from other donor countries, such as Japan, Portugal and Australia, to introduce women-friendly policies has worked thus far and women's groups in East Timor have already succeeded in securing a deal in which local councils are made up of 50% men and 50% women.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the cost of the UN's current babysitting of East Timor is estimated to be over $700m, yet there is very little rebuilding going on, no new industry and the country is proving a tough place to run. There may be hundreds of white UN four-wheel drive vehicles on the roads, but only three fishing boats were left in a city that depended on fishing for its survival. The independent East Timor was left with no electricity, no schools, no universities - even the saw mill machinery had been ripped out and taken back to Indonesia. The only jobs are with the UN - at a daily rate of $5 for locals, New York salaries for its own staff. The only thing being built is a floating hotel in the harbour, commissioned and partially funded by the UN, where its visiting staff can stay at a cost of $160 a night.</p> <p>The result is 80% unemployment. Men are humiliated at being without jobs in a country in which white foreigners seem to have everything going for them, and their disillusionment has resulted in the rise in domestic violence.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of anger now,\" Pires says, \"as people see that what they were fighting for hasn't happened. Now they just want the UN to go.\" Even Mary Robinson, the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, criticised the international community in East Timor during a recent visit to the territory. \"There is not that empathy of really understanding how much the people of East Timor suffered,\" she said.</p> <p>During the Indonesian occupation, women were separated from their husbands and sons, harassed and often raped. In the refugee camps, populated mainly by women and children, living conditions are terrible, with food shortages, poor sanitation and rampant disease.</p> <p>Now there is a determination that in the new society being built in East Timor, women will suffer less. Last September, for the first time in East Timor's history, a woman went to court to accuse her husband of violence against her. It's a start.</p>",

Judge John Deed was great fun, and I hope they make a series out of him. It will do wonders for the image of the judiciary.",

      "bodyText": "The Filofax, the personal organiser that became a must-have accessory for a generation of yuppies, is up for sale again - for less than half the amount it fetched three years ago. Two unnamed bidders, one British and the other American, are said to be competing to buy the firm for around \u00a320m. Day Runner, the US firm that paid \u00a351m for Filofax three years ago, has run into financial difficulties as a flood of handheld electronic organisers have hit the market. Christopher Brace, Filofax's managing director, was reported this weekend as saying: \"It is no secret that Day Runner is in serious financial difficulties and making strategic asset sales. Filofax is one of them.\" Day Runner's trading is said to have been hit by supermarkets cutting the number of organisers they stock. In contrast, handheld computer manufacturers like Psion and Palm have reported strong sales. Mr Brace insists that Filofax's finances remain in good health, despite the new competition. Graduates in their mid-20s, people with busy diaries and those who don't like entrusting their data to an electronic device are said to be among the most loyal customers. The Filofax was invented during world war one by a British army colonel and became popular with the military and members of the clergy. Sales peaked in the 1980s and early 90s when it became a status symbol among the young affluent. Today gadgets like Psion and Palm organisers are increasingly attracting that market but even their products cannot be guaranteed longevity. Technological advances will soon allow people to watch video through mobile devices and it is not yet clear whether it will be the handheld computer firms or mobile phone companies who will emerge victorious in that battle.",

By a professional dedication to the techniques of animation and her excellent design sense, she progressed to being not only the first woman auteur cartoon film-maker in Britain but also the best.</p> <p>She was born in Peshawar, where her father was a company sergeant major in the Royal Tank Corps. The family returned to England when Alison was three and she spent her childhood moving from one army camp to another. She studied art in Brighton before completing her education at the Royal Academy in London.</p> <p>Her first regular job was with the Halas and Batchelor Studio in 1951, where she worked as a background designer on public relations films for industry. In 1957 she moved to Guild Television Services as head of its animation unit, to direct and design TV commercials. In 1960 she made her first attempt at a personal film, Two Faces, which was constructed around some of her poetry.</p> <p>During the 1960s she freelanced as designer and director for various studios until she joined TVC in 1967 to work (with almost everyone else in the London animation world) on the Beatles' film Yellow Submarine. As design director, she made a spectacular success of transferring Heinz Edelmann's psychedelia to working cartoon backgrounds - and made a cameo appearance as one of the photographed figures in the Eleanor Rigby sequence.</p> <p>Between 1970 and 1980, while she was an associate of the Wyatt Cattaneo commercials studio, she began her most productive period. It is greatly to Ron Wyatt and Tony Cattaneo's credit that they gave her the scope and encouragement to make her own personal films. The commercial return on a short cartoon was virtually nil during this period and has hardly improved since. Caf\u00e9 Bar (5 minutes), which Alison made in 1975, avoided the obscurity and artiness often associated with personal animation. It encapsulates splendidly the confrontation between \"this man\" and \"this woman\", while using true cartoon gags and symbols to examine relations between the sexes.</p> <p>This film began her career of collecting prizes at every international festival at which her work was seen. Mr Pascal (7 minutes) followed in 1979, and won her the Grand Prix at the Annecy Festival, making her, so to speak, world champion. The film shows a lonely widowed shoemaker taking pity on an effigy of the crucified Christ who then comes to life. Although de Vere was without conventional religious belief, the character she gives to Christ is probably the most sympathetic in any film.</p> <p>She became less attached to the Wyatt Cattaneo Studio in the 1980s, but knowledge of her films encouraged the commissioning editors for animation at the new Channel 4 to give her the opportunity to expand her range. During the 80s, Alison began to spend more and more time in Cornwall, where she established a studio.</p> <p>Her love of the bleak landscape around St Just had a profound influence on her work. The Black Dog (19 minutes), which must be considered her masterpiece, was the next commission from Channel 4 and was executed largely in Cornwall. She worked on this film, completed in 1987, while caring for her progressively senile mother. To understand the size of her achievement in creating a film of this length with only a few occasional assistants, working at a distance from the camera laboratories and recording studios required, one must bear in mind that a normal production studio would need at least a dozen skilled artists to create an equal result. It has been said that The Black Dog represents the same sort of advance in animation that The Marriage of Figaro was in opera.</p> <p>It is a fully entertaining cartoon film, beautifully designed and animated, but covering in its events and characters themes of self-discovery and experience of the deepest kind. There is, towards the end of the film, an image of the relationship between parent and child that is unbelievably moving. The film collected armfuls of awards internationally.</p> <p>Psyche and Eros (26 minutes), also commissioned by Channel Four, followed in 1994. Again, it is a beautiful film with even more sophisticated design and animation, even if it does not carry the same personal charge as Caf\u00e9 Bar and The Black Dog.</p> <p>Alison de Vere's achievement in these films is to have created work that was always written in the accepted form of the cartoon film, while presenting images and emotions of the highest art. When pursuing their personal visions, many animators become self-indulgent and are guilty of wilful obscurity. Alison was always professional and consequently a greater artist.</p> <p>In person, her modest and unobtrusive manner would lead you to underestimate her power. Small and slight, with a bush of frizzy hair, when she wore her tinted spectacles she could have passed for a female version of Mole from The Wind in the Willows.

Each chapter would take several months to conceive and, when she finally put pen to paper, what she produced was exactly what she intended. It was as though she cooked it inside her head so as to present a perfect meal. There was no question of rewriting or editing.</p> <p>She was an intensely social person. Talk - about people, books, the ways of academe - meant almost everything to her. When she seemed to have no physical strength left to draw upon, she could be transformed by a long gossip or an impromptu seminar.

Each chapter would take several months to conceive and, when she finally put pen to paper, what she produced was exactly what she intended. It was as though she cooked it inside her head so as to present a perfect meal. There was no question of rewriting or editing. She was an intensely social person. Talk - about people, books, the ways of academe - meant almost everything to her.

      "body": "<p>Alfred Schnittke's music is defined by diversity. His symphonies lurch from modernist violence to quotations from Beethoven; his concertos contain everything from baroque pastiche to jazz solos; and his chamber music is brutal then beguiling. This BBC weekend was the first major retrospective of Schnittke's work since his death in 1998; it included appearances from his closest friends, including violinist Gidon Kremer, cellist Alexander Ivashkin, and the composer's widow, the pianist Irina Schnittke. </p> <p>There was no more telling contrast in the first two days of concerts than that between the riotous First Symphony, composed in 1969-72, and the Concerto for Mixed Choir, written in 1985. The symphony was played in the Barbican by Martyn Brabbins and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, while the BBC Singers and Stephen Cleobury performed the concerto in the haunting intimacy of St Giles, Cripplegate. </p> <p>Schnittke's First Symphony is one of the great showpieces of the recent orchestral repertoire, and the BBCSO's performance was a major event. The 70-minute symphony began with every musician playing as they walked on stage, creating a ferocious dissonance. It goes on to parody genres of music from military marches to waltzes, and the niceties of concert-hall convention. </p> <p>After one outburst, a violin and piano duo started a separate performance in front of the first violins - disregarded by the orchestra, which continued to play. Violinist Daniel Hope and pianist Simon Mulligan gave a hyperactive recital, mercilessly satirising the virtuoso tradition. At the end of the symphony, the players continued performing on the journey backstage, only to reappear exactly as they did at the start of the symphony, before Brabbins finally called a halt to proceedings. </p> <p>Next to this extraordinary collage, the serene concentration and austere atmosphere of the Concerto for Mixed Choir, settings of sacred verses by the 9th-century Armenian Grigori Narekatsi, could have been the work of another composer. Yet there is a profound connection between the archaic style of the concerto and the \"polystylism\", as Schnittke described it, of the symphony. </p> <p>Although the First Symphony is often hilarious, there is a tragic tension in the piece between its hidden architecture and the fragments of music Schnittke pastes over it. The funny stuff on the surface has a deadly serious meaning; it's the modernist structure underneath that Schnittke is really parodying. So the timeless qualities of diatonic melody and plainchant in the choir concerto (and in other of Schnittke's works of the 1980s performed over the weekend, such as the Fourth Symphony) are one way of bypassing the dilemma of the symphony. Yet the ultimate irony is that these languages are no less borrowed than any passage of the First Symphony. </p> <p>At the end of his life, Schnittke found a musical language that escaped the conflicts of his previous music. The London Sinfonietta gave the world premiere of Fragment, part of a piece they had commissioned from Schnittke in 1994, but which he never finished. There is an amazing conviction and clarity about the work's three existing movements. Even more striking was the British premiere of the radiant Eighth Symphony, given by the BBCSO under conductor Eri Klas. There, the earlier tussle between styles and structures is replaced by a music that is more unified but also more terrifying: a stillness and calm that seems to reflect Schnittke's gaze upon death. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Alfred Schnittke's music is defined by diversity. His symphonies lurch from modernist violence to quotations from Beethoven; his concertos contain everything from baroque pastiche to jazz solos; and his chamber music is brutal then beguiling. This BBC weekend was the first major retrospective of Schnittke's work since his death in 1998; it included appearances from his closest friends, including violinist Gidon Kremer, cellist Alexander Ivashkin, and the composer's widow, the pianist Irina Schnittke. There was no more telling contrast in the first two days of concerts than that between the riotous First Symphony, composed in 1969-72, and the Concerto for Mixed Choir, written in 1985. The symphony was played in the Barbican by Martyn Brabbins and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, while the BBC Singers and Stephen Cleobury performed the concerto in the haunting intimacy of St Giles, Cripplegate. Schnittke's First Symphony is one of the great showpieces of the recent orchestral repertoire, and the BBCSO's performance was a major event. The 70-minute symphony began with every musician playing as they walked on stage, creating a ferocious dissonance. It goes on to parody genres of music from military marches to waltzes, and the niceties of concert-hall convention. After one outburst, a violin and piano duo started a separate performance in front of the first violins - disregarded by the orchestra, which continued to play. Violinist Daniel Hope and pianist Simon Mulligan gave a hyperactive recital, mercilessly satirising the virtuoso tradition. At the end of the symphony, the players continued performing on the journey backstage, only to reappear exactly as they did at the start of the symphony, before Brabbins finally called a halt to proceedings. Next to this extraordinary collage, the serene concentration and austere atmosphere of the Concerto for Mixed Choir, settings of sacred verses by the 9th-century Armenian Grigori Narekatsi, could have been the work of another composer. Yet there is a profound connection between the archaic style of the concerto and the \"polystylism\", as Schnittke described it, of the symphony. Although the First Symphony is often hilarious, there is a tragic tension in the piece between its hidden architecture and the fragments of music Schnittke pastes over it. The funny stuff on the surface has a deadly serious meaning; it's the modernist structure underneath that Schnittke is really parodying. So the timeless qualities of diatonic melody and plainchant in the choir concerto (and in other of Schnittke's works of the 1980s performed over the weekend, such as the Fourth Symphony) are one way of bypassing the dilemma of the symphony. Yet the ultimate irony is that these languages are no less borrowed than any passage of the First Symphony. At the end of his life, Schnittke found a musical language that escaped the conflicts of his previous music. The London Sinfonietta gave the world premiere of Fragment, part of a piece they had commissioned from Schnittke in 1994, but which he never finished. There is an amazing conviction and clarity about the work's three existing movements. Even more striking was the British premiere of the radiant Eighth Symphony, given by the BBCSO under conductor Eri Klas. There, the earlier tussle between styles and structures is replaced by a music that is more unified but also more terrifying: a stillness and calm that seems to reflect Schnittke's gaze upon death.",

      "body": "<p>'I want to be put through to the head of IT. What's his name?\" \"Oh, I'm sorry, Sir, I'm not allowed to disclose that information.\" \"Look love, I'm not getting off this line until you do . . .\" </p> <p>Sound familiar? If not, it may only be a matter of time. Headhunters are hot on the trail, stealing staff from companies - and using front-line staff such as receptionists and secretaries to get the information they need. What's more, their tactics are becoming increasingly cunning and aggressive, causing growing numbers of secretaries to quit their jobs as a result of the strain. Quite simply, headhunters use any means necessary to build up a database of names, job details and direct telephone lines, so they can then approach the relevant people as and when an employer becomes interested. It is estimated that secretaries at some multinational firms receive up to 50 such calls a day. </p> <p>A particularly hostile story is currently doing the rounds, detailing an imposter faking an imminent conference. \"I need a faxed list of the sales team right now,\" he demands of the innocent at the other end of the line. </p> <p>\"I'm really sorry, but I don't think I'm allowed to do that,\" she says, following the company line. </p> <p>\"Well, I'm allowing you. I work for this company, too, and am a damn sight higher up than you, so if you don't do it, I can assure you you'll be out of a job.\" </p> <p>\"Oh yes, OK, I'll get on to it immediately,\" seems the only possible answer to the threat. The list is delivered straight into the hot little hands of the headhunter. </p> <p>So why the sudden explosion of this behaviour? The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development puts it down to the unprecedented growth of the recruitment industry. </p> <p>\"Around the world, the shortage of skilled people in many sectors of industry means that headhunting is increasing at a dramatic rate, with 20,000 companies alone in the UK,\" explains a spokesperson. \"There is huge competition between them to get details of the best people.\" </p> <p>Paul Sampson, an ex-headhunter adds, \"A lot of young people working in recruitment realise that if they set up their own headhunting company, they could make a lot more money. Not surprisingly, they're hungry to get a database started and so they'll be as aggressive as need be to get it.\" </p> <p>Sampson believes it's no coincidence that we are witnessing a high turnover of secretarial staff. \"Understandably, they can't hack these calls,\" he says. \"They leave the office feeling used, abused, guilty and exhausted. No wonder they get to the point where they think, 'Is this worth it?' Meanwhile, the employers suffer by losing their staff. It's bad news all round.\" </p> <p>So severe are the repercussions, he says, that this month he has launched Anti-Headhunting UK, a service with a training package specifically aimed at front-line staff. \"We've been successfully running an anti-headhunting service on the continent for two years, but since staff data is at greater risk in the UK than almost any other European market, we've decided to expand here.\" </p> <p>Shock tactics are not spared. \"The seminar starts by us making live phone calls in front of the secretaries to prove the problem exists,\" he explains. Perhaps he'll phone a receptionist and say, \"Hi, it's Phil from IT. We've had a breakdown of a system and need to be reminded of your password to Lotus Notes.\" Phoney Phil may then be able to access anything from staff lists to salaries. Alternatively, Sampson might opt for a more antagonistic example. \"You think you'll never give such information away, but we show it's actually very easy to take advantage of people's ignorance,\" he says. </p> <p>The trick, he believes, is to teach secretaries specific tactics in handling callers that both protects their emotions and the company's interests. \"Some employers are so paranoid about access to staff data that receptionists come across as unhelpful and rude. That's the other end of the spectrum in responding to headhunters that we try to avoid,\" he explains. </p> <p>Secretaries within the IT industry - which is facing a particularly harsh skills shortage - are most likely to hear from headhunters, with those working in telecommunications, banking and insurance companies close behind. Indeed, organisations such as Deutsche Bank and Worldcom have recognised that there is no point investing vast sums in computer security if systems are being consistently undermined by human error. </p> <p>Nevertheless, even Sampson admits that the recent surge in the headhunting of secretarial staff themselves makes such tactics only part of the solution. Employers must work harder than ever at retaining staff so that the sales pitch of a recruitment consultant won't be enough to lure them away. \"We are never going to stop the problem of headhunting altogether,\" admits Sampson. \"In some instances, you will genuinely be offered a better job.\" </p> <p>Research shows that among the top retention techniques for secretaries are flexible perks, flexible working hours and a focus on development. At least then, secretaries suffering the brunt of headhunting can console themselves with the knowledge that the more they grow, the more justified they will be in demanding the benefits that these extra responsibilities entail. </p> <p>Anti-Headhunting UK can be reached on 020 7864 9956 or by visiting <a href=\"http://www.anti-headhunting.com\">www.anti-headhunting.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "'I want to be put through to the head of IT. What's his name?\" \"Oh, I'm sorry, Sir, I'm not allowed to disclose that information.\" \"Look love, I'm not getting off this line until you do . . .\" Sound familiar? If not, it may only be a matter of time. Headhunters are hot on the trail, stealing staff from companies - and using front-line staff such as receptionists and secretaries to get the information they need. What's more, their tactics are becoming increasingly cunning and aggressive, causing growing numbers of secretaries to quit their jobs as a result of the strain. Quite simply, headhunters use any means necessary to build up a database of names, job details and direct telephone lines, so they can then approach the relevant people as and when an employer becomes interested. It is estimated that secretaries at some multinational firms receive up to 50 such calls a day. A particularly hostile story is currently doing the rounds, detailing an imposter faking an imminent conference. \"I need a faxed list of the sales team right now,\" he demands of the innocent at the other end of the line. \"I'm really sorry, but I don't think I'm allowed to do that,\" she says, following the company line. \"Well, I'm allowing you. I work for this company, too, and am a damn sight higher up than you, so if you don't do it, I can assure you you'll be out of a job.\" \"Oh yes, OK, I'll get on to it immediately,\" seems the only possible answer to the threat. The list is delivered straight into the hot little hands of the headhunter. So why the sudden explosion of this behaviour? The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development puts it down to the unprecedented growth of the recruitment industry. \"Around the world, the shortage of skilled people in many sectors of industry means that headhunting is increasing at a dramatic rate, with 20,000 companies alone in the UK,\" explains a spokesperson. \"There is huge competition between them to get details of the best people.\" Paul Sampson, an ex-headhunter adds, \"A lot of young people working in recruitment realise that if they set up their own headhunting company, they could make a lot more money. Not surprisingly, they're hungry to get a database started and so they'll be as aggressive as need be to get it.\" Sampson believes it's no coincidence that we are witnessing a high turnover of secretarial staff. \"Understandably, they can't hack these calls,\" he says. \"They leave the office feeling used, abused, guilty and exhausted. No wonder they get to the point where they think, 'Is this worth it?' Meanwhile, the employers suffer by losing their staff. It's bad news all round.\" So severe are the repercussions, he says, that this month he has launched Anti-Headhunting UK, a service with a training package specifically aimed at front-line staff. \"We've been successfully running an anti-headhunting service on the continent for two years, but since staff data is at greater risk in the UK than almost any other European market, we've decided to expand here.\" Shock tactics are not spared. \"The seminar starts by us making live phone calls in front of the secretaries to prove the problem exists,\" he explains. Perhaps he'll phone a receptionist and say, \"Hi, it's Phil from IT. We've had a breakdown of a system and need to be reminded of your password to Lotus Notes.\" Phoney Phil may then be able to access anything from staff lists to salaries. Alternatively, Sampson might opt for a more antagonistic example. \"You think you'll never give such information away, but we show it's actually very easy to take advantage of people's ignorance,\" he says. The trick, he believes, is to teach secretaries specific tactics in handling callers that both protects their emotions and the company's interests. \"Some employers are so paranoid about access to staff data that receptionists come across as unhelpful and rude. That's the other end of the spectrum in responding to headhunters that we try to avoid,\" he explains. Secretaries within the IT industry - which is facing a particularly harsh skills shortage - are most likely to hear from headhunters, with those working in telecommunications, banking and insurance companies close behind. Indeed, organisations such as Deutsche Bank and Worldcom have recognised that there is no point investing vast sums in computer security if systems are being consistently undermined by human error. Nevertheless, even Sampson admits that the recent surge in the headhunting of secretarial staff themselves makes such tactics only part of the solution. Employers must work harder than ever at retaining staff so that the sales pitch of a recruitment consultant won't be enough to lure them away. \"We are never going to stop the problem of headhunting altogether,\" admits Sampson. \"In some instances, you will genuinely be offered a better job.\" Research shows that among the top retention techniques for secretaries are flexible perks, flexible working hours and a focus on development. At least then, secretaries suffering the brunt of headhunting can console themselves with the knowledge that the more they grow, the more justified they will be in demanding the benefits that these extra responsibilities entail.

Reynard went into the centre for a couple of hours each day, when her son was at school, whereas Nicole decided to learn online. \"I'd never even used a mouse before, so I was all over the screen when I first started\", says Reynard, \"but it's amazing how simple it is to get on with computers.\" Now she feels confident enough to experiment on her own, and is no longer scared of the machine. And, she confesses, \"If I get stuck I just ask my son.\" Visit Learn Direct on www.learndirect.co.uk, or call freefone 0800 100 900.",

Hadn't they heard of Paul Taylor, who in 1957 earned a blank review for standing still in a dance show? But as the pair finally began to move, minutely adjusting their bodies through the slowest of stretches, somersaults, crouches and crawls, I saw that they weren't reiterating the mischievous deconstructions of earlier generations, but doing a very contemporary spin on minimalism. They were doing dance as designer loft living, dance as feng shui. </p> <p>Dressed in muted grey and brown and tracking around a space that was fastidiously lit, the two dancers sculpted their bodies through a sequence of beautiful and contemplative forms. Low-key music subtly altered the ambience from trance to urban. We never saw the dancers' faces, so deeply coiled and twisted were their bodies, but we got to know their limbs, their spines, the soles of their feet, the sensuous precision of their breathing . If the pacing of the work was such that our minds wandered, it was always a pleasure returning to this space of elegant lines and gracious calm. </p> <p>Lurking in the background of I Am Vertical, a work by the enigmatically styled group th53, was the imposing ghost of Pina Bausch. The six dancers spoke snatches of confessional nonsense and attempted tasks that were comically doomed to failure, all in familiar Bausch mode. But th53's humour revelled in a loopy wit that was all its own and the performers were slick and engaging. </p> <p>The centrepiece of the programme was choreographed by Martin Lawrance, a terrifically gifted dancer and a member of the Richard Alston Company. ShELF is set to a suite of Bach solo cello music, performed onstage while Lawrance sent phrases of physically lush but emotionally introvert dance spinning along the lines of the music. The work featured deftly choreographed passages performed to a high standard, but it also appeared cramped.
