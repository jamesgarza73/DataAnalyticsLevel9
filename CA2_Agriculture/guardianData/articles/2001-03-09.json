They're based in the foothills of the Cairngorms in a wonderfully scenic area which is ideal for hill walking.

In the evenings you can all meet up back at the accommodation which is in a converted steading by the side of the River Feshie.

Featured on the BBC Holiday programme, it is now in the hands of new, younger owners, John and Gail Gravett, who have made great efforts to make a good enterprise even better. There is in-house processing, and digital facilities have also been provided. Braithwaite is a good centre for walking, and some really good hill days are accessible without use of transport, with many more only a short drive away. George Kitchin \u0095 Now in its 21st year, the Lancaster University Summer Programme offers a course in landscape photography (for those who already know the basics of camera use) and a full-day course called walking, countryside and heritage during the week July 30 to August 3, with residence available from July 29 to August 4. Accommodation is available, and there is a full evening social programme too. Gerry Cotter \u0095 As a lecturer in photography and frequent traveller, I can throughly recommend the Inversnaid Photography Centre, Scotland. Overlooking Loch Lomond, the Centre is located in a former hunting lodge, within its own 50 acre nature reserve. The Lodge has been beautifully restored and has water supplied from its own natural spring. I visited the Centre with a group of friends a couple of years ago. We took the full board option and even though we must have walked miles during our weeks stay, we still couldn't shift the extra pounds we gained from the delicious home cooked meals! The centre runs workshops with experienced photographers on location. Alternatively, and especially if the weather is bad, there is a fully equipped studio and darkroom. This is certainly a photographers' and walkers' dream location in Scotland (watch out for the Highland cattle that roam about the hills in their woolly coats!) Emma Peios \u0095 Lee Frost, one of Britain's foremost landscape photographers, runs a company called Photo Adventures which organises photographic holidays in the UK and abroad. Lee's trips include one-to-one tuition in locations from Northumberland and Dartmoor to Namibia and Venice. Lee has published a number of beautiful landscape photo books and writes regularly for Outdoor Photography magazine. He can be contacted on mail@leefrost.demon.co.uk.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\"It's in the bag, Tony. You might as well call election now\", was the Sun's headline yesterday. Its front page proclaimed: \"Blair gets our support for a second term.\" On and on rolled the eulogy. (They do nothing by halves). \"Yesterday's budget was an astounding achievement.\"</p> <p>This conversion was no surprise. The Sun always rises to embrace power. Bullies the world over have just one rule - always join the winning side, don't be seen dead with the losers. This is another tombstone representing the collapse of the right. After two elections supporting Labour, the Sun can never again be the cornerstone of the old Conservative party. It recognises there is nothing there - no party (average age 66), no policies, no personalities, no purpose, no project. A very dead parrot, the final end of the Thatcher era. The nostrums and the diktats of her days were nowhere to be found in the Budget speech, finally purged and not before time. Labour has nothing left to fear from the past, no excuse now for future pusillanimity.</p> <p>Gallantly, the Sun tried hard to support William Hague but the faltering relationship is over, leaving an anguished Tory camp yesterday. The Sun front page Dear John letter had all the classic pathos of the but-let's-always-stay-friends, adding insult to injury. \"Truth is: the Tories are quite simply not ready. We respect William Hague... We gave him a chance. But, truly, we cannot endorse a Hague-Portillo team up against Blair-Brown. Who could? ... New Labour is not perfect. There is much to be done. And we will want results, Tony. We will demand them... But Blair has done enough to win our backing.\"</p> <p>Oh, good. Phew! That's it then. The election must be in the bag because the Sun says so and it will be \"the Sun wot won it\" yet again. They always do. The sheer brass neck, the conviction that they do actually run the country is comical, almost endearing in its illusion: it is one of their very few sincerely held beliefs. When journalists start believing they control the events they report, they have always lost the plot. Everyone sniggers. This portentous self-importance is just another common journalistic delusion of grandeur: given a platform and a bunch of students, journalists swashbuckle with the doughty sword of truth, boasting of the mighty brought low by fearless investigation, toiling in the dustbins of politics. However, most British journalists work for Murdoch, Black and Rothermere, for whom truth-seeking does not comes first. Frivolity and showmanship are rarely mentioned in earnest seminars. Nor the louche sneer and jeer that is the lingua franca. Nor the sheer joy of bullying anyone famous, kicking heads in for the hell of it. Power indeed.</p> <p>But psephologist Professor John Curtice takes a dusty view of the power of the press over voters in elections. Minimal, his research suggests. For all the bombast of newspaper opinionising, during the last election all that happened during the campaign was a 4% swing away from Labour to the Lib Dems, not advocated by any newspaper. Well, he says, at the margins the newspapers do bring in some voters. The Sun's switch to Labour at least stopped them recruiting Tories, but brought in no extra. A third of voters read no newspaper at all. Over the four years between elections, a third of readers swap papers, shifting cavalierly to a political opposite. The consumers of this declining industry are fickle and volatile. \"For marketing purposes, the Sun needed to keep up with its readers.\"</p> <p>Other suspicions lurk. Murdoch gives nothing for nothing. What's he after? It requires nothing so vulgar as a deal or even a word spoken - but the communications white paper's crucial section on media ownership is \"out for consultation\" until after the election. ON-digital is taking BSkyB to the Office of Fair Trading for abusing its monopoly control over sport and movies - the drivers of the digital future that can drive others out of business. Murdoch continues to lobby for the BBC to become a tiny public service broadcaster, its money dispersed among all broadcasters willing to do a bit of public service too. Murdoch has no views, only business interests that require him to be in arm-twisting reach of governments everywhere.</p> <p>However, venality apart, if the Sun is interesting, it is as a weather vane, acutely attuned to popular mood. On Wednesday it took a new astonishing line. It lambasted Hague's infamous \"Let me take you to a foreign country\" speech. The Sun leader said: \"Hague risked being called an extremist by banging on about immigration. This was imprudent... If an asylum seeker and his family is prepared to risk their lives to come here - might they not work hard? We're just asking - particularly as we need immigrants to boost our workforce... If they want to work, they should be allowed to stay. And Blair should be more prepared to argue that case.\" Hague's speech \"left a nasty taste in the mouth\".</p> <p>Perplexed cynics point out that Rupert Murdoch's new wife is a thirty-something who was born in China. Another interpretation might be that at last the multiculturalism of Britain, its diversity and plurality, has become so embedded in the national psyche, soap operas and comedy shows, that the Sun must follow.</p> <p>Inside Downing Street the Daily Mail used to be the bellwether. Its daily menu of anti-government stories - most of them breathtaking invention and distortion - frightened the life out of their pollster Philip Gould, who warned that private polling shows asylum seekers are a major concern to his focus groups.</p> <p>The Mail continues to belabour asylum seekers, but the Mail is in another business altogether from the Sun. Its arrogance is to believe that it is now Her Majesty's true opposition, there being no other. What it sells is a delusion of another kind. It offers a make-believe world where readers can amusingly delude themselves briefly. Come with the Mail and you enter a faraway country that is forever 1955, Noddy on the bookshelf, a comfy place where Mr and Mrs England with Janet and John would live happy ever after if it weren't for the scary gollywogs in the wood: a never ending tale of right v wrong.</p> <p>There are signs at last that the government is growing braver about the press. They can ignore both the Sun's boastful blandishments and the Mail's brickbats. There can rarely have been a lower moment in any leader's career than the craven anti-European article Tony Blair wrote in the Sun just before the last election, the quid pro quo for its support. There is no need to heed any of that any more.</p> <p>But there will be a need for bravery when it comes to facing the full blast of a 70% eurosceptic press in the euro referendum. Newspapers may not do much to change party allegiance, but Harvard research has shown how right across Europe a eurosceptic press has influenced opinion against the euro. The government has to win by sheer force of argument, but it will be a frightening and final \"who governs\" showdown with the press.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\"It's in the bag, Tony. You might as well call election now\", was the Sun's headline yesterday. Its front page proclaimed: \"Blair gets our support for a second term.\" On and on rolled the eulogy. (They do nothing by halves). \"Yesterday's budget was an astounding achievement.\" This conversion was no surprise. The Sun always rises to embrace power. Bullies the world over have just one rule - always join the winning side, don't be seen dead with the losers. This is another tombstone representing the collapse of the right. After two elections supporting Labour, the Sun can never again be the cornerstone of the old Conservative party. It recognises there is nothing there - no party (average age 66), no policies, no personalities, no purpose, no project. A very dead parrot, the final end of the Thatcher era. The nostrums and the diktats of her days were nowhere to be found in the Budget speech, finally purged and not before time. Labour has nothing left to fear from the past, no excuse now for future pusillanimity. Gallantly, the Sun tried hard to support William Hague but the faltering relationship is over, leaving an anguished Tory camp yesterday. The Sun front page Dear John letter had all the classic pathos of the but-let's-always-stay-friends, adding insult to injury. \"Truth is: the Tories are quite simply not ready. We respect William Hague... We gave him a chance. But, truly, we cannot endorse a Hague-Portillo team up against Blair-Brown. Who could? ... New Labour is not perfect. There is much to be done. And we will want results, Tony. We will demand them... But Blair has done enough to win our backing.\" Oh, good. Phew! That's it then. The election must be in the bag because the Sun says so and it will be \"the Sun wot won it\" yet again. They always do. The sheer brass neck, the conviction that they do actually run the country is comical, almost endearing in its illusion: it is one of their very few sincerely held beliefs. When journalists start believing they control the events they report, they have always lost the plot. Everyone sniggers. This portentous self-importance is just another common journalistic delusion of grandeur: given a platform and a bunch of students, journalists swashbuckle with the doughty sword of truth, boasting of the mighty brought low by fearless investigation, toiling in the dustbins of politics. However, most British journalists work for Murdoch, Black and Rothermere, for whom truth-seeking does not comes first. Frivolity and showmanship are rarely mentioned in earnest seminars. Nor the louche sneer and jeer that is the lingua franca. Nor the sheer joy of bullying anyone famous, kicking heads in for the hell of it. Power indeed. But psephologist Professor John Curtice takes a dusty view of the power of the press over voters in elections. Minimal, his research suggests. For all the bombast of newspaper opinionising, during the last election all that happened during the campaign was a 4% swing away from Labour to the Lib Dems, not advocated by any newspaper. Well, he says, at the margins the newspapers do bring in some voters. The Sun's switch to Labour at least stopped them recruiting Tories, but brought in no extra. A third of voters read no newspaper at all. Over the four years between elections, a third of readers swap papers, shifting cavalierly to a political opposite. The consumers of this declining industry are fickle and volatile. \"For marketing purposes, the Sun needed to keep up with its readers.\" Other suspicions lurk. Murdoch gives nothing for nothing. What's he after? It requires nothing so vulgar as a deal or even a word spoken - but the communications white paper's crucial section on media ownership is \"out for consultation\" until after the election. ON-digital is taking BSkyB to the Office of Fair Trading for abusing its monopoly control over sport and movies - the drivers of the digital future that can drive others out of business. Murdoch continues to lobby for the BBC to become a tiny public service broadcaster, its money dispersed among all broadcasters willing to do a bit of public service too. Murdoch has no views, only business interests that require him to be in arm-twisting reach of governments everywhere. However, venality apart, if the Sun is interesting, it is as a weather vane, acutely attuned to popular mood. On Wednesday it took a new astonishing line. It lambasted Hague's infamous \"Let me take you to a foreign country\" speech. The Sun leader said: \"Hague risked being called an extremist by banging on about immigration. This was imprudent... If an asylum seeker and his family is prepared to risk their lives to come here - might they not work hard? We're just asking - particularly as we need immigrants to boost our workforce... If they want to work, they should be allowed to stay. And Blair should be more prepared to argue that case.\" Hague's speech \"left a nasty taste in the mouth\". Perplexed cynics point out that Rupert Murdoch's new wife is a thirty-something who was born in China. Another interpretation might be that at last the multiculturalism of Britain, its diversity and plurality, has become so embedded in the national psyche, soap operas and comedy shows, that the Sun must follow. Inside Downing Street the Daily Mail used to be the bellwether. Its daily menu of anti-government stories - most of them breathtaking invention and distortion - frightened the life out of their pollster Philip Gould, who warned that private polling shows asylum seekers are a major concern to his focus groups. The Mail continues to belabour asylum seekers, but the Mail is in another business altogether from the Sun. Its arrogance is to believe that it is now Her Majesty's true opposition, there being no other. What it sells is a delusion of another kind. It offers a make-believe world where readers can amusingly delude themselves briefly. Come with the Mail and you enter a faraway country that is forever 1955, Noddy on the bookshelf, a comfy place where Mr and Mrs England with Janet and John would live happy ever after if it weren't for the scary gollywogs in the wood: a never ending tale of right v wrong. There are signs at last that the government is growing braver about the press. They can ignore both the Sun's boastful blandishments and the Mail's brickbats. There can rarely have been a lower moment in any leader's career than the craven anti-European article Tony Blair wrote in the Sun just before the last election, the quid pro quo for its support. There is no need to heed any of that any more. But there will be a need for bravery when it comes to facing the full blast of a 70% eurosceptic press in the euro referendum. Newspapers may not do much to change party allegiance, but Harvard research has shown how right across Europe a eurosceptic press has influenced opinion against the euro. The government has to win by sheer force of argument, but it will be a frightening and final \"who governs\" showdown with the press. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, yesterday attacked the Sun newspaper for endorsing Labour at the next election, claiming the decision was contradictory and illogical. In an editorial written by the paper's editor David Yelland in the wake of Wednesday's budget, the Sun declared on its front page that the election was in the bag for Labour, and Tony Blair would have the newspaper's support. Privately, senior Conservatives regard the loss of the Thatcherite flagship paper as inevitable and claim it was dictated for commercial reasons by the proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, over the heads of the paper's political staff. Some Tory MPs ruefully admitted that Mr Murdoch, not known for backing the losing side, had long ago decided that Labour would win the election at a canter. Trevor Kavanagh, the Sun's political editor, has for many months been dropping broad hints that his paper would be giving Labour a second chance. The move now raises the prospect that only the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail of the national daily press will back William Hague. A central office official said the Sun's repeat of its 1997 defection, when it backed Labour in another front page endorsement at the start of the election campaign, was \"always coming\". He drew comfort from the fact that the paper was still being relatively complimentary about William Hague. \"They did not put the boot into William,\" he said. Officials also hoped that Mr Kavanagh, a fan of Lady Thatcher, will still be free to express his opinions. But Tories were angry that the Sun had earlier attacked William Hague's speech at the party's spring conference in Harrogate, when he warned Britain would look like a foreign land after four years of a second Labour term. Mr Hague's speech called for tough action against asylum seekers, including detention camps for all applicants, and it might have been tailor made for the white van man, the Sun's latest version of Essex man. Instead the Sun attacked the speech on the grounds that it could be misconstrued as racist and anti-foreign. \"It flirted with extremism and left a nasty taste in the mouth\", said the paper. Deploying some of the pioneer spirit of early America, the Sun argued that Britain needed more immigrants to boost the workforce. The same point has been made by the government in a series of speeches by Barbara Roche, the immigration minister. Adopting a policy that left central office in a state of puzzled despair, the Sun argued in an editorial the day before it finally endorsed Labour: \"If these immigrants are just here for the benefits they should be sent home. But if they want to work, they should be allowed to stay.\" Mr Kavanagh in a signed article urged the Conservatives to adopt a bold policy of \"barring new arrivals from all forms of welfare for a year until they prove they are genuinely looking for work\". Pressed on the Sun's attitude decision yesterday Mr Portillo said: \"I thought the Harrogate speech was a very good speech and a speech in normal times that talked about the dangers of the euro would have been a speech that the Sun would have applauded because the sentiments expressed were so much in line with the policy of the Sun.\" Tories argued their approach to asylum was much closer to the views of the Sun readership than Labour. There has been a long academic debate about the extent to which newspapers can influence the voting habits of their reader, although many. believe the influence of newspapers has been diluted by the dominance of TV during elections. The Sun's influence can be exaggerated. In 1979 a third of the Sun readership on the weekend after the election thought the paper had backed Labour when it had in fact supported the Tories. The Sun nevertheless claimed that \"it was the Sun wot won it\" for John Major in 1992, after front page attacks such as \"Will the last person to leave Britain turn out the lights?\" on polling day ridiculed Labour's competence. The then Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, came to believe that the tabloids killed off his chances. Equally the defection to Labour in 1997, carefully prepared by Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair, was seen as decisive by the Sun and significant within Downing Street. Bob Worcester, chairman of opinion pollsters Mori, argues the Sun's readership's politics precisely reflects that of the British public. A Mori poll in January showed Sun readers as 50% Labour supporters, 33% Conservative and 12% Liberal Democrat. The same poll nationally showed Labour on 50%, Conservatives on 31% and Liberal Democrats 14%. Mr Worcester argues that with about 20% of the electorate determinining the outcome of each election, the Sun can have an important influence. He said: \"The Sun newspaper represents 17% or 18% of the electorate, and if they move just 1% of the marginal voters, it's the same as if they are moving 5% of the total electorate.\"",

Forty-five candidates, including one former MP, queued last Monday for a \"photo-opportunity\" with Lady Thatcher, who resigned as prime minister 11 years ago. Some Tory candidates privately admit that canvassing returns show William Hague is a turn-off to voters with many elderly ex-Tories, saying they would vote for the party if Lady Thatcher were still leader. As a result, some Tory candidates will ditch pictures of Mr Hague for the 75-year-old baroness in election addresses. Others will highlight both in their election addresses or issue press releases featuring Lady Thatcher during the campaign. Lady Thatcher is also expected to make constituency appearances for her most favoured candidates. The candidates keenest on Lady Thatcher include many in London and the south-east where the Tories lost seats in droves to Labour and the Liberal Democrats in 1997. Vivian Bendall, who is trying to wrest back his Ilford North seat from Labour (majority 3,224), said: \"I have always been an admirer of Lady Thatcher.

      "bodyText": "The IRA suddenly renewed contact with the international disaramament body yesterday after issuing a surprise dawn statement reiterating their commitment to lasting peace. The move came as Tony Blair and the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, met party leaders at Hillsborough Castle in an attempt to end the deadlock in the Northern Ireland political process. However there was little hope last night of a significant breakthrough. The IRA revealed their representative had been in touch with decommissioning head, General John de Chastelain, to pave the way for more discussions, the first since last June. But republicans want further moves on policing reform, security scaled down and an amnesty to prisoners on the run, and the IRA warned: \"For this engagement to be successful, the British government must deliver on its obligations.\" While the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, welcomed the initiative as creating space for movement, the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, dismissed it as a publicity stunt, insisting he wanted action not words on decommissioning. Yesterday's round table and bilateral negotiations were described as \"full and frank\", and sources claimed the prime minister admitted, with caveats, the government had not yet delivered on all commitments made last May. The talks came after eight weeks of behind-the-scenes efforts to broker a deal, but with election pressures retrenching all sides, few were holding out hope of an immediate settlement on policing, decommissioning and demilitarisation. The aim now seems to be an interim arrangement, which will tide the parties through to summer or even autumn, avoiding the need for suspension of the power-sharing Stormont assembly, but have the new IRA statements given Mr Blair and Mr Ahern the opening gambit they need? The Provisional IRA is as aware as any paramilitary organisation of how to use surprise tactics to best advantage, and on one reading, as Mr Trimble was quick to point out, the latest moves could be viewed as merely a \"pre-emptive strike\", shifting blame before a possible collapse of the process. The IRA has promised to do no more than it did last May, when it opened up several of its secret arms dumps to two international inspectors, but no weapons were decommissioned. But on another level, the statements are a welcome reminder of the Provisionals' commitment to peace, and an antidote to IRA veteran Brian Keenan's ominous words a fortnight ago that violence was still an option if politics failed. There was a feeling, however, that Mr Keenan's speech was for internal consumption, showing would-be defectors to dissidents like the Real IRA that he has not gone soft, and the fact that he is the Provisionals' representative to the de Chastelain commission is significant, given the latest move. London and Dublin's hope is that the IRA reopening serious discussions with de Chastelain would enable Mr Trimble to lift his ban on Sinn Fein ministers Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brun attending north/south meetings. The government would undertake some security scaledown, perhaps shutting installations in Magherafelt, Co Derry, and Newtownhamilton, Co Armagh, with the prospect of further closures of some of the controversial watchtowers in south Armagh. It is also hoped the SDLP at least could be persuaded to take its seats on the new police board, with the door still open for Sinn Fein to do so later. The SDLP has up till now refused to break ranks with Sinn Fein on policing. The SDLP recently appeared to be nearing a deal to enable it to nominate representatives to the police board but their big fear is jumping first on to the board and Sinn Fein then negotiating some further concessions, which would then enable them to gain capital in the election. Downing Street has strongly denied Sunday's Real IRA bomb outside the London headquarters of the BBC has increased pressure to make progress. But there is no doubt the growing dissident republican threat has added urgency to proving politics work, while conversely making it more difficult for unionists and republicans to compromise. Mr Adams will argue that to make radical moves on decommissioning would drive new recruits into the arms of the dissidents, but, in this context, the IRA statement is important as an indication of final intent. Mr Trimble, meanwhile, insists such attacks make demilitarisation dangerous and disarmament all the more necessary. He has made it clear he will not lift his veto for something inconsequential. The anti-agreement Ulster Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party needs to see actual decommissioning very soon. But the expected Ulster Unionist Council showdown at the start of the year never materialised and the im mediate threat of the party's pullout from Stormont seems to have somewhat receded. An Ulster Unionist meeting is scheduled for March 24, although foot and mouth restrictions might lead to its postponement, given that many key members are farmers, which could ironically buy Mr Trimble time. But the crux of the issue remains exactly what IRA re-engagement with de Chastelain constitutes, which will no doubt be teased out in coming days, and whether it will be enough to keep unionists on board. Mr Trimble is reluctant to see Stormont put into cold storage, although another review of the process with no suspension is still possible. And while this election is expected to be tough for his party, there is a contrary argument that its pressures could force members to paper over bitter divisions, at least for the time being. He might feel he can now afford to wait it out to see exactly what the IRA does, while they, likewise, will carefully assess reciprocal moves. Keen as Mr Blair is to see some sort of deal, rather than no deal at all, he may well have to be content with work in progress.

      "body": "<p>The British Medical Association is gearing up for confrontation with health ministers during the election campaign by producing a patients' dossier, showing the suffering caused when doctors in the hard-pressed NHS are forced to cut corners.</p> <p>Doctors' leaders will say they are not taking sides but their intervention is likely to help William Hague's attempt to undermine the credibility of NHS reforms - regarded by Labour strategists as one of their strongest electoral suits.</p> <p>The plan emerged yesterday after the BMA council on Wednesday decided patients were being \"short-changed\" by excessive workload. \"Patients in both primary and hospital care get too little time with their doctors. The inexorable rise in workload and the constant flow of new government initiatives and targets have created a very real tide of anger and demoralisation amongst senior hospital doctors and GPs,\" the BMA said.</p> <p>John Chisholm, chairman of its GP committee, said: \"We will not name individual patients or doctors to protect their anonymity, but we will provide evidence of what it is really like in the NHS.\"</p> <p>Dr Chisholm said he was writing to the UK's 36,000 GPs urging them to lobby MPs and parliamentary candidates and contact newspapers, television and radio on workloads and recruitment issues.</p> <p>The average GP was giving 10,000 consultations a year - 50% more than when the NHS was founded in 1948. That cut the average length of a consultation to eight minutes or less.</p> <p>\"This is unfair to patients. It does not give the space they need for reassurance and discussion of the treatments they need, or advice on how to live with chronic illness. For doctors all the pleasure of medicine is destroyed by the conveyor belt pace... The result is work related stress and disaffection,\" he said.</p> <p>The government was planning to appoint an extra 2,000 GPs in England by 2004, but this was less than a fifth of the 10,330 needed to provide a satisfactory service.</p> <p>\"We are way behind even the government's ridiculously low targets for GP recruitment. The government must take some urgent and immediate steps to boost morale, providing pensions incentives to keep older doctors in the workforce and offering hope to new doctors that general practice will be an attractive career where they can serve the community without destroying their own health or disappearing under a mountain of paperwork,\" he said.</p> <p>Derek Machin, deputy chairman of the consultants' committee, said pressure from the government to reduce hospital waiting lists was forcing doctors to prioritise the wrong patients. Ministers were promising to appoint 7,500 more con sultants by 2004, but this was raising patients' expectations without yet reducing the burden on doctors.</p> <p>\"For hospital consultants, the crunch issue really is workload. For too long, consultants have tried to reconcile two contradictory imperatives. We try to fast track patients through the system, squeezing extra appointments into out-patient clinics, discharging patients at lightning speed and putting quantity ahead of quality. That increases the risk of accident and error,\" he said.</p> <p>Plans to intervene in the election came as the BMA moved closer to settling a long-running argument with the general medical council on streamlining disciplinary procedures.</p> <p>Dr Bogle said both sides would support a small GMC executive that could speed up decisions and a larger council of about 50 medical and lay representatives that could discuss policy. There was disagreement about which body should have the more statutory powers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The British Medical Association is gearing up for confrontation with health ministers during the election campaign by producing a patients' dossier, showing the suffering caused when doctors in the hard-pressed NHS are forced to cut corners. Doctors' leaders will say they are not taking sides but their intervention is likely to help William Hague's attempt to undermine the credibility of NHS reforms - regarded by Labour strategists as one of their strongest electoral suits. The plan emerged yesterday after the BMA council on Wednesday decided patients were being \"short-changed\" by excessive workload. \"Patients in both primary and hospital care get too little time with their doctors. The inexorable rise in workload and the constant flow of new government initiatives and targets have created a very real tide of anger and demoralisation amongst senior hospital doctors and GPs,\" the BMA said. John Chisholm, chairman of its GP committee, said: \"We will not name individual patients or doctors to protect their anonymity, but we will provide evidence of what it is really like in the NHS.\" Dr Chisholm said he was writing to the UK's 36,000 GPs urging them to lobby MPs and parliamentary candidates and contact newspapers, television and radio on workloads and recruitment issues. The average GP was giving 10,000 consultations a year - 50% more than when the NHS was founded in 1948. That cut the average length of a consultation to eight minutes or less. \"This is unfair to patients. It does not give the space they need for reassurance and discussion of the treatments they need, or advice on how to live with chronic illness. For doctors all the pleasure of medicine is destroyed by the conveyor belt pace... The result is work related stress and disaffection,\" he said. The government was planning to appoint an extra 2,000 GPs in England by 2004, but this was less than a fifth of the 10,330 needed to provide a satisfactory service. \"We are way behind even the government's ridiculously low targets for GP recruitment. The government must take some urgent and immediate steps to boost morale, providing pensions incentives to keep older doctors in the workforce and offering hope to new doctors that general practice will be an attractive career where they can serve the community without destroying their own health or disappearing under a mountain of paperwork,\" he said. Derek Machin, deputy chairman of the consultants' committee, said pressure from the government to reduce hospital waiting lists was forcing doctors to prioritise the wrong patients. Ministers were promising to appoint 7,500 more con sultants by 2004, but this was raising patients' expectations without yet reducing the burden on doctors. \"For hospital consultants, the crunch issue really is workload. For too long, consultants have tried to reconcile two contradictory imperatives. We try to fast track patients through the system, squeezing extra appointments into out-patient clinics, discharging patients at lightning speed and putting quantity ahead of quality. That increases the risk of accident and error,\" he said. Plans to intervene in the election came as the BMA moved closer to settling a long-running argument with the general medical council on streamlining disciplinary procedures. Dr Bogle said both sides would support a small GMC executive that could speed up decisions and a larger council of about 50 medical and lay representatives that could discuss policy. There was disagreement about which body should have the more statutory powers.",

Now, like Michael Heseltine, I am finding my own loyalty to the Conservative party tested as never before. I don't believe William Hague is a racist, a xenophobe or an extremist. But why should I pro-actively go out and vote for someone whose agenda appears to be entirely negative?</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph entitled a front page story on Hague's most recent speech \"A pledge to preserve Britishness\". It seemed designed to suggest that British culture is on the point of extinction, but that brave little William was promising a fight to keep it alive, an infinitely depressing prospect.</p> <p>I don't believe Britishness is about to die out - after all, we are not sinking beneath the waves even if we don't rule them any more - but if there are those at Tory central office who think otherwise I have to ask: a) what do they think constitutes \"Britishness\"; and b) how are they going to preserve it? Are red-haired, kilt wearing Scots going to be herded into reservations for Americans tourists to photograph?

      "bodyText": "\"Don't be a class traitor,\" I shouted after a friend as she went off to vote for Neil Kinnock many years ago. Now, like Michael Heseltine, I am finding my own loyalty to the Conservative party tested as never before. I don't believe William Hague is a racist, a xenophobe or an extremist. But why should I pro-actively go out and vote for someone whose agenda appears to be entirely negative? The Daily Telegraph entitled a front page story on Hague's most recent speech \"A pledge to preserve Britishness\". It seemed designed to suggest that British culture is on the point of extinction, but that brave little William was promising a fight to keep it alive, an infinitely depressing prospect. I don't believe Britishness is about to die out - after all, we are not sinking beneath the waves even if we don't rule them any more - but if there are those at Tory central office who think otherwise I have to ask: a) what do they think constitutes \"Britishness\"; and b) how are they going to preserve it? Are red-haired, kilt wearing Scots going to be herded into reservations for Americans tourists to photograph? Shall children be raised to mirror the attitudes and fashion sense of the gerontocracy that form the majority of Conservative party members?

Liverpool are also hopeful that Steven Gerrard and Danny Murphy will overcome their injury problems. Igor Biscan or Gary McAllister will replace the suspended Dietmar Hamann in midfield.</p> <p><strong>ARSENAL v BLACKBURN</strong></p> <p>Matt Jansen believes that Blackburn can cause a shock at Highbury tomorrow. \"We have already been to Derby in the Cup and put five past them,\" he said. \"While that is unlikely to happen again tomorrow, who knows what we could achieve if we play to our top form?\"</p> <p>Blackburn go into the game having suffered only two defeats in 24 games stretching back to last November, and should be at full strength with influential England U-21 midfielder David Dunn returning from a toe injury.</p> <p>Arsenal meanwhile are depleted through injuries and international call-ups. Martin Keown (knee), Edu (hamstring) and Ray Parlour (hamstring) are all ruled out, while Kanu is on international duty with Nigeria. Silvinho, who only flew back from international duty today, could start on the substitutes' bench.</p> <p>Thierry Henry will still have a late fitness test after taking a knock during the Champions League game against Spartak Moscow in midweek.</p> <p><strong>WEST HAM v TOTTENHAM</strong></p> <p>West Ham manager Harry Redknapp will make a last minute decision over whether to risk Stuart Pearce, who sprained his ankle in Wednesday night's 2-0 defeat at home to Chelsea.

      "bodyText": "LIVERPOOL v TRANMERE Gerard Houllier has warned his side that Tranmere could be a potential \"banana skin\" if they are not careful. \"They have beaten seven Premiership sides,\" he admitted. \"This is a real banana skin and we must be mentally prepared for the occasion.\" Houllier expects to be without Stephane Henchoz with a knee injury, but Jari Litmanen will be available. Liverpool are also hopeful that Steven Gerrard and Danny Murphy will overcome their injury problems. Igor Biscan or Gary McAllister will replace the suspended Dietmar Hamann in midfield. ARSENAL v BLACKBURN Matt Jansen believes that Blackburn can cause a shock at Highbury tomorrow. \"We have already been to Derby in the Cup and put five past them,\" he said. \"While that is unlikely to happen again tomorrow, who knows what we could achieve if we play to our top form?\" Blackburn go into the game having suffered only two defeats in 24 games stretching back to last November, and should be at full strength with influential England U-21 midfielder David Dunn returning from a toe injury. Arsenal meanwhile are depleted through injuries and international call-ups. Martin Keown (knee), Edu (hamstring) and Ray Parlour (hamstring) are all ruled out, while Kanu is on international duty with Nigeria. Silvinho, who only flew back from international duty today, could start on the substitutes' bench. Thierry Henry will still have a late fitness test after taking a knock during the Champions League game against Spartak Moscow in midweek. WEST HAM v TOTTENHAM West Ham manager Harry Redknapp will make a last minute decision over whether to risk Stuart Pearce, who sprained his ankle in Wednesday night's 2-0 defeat at home to Chelsea. But Pearce is the only Hammers doubt: Michael Carrick, Freddie Kanoute, Nigel Winterburn and Igor Stimac all return and Sebastien Schemmel will start after being rested on Wednesday. LEICESTER v WYCOMBE Robbie Savage believes his lucky silver boots are key to Leicester's bid to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 19 years. \"We won at Villa in the third round and I've worn them ever since.

      "body": "<p>\"If Gordon Brown's Budget was rewritten as a Hollywood movie,\" said Howard Reed of the Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday, \"it would be called 'no losers' - or perhaps, 'everyone's a winner'.\"</p> <p>Weeks ahead of a general election, the chancellor's fifth and final Budget of the parliament followed a familiar pattern of quiet redistribution, with most of the gains concentrated at the bottom end of the income scale.</p> <p>But with middle England likely to play a crucial part in the outcome of the poll, Mr Brown also made sure that average and higher income groups did not suffer. Unlike some previous Budgets, there were gains for families in every income bracket.</p> <p>\"This Budget goes with the grain of previous Labour party budgets whilst offering something for almost everyone,\" Mr Reed said.</p> <p>In its analysis of the distributional impact of the personal tax and benefit changes, the IFS said the biggest gainers in percentage terms are households in the poorest tenth of the population.</p> <p>They gain on average about 1.6% of disposable income. In cash terms, that is about \u00a31.65 a week. The main drivers are the benefit increases and excise duty changes.</p> <p>Further up the income distribution scale, the widening of the 10p tax band from \u00a31,520 to \u00a31,880 ensures that basic and higher rate taxpayers also have some extra money in their pockets.</p> <p>In percentage terms, the richest 10% of the population gains about 0.3% of disposable income - around \u00a32 a week in cash terms.</p> <p>The IFS has also calculated the effect of the Budget changes on direct and indirect tax by family type. This shows that families with children are the biggest beneficiaries.</p> <p>They gain from the above-inflation increases in the working families tax credit, the children's credit and the changes to child allowances in income support. As a percentage of disposable income, single parents and non-earning couples with children gain the most.

      "bodyText": "\"If Gordon Brown's Budget was rewritten as a Hollywood movie,\" said Howard Reed of the Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday, \"it would be called 'no losers' - or perhaps, 'everyone's a winner'.\" Weeks ahead of a general election, the chancellor's fifth and final Budget of the parliament followed a familiar pattern of quiet redistribution, with most of the gains concentrated at the bottom end of the income scale. But with middle England likely to play a crucial part in the outcome of the poll, Mr Brown also made sure that average and higher income groups did not suffer. Unlike some previous Budgets, there were gains for families in every income bracket. \"This Budget goes with the grain of previous Labour party budgets whilst offering something for almost everyone,\" Mr Reed said. In its analysis of the distributional impact of the personal tax and benefit changes, the IFS said the biggest gainers in percentage terms are households in the poorest tenth of the population. They gain on average about 1.6% of disposable income. In cash terms, that is about \u00a31.65 a week. The main drivers are the benefit increases and excise duty changes. Further up the income distribution scale, the widening of the 10p tax band from \u00a31,520 to \u00a31,880 ensures that basic and higher rate taxpayers also have some extra money in their pockets. In percentage terms, the richest 10% of the population gains about 0.3% of disposable income - around \u00a32 a week in cash terms. The IFS has also calculated the effect of the Budget changes on direct and indirect tax by family type. This shows that families with children are the biggest beneficiaries. They gain from the above-inflation increases in the working families tax credit, the children's credit and the changes to child allowances in income support. As a percentage of disposable income, single parents and non-earning couples with children gain the most. Their incomes rise by about 2% a week on average. At the opposite end of the age range, pensioners gain little from the tax and benefit changes announced yesterday. But they will still be better off both this year and in the years to come, thanks to the generous package of measures announced in November's pre-Budget report, including increases in the basic state pension and the minimum income guarantee. Pensioners also benefit from tax allowances rising in line with earnings from 2003 onwards, and the planned introduction of the new pension credit. The IFS said the overall impact of the Budget on the public finances was to loosen fiscal policy by \u00a34.4bn in the coming financial year, rising to \u00a35.2bn in 2002-03 and \u00a35.8bn in 2003-04. IFS researcher Carl Emmerson said the tax cuts and spending increases announced by the chancellor had been made possible by higher than expected tax revenue - especially income tax - combined with lower than expected spending on social security and debt interest, and underspending of departmental programmes. However, he questioned the chancellor's claim to have upped spending increases to 3.7% a year over the next three years from 3.4% previously, saying that the only reason spending was growing faster was that it was starting from a lower base.

Strangely, \"very editorial\" is generally used as a compliment. It was, in fact, just about the only compliment possible to describe the most prominent trend from the Milan fashion shows - the little girl/babydoll look. </p> <p>Those with long fashion memories may remember the \"Lolita\" trend of a few years ago, when it was briefly de rigueur to wear over-the-knee socks and squeeze into child-sized T-shirts. As I recall, some well-known women even took to wearing their hair in bunches, though I'm not naming names. Well, this season's little girl/babydoll look has the same distinctly dodgy undertones - the difference is, this time it's uglier and less flattering. </p> <p>I'm not really selling it, am I? As a fashion editor, I'm supposed to promote the \"new wardrobe every six months\" mantra that keeps the industry rolling. Sorry. Rest assured, there were some very, very nice clothes - coats and trouser suits in particular - and we'll come to those in a moment. But first, babydoll. </p> <p>At Gucci, the babydoll silhouette of empire-line waist and extra-high hemline dominated eveningwear, with tiny evening dresses in dark velvet or in striped or spotted net. At Prada, models had grown up to school age, with apron dresses and capes. Poor Bridget Hall demonstrated the problems of an empire-line silhouette for anyone with breasts, looking mortally embarrassed in an unflattering smock dress that ballooned her svelte shape to twice its normal size. </p> <p>Miu Miu took literally its role as Prada's younger line, with square-necked, big-buttoned, prep school princess coats in red and grey. Blouses had frilly cap sleeves and patch pockets at bust level. Philosophy looked positively elderly by comparison, with its sulky sixth-form chic: a long purple velvet skirt was worn with a purple ribbed cardigan and flat boots. At Lawrence Steele, ribbon-trimmed babydoll dresses were voluminous around the bottom, making stick-thin girls look as if they were wearing nappies. Square- necked sailor jackets, bermuda shorts, smocked vel vet party dresses with puff sleeves - frankly, Britney Spears would look like mutton dressed as lamb in these clothes. </p> <p>That's the bad news. The good news is that sharing the same catwalks were some very good pieces. The first three-quarters of the Gucci show, before the babydoll eveningwear appeared, was sheer fantasy shopping: a perfect 10 for trousers that hit just the right note between slick and slouchy, utterly desirable coats in black and cream detailed with shiny silver zips, simple black satin cocktail dresses slashed to bare just the right amount of flesh. At Prada, there was nothing frumpy about the sleek silk shirt dresses in soft plum or in a swirly, caramel-and-cream print, or the riding school-styled grey wool trouser suit with cutaway, curvy jacket and jodhpur-seamed trousers. Miu Miu's tan leather coat dress and dark washed denim, long-legged, sexy jeans were gorgeous. At Philosophy, the petrol blue cinched-back silk dress and tobacco corduroy jackets and coats were lovely. </p> <p>But best of the week came from a label that steered another course entirely. Bottega Veneta was head and shoulders above the rest of Milan, both for fresh ideas and slick execution. A tab-front jacket in the most luxurious thick, shiny red leather was cut with meticulous accuracy: shoulders pin-sharp, sleeve cuffs sitting at precisely the same height as the waistband. Neon bright jade, turquoise, yellow and red were worn with black. Bleached denim came in loose, hipster jeans, a curvy seamed dress and a zip-seamed mini-skirt, worn over thick ribbed leggings pulled low over bright, high-heeled shoes. The woven leather for which the house is known was there in an indulgent leather coat, on ponytail bands and even on leather headphones, but bags also came as shiny, shin-bruising boxy suitcases. </p> <p>Less airbrushed but with the same brittle, hard-as-nails aesthetic was Luella, which occasionally looked a little like a Bottega Veneta diffusion line but mostly stood soundly on its own, with paint-striped trousers and shirts, and bumblebee- striped sweater-dresses and jackets. </p> <p>Other labels stuck to their guns and produced good collections in the styles for which they are known. Alberta Ferretti's was a strong show, understated but powerful: a navy chiffon blouse with a tan leather skirt, an elegant cutaway jacket in plum velvet, a fluid satin off-the-shoulder dress in the palest silver satin. Dolce &amp; Gabbana's \"glamour hippy\" look featured all their signatures. Ultra-low-riding, super-tight, extra-long leather trousers were worn with high-necked sheer lace blouses laden with strings of pearls. Corseting came in a tight black dress and a coffee-coloured bodice laced with cream ties. The shoes, as always, were fabulous: high sandals with ankle straps of pearls, knee-high white leather boots sprigged with tiny flowers. At the diffusion line D&amp;G, rock chicks still rule, though this season Madonna gave way to Debbie Harry. </p> <p>Versace, funnily enough, did glamour, too. Dramatic backless dresses, in ribbed black jersey with gold-zipped neck cuff, or in jade green silk with a black leather collar, were worn with steel-spike heels so spindly they didn't even last till the end of the catwalk. The full-length dresses were the least successful, looking a little fussy, but the trouser suit-based daywear worked well. Versus, aimed at the younger customer, was shorter, brighter and sheerer, worn with boots and stockings. </p> <p>Samsonite Blacklabel was an accomplished collection from a brand that is leaving the luggage tags behind. Miniskirt suits in winter white wool, car coats in tweed, trench coats in olive leather and cosy knitwear were finished off with one of the best bags of the season, a boxy, two-piece, vanity case-style handbag with thick bright striped strap. </p> <p>Alessandro dell'Acqua showed interesting eveningwear: ballet-wraps in black chiffon over bronze sequin vests, and sheer chiffon in shades of toffee and burnt orange. Missoni was a little lacklustre this season, the prints failing to sing out. Antonio Berardi pulled out all the stops with his own name collection. Trousersuits were worn back to front or with corset bodices over the top, stunning cutaway dresses came in black leather and ruffled flamenco styles in lemon and pink were topped off with spiky, sparkling Stephen Jones hats. At Exte, there were steel corsets and stiff leather armour-style cropped jackets, but better were the softer pieces - a green satin asymmetric dress layered with diagonal pieces, like giant fishscales, was stunning. Berardi was missed at Pucci, where his replacement failed to make the classic prints come to life. The swirled shirt dresses, a geometric short coat and a strawberry pink printed satin clutchbag were all perfectly fine, but somehow the fizz had gone. Pucci fans might do better to visit the vintage shops next season.</p>",

Alberta Ferretti's was a strong show, understated but powerful: a navy chiffon blouse with a tan leather skirt, an elegant cutaway jacket in plum velvet, a fluid satin off-the-shoulder dress in the palest silver satin. Dolce &amp; Gabbana's \"glamour hippy\" look featured all their signatures. Ultra-low-riding, super-tight, extra-long leather trousers were worn with high-necked sheer lace blouses laden with strings of pearls. Corseting came in a tight black dress and a coffee-coloured bodice laced with cream ties. The shoes, as always, were fabulous: high sandals with ankle straps of pearls, knee-high white leather boots sprigged with tiny flowers. At the diffusion line D&amp;G, rock chicks still rule, though this season Madonna gave way to Debbie Harry. Versace, funnily enough, did glamour, too. Dramatic backless dresses, in ribbed black jersey with gold-zipped neck cuff, or in jade green silk with a black leather collar, were worn with steel-spike heels so spindly they didn't even last till the end of the catwalk. The full-length dresses were the least successful, looking a little fussy, but the trouser suit-based daywear worked well. Versus, aimed at the younger customer, was shorter, brighter and sheerer, worn with boots and stockings. Samsonite Blacklabel was an accomplished collection from a brand that is leaving the luggage tags behind. Miniskirt suits in winter white wool, car coats in tweed, trench coats in olive leather and cosy knitwear were finished off with one of the best bags of the season, a boxy, two-piece, vanity case-style handbag with thick bright striped strap. Alessandro dell'Acqua showed interesting eveningwear: ballet-wraps in black chiffon over bronze sequin vests, and sheer chiffon in shades of toffee and burnt orange. Missoni was a little lacklustre this season, the prints failing to sing out. Antonio Berardi pulled out all the stops with his own name collection. Trousersuits were worn back to front or with corset bodices over the top, stunning cutaway dresses came in black leather and ruffled flamenco styles in lemon and pink were topped off with spiky, sparkling Stephen Jones hats. At Exte, there were steel corsets and stiff leather armour-style cropped jackets, but better were the softer pieces - a green satin asymmetric dress layered with diagonal pieces, like giant fishscales, was stunning. Berardi was missed at Pucci, where his replacement failed to make the classic prints come to life. The swirled shirt dresses, a geometric short coat and a strawberry pink printed satin clutchbag were all perfectly fine, but somehow the fizz had gone. Pucci fans might do better to visit the vintage shops next season.",

      "bodyText": "One of the biggest management jobs in the health service - regional director of the NHS in London - has gone to civil servant John Bacon. Mr Bacon, who will oversee a \u00a36bn budget and over 90 NHS trusts and health authorities, is currently acting director of London region after spending two years as its director of finance and performance. He succeeds his former boss at London region, Nigel Crisp, who was appointed NHS chief executive in autumn 2000. In a separate move, Ruth Carnall has been appointed as regional director of the NHS south-east region in succession to Barbara Stocking, who became director of the NHS modernisation agency in November 2000. Ms Stocking has subsequently announced she is to leave the NHS to become chief executive of the aid charity Oxfam. Mr Bacon\u0092s appointment, which was widely expected, is one of the most demanding in the NHS, covering as it does one of the most complex and politically sensitive areas of the UK. His predecessor won plaudits for developing close relations with London mayor Ken Livingstone at a time when many expected the mayor to take a critical stance to the NHS. Mr Bacon will have the task of implementing the government\u0092s NHS reforms at a time when the capital\u0092s health service faces pressure on several fronts, including a chronic shortages of nurses and other key staff. He said: \u0093I look forward to continuing the good work of the past two years in forging close links with our colleagues in local government and the voluntary sector in developing policies and strategies which will lead to the overall improvement of the health of Londoners in future.\u0094 Before joining NHS London region in 1998, Mr Bacon worked as an NHS manager in Surrey and the south-west. He joined the NHS in 1983 from the UK Atomic Energy Commission. Ms Carnall, the chief executive of West Kent health authority, has been acting director of south-east region for the past three months. She is a career NHS manager.",

The statement from Yahoo!, together with a warning that profits this quarter would be far lower than expected, combined to make this an anniversary investors would prefer to forget. In the past 12 months the Nasdaq index has more than halved in the wake of the dot.com bubble bursting and a series of profit warnings from a host of large technology firms. Yesterday it had fallen a further 60 points to 2,163 by the time London closed. </p> <p>The announcement from Yahoo! dragged shares across the whole internet and related sectors down yet again. T-Online, Europe's largest internet service provider owned by Deutsche Telekom fell by nearly 6% to \u20ac11.80 (\u00a37.50), close to its all-time low. At its peak in May last year, T-Online was trading at \u20ac48 a share. </p> <p>Spain's Terra Lycos was 10% lower, and France's Wanadoo, which owns Freeserve, was 7% softer. </p> <p>Stock in Yahoo! was ravaged in heavy trading, falling almost 20% to $16 during the early afternoon. \"The best dot.com can't make it, and that's troubling for the entire internet economy,\" one trader said. </p> <p>The Yahoo! warning said revenues during the current quarter would be $170m-$180m, against forecasts of $232m. Yahoo! had been regarded as one of the internet's biggest financial success sto ries, with revenue nearly doubling last year to \u00a31.1bn. </p> <p>But analysts have begun to question the very fundamentals of the Yahoo! model which relies heavily on advertising for revenues - some 90% of its total last year. The softening of the advertising market, particularly in the US, could hardly have come at a worse time for an industry still stumbling towards maturity. </p> <p>Yahoo!, along with other US internet portals, relied heavily on advertising from other dot.coms and has found itself in a vicious circle. Its European peers at least are less dependent. Merrill Lynch predicts that online advertising will grow by about 25% in Europe this year, compared with a flat performance in the US. </p> <p>The US also has further to fall. Estimates suggest that between $600m-$900m was spent on online advertising in Europe last year compared with $2bn in the US third quarter alone. </p> <p>Silicon Valley-based online technology news provider CNET Networks, communications equipment maker Tellabs and TIBCO Software all contributed to the despair yesterday with their own profit warnings. </p> <p>Not even the endorsement of one of the pioneers of the internet can see off the gloom. Loudcloud, the internet infrastructure firm co-founded by former Netscape executive Marc Andreessen, cut its offer price and raised the number of shares on offer in its imminent flotation. </p> <p>Yahoo! has now begun the search for a replacement for Mr Koogle, who will remain with the company as chairman. Last month, Fabiola Arredondo, chief executive of Yahoo! Europe also quit to pursue \"private business interests\". </p> <p>A chief executive, however, may not be the only new member of the Yahoo! board as rumours continued to circulate that the company may fall prey to a potential takeover or at least forge an alliance with a traditional media firm with some traditional media assets.

The French duo's 1997 debut album Homework was a record that genuinely changed things, introducing now-ubiquitous sounds and styles into pop. Twenty-something Parisians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo applied pilfered chunks of old disco records to harsh techno beats and robotic vocoded vocals. Homework sold well, and Bangalter's solo project Stardust reached Number One with the similarly styled Music Sounds Better With You, but more remarkable is the extent of Daft Punk's influence on the charts. In the last nine months, three number one singles have been deeply indebted to Homework's template: Spiller's Groovejet, Modjo's Lady and, most notably, Madonna's Music. </p> <p>And it's not just dance music that the duo have influenced, or at least been startlingly prescient about. Homework's sleeve loudly proclaimed Daft Punk's penchant for the bland, critically reviled \"soft rock\" of Peter Frampton and Andy Gibb. Four years on, East London's voguish clubs play just that, and Toploader's anodyne mid-1970s strumming sells millions. Daft Punk are never photographed unless heavily disguised (recently they've been modelling chrome robot helmets), but the solitary extant photo of the duo sans masks - taken in 1995 - features Bangalter in 1980s garb and Homem-Christo sporting a luxuriant mullet. It looks like a painfully hip fashion spread from last month's Face. Daft Punk's speciality is rehabilitating ideas long consigned to the dustbin of history, a cocksure Gallic disregard for the accepted canon of cool. </p> <p>Four years later, they're at it again. Discovery comes studded with the sort of finger-twiddling, pseudo-classical solos that aspiring heavy-metal guitarists spent the 1980s trying to perfect. It also offers pomp-rock keyboard runs of which Rick Wakeman would be proud, and the return of the smooth mid-Atlantic funk ballad, beloved of both Phil Collins and commercial local radio 15 years ago. </p> <p>The bad news is that, this time, the salvage operation doesn't work. Forthcoming single Aerodynamic illustrates its failings. There are pounding house beats, metal guitars, rococo synth flourishes and a Kraftwerk pastiche, but it all sounds disjointed and episodic. You can admire Daft Punk's desire to marry wildly differing musical cultures, and their disregard for the stultifying conformity of dance music, but it doesn't make Aerodynamic any more fun to listen to. </p> <p>Admittedly, Discovery's experiments occasionally come off. Nightvision condenses 10CC's breathy chart-topper I'm Not in Love into 90 seconds of rather lovely instrumental drifting. And Short Circuit begins like an early 1980s breakdance favourite, corrodes into distorted noise and manages to sound both wildly funky and slightly disturbing. </p> <p>But worryingly, most of Discovery's best tracks - hit single One More Time, vocal-house closer Too Long, the relentless Superheroes - are those that stick closest to Homework's filtered disco blueprint. And what are we to make of Veridis Quo, which sounds like the incidental music from one of Channel Five's erotic thrillers, or Something About Us, featuring Bangalter's Clouseau-accented vocals over antiseptic synthesisers and Level 42 bass? </p> <p>One dance-music magazine has already proclaimed Discovery \"the greatest album ever\", but there's the lingering suspicion that if Something About Us were the work of Mike and the Mechanics rather than two trendy French blokes wearing \"ironic\" robot helmets, everyone would think it was rubbish. </p> <p>In an era of guileless, style-less music, when earnest men in casual dress and the blandest of rock cliches rule, it seems almost churlish to condemn an album for prizing style over content or invention over end result. Most of Discovery probably sounded like a good idea at the time, but there's not much point in having ideas if they don't work. At worst, Discovery is less a record than a hypothesis. At best - like a lot of other records these days - it just sounds like Daft Punk's first album.</p>",

      "bodyText": "French media giant Vivendi Universal is sticking to its ambitious growth targets despite reporting maiden results below analysts' expectations. Jean-Marie Messier, the group's colourful chief executive, said the group had \"enormous growth opportunities\". \"We are ideally positioned to provide the global consumer with seamless connectivity and competitively superior content and services - anywhere, anytime and over any device or platform,\" said Mr Messier. But investors still harbour doubts about the company's ability to mould its extensive telecoms, film, music, internet and TV assets into an all-conquering media force. Vivendi today reported an operating profit of \u00a31.63bn, below analysts' estimates of \u00a31.67bn. However, investors will be more interested in the pledges behind the figures, with Mr Messier reaffirming his belief that pre-tax earnings would leap 35% by 2002 and revenues would rise 10% in 2001 and 2002. \"The company's unique combination of content and distribution assets paves the way for enormous growth opportunities,\" added Mr Messier. Vivendi Universal includes the Canal Plus pay-TV station, the Cegetel telecoms company, Universal Pictures and Universal Music. Vivendi took on the Universal brand when it merged with Canadian company Seagram late last year in a \u00a350bn deal. However, the group's shares have slipped 20% since the deal was struck, as investors voiced doubts over Vivendi's ability to knit the new company together. Today's figures show that Universal Music and Universal Pictures had a bumper 12 months, with earnings at the music division rising 16% and the film operation taking over \u00a3680m at the box office. The Canal Plus subsidiary brushed off concerns over its subscriber base by reporting a 32% increase in the number of European subscribers to 5.3m. Although Canal's full figures were not immediately available, the company strenuously denied reports its losses were widening. Canal Plus said 2001 would mark \"a substantial increase in 2001 EBIT [earnings before interest and tax], operating profit and net profit.\" Vivendi devoted surprisingly little time to its Vizzavi mobile internet service in its results presentation and repeated its target of 2m customers by this summer. The joint venture with UK mobile phone giant Vodafone is a core part of Vivendi's future strategy, where a potential audience of 90m consumers will access the group's content. Vizzavi is a pan-European internet operation, but analysts want Vivendi to bolster by joining with an internet service provider. Yahoo! is currently the hot favourite following its recent struggles.",

A \u00a31m advertising campaign for the bus company Arriva will feature an attractive young couple engaging in a passionate kiss on the top deck of a bus. When the woman asks provocatively, \"Your place or mine?\", destinations including \"work\", \"cinema\", \"your place\" and \"his place\" flash across the screen. The advert, part of the company's \"Going your way\" campaign, was created by Arriva's advertising agency Cogent. It will be screened at cinemas across the north-east of England from today. Sunderland-based Arriva, one of the largest providers of passenger transport in Europe, hopes to extend the campaign to the rest of the country. Celia Johnson kissing Trevor Howard on a station platform in the classic film Brief Encounter has helped imbue train travel with a certain romance. But the humble bus has never claimed to have a glamorous image. \"Encouraging people to start thinking about and using our services is the next step in our business development,\" said Steve Clayton, managing director of Arriva UK Bus. Peter Huntley, director of transport consultancy the TAS partnership, said bus travel had been in decline since 1956. \"While as a whole we are all making more journeys, there has been no real growth in the bus industry,\" he said. \"However, over the last four years, figures have become more stable and we can put this down to effective marketing campaigns. \"The main attraction of bus travel is that it is cheap. With an increase in bus lanes, using it to get into a city centre when parking is bad is another major benefit. \"One of the biggest downsides is time - people don't want to stand for 20 minutes at a bus stop in the middle of nowhere. \"If they know they can rely on a bus turning up on time, the battle is won,\" he said.",

Well, you can beat them as well, repeatedly in the face with a heavy plank of decorative hardwood, but no liberal tea-time take on the world of football worth its salt would suggest doing that. Much better to follow the example of Neil Lennon, who today decided to play on for Northern Ireland despite being abused by oafs during the recent friendly against Norway, just because he plays for Celtic.</p> <p>\"Following lengthy consideration, I have decided that I wish to continue to play at international level with Northern Ireland,\" Lennon told his club's official website this morning. \"The level of support I have received from all sections of the community has been overwhelming and very touching and has played a major part in my decision,\" he went on, extremely reasonably when you think about it. </p> <p>Lennon, who \"urged\" supporters to come together and support the team in their upcoming World Cup qualifier with the Czech Republic, explained why his decision took so long. \"The decision I have made was not taken lightly as I felt it was important to consider the feelings of my family and friends as they had been through a very traumatic experience,\" he said. \"Obviously I hope that they and myself do not have to suffer under these circumstances again.\" The Fiver hopes Lennon's gracious statement will bring an end to this nasty episode, and that the only suffering experienced at Windsor Park from now on will be by fans watching their team go down by the usual three-goal margin.</p> <p><strong>SIT DOWN FOR YOUR RIGHTS</strong></p> <p>One of the keys to being a successful manager - as anyone who has ever devoured Moses on Management: 50 Leadership Lessons from the Greatest Manager of All Time will tell you - is to buffer the bad news with some good.

And before you know it, everybody has gone home happy. </p> <p>The Imperial Lord Ferg, being a successful manager, knows this. Which is why he spent the day warning Manchester United fans not to stand in seating areas at Old Trafford, while dropping subtle hints that he was on their side in the if-fans-stand-the-ground-could-be-closed debate. \"The club has shown great vision in building a stadium which holds 67,000 and if it comes to a situation where this has to be reduced, this would affect the team,\" he thundered. \"We're talking about a loss of seats if this threat is carried out and the fans have to pay heed to this.\"</p> <p>A loss of seats! Perish the thought! But just as the Fiver was wondering whether Ferg could be a stooge of Trafford councillor Barry Brotherton, the man with the power to close Old Trafford, Ferg's management skills began to show. \"It would be great in the future if we could have standing areas and I think I speak for all football fans and all football clubs,\" he suddenly admitted, causing the Fiver's empathy chakra to tingle warmly. \"As a club we would welcome this as would every other club and every other fan.\" Unfortunately, it was at this point that Ferg bottled out completely by admitting: \"But I'm sorry, it's unfortunate this law is in place and you have to change the law before you can do anything.\" Still, as a display of good management practice, his performance can't be beat.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Personally, I think Anne 'The Sphinx' Robinson must be the most repulsive and obnoxious person ever to set foot on earth. She has no redeeming features. She is seriously ugly and if the BBC does as it should and she is sacked, she could start a new career advertising shaving blades for men. She is Darwin's missing link.

One group has never hidden its nostalgia for Nazi German authoritarianism.\" Belgium has the highest number of immigrants per head in the European Union and the VB has been adept at stirring up racial intolerance as a result. During the second world war sections of the Flemish community also collaborated with the Nazis. Raes has a long history of close involvement with the far right in Europe and was for many years responsible for the Belgian distribution of a magazine called De Schakel which was edited in Argentina by former members of the Flemish SS.

      "bodyText": "One of Labour's most intelligent and least headline-obsessed ministers, Chris Smith, minister of culture since the start of the 1997 parliament, can seldom be faulted when making decisions on his own. But he has made less of a mark than was once expected. This can be attributed to pressure from the Treasury and other cabinet colleagues. His most notable decision came long before he took high office when, at a meeting in Rugby in 1984, he announced: \"My name is Chris Smith, I'm the Labour MP for Islington South and I'm gay,\" to a five-minute standing ovation. He later said: \"More is achieved for the sense of self worth of lesbians and gays in society by one person who comes out voluntarily than by 100 who are forced out.\" Because he does not like to land unnecessary partisan blows, he has no mass political fan club. However, he is widely admired outside Labour as a modernising, caring Christian socialist. A keen mountaineer, he was the first MP to conquer all 277 of the 3,000ft Munro mountains in Scotland; a success that encapsulates both his gentleness and his rigour. Still, Mr Smith can be battered about more than some cabinet ministers because he is in neither the Gordon Brown nor the Tony Blair camp. He fell out with the chancellor when serving as social security spokesman in opposition, and relations with Number 10 have deteriorated since the Camelot \"fat cats\" debacle. As a result, he often cannot secure extra Treasury funds for his pet causes - such as free museum access - or get the job he desires, probably in a high-spending department. Born to a civil servant and a teacher in Barnet in 1951, Mr Smith went from George Watson's college, Edinburgh, to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he gained a BA with first class honours and a PhD in Coleridge and Wordsworth ballads. Like countless others who later entered the Commons, he became president of the Cambridge Union and was chairman of the Fabians. At Cambridge, he also struck up a friendship with John Smith, leader of the Labour party from 1992 until his death in 1994. Mr Smith earned his living initially as development secretary at the Shaftesbury society, which provided sheltered housing for the elderly and disabled. He had a turbulent initiation into politics after being elected as an Islington councillor in 1978, losing his post as chief whip when rightwing Labour councillors defected to the SDP. He won his local seat, Islington South, in 1983, narrowly defeating SDP defector George Cunningham. In 1987, he held on to the seat by another tiny margin and must have been relieved in 1992, when his majority soared above 10,000 and remained the same in 1997. In parliament, Mr Smith rose through the ranks, shining as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury before 1992 and damaging the Tories as shadow health secretary before 1997. He had good cause to expect to take on that job after New Labour's election triumph but, instead, was handed unexpectedly the task of reforming the then Department of National Heritage. Since 1997 Mr Smith's local council has gone Lib Dem but there seems no reason why his seat should do so. Less certain is his ministerial future. After four quietly successful years at the Department of Culture, where he avoided becoming tainted with the calamity of the Millennium Dome (he opposed it), Mr Smith has neither fallen apart nor laid siege to the high offices of state. The prime minister may leave him in place for now, an easy sacrificial victim should a cabinet vacancy be required urgently in the years ahead.

When Romeo Gigli invited everyone to dine at his huge apartment, a huddle of London's fashionistas formed around the buffet table, piling their plates with massive balls of buffalo mozzarella. Hungry after a hard day on the front row, they restocked their plates again and again, not knowing that what was on offer was merely the antipasto. When they realised their food faux pas, they just about managed the soup (carrot, served in a carved-out crusty bap) and pasta, but hid around the corner on Gigli's impressive leather poufs when it came to desert - a selection of cakes so big they had their own annexe. </p> <p>The next night, with no major parties to attend, word went out to regroup in the Principe hotel bar. What started as a few glasses of kir royale turned into a drinks bill equivalent in cost to a Fendi fur. At the evening's high point (approx 1am), it was as if Sam Taylor Wood had been commissioned to photograph a tableau of everyone who wanted to be fabulous, as people from Gucci, McQueen, Armani and Prada gassed with every UK stylist and writer worth their salt. When the bar shut, the crowd dispersed, maybe first to crash UltraOzbek's impromptu party, then on to the room of Dazed and Confused editor Jefferson Hack. He has become quite a celebrity since he started dating Kate Moss, so everyone wanted to know, was she there? Was she modelling? The answers were obvious: no and no.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Milan, most foreign of the fashion destinations (no one really speaks English, there are never any taxis), the Brits always stick together. When Romeo Gigli invited everyone to dine at his huge apartment, a huddle of London's fashionistas formed around the buffet table, piling their plates with massive balls of buffalo mozzarella. Hungry after a hard day on the front row, they restocked their plates again and again, not knowing that what was on offer was merely the antipasto. When they realised their food faux pas, they just about managed the soup (carrot, served in a carved-out crusty bap) and pasta, but hid around the corner on Gigli's impressive leather poufs when it came to desert - a selection of cakes so big they had their own annexe. The next night, with no major parties to attend, word went out to regroup in the Principe hotel bar. What started as a few glasses of kir royale turned into a drinks bill equivalent in cost to a Fendi fur. At the evening's high point (approx 1am), it was as if Sam Taylor Wood had been commissioned to photograph a tableau of everyone who wanted to be fabulous, as people from Gucci, McQueen, Armani and Prada gassed with every UK stylist and writer worth their salt. When the bar shut, the crowd dispersed, maybe first to crash UltraOzbek's impromptu party, then on to the room of Dazed and Confused editor Jefferson Hack. He has become quite a celebrity since he started dating Kate Moss, so everyone wanted to know, was she there? Was she modelling? The answers were obvious: no and no.",

      "body": "<p>The former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson and the Europe minister, Keith Vaz, were today cleared of any improper conduct over the Hinduja passport affair by the Hammond inquiry into the case.</p> <p>Sir Anthony Hammond ruled that it was \"likely\" that Mr Mandelson telephoned immigration minister Mike O'Brien personally about Srichand Hinduja's bid for naturalisation, the crucial alleged call that eventually led to Mr Mandelson's resignation from the government in January.</p> <p>But Sir Anthony adds: \"Mr Mandelson's belief that he had not had a telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien was honestly held.\"</p> <p>The inquiry's main conclusion stated: \"No improper pressure was brought to bear by any minister in respect of these applications.\"</p> <p>And, the report says, \"there is no evidence\" of any connection between Mr Mandelson's contacts with the brothers over sponsorship of the Millennium Dome and their efforts to obtain naturalisation.</p> <p>Speaking outside his Hartlepool home, Mr Mandelson hailed the report by Sir Anthony, a leading QC, as a vindication of his behaviour. \"I am grateful to Sir Anthony for clearing my name and restoring my reputation.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Sir Anthony's report makes clear that I did not lie, I did not mislead, and I did not deceive.\"</p> <p>Mr Mandelson said he regretted that there had been a \"muddle\" in Whitehall, which had led to his resignation. But confirming that he intended to continue as an MP and focus on his Hartlepool constituents rather than attempting to return to the government, he added: \"I feel I can now draw a line underneath these events.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Scotland, the prime minister, Tony Blair, said: \"Peter has made it clear, and I have also made it clear, that there is no question of him coming back into government.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I've said all the way through that I think what is important is that the key allegation has been investigated thoroughly and has been found to be false.</p> <p>Mr Blair said that he believed Mr Mandelson was a man of great ability.

      "bodyText": "The former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson and the Europe minister, Keith Vaz, were today cleared of any improper conduct over the Hinduja passport affair by the Hammond inquiry into the case. Sir Anthony Hammond ruled that it was \"likely\" that Mr Mandelson telephoned immigration minister Mike O'Brien personally about Srichand Hinduja's bid for naturalisation, the crucial alleged call that eventually led to Mr Mandelson's resignation from the government in January. But Sir Anthony adds: \"Mr Mandelson's belief that he had not had a telephone conversation with Mr O'Brien was honestly held.\" The inquiry's main conclusion stated: \"No improper pressure was brought to bear by any minister in respect of these applications.\" And, the report says, \"there is no evidence\" of any connection between Mr Mandelson's contacts with the brothers over sponsorship of the Millennium Dome and their efforts to obtain naturalisation. Speaking outside his Hartlepool home, Mr Mandelson hailed the report by Sir Anthony, a leading QC, as a vindication of his behaviour. \"I am grateful to Sir Anthony for clearing my name and restoring my reputation.\" He added: \"Sir Anthony's report makes clear that I did not lie, I did not mislead, and I did not deceive.\" Mr Mandelson said he regretted that there had been a \"muddle\" in Whitehall, which had led to his resignation. But confirming that he intended to continue as an MP and focus on his Hartlepool constituents rather than attempting to return to the government, he added: \"I feel I can now draw a line underneath these events.\" Speaking in Scotland, the prime minister, Tony Blair, said: \"Peter has made it clear, and I have also made it clear, that there is no question of him coming back into government.\" He added: \"I've said all the way through that I think what is important is that the key allegation has been investigated thoroughly and has been found to be false. Mr Blair said that he believed Mr Mandelson was a man of great ability. And he added: \"I said to people right at the beginning that this was a tragic case, and I said I believed Peter would be cleared of any impropriety. And I am very pleased for his sake he has been and I hope he will be able to get on with rebuilding his life.\" But with Mr Mandelson's reputation cleared by the report there are bound to be questions over why a minister who had done nothing wrong and was one of Mr Blair's closest allies, was forced to quit. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP whose investigations triggered the inquiry, said many questions remained unanswered. He said: \"We need to examine the ministerial code to see what improvements can be made.\" As the affair broke, Mr Mandelson maintained he had no personal involvement in Srichand's case, a line that was repeated to MPs by the culture secretary, Chris Smith. Mr Straw then reminded Mr Mandelson of the phone call, and also told Mr Blair he had done so. An early morning meeting in Mr Blair's Downing Street flat on January 24, attended by the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, and the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, appears to have sealed Mr Mandelson's fate. Mr Mandelson offered his resignation later that day, accepting he should have made clear the phone call had taken place. The Hammond inquiry, set up by Mr Blair , found that intelligence material about the wealthy Hinduja brothers - linked to an arms bribes scandal in India - was not passed to the home office. And Sir Anthony says record keeping in ministers' private offices was \"unsatisfactory\" and needed shaking up, as does the procedure for monitoring telephone calls. The home secretary, Jack Straw, promised to act on Sir Anthony's recommendations and said the affair had been \"a personal tragedy\" for his highly respected \"colleague and friend\". Despite Mr Mandelson's comment that he did \"not desire a return to government\", bookmakers William Hill responded to the Hammond report by cutting the odds on him being re-appointed to the cabinet within five years from 7/1 to 5/1.

      "body": "<p>When Peter Mandelson's lawyer, Jonathan Caplan, protested yesterday that his client would have a good legal case for suing the government for constructive dismissal, he had clearly had time to read the Hammond report in full.</p> <p>It was a fair point. Sir Anthony Hammond concluded that Mr Mandelson - \"consistent and frank\" - had not lied about his recollections of the phone call he made (or didn't) to Mike O'Brien, the immigration minister in 1998. He also reported that no impropriety took place with regard to either the Hinduja brothers' \u00a31 million donation to the Greenwich Dome - or the phone call (or not) about the prospects for SP Hinduja getting his British passport.</p> <p> So why was the Northern Ireland secretary hurriedly forced to resign from Tony Blair's cabinet for the second time? That, too, is a good question, so good that neither the prime minister nor his press office was prepared to answer it yesterday.</p> <p> Instead they praised him as a man of ability who had done nothing wrong and must now be allowed to rebuild his life and career, not least as the Labour MP for Hartlepool, they added. It was said with every appearance of sorrow - the word tragedy was used - but the underlying implication was brutal: no way back for Peter, the man who, as much as anyone, put Blair where he is today.</p> <p> In fact, the Hammond report is not so blandly evasive as the first glance suggests. It is true, as the No 10 press office stresses, that he was asked to inquire into the allegations (\"tantamount to corruption\" said Mr Blair) that the Dome link amounted to cash-for-passports.</p> <p> But he does raise awkward questions over what ministers and officials did both in 1998 - when both Dome and passport were at issue - and in the weeks, days and hours leading up to Mandelson's dismissal (\"resignation\" is a euphemism) on January 24 2001.</p> <p> \"Muddle\" is the kindest word deployed by Sir Wally - as his cricketing colleagues call him - as he accepts that everyone had acted honourably. Yet it is more complicated than that. The report accepts that Mr Mandelson \"probably\" did talk to Mr O'Brien about SP Hinduja's passport hopes, but says that does not amount to making \"representations\" on his behalf. Less charitable readers might assume that any phone call from such a source was a formidable \"representation\", no matter how little was said.</p> <p> Surprisingly, he also sets out a letter Mr Mandelson, by now the rehabilitated Ulster secretary, sent to Jack Straw, about the third Hinduja brother, Prakash, in May 2000. He wanted - and got - a British passport too. No \"representation\", Sir Wally again decided. Yet he also reports irregularities in the normal procedures which govern passport decisions. The brothers had been rejected in 1998, partly because of the \"good character\" question (the Bofers bribery scandal in their native India), partly because they did not spend enough time in Britain. </p> <p> In 1998, SP Hinduja was specifically in breach of an \"unwaivable requirement\" - to have been in Britain five years to the day before his application. But he got the passport. Luckily, busy officials had also forgotten to check with the foreign office's South Asia desk if there had been developments in the Bofers investigation: there had.</p> <p> There are other intriguing strands. One official in Mr O'Brien's office claimed that Mr Mandelson regarded his chat with her boss as \"private\", a claim with sinister overtones which was emphatically denied by Mandelson staff. </p> <p> One the other side of the muddle, Mr Mandelson was led to believe by both Mr O'Brien and Alastair Campbell, the No 10 press spokesman, when the trio spoke on a \"conference call\" on January 22, that there was documentary proof that the fateful call took place.</p> <p> There wasn't as it turned out and, in any case, Mr Mandelson's belief on that point is challenged by the other two. It turned out to be crucial. Mr Campbell believed as a result that Mr Mandelson accepted that the call did take place and sought no further proof. Mr Mandelson assumed that proof existed. </p> <p> So they all drifted closer to the edge - and he fell over. By the time the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, had given Mr Blair his own summary (Annexe P in the report) several bits of muddle had conspired to make the prime minister assume his old chum was covering something up - as he had in not revealing his \u00a3374,000 home loan in 1998.</p> <p> Sir Richard's memo is revealing in that it acknowledges a \"slippery slope\" - passports for help with the Dome - but backs the view that a phone call does not constitute supporting a passport application or making \"representations\". </p> <p>\"Not a shred of evidence of impropriety,\" Sir Richard told the PM who nonetheless got rid of Mr Mandelson within 12 hours. Curious or what?

      "bodyText": "When Peter Mandelson's lawyer, Jonathan Caplan, protested yesterday that his client would have a good legal case for suing the government for constructive dismissal, he had clearly had time to read the Hammond report in full. It was a fair point. Sir Anthony Hammond concluded that Mr Mandelson - \"consistent and frank\" - had not lied about his recollections of the phone call he made (or didn't) to Mike O'Brien, the immigration minister in 1998. He also reported that no impropriety took place with regard to either the Hinduja brothers' \u00a31 million donation to the Greenwich Dome - or the phone call (or not) about the prospects for SP Hinduja getting his British passport. So why was the Northern Ireland secretary hurriedly forced to resign from Tony Blair's cabinet for the second time? That, too, is a good question, so good that neither the prime minister nor his press office was prepared to answer it yesterday. Instead they praised him as a man of ability who had done nothing wrong and must now be allowed to rebuild his life and career, not least as the Labour MP for Hartlepool, they added. It was said with every appearance of sorrow - the word tragedy was used - but the underlying implication was brutal: no way back for Peter, the man who, as much as anyone, put Blair where he is today. In fact, the Hammond report is not so blandly evasive as the first glance suggests. It is true, as the No 10 press office stresses, that he was asked to inquire into the allegations (\"tantamount to corruption\" said Mr Blair) that the Dome link amounted to cash-for-passports. But he does raise awkward questions over what ministers and officials did both in 1998 - when both Dome and passport were at issue - and in the weeks, days and hours leading up to Mandelson's dismissal (\"resignation\" is a euphemism) on January 24 2001. \"Muddle\" is the kindest word deployed by Sir Wally - as his cricketing colleagues call him - as he accepts that everyone had acted honourably. Yet it is more complicated than that. The report accepts that Mr Mandelson \"probably\" did talk to Mr O'Brien about SP Hinduja's passport hopes, but says that does not amount to making \"representations\" on his behalf. Less charitable readers might assume that any phone call from such a source was a formidable \"representation\", no matter how little was said. Surprisingly, he also sets out a letter Mr Mandelson, by now the rehabilitated Ulster secretary, sent to Jack Straw, about the third Hinduja brother, Prakash, in May 2000. He wanted - and got - a British passport too. No \"representation\", Sir Wally again decided. Yet he also reports irregularities in the normal procedures which govern passport decisions. The brothers had been rejected in 1998, partly because of the \"good character\" question (the Bofers bribery scandal in their native India), partly because they did not spend enough time in Britain. In 1998, SP Hinduja was specifically in breach of an \"unwaivable requirement\" - to have been in Britain five years to the day before his application. But he got the passport. Luckily, busy officials had also forgotten to check with the foreign office's South Asia desk if there had been developments in the Bofers investigation: there had. There are other intriguing strands. One official in Mr O'Brien's office claimed that Mr Mandelson regarded his chat with her boss as \"private\", a claim with sinister overtones which was emphatically denied by Mandelson staff. One the other side of the muddle, Mr Mandelson was led to believe by both Mr O'Brien and Alastair Campbell, the No 10 press spokesman, when the trio spoke on a \"conference call\" on January 22, that there was documentary proof that the fateful call took place. There wasn't as it turned out and, in any case, Mr Mandelson's belief on that point is challenged by the other two. It turned out to be crucial. Mr Campbell believed as a result that Mr Mandelson accepted that the call did take place and sought no further proof. Mr Mandelson assumed that proof existed. So they all drifted closer to the edge - and he fell over. By the time the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson, had given Mr Blair his own summary (Annexe P in the report) several bits of muddle had conspired to make the prime minister assume his old chum was covering something up - as he had in not revealing his \u00a3374,000 home loan in 1998. Sir Richard's memo is revealing in that it acknowledges a \"slippery slope\" - passports for help with the Dome - but backs the view that a phone call does not constitute supporting a passport application or making \"representations\". \"Not a shred of evidence of impropriety,\" Sir Richard told the PM who nonetheless got rid of Mr Mandelson within 12 hours. Curious or what? But so is the role of Jack Straw, the home secretary, whose past as a have-a-go-hero, tackling muggers in his constituency, is here relived in the role of Mandelson-tackler. At several crucial moments Mr Straw's intervention ensured that Mr Blair and Mr Campbell were left in no doubt that the O'Brien phone calls took place and that he - Mr Straw - had recently reminded Mr Mandelson of the fact, not once but twice. All in all a field day for conspiracy theorists who will see Mr Straw as Mr Mandelson's chief rival to be the next foreign secretary. Mr Blair wants to put it all aside and move on to the election campaign. He will be lucky.

      "body": "<p>Peter Mandelson has lost the battle to win his way back into the government despite today's Home Office report into the Hinduja passport affair, which will acquit him of lying to Downing Street about his role.</p> <p>As Sir Anthony Hammond's report was received by No 10 - ready for publication at 9.30 this morning - sources made clear that Tony Blair will not give the man who was his closest political intimate a third chance in government.</p> <p>\"It's harsh, but it's inevitable. Peter is different,\" one senior insider warned as the Mandelson camp predicted that the Hammond report will contain nothing that justifies the sudden dismissal of the then Northern Ireland secretary on January 24.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson, who will spend today in his Hartlepool constituency, is pessimistic that the report will be strong enough to persuade the Blair camp to admit publicly that they panicked and were wrong to demand his resignation.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson will make a short statement today, but it is not clear what his next move can be. No 10 will argue that the wider background - including his resignation over the \u00a3374,000 home loan in 1998 - was crucial to Mr Blair's decision andbelieves the controversy will quickly fade.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson's best hope is that Mr Blair will be willing to restate that he is a man of integrity, an endorsement he badly needs if he is to continue as a significant player in public life. The prime minister's aides have warned him he will be too damaged if he admits a fundamental error of judgment so close to the likely May 3 election.</p> <p>Instead, Mr Blair will today use a speech in Inverness to try to move the agenda towards the big economic picture of the Britain voters want to see.</p> <p>Insiders on both sides of the passport dispute last night played down speculation that the prime minister will be exposed to implicit criticism for discounting advice from the intelligence service, MI6, on the character of the Hindujas, controversial Indian millionaires engulfed in an arms-dealing controversy in Delhi.</p> <p>Tory ex-ministers say Sir Anthony will show how MI6 would have steered Labour away from accepting their \u00a31m gift to the Millennium Dome's faith zone in 1998, shortly before S J Hinduja finally got his British passport.</p> <p>One Downing Street source said: \"That is the single issue we are most worried about.\" As minister for the dome in June 1998, Mr Mandelson courted the Hindujas and also made inquiries through his private office about S J's chances of obtaining a passport, either indirectly through officials or in a brief talk with Mike O'Brien, then immigration minister.</p> <p>At that stage he did not know about MI6's doubts about the Hindujas, though he was briefed in October when he entered the cabinet as trade secretary. Though it enhanced his caution, the report will say, it was not enough to pull out of the faith zone deal.</p> <p>Sir Anthony will say the crucial phone call over the passport probably took place as Mr O'Brien recalls, but will not accuse Mr Mandelson of lying about it, as Jack Straw, the home secretary, later suggested on TV.</p> <p>The Hammond report, drawn up after interviews with most of the key players - notably the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson - will not pass judgment on whether or not Mr Blair was right to force Mr Mandelson's resignation.</p> <p>One Mandelson supporter predicted: \"It's going to be like a piece of modern art; it says whatever the person who is viewing it brings to it.\" But he added: \"If Blair knew then what he will know from the report, would he still ask Peter to resign? The answer must be no.\"</p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/\">Special report: Mandelson</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449014,00.html\">09.09.2001: Mandelson cleared over passports row</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449038,00.html\">09.03.2001: Vaz cleared over Hinduja affair</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449071,00.html\">09.03.2001: Questions left unanswered by Hammond Inquiry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,449016,00.html\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430254,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430250,00.html\">29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430189,00.html\">29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,430167,00.html\">29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,429979,00.html\">28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0309mandelson.ra\">09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry report (2mins 36)</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/graphic/0,7367,428461,00.html\">Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7ffde\">Have your say on the Mandelson affair</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/01/28/stifocnws02001.html\" target=\"_new\">Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageId=3284\" target=\"_new\">Downing Street press briefing</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson has lost the battle to win his way back into the government despite today's Home Office report into the Hinduja passport affair, which will acquit him of lying to Downing Street about his role. As Sir Anthony Hammond's report was received by No 10 - ready for publication at 9.30 this morning - sources made clear that Tony Blair will not give the man who was his closest political intimate a third chance in government. \"It's harsh, but it's inevitable. Peter is different,\" one senior insider warned as the Mandelson camp predicted that the Hammond report will contain nothing that justifies the sudden dismissal of the then Northern Ireland secretary on January 24. Mr Mandelson, who will spend today in his Hartlepool constituency, is pessimistic that the report will be strong enough to persuade the Blair camp to admit publicly that they panicked and were wrong to demand his resignation. Mr Mandelson will make a short statement today, but it is not clear what his next move can be. No 10 will argue that the wider background - including his resignation over the \u00a3374,000 home loan in 1998 - was crucial to Mr Blair's decision andbelieves the controversy will quickly fade. Mr Mandelson's best hope is that Mr Blair will be willing to restate that he is a man of integrity, an endorsement he badly needs if he is to continue as a significant player in public life. The prime minister's aides have warned him he will be too damaged if he admits a fundamental error of judgment so close to the likely May 3 election. Instead, Mr Blair will today use a speech in Inverness to try to move the agenda towards the big economic picture of the Britain voters want to see. Insiders on both sides of the passport dispute last night played down speculation that the prime minister will be exposed to implicit criticism for discounting advice from the intelligence service, MI6, on the character of the Hindujas, controversial Indian millionaires engulfed in an arms-dealing controversy in Delhi. Tory ex-ministers say Sir Anthony will show how MI6 would have steered Labour away from accepting their \u00a31m gift to the Millennium Dome's faith zone in 1998, shortly before S J Hinduja finally got his British passport. One Downing Street source said: \"That is the single issue we are most worried about.\" As minister for the dome in June 1998, Mr Mandelson courted the Hindujas and also made inquiries through his private office about S J's chances of obtaining a passport, either indirectly through officials or in a brief talk with Mike O'Brien, then immigration minister. At that stage he did not know about MI6's doubts about the Hindujas, though he was briefed in October when he entered the cabinet as trade secretary. Though it enhanced his caution, the report will say, it was not enough to pull out of the faith zone deal. Sir Anthony will say the crucial phone call over the passport probably took place as Mr O'Brien recalls, but will not accuse Mr Mandelson of lying about it, as Jack Straw, the home secretary, later suggested on TV. The Hammond report, drawn up after interviews with most of the key players - notably the cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson - will not pass judgment on whether or not Mr Blair was right to force Mr Mandelson's resignation. One Mandelson supporter predicted: \"It's going to be like a piece of modern art; it says whatever the person who is viewing it brings to it.\" But he added: \"If Blair knew then what he will know from the report, would he still ask Peter to resign? The answer must be no.\" Special reports Special report: Mandelson New Labour in power Related articles 09.09.2001: Mandelson cleared over passports row 09.03.2001: Vaz cleared over Hinduja affair 09.03.2001: Questions left unanswered by Hammond Inquiry 09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry 29.01.2001, analysis: How Mandelson and Campbell came to blows 29.01.2001, analysis: 'I think Peter has been slightly detached' 29.01.2001, leader: Spinning out of control 29.01.2001, Roy Hattersley: Why the passing of Peter isn't very important 28.01.2001, Andrew Rawnsley: Why he really had to go 25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins 25.01.2001, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: I'm Mandy, fire me Audio 09.03.2001: Mandelson's response to Hammond Inquiry report (2mins 36) 24.01.2001: Peter Mandelson's resignation statement Photo gallery Peter Mandelson: a life in pictures Cartoon Steve Bell on life without Peter Mandelson The 1998 home loan row Text of resignation letter 24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan 24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Talk about it Have your say on the Mandelson affair Useful links Peter Mandelson: Why I had to go - Sunday Times, 28.01.2001 24.01.2001: Full text of Mandelson's resignation statement Hinduja group history Downing Street press briefing Hartlepool Mail",

      "bodyText": "No evidence exists of any \"improper relationship\" between the Europe minister Keith Vaz and the multi-millionaire Hinduja brothers, the Hammond Inquiry announced today. The Inquiry report concludes that Mr Vaz made representations on behalf of Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja, but said they were in the context of many other immigration and nationality cases in which he made representations. Mr Vaz has consistently said he acted as a prominent member of the Asian community and insisted he did nothing improper in asking the Home Office when Mr Hinduja's application was likely to be decided. Sir Anthony Hammond's report says Mr Vaz \"categorically denied\" that he had discussed the brothers' possible extradition to India over the Bofors scandal at any meeting with them. He also denies passing secrets to them and said he would have referred them to the Foreign Office if they had raised the issue. The report says there is no evidence that Mr Vaz had written to the prime minister or Peter Mandelson about the brothers' applications for naturalisation. It says the MP made inquiries on behalf of both brothers, particularly Gopichand Hinduja. \"It is true that Mr Vaz was probably more vigorous in his representative role than most of the other people who made representations. \"But I believe that it is legitimate to view Mr Vaz's role in the context of his unique position in the Asian community,\" the report says. \"I have been able to find nothing improper in his relations with the Home Office over these matters.\" Sir Anthony said the Home Office official to which Mr Vaz had written and spoken to about the case had not felt he was put under \"improper pressure\".

      "bodyText": "President George Bush has made it clear that he is not interested in continuing the Clinton administration's policy of cautious detente with North Korea. The change comes as China says it is increasing its defence spending because it believes that the Washington is hardening its stance in favour of Taiwan. Mr Bush made his position known during talks at the White House on Wednesday with the president of South Korea, Kim Dae-jung, who favours detente and hoped to win Mr Bush's backing for his \"sunshine policy\" towards the communist regime in the north. But Mr Bush told Mr Kim that he had no plans to resume discussing missiles with North Korea in the foreseeable future. This marks a sharp change from Mr Clinton's two-year effort to head off a threatened military build-up in the north and work towards the restoration of normal relations between Washington and Pyongyang. Mr Bush's stance has stirred speculation in Washington that he wants to freeze out North Korea to justify his government's planned national missile defence (NMD) shield. The justification offered for NMD in 1999 was that the US faced a threat from North Korea's missile programme. As well as delivering a serious blow to Mr Kim's efforts to negotiate a broad peace between the two Koreas, Mr Bush appeared to put him at odds with his own secretary of state, Colin Powell, who said on Tuesday that he hoped \"to pick up where President Clinton and his administration left off\". But Mr Powell emerged from the Bush-Kim meeting calling Pyongyang \"a threat\" whose intentions nobody should be naive about. The president's uncompromising position towards North Korea is a sign that the hardliners around him - including on this issue the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice - have gained the upper hand in policy-making towards the region. In a speech last year Ms Rice called North Korea \"the road kill of history\". She was behind the Bush administration's recent decision to reintroduce the term \"rogue states\", which the Clinton administration dropped in its final year. Before Mr Kim arrived in Washington his advisers argued that North Korea might retreat to its earlier isolationist positions if it concluded that the Bush administration was dropping the policy of engagement. Mr Clinton had hoped to make a landmark visit to Pyongyang at the end of his presidency to meet the northern leader, Kim Jong-il. Last week he said he would almost certainly have made this visit had it not been for the 36-day dispute over the outcome of the presidential election. After meeting Kim Dae-jong this week, Mr Bush said he was \"concerned about the fact that the North Koreans are shipping arms around the world\". \"We want to make sure that their ability to develop and spread weapons of mass destruction was in fact stopped and that we could verify that in fact they had stopped it,\" he said. \"We're not certain as to whether or not they're keeping all terms of all agreements.\" There is one agreement between the US and North Korea there is one agreement, the 1994 accord which ended Pyongyang's processing of plutonium at a suspected nuclear weapons plant. US officials told the New York Times yesterday that there was no evidence that North Korea was violating the terms of this agreement. Washington's harder stance against North Korea became apparent just after China announced this week that it would increase its defence spending by 17.7% to cope with what it described as \"drastic changes\" in the global military balance. In a speech on Tuesday, the finance minister, Xiang Huaicheng, unveiled plans for China's biggest increase in military spending in real terms for 20 years. He said this was \"to meet the drastic changes in the military situation around the world and prepare for defence and combat given the conditions of modern technology, especially high technology.\" China's military spending has been growing for several years; last year's announced increase was more than 12%. Officially, the lastest rise will would make the country's total defence budget $17.2bn (\u00a311.5bn) next year, compared with Mr Bush's requested Pentagon budget for 2002 of $310bn. But experts believe that China keeps most of its military spending secret, and that the real figure is more like $70bn-$80bn. Whatever the realities of the spending, this week's Beijing announcement serves to pass the message that China believes it must prepare for a coming conflict with the US over Taiwan, whose independent status many in the administration wish to protect with a sea and space based missile shield.",

      "bodyText": "The controversial anti-obesity drug Orlistat should be prescribed on the NHS, a government body ruled today. However, patients in England and Wales will only receive the drug if they fulfil criteria laid down by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (Nice). Adults must have lost at 2.5kg by dieting and exercise in the month prior to receiving the first prescription of Orlistat, which is traded under the name Xenical. They must also have a body mass index (their weight in kg divided by their height in metres squared) of at least 28 and have another serious illness such as diabetes or high blood pressure, or have a BMI of 30 with no other associated illnesses. Nice estimate that the recommendations will mean 11,000 more people in England and Wales will be prescribed the drug at a cost to the NHS of \u00a312m a year. Professor Peter Littlejohns, clinical director of Nice, said: \"Today's guidance is another example of how Nice can help doctors and patients be clear about the value and appropriate use of a new medicine. \"Obesity has a major impact on a person's physical, social and emotional wellbeing and future health. \"Doctors and patients need to work together to manage this condition and today's guidance provides advice on the contribution which Orlistat can make.\" The drug is the first anti-obesity treatment that does not work by suppressing appetite. Instead it works in the gut by impairing the digestion of fats and stopping their passage into the bloodstream. The capsules are taken three times a day with meals and clinical trials have shown it to be highly effective in helping people lose weight. One in five adults in the UK are classed as obese and 30,000 people die prematurely every year partly as a result of chronic weight problems.

The long-running series proved a popular alternative to a diet of football on BBC1, where the evening schedule comprised a two-hour broadcast of Liverpool's quarter-final Uefa Cup match against Porto. Peak Practice's ratings reached 7.8m, 400,000 more than in its previous Tuesday evening slot, helped by a lead-in from Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. The ever-popular quiz show attracted over 10m viewers to give it a 42% share, according to unofficial overnight figures. By contrast the BBC's Match of the Day, shown between 8pm and 9pm, brought in just 6.4m viewers to give it an average share of 27%. The lead-in from Peak Practice also helped ITV's Ten O'Clock News attract more than 1m more viewers than the BBC's version. Elsewhere, the viewers who tuned in to the return of Crossroads at the beginning of the week appear to be drifting away. The lunchtime broadcast brought in 1.5m viewers, down from 1.7m on Wednesday while the early evening showing attracted 2.5m viewers, down from 2.8m. BBC2, forced to find a last-minute replacement for its planned broadcast from the cancelled Crufts dog show, nevertheless turned in a respectable performance.

Following the success of the movie, the most profitable non-English language film ever, Lee has revealed that Crouching Tiger 2 will focus on the high-kicking warriors played by Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh in the original. According to Page Six.com, the film will be a prequel to the ten-time Oscar nominee. \"It would be very expensive, everybody's going to charge me five times as much,\" said Lee. \"We got all the equipment for half price. When we went on location, they thought we were a TV crew. That's not going to happen again.\" Yeoh, recently honoured at the annual ShoWest convention in Las Vegas as international star of the year, said it was the emotional impact of the film which explained its success. \"Crouching Tiger shows that it doesn't matter what the period is, it doesn't matter what the language is, as long as it reaches out to people, it will be successful.\" Lee has two other projects to complete before he can think about shooting the prequel. One is a feature film version of the Incredible Hulk (see earlier story), while the other is a biopic of Harry Houdini. \u0095 For more on Michelle Yeoh. \u0095 For more on Chow Yun-Fat.",

      "bodyText": "I am grateful to Sir Anthony Hammond for this thorough and comprehensive report which requires careful and considered reading. I have read it with a great sense of gratitude and considerable relief. These are Sir Anthony's key findings in relation to my actions: In respect of the passport application, Sir Anthony found: \u0095 that \"Mr Mandelson behaved perfectly properly\" \u0095 that \"Mr Mandelson did not try to influence Mr O'Brien or his officials at any point and did not make representations on behalf of Mr Hinduja's application\" In respect of sponsorship of the Dome, Sir Anthony found: \u0095 that \"Ministers generally and Mr Mandelson, in particular, acted correctly\" In respect of briefing the Observer newspaper, Sir Anthony states: \u0095 that \"I do not believe Mr Mandelson was seeking to be evasive\" In respect of the whole chain of events, Sir Anthony found: \u0095 that \"I do not believe that Mr Mandelson has tried to deceive anyone during the course of these events\" \u0095 that \"Throughout his evidence to me, Mr Mandelson has been consistent and frank\" He found: \u0095 that there was \"no reason to doubt Mr Mandelson's honesty throughout this period\" In sum, Sir Anthony's report establishes that I did not lie; that I did not deceive; that I did not set out to mislead. I am grateful to Sir Anthony for clearing my name and restoring my reputation. This was indeed a muddle rather than a misrepresentation and I would like to say how much I regret the part I played in creating this muddle. I feel I can now draw a line under these events. I intend to concentrate on winning back the full trust of my Hartlepool constituents and serving in Parliament for another term. For reasons I hope people will understand, I do not desire a return to government. There are more ways to serve New Labour and to fulfil our ambitions for the country and that is what I intend to do.

      "bodyText": "Nato yesterday agreed to allow Serb forces into the buffer zone between Kosovo and Macedonia amid alarm in the west about the activities of Albanian extremists threatening to engulf the Balkans in a new crisis. Growing tension in the region, notably along the border with Macedonia, overcame American reluctance to allow the Serbs to enter part of the three-mile deep \"ground safety zone\" along the border with Kosovo, European diplomats said. In Washington, fresh doubts emerged about the long-term commitment of the Bush administration to Nato's peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans. At a press conference with Nato secretary general Lord Robertson, the Pentagon secretary Donald Rumsfeld notably adopted a more cautious tone on US commitments in the Balkans than recent remarks by the secretary of state, Colin Powell. In contrast to Mr Powell, who told Nato ministers two weeks ago that the US and its European allies \"went in together and we'll come out together\", Mr Rumsfeld said Nato faced \"a difficult job\" in the Balkans and refused several invitations by journalists to commit the US to \"stay the course\" in Kosovo. There was a marked contrast between his downbeat comments and those of Lord Robertson, who called Nato's Kosovo peacekeeping role \"a commitment we intend to see through\". Access to a narrow strip of land - where Serbia meets Macedonia and Kosovo - has been restricted to Serb paramilitary and border guard units armed only with light weapons. Talks are continuing between Nato and Yugoslavia about a phased reduction of the zone which was imposed by Nato at the end of the Kosovo war in 1999. Over the past few days, ethnic Albanian insurgents have killed three Yugoslav officers in the Presevo Valley in Serbia and three Macedonian soldiers. They have used the zone to smuggle arms and men. Macedonian troops and ethnic Albanian guerrillas clashed for two days this week in the Macedonian village of Tanusevci, just across the border from Kosovo, and on Wednesday, American peacekeepers in Kosovo were engaged in a firefight with gun men in the adjoining village of Mijak on the Kosovo side of the border. Macedonian troops yesterday drove Albanian gunmen from their stronghold on the border with Kosovo, the defence ministry said. American troops in the area confirmed that the insurgents had fled, taking weapons with them. The fighting started before dawn near Tanusevci when about 50 Albanian guerrillas attacked Macedonian troops, unleashing horses ahead of them to check for mines, defence ministry spokesman, Blagoja Markovci said. Lord Robertson said the alliance \"is determined that those extremist elements seeking to sow instability or to advance their political agenda by violent means will be stopped, whether in southern Serbia, Macedonia or within Kosovo.\" Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica yesterday accepted the Nato plan to allow Serb forces into parts of the buffer zone. At his monthly press conference, he also delivered a bitter attack on Nato, saying its peacekeeping force in the Serbian province of Kosovo had produced \"disastrous\" results. He accused K-For of failing to disarm ethnic Albanian guerrillas and of \"stimulating instead of curbing\" aspirations of a Greater Albania because it was too concerned about protecting its own troops rather than local people. \"Is Nato a military or a humanitarian organisation? What's the reason for its presence there?\" he asked. The Macedonian foreign minister, Srgjan Kerim, will attend a special meeting of the North Atlantic Council, Nato's policy-making body, in Brussels today. Macedonia, whose population is about 30% Albanian, has called for the creation of a Nato-patrolled \"ground safety zone\" along its border with Kosovo to cut off supplies to the Albanian rebels. Mr Kostunica also said he was optimistic that Yugoslavia would meet a US deadline to start co-operating with the UN war crimes tribunal, which wants to try his predecessor Slobodan Milosevic. The US Congress has set a March 31 deadline for cooperation or its aid allocation will be frozen and Washington will oppose badly needed loans from international financial institutions.",

Three guards using nightsights said they saw the sky light up with tracer bullets as the rebels withdrew from the camp, in sight of Macedonian army forward positions. Mortar fire could be heard several miles away.</p> <p>The signs of a hasty retreat by the rebel group, known as the National Liberation Army, could be seen in the 30 or so houses that served as the guerrilla base. Green coats and rations were dumped on the ground next to trenches. In a former school a significant stockpile of weapons was left behind, including anti-tank mines, rocket launchers, mortars and dozens of boxes of ammunition. There was also a television camera and tripod, \"confiscated\" from a Macedonian television crew last month.</p> <p>The sole remaining inhabitant of the village, a 74-year-old man, claimed to know very little about his erstwhile neighbours. \"I believe there were some people up on top of the hill, but I never went out to have a look at them,\" Sy Rrustemi said. I've no idea why they were fighting.\"</p> <p>US troops based in Kosovo yesterday moved in to take control of this key ethnic Albanian guerrilla stronghold on the boundary with Macedonia when 300 heavily armed troops from a US airborne battalion, backed up by helicopter gunships, started the operation early in the morning only to find the camp deserted.</p> <p>At least 300 soldiers, including a detachment of Poles and Ukrainians, saturated the village of Mijak on Wednesday after four armed men were spotted leaving a house. Americans fired after the men waved their guns, injuring two and precipitating a siege of the house which was being used as a barracks.</p> <p>Reinforcements sealed off the ridge, which overlooks forested valleys, as negotiators asked the rebels to surrender. They refused and a decision was taken to allow them to leave. \"We estimate there were between 20 and 40 of them,\" said Major Jim Marshall, a US army spokesman. Major Marshall said the objective of ensuring a safe and secure environment had been realised and confirmed that the insurgents had nowhere to go but Macedonia.</p> <p>US soldiers interviewed at the nearby village of Debelde appeared mortified. \"You could say it's embarrassing,\" one corporal said. \"I mean, they were trapped. We could have at least arrested them.\" A captain blushed when pressed on the issue. \"We do what we are told to do.

      "bodyText": "The last remaining Albanian guerrillas left their Tanusevci camp by mule and car before dawn yesterday. Three guards using nightsights said they saw the sky light up with tracer bullets as the rebels withdrew from the camp, in sight of Macedonian army forward positions. Mortar fire could be heard several miles away. The signs of a hasty retreat by the rebel group, known as the National Liberation Army, could be seen in the 30 or so houses that served as the guerrilla base. Green coats and rations were dumped on the ground next to trenches. In a former school a significant stockpile of weapons was left behind, including anti-tank mines, rocket launchers, mortars and dozens of boxes of ammunition. There was also a television camera and tripod, \"confiscated\" from a Macedonian television crew last month. The sole remaining inhabitant of the village, a 74-year-old man, claimed to know very little about his erstwhile neighbours. \"I believe there were some people up on top of the hill, but I never went out to have a look at them,\" Sy Rrustemi said. I've no idea why they were fighting.\" US troops based in Kosovo yesterday moved in to take control of this key ethnic Albanian guerrilla stronghold on the boundary with Macedonia when 300 heavily armed troops from a US airborne battalion, backed up by helicopter gunships, started the operation early in the morning only to find the camp deserted. At least 300 soldiers, including a detachment of Poles and Ukrainians, saturated the village of Mijak on Wednesday after four armed men were spotted leaving a house. Americans fired after the men waved their guns, injuring two and precipitating a siege of the house which was being used as a barracks. Reinforcements sealed off the ridge, which overlooks forested valleys, as negotiators asked the rebels to surrender. They refused and a decision was taken to allow them to leave. \"We estimate there were between 20 and 40 of them,\" said Major Jim Marshall, a US army spokesman. Major Marshall said the objective of ensuring a safe and secure environment had been realised and confirmed that the insurgents had nowhere to go but Macedonia. US soldiers interviewed at the nearby village of Debelde appeared mortified. \"You could say it's embarrassing,\" one corporal said. \"I mean, they were trapped. We could have at least arrested them.\" A captain blushed when pressed on the issue. \"We do what we are told to do. Or not to do, as in this case.\" Nearby settlements were bemused by the ensuing blitz of Black Hawk helicopters and armoured vehicles that clattered over the ridges. Stunted oak trees, until recently covered in snow, have sprouted tiny leaves - a sign that spring, the real fighting season, is on its way, according to one shepherd. \"This means the Americans are still our friends doesn't it?\" saidanother. He had been told that his heroes, K-For, who expelled Serb forces in 1999, had now turned against Albanian extremists. \"That is crazy. The Americans are our allies and they understand that it is the Macedonians causing the problems.\" The decision to deploy the US army in the region follows seven weeks of repeated clashes between the NLA and Macedonian forces in which five people have died, including three Macedonian soldiers killed last Sunday. On Tuesday, a forward party of US special forces said they were fired on by the rebel group and responded, injuring at least two people. \"We've been very deliberate about this operation,\" General Kenneth Quinlan, the commander of US soldiers in Kosovo, said. \"We've been in this area for a full 48 hours, clearly these guerrillas knew K-For was here.\" While the success of the operation may help to repair K-For's relations with the Macedonians, it was also marked with controversy: the Nato-led peacekeeping force denied it had crossed into the country to undertake the task as Macedonia is outside K-For's area of operations. Speaking outside the village school, which has signs written clearly in Macedonian, Gen Quinlan stressed: \"No actually we're in Kosovo right now, we are of course coordinating the operation with the Macedonians.\" Only a week ago, the head of the UN mission in Kosovo said there was no evidence to say that guerrillas were being supported from with in the province. Gen Quinlan himself seemed somewhat confused. \"Who's right I don't know, the boundary agreement between the Yugoslavs and the Macedonians was only recently certified and I don't even have the decisions,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>There is a corner of Milan that is, currently, very English. Behind the fashionably matt silver gates of the new Bottega Veneta headquarters is a designer's dream space: light-filled workrooms, a catwalk theatre, coffee bar serving espresso in tiny egg yolk-yellow cups. The Bottega Veneta company, flying high on the back of British creative team Giles Deacon and Katie Grand, allowed an independent British designer, 27-year-old Luella Bartley, who happens to be Grand's ex-flatmate, to stage her Luella show there. Happily, the Moltedo family, owners of Bottega Veneta, don't seem to mind that their beautiful space has been overrun by \"mad, English, scruffy teenagerey people\", as Bartley puts it. </p> <p>Bartley is, by her own admission, one of the scruffy people. She is also officially the hottest thing in fashion right now, bouncing from relative obscurity last year to closing Milan fashion week on Tuesday. Sipping espresso in jeans, flat boots and loose sweater, there's no denying that by Milan standards she looks unkempt, but it is evident she shares with her fashionable friends a semi-ironic love of luxury labels: the strap of a Prada camisole peeks from beneath her sweater, her plastic ponytail bobbles are Louis Vuitton. She is Nordic pale with salty blonde hair, invisible lashes and eyes the blue of Evian bottle tops. </p> <p>Bartley has shot to fame as, in the words of American Harper's Bazaar, the \"leader of the pack\" of London's \"junior style mafia\". She is constantly described as \"very London\", though she is no more sure than anyone else what this might mean. \"I couldn't say, it's just that London Chick label. In London you've got the best art, the best gigs. I get so much out of being in London that my stuff is bound to look quite London.\" Comparisons are made with Stella McCartney, who held the London Chick title before her, but Bartley's style is harder. </p> <p>It is less than 10 years since Bartley moved to London to train at St Martins, and her first crack at designing was not a success. \"I got incredibly intimidated by the place. Unless you're very artsy and conceptual, they're not interested. Try to make a nice frock and they're not having it, they want some madness going on. It's great if you're that kind of gay male designer, but if you're not . . . \" </p> <p>She changed to the fashion journalism course, took a work placement at the Evening Standard, landed a job and never went back. But after four years at the paper and two at Vogue, Bartley wanted a change. She turned to freelance journalism before deciding to become a designer a couple of years ago, \"one drunken evening\". </p> <p>The journalistic background has made a difference. \"A designer from a design background would start with a fabric or a colour, while I see the cat walk report in my head and work down from there. I see the whole image before I see the buttons. I put together an outfit for the catwalk in the same way I'd put together an outfit in the morning. That sounds a bit boring, doesn't it? But I wouldn't design something I wouldn't wear. All I really want to do is design jeans.\" </p> <p>Through her link with Grand, who collaborates on Luella, Bartley had already used Bottega Veneta bags and shoes in her shows. The company are \"really, really cool. Mrs Moltedo just said one day: 'Why don't you come and show in our space in Milan?' \" </p> <p>The Italian connection has proved lucrative. \"The orders have been ridiculous. I'm getting single orders for \u00a370,000 rather than my whole season's orders being \u00a370,000.\" </p> <p>Moving this season's show to Milan was a smart move. It has enabled her to escape the spectre of her inevitable replacement as London's hottest new thing: the London fashion world's attention span is nonexistent and there is no doubt that sooner or later another designer will be crowned The New Luella Bartley. \"I don't think about that too much because it scares me. A lot of people thought this move [to Milan] was arrogant, but it's good to move on from London before they can get bored of you.\" </p> <p>The autumn/winter 2001 collection, Looking Hard in the Yard - \"I do like my titles, that's a journalistic thing, I guess\" - is a \"rude boy skinhead\" look, with a bit of Buffalo thrown in. \"It feels right because it's really hard, quite aggressive, quite graphic.\" </p> <p>She bounces around the rails, showing me her favourite pieces: a denim mini with a double waistband, a Fred Perry-style top in cashmere, a tight black leather blouson jacket, \"like hard skinhead girls used to wear\". And, of course, some \"fantastic\" tight jeans. </p> <p>The road from kooky young thing to established designer is perilous, but Bartley is in a good position to negotiate it. For now, her aim is \"to be able to pay myself and not go under\", but there are also vague plans to turn her London studio into a shop and to expand the accessories line begun this week with the catwalk debut of the Luella bag. Eventually, she would like to do \"sunglasses and stuff. I mean, why not? It would be a laugh.\"</p>",

It's great if you're that kind of gay male designer, but if you're not . . . \" She changed to the fashion journalism course, took a work placement at the Evening Standard, landed a job and never went back. But after four years at the paper and two at Vogue, Bartley wanted a change. She turned to freelance journalism before deciding to become a designer a couple of years ago, \"one drunken evening\". The journalistic background has made a difference. \"A designer from a design background would start with a fabric or a colour, while I see the cat walk report in my head and work down from there. I see the whole image before I see the buttons. I put together an outfit for the catwalk in the same way I'd put together an outfit in the morning. That sounds a bit boring, doesn't it? But I wouldn't design something I wouldn't wear. All I really want to do is design jeans.\" Through her link with Grand, who collaborates on Luella, Bartley had already used Bottega Veneta bags and shoes in her shows. The company are \"really, really cool. Mrs Moltedo just said one day: 'Why don't you come and show in our space in Milan?' \" The Italian connection has proved lucrative. \"The orders have been ridiculous. I'm getting single orders for \u00a370,000 rather than my whole season's orders being \u00a370,000.\" Moving this season's show to Milan was a smart move. It has enabled her to escape the spectre of her inevitable replacement as London's hottest new thing: the London fashion world's attention span is nonexistent and there is no doubt that sooner or later another designer will be crowned The New Luella Bartley. \"I don't think about that too much because it scares me. A lot of people thought this move [to Milan] was arrogant, but it's good to move on from London before they can get bored of you.\" The autumn/winter 2001 collection, Looking Hard in the Yard - \"I do like my titles, that's a journalistic thing, I guess\" - is a \"rude boy skinhead\" look, with a bit of Buffalo thrown in. \"It feels right because it's really hard, quite aggressive, quite graphic.\" She bounces around the rails, showing me her favourite pieces: a denim mini with a double waistband, a Fred Perry-style top in cashmere, a tight black leather blouson jacket, \"like hard skinhead girls used to wear\". And, of course, some \"fantastic\" tight jeans. The road from kooky young thing to established designer is perilous, but Bartley is in a good position to negotiate it. For now, her aim is \"to be able to pay myself and not go under\", but there are also vague plans to turn her London studio into a shop and to expand the accessories line begun this week with the catwalk debut of the Luella bag. Eventually, she would like to do \"sunglasses and stuff. I mean, why not? It would be a laugh.\"",

      "bodyText": "Over 20,000 viewers voted in Sky News's first interactive vote for Gordon Brown's Budget on Wednesday. In a new development that Sky is touting as a revolution for democracy, viewers of Sky News were able to use their TV handsets to register their approval or disapproval of Mr Brown's policies. In the first hour after the chancellor delivered his Budget statement, 8,500 viewers registered their response to the question, \"How was the Budget for you?\". Sky claims 41% of people said they were \"very dissatisfied\" with the Budget, while only 21% were \"very satisfied\". The Budget also saw the first public outing of the Sky News Worm(Witness Opinion Response Monitor), Sky News's answer to the BBC's election swingometer. The Worm charted viewer responses to the statement in real-time, and registered a sudden dip every time Mr Brown mentioned the word \"prudence\". The Sky News Active vote is the brainchild of former Sky News deputy Jim Rudder, who was seconded last year to a new department to focus on interactive developments.",

      "bodyText": "The future of French pay-TV station Canal Plus is again in doubt as parent company Vivendi Universal prepares to unveil its maiden results. Vivendi is expected to reveal today that subscriber growth has stagnated at Canal Plus, which will increase speculation of a management clear-out at the company. Vivendi boss Jean-Marie Messier has been dogged by rumours of a deteriorating relationship with Canal counterpart Pierre Lescure, who runs a company which has yet to turn a profit. It is reported that Canal expects 30,000 new subscribers this year, against 43,000 last year and 110,000 in 1999. The latest figures would take the company's total customer base to 4.65m, but the slowdown in growth hints at saturation in the client base. Analysts will also be concerned that higher operating costs will deepen net losses from \u00a3248m in 1999 to \u00a3261m last year. A Canal Plus spokesman could not confirm if the reports were accurate. The Canal Plus results will increase market doubts about the world's second largest media company, which was formed last year by the \u00a350bn merger of French group Vivendi and Canadian corporation Seagram, owner of Universal Music and Universal Studios. Investors want to see detailed plans for delivering Vivendi's impressive content portfolio, which centre on its Vizzavi mobile internet venture with Vodafone. However, the roll-out of the portal has been hampered by the slow take-up of Wap phones and delays in launching next-generation handsets. A more worrying gap in Vivendi's distribution system is the lack of a strategic partnership with an internet service provider, following its decision to exit AOL France. Answering these doubts is of more importance to investors than the figures, which are expected to show pre-tax profits of \u00a31.1bn. Analysts say the results will be boosted by an exceptional year for Universal Music and Universal Studios which is unlikely to be repeated.

      "body": "<p>More than 40 girls, some as young as 14, have gone missing from care homes in the last five years and been transported to Italy to work as child prostitutes, police fear. </p> <p>The teenagers had been flown into Gatwick from West African countries by human traffickers who use Britain as a transit point into Europe. </p> <p>The girls' original documentation was destroyed by the traffickers, who told them to apply for political asylum on arrival, detectives believe. </p> <p>They were told to claim they were from Sierra Leone, riven by civil war, and not from Nigeria, and also to lie about their age so they were taken into care homes. </p> <p>Traffickers take samples of hair from the girls and warn them that these will be used to carry out voodoo punishments on them or their families if they disobey orders. </p> <p>The girls have gone on to abscond from the care homes and are believed to have been transported to countries, including Italy and Holland, where they are told they will find work as hairdressers or shop assistants. Instead, they are forced into prostitution. </p> <p>Britain is being used as a staging post because the Italian authorities have become alert to direct flights from West Africa. </p> <p>However, travellers from other EU countries are subject to far less scrutiny. </p> <p>Sources said one suspected trafficker, a Dutch national of Nigerian origin, was arrested at Dover with a girl from a West Sussex care home in his care last March, but the only charge that could be brought against him was for allegedly handling stolen credit cards. </p> <p>Detective Sergeant Andy Cummins of Sussex police said: \"The girls are afraid of the men and well drilled in their stories. There is a loophole in the legislation in that there is no specific offence of human trafficking. To prove kidnapping, you need to show the person has gone against their will.\" </p> <p>Police first established a link with the Italian sex trade after one girl escaped and contacted West Sussex social services in December 1999.

      "bodyText": "More than 40 girls, some as young as 14, have gone missing from care homes in the last five years and been transported to Italy to work as child prostitutes, police fear. The teenagers had been flown into Gatwick from West African countries by human traffickers who use Britain as a transit point into Europe. The girls' original documentation was destroyed by the traffickers, who told them to apply for political asylum on arrival, detectives believe. They were told to claim they were from Sierra Leone, riven by civil war, and not from Nigeria, and also to lie about their age so they were taken into care homes. Traffickers take samples of hair from the girls and warn them that these will be used to carry out voodoo punishments on them or their families if they disobey orders. The girls have gone on to abscond from the care homes and are believed to have been transported to countries, including Italy and Holland, where they are told they will find work as hairdressers or shop assistants. Instead, they are forced into prostitution. Britain is being used as a staging post because the Italian authorities have become alert to direct flights from West Africa. However, travellers from other EU countries are subject to far less scrutiny. Sources said one suspected trafficker, a Dutch national of Nigerian origin, was arrested at Dover with a girl from a West Sussex care home in his care last March, but the only charge that could be brought against him was for allegedly handling stolen credit cards. Detective Sergeant Andy Cummins of Sussex police said: \"The girls are afraid of the men and well drilled in their stories. There is a loophole in the legislation in that there is no specific offence of human trafficking. To prove kidnapping, you need to show the person has gone against their will.\" Police first established a link with the Italian sex trade after one girl escaped and contacted West Sussex social services in December 1999. The girl, whose Roman Catholic beliefs meant she was not afraid of the voodoo threats, was interviewed by detectives but was unable to provide the information needed for a prosecution. \"She did not know who any of the men were. She did not know England and could not describe what route she had taken.\" Police in Turin said yester day they had found Nigerian prostitutes carrying British passports, but were not aware of any girls who had absconded from Britain. Charity workers say that around 40% of Italy's prostitutes come from Nigeria and there are 2,500 West African prostitutes working on the streets of Turin every day. \"Turin is the Italian capital of Nigerian prostitution,\" said Mirta Da Pra, the head of a project on prostitution and human smuggling run by the charitable organisation Gruppo Abele. Nigerian women began arriving in Italy to work as prostitutes in 1988 and today share the market with women from eastern Europe. Their increasing dominance of the market followed the withdrawal of many Italian women in the wake of Aids. Ms Da Pra said: \"They come here to escape from a disastrous social and economic situation in Nigeria, where women have a very low status - they are not even allowed to have their own money - and no prospects.\" The prostitution rings are run by Nigerian madams, often ex-prostitutes themselves, who will buy women for between \u00a35,000 and \u00a37,000 from the \"sponsor\" who facilitated the girls' entry to Italy. Men play a minor role in the organisation, acting as drivers, collecting money and occasionally imposing discipline through physical force. \"Almost everything is run by the women,\" Ms Da Pra said. \"They are quite fearsome and perfectly capable of administering a beating.\" West Sussex social services have now stepped up security around girls arriving from West Africa.",

Their details are listed under the following headings: name, date of birth, arrival date, date went missing. Most were in their mid-teens when they arrived here, alone and seeking asylum. All have disappeared: some within 24 hours, some after a week or two, and a handful after several months. What evidence there is strongly suggests they have been trafficked into prostitution in Italy, where some 6o% of street prostitutes are West African. </p> <p>\"Jane\", a 16-year-old Nigerian, is one of only two girls to have surfaced again after vanishing from social services here (the other was found hiding in a church in Italy). Jane sits very still, and seems numb as she recounts her ordeal. Even when she cries, she barely moves. </p> <p>In Nigeria, thinking she was going to a party, Jane was taken by traffickers to a room where there were human heads on spikes. There she was forced to drink the blood of a dead woman. They then cut her with razor blades in small, neat rows, making her promise with each cut not to tell anyone anything, saying they would know because they had voodoo powers. There was another girl there and they forced them to lick each other's wounds. </p> <p>The traffickers then instructed her to return, bringing a friend, but she refused and so they sent her threatening messages. She met a man who, feigning sympathy, offered to help her. The cycle had begun. She was introduced to a man who provided her with a ticket and forged passport and told her to memorise a telephone number which she was to ring on arrival in London. </p> <p>Jane imagined that in London she would go through immigration on her forged passport and find a telephone. She had never been more than a few miles beyond her home before, and didn't know UK currency would be any different to Nigerian naira. She could barely read or write and forgot the telephone number, so when a Gatwick immigration officer asked her where she was going, she said she didn't know. She ended up in the care of West Sussex social services. </p> <p>But two months after her arrival there, she left, only to be arrested three weeks later at a port. The man she was with had been stopped before in the company of young girls, using the same passport as Jane had on this occasion. He had also been arrested in another European country, where an attempt to prosecute him for human trafficking had failed. Port authorities let the man go (despite a Customs and Special Branch request to the contrary). Jane was put in detention for five months, leading her to the brink of suicide before she was released back into West Sussex's care last summer. The Home Office turned down her asylum claim and she is currently appealing. </p> <p>Lynne Chitty, a senior asylum team social worker at West Sussex, who is looking after Jane, has heard many similar stories. She was told that a lawyer had come forward, claiming to have been instructed by Jane's father, and insisting that the girl was older than she said. Jane says this is impossible, that she doesn't even know who her father is. Chitty says that solicitors are used unwittingly by third parties to control the young people. </p> <p>She has watched the tragedy of such cases unfold since the first children disappeared in 1995, and she believes that of the West Sussex list of 71 missing, at least 40 West African girls and 14 West African boys have been trafficked into the sex trade. In January 1998 - by which time 10 children had gone missing - Sussex Police set up Operation Newbridge to gather intelligence on the girls. The boys were not included. A Missing Persons Helpline television programme resulted in a lead from a truck driver who had seen young African girls in lorry parks in Italy. </p> <p>In January 2000, the national crime squad presented a case against a number of men suspected of trafficking and prostitution, but the crown prosecution service rejected it. Current legislation makes convictions virtually impossible, and the authorities regard the few witnesses who might be prepared to come forward as unreliable because they change their stories. Chitty says they change them because they are too frightened to tell the truth until trust has built up between them and social workers. </p> <p>Chitty claims she has seen the traffickers: a woman hanging around a safe house who ran when approached by police; four men in a car outside a meeting of these children, who were watching her as she called police on her mobile phone. She and her family have been threatened. Disturbingly, half a dozen of the young people fitting the \"profile\" are working with the gangs, corrupted by money and power. Chitty knows, and they know she knows. </p> <p>DI Nigel Kent of the National Crime Squad, which led the failed investigation, thinks some girls know what awaits them here, \"believing the UK is the land of milk and honey\". Bisi Olateru Olagbegi, a Nigerian lawyer and women's rights activist, says that some see prostitution as an escape from poverty, but don't realise the horror of the conditions in which they will live and work. Nor do they realise that their debt bondage, usually about \u00a338,000 to traffickers, pimps and madams, will tie them down for years. (At Italian rates, a girl would have to suffer 3,000 clients to expunge the debt.) Olagbegi says that rape and even bestiality are used to control the girls. </p> <p>West Sussex social services has been vigorously proactive in tackling the situation, setting up safe houses, reporting every disappearance, working closely with immigration, police, the Missing Persons Helpline, the Refugee Council and others. Other authorities, notably Kent County Council and Hillingdon, have also lost children. For a few months last year, none left the West Sussex safe houses. But another girl vanished one Sunday lunchtime in October and hasn't been seen since. Chitty, who knew the girl well, and the others in the safe house, insist she would not have gone voluntarily and fear she is in danger. </p> <p>Chitty continues to report every disappearance and supply police with information, but feels it is futile. Detective Superintendent David Gaylor of Sussex police, who was involved at the start of the investigations, shares her concerns but says the police are not to blame: \"We feel neutered and disempowered.\" </p> <p>Gaylor says that when the issue was first raised with the Home Office two years ago, officials responded, \"in so many words, that it wasn't their problem\". Since then, Gaylor says there has been some response from Barbara Roche, the immigration minister , but \"there's still a long way to go\". He hopes now that there will be European and international liaison to combat the traffickers. </p> <p>Meanwhile the trafficking continues and Chitty fears that nothing will be done until the tragedy becomes a crisis - until one of those who is missing is found dead. She feels passionately about these young people. \"I feel privileged to work with them, I can't believe how brave they are. They arrive here, they don't even know where they are. They deserve to be safe, to be cared for. They are children.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>\"If Gordon Brown's Budget was rewritten as a Hollywood movie,\" said Howard Reed of the Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday, \"it would be called 'no losers' - or perhaps, 'everyone's a winner'.\" </p> <p>Weeks ahead of a general election, the chancellor's fifth and final Budget of the parliament followed a familiar pattern of quiet redistribution, with most of the gains concentrated at the bottom end of the income scale. </p> <p>But with middle England likely to play a crucial part in the outcome of the poll, Mr Brown also made sure that average and higher income groups did not suffer. Unlike some previous Budgets, there were gains for families in every income bracket. </p> <p>\"This Budget goes with the grain of previous Labour party budgets whilst offering something for almost everyone,\" Mr Reed said. </p> <p>In its analysis of the distributional impact of the personal tax and benefit changes, the IFS said the biggest gainers in percentage terms are households in the poorest tenth of the population. </p> <p>They gain on average about 1.6% of disposable income. In cash terms, that is about \u00a31.65 a week.

      "bodyText": "\"If Gordon Brown's Budget was rewritten as a Hollywood movie,\" said Howard Reed of the Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday, \"it would be called 'no losers' - or perhaps, 'everyone's a winner'.\" Weeks ahead of a general election, the chancellor's fifth and final Budget of the parliament followed a familiar pattern of quiet redistribution, with most of the gains concentrated at the bottom end of the income scale. But with middle England likely to play a crucial part in the outcome of the poll, Mr Brown also made sure that average and higher income groups did not suffer. Unlike some previous Budgets, there were gains for families in every income bracket. \"This Budget goes with the grain of previous Labour party budgets whilst offering something for almost everyone,\" Mr Reed said. In its analysis of the distributional impact of the personal tax and benefit changes, the IFS said the biggest gainers in percentage terms are households in the poorest tenth of the population. They gain on average about 1.6% of disposable income. In cash terms, that is about \u00a31.65 a week. The main drivers are the benefit increases and excise duty changes. Further up the income distribution scale, the widening of the 10p tax band from \u00a31,520 to \u00a31,880 ensures that basic and higher rate taxpayers also have some extra money in their pockets. In percentage terms, the richest 10% of the population gains about 0.3% of disposable income - around \u00a32 a week in cash terms. The IFS has also calculated the effect of the Budget changes on direct and indirect tax by family type. This shows that families with children are the biggest beneficiaries. They gain from the above-inflation increases in the working families tax credit, the children's credit and the changes to child allowances in income support. As a percentage of disposable income, single parents and non-earning couples with children gain the most. Their incomes rise by about 2% a week on average. At the opposite end of the age range, pensioners gain little from the tax and benefit changes announced yesterday. But they will still be better off both this year and in the years to come, thanks to the generous package of measures announced in November's pre-Budget report, including increases in the basic state pension and the minimum income guarantee. Pensioners also benefit from tax allowances rising in line with earnings from 2003 onwards, and the planned introduction of the new pension credit. The IFS said the overall impact of the Budget on the public finances was to loosen fiscal policy by \u00a34.4bn in the coming financial year, rising to \u00a35.2bn in 2002-03 and \u00a35.8bn in 2003-04. IFS researcher Carl Emmerson said the tax cuts and spending increases announced by the chancellor had been made possible by higher than expected tax revenue - especially income tax - combined with lower than expected spending on social security and debt interest, and underspending of departmental programmes. However, he questioned the chancellor's claim to have upped spending increases to 3.7% a year over the next three years from 3.4% previously, saying that the only reason spending was growing faster was that it was starting from a lower base.",

Mr Darling said this money would be carried over. </p> <p>Mr Portillo's office insisted Labour's Budget did not increase spending on health, education and crime by \u00a32.3bn over the next three years.

Its front page proclaimed: \"Blair gets our support for a second term.\" On and on rolled the eulogy. (They do nothing by halves). \"Yesterday's budget was an astounding achievement.\"</p> <p>This conversion was no surprise. The Sun always rises to embrace power. Bullies the world over have just one rule - always join the winning side, don't be seen dead with the losers. This is another tombstone representing the collapse of the right. After two elections supporting Labour, the Sun can never again be the cornerstone of the old Conservative party. It recognises there is nothing there - no party (average age 66), no policies, no personalities, no purpose, no project. A very dead parrot, the final end of the Thatcher era.

      "bodyText": "\"It's in the bag, Tony. You might as well call election now\", was the Sun's headline yesterday. Its front page proclaimed: \"Blair gets our support for a second term.\" On and on rolled the eulogy. (They do nothing by halves). \"Yesterday's budget was an astounding achievement.\" This conversion was no surprise. The Sun always rises to embrace power. Bullies the world over have just one rule - always join the winning side, don't be seen dead with the losers. This is another tombstone representing the collapse of the right. After two elections supporting Labour, the Sun can never again be the cornerstone of the old Conservative party. It recognises there is nothing there - no party (average age 66), no policies, no personalities, no purpose, no project. A very dead parrot, the final end of the Thatcher era. The nostrums and the diktats of her days were nowhere to be found in the Budget speech, finally purged and not before time. Labour has nothing left to fear from the past, no excuse now for future pusillanimity. Gallantly, the Sun tried hard to support William Hague but the faltering relationship is over, leaving an anguished Tory camp yesterday.

The luckiest few, which include the Chichester Festival Theatre and South Asian Theatre Development, will receive five times as much in grants as they do now.</p> <p>Mr Robinson claimed there was a \"new generation of talented people ready to emerge\" whose ambitions had been thwarted. \"Now they have the money and it is time for theatre to deliver.\"</p> <p>The big winners were spread fairly evenly across the country, from Live Theatre in Newcastle to the Plymouth Theatre Royal, with those seen as innovators particularly rewarded.</p> <p>But not of all those theatres that seemed to have done well were celebrating. Edward Hall at the Watermill near Newbury, said he was \"disgusted\" by the extra \u00a330,000 it had got to help bring on new directors like him, which the arts council had billed as a 131% rise.</p> <p>\"Are they serious? - \u00a330,000 would give underpaid staff here an extra \u00a311.50 a week [if it were to be used for wages]. I am disgusted.\"</p> <p>Mr Robinson, who put the unprecedented package together with the culture secretary, Chris Smith, in the wake of the Boyden report, which warned of a catastrophic decline in regional theatre, said he was determined the money should go straight towards improving the work on the stage.</p> <p>And he heralded an end to the \"tick-box culture\" under which companies were forced to jump through bureaucratic funding hoops. \"I hate the bureaucracy that surrounds arts funding. The other side of the coin is that when it doesn't work we are going to say, 'Hey, we thought we were going to get this for our money'.\"</p> <p>Mr Robinson admitted that when he took on the arts council job, he had assumed many of theatre's problems were down to inefficiency. \"However, you only have to look at the figures to be disabused of that notion. We are talking about chronic underfunding here, and it was only because the people involved were so committed that magical work has been done.\"</p> <p>But with three regional theatres not getting a penny extra, and another, the Theatre Royal in York, facing a cut in real terms, not everyone was jubilant.</p> <p>The future looks bleak for the Swan Theatre in Worcester, but the Croydon Warehouse - a springboard for new writers - is in most immediate danger of closure. As well as missing out on any extra cash from the review, it faces losing its \u00a360,000 grant from the London arts board next year.</p> <p>However, there was better news for the third of the threatened theatres, the Gateway in Chester, which had also missed out on the windfall. In a surprise move, North West Arts announced yesterday that it would increase its funding by 63% over the next three years if the project became a mixed-use arts centre.</p> <p>Kim Evans, the arts council's executive director of arts, said the fact that four companies had not benefited out of more than 190 had to be seen in context. \"Let's be clear, this is a great day for the theatre.\"</p> <p><b>The Budget in detail</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447997,00.html\">At a glance: main points</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447977,00.html\">Full text of the speech</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448048,00.html\">Budget buzz words</a><br></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/flash/0,7365,447971,00.html\">Guide to the Budget</a></p> <p><b>Comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448035,00.html\">Will Hutton: A typical Brown Budget</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448037,00.html\">Kamal Ahmed: The big Budget give-away</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,448000,00.html\">The view from the City: More theatrical than significant</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown's comments on the family (1min 06)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307Elliott.ra\">Audio: Larry Elliott analyses Budget 2001 (2mins)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0307hoggart.ra\">Simon Hoggart's sketch</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/brown.ra\">Gordon Brown on the family</a></p> <p><b>Game</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Budget_Game\">Play at being chancellor with our interactive Budget</a></p> <p><b>What do you think?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447991,00.html \">Online vote: was it a good Budget?</a><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Talk about it</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,447819,00.html\">Budget day in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,211615,00.html\">Can you spot the Labour chancellor?</a></p> <p><b>What does it mean for me?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardian.digita.com/budget/\">The Budget Estimator from Digita.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Money/0,6448,407734,00.html\">Personal finance from our Money site</a></p> <p><b>Public sector Budget analysis</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Society/2001budget/0,8145,438365,00.html\">Society Guardian.co.uk</a><br><a href=\"http://education.theguardian.com/\">Guardian Unlimited Education</a></p> <p><b>Chancellors</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447338,00.html\">Who is Gordon Brown?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/subsection/0,7370,437977,00.html\">Archive: every Budget since 1974</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/csr/0,2759,343298,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comprehensive spending review</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/0,2759,181262,00.html\">Budget 2000</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/index.html\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury Budget page</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget2001/fsbr/contents.html\" target=\"_new\">Budget 2001 report</a><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2001/story/0,7369,447903,00.html\">Ministers say Brown will tread carefully</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447673,00.html\">07.03.2001, Jonathan Freedland: He may have stumbled but he's saved the best till last</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,447654,00.html\">07.03.2001: Analysis</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/archive/0,7364,433881,00.html\">All Budget 2001 articles</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,447859,00.html \">NetNotes: Budget in links</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Bank of England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/\" target=\"_new\">The IMF</a><br><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Social Market Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www1.ifs.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Insititute of Fiscal Studies</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>By 1968, Elvis Presley's career was at an all-time low. The combined effect of the mid-60s British invasion led by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and the revolution in American music spearheaded by the Beach Boys, the Doors and Janis Joplin, ensured that the King's slick black quiff and curling upper lip had become as corny as communist paranoia and ice-cream sodas. Having spent most of the decade forsaking stage and studio for the cheap sets of one Hollywood B-movie after another, Elvis was, at the tender age of 33, all washed up. </p> <p>Help came in the form of a young NBC television producer, Steve Binder. Binder put Elvis back on the map with a v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style documentary, featuring a stripped-down performance that cured Elvis of his stage fright and, by giving him contemporary material and a sharp, leather-clad image, made him relevant again. Elvis responded to the show's success by telling his manager, the notorious Colonel Parker: \"I've got to get back in front of the public. I've got to get out on the road again!\" </p> <p>The colonel responded by showcasing his boy at Las Vegas, home of ageing crooners, gambling grannies and traditional entertainment in all its stagnant forms. Elvis had played Vegas once before - in 1956 he had bombed in front of an audience shocked by his then controversial stage show - and he hated the idea of going back. But Parker was enticed by the thought of a residency at the world's largest and most lavish hotel, the 1,500-room International, and signed his boy to play two months a year for five years. </p> <p>That's the Way It Is, the concert film of Elvis's 1970 performances at the Hotel International, documents the beginning of the Vegas period that lasted up until Elvis's death, and shows how, despite his misgivings, he rose to the occasion magnificently. Starved to perfection and knocking them dead in a white jumpsuit, Elvis shivered and shook before a 35-piece orchestra, two vocal groups and a soprano; kissed 100 swooning girls; karate-kicked his way through Suspicious Minds; and generally gave the performance of a lifetime. This despite the fact that That's the Way It Is was made in the same year that, doped up to his eyeballs, Elvis visited President Nixon to demand that he be appointed special agent for the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. He still appears as a regular guy, joking around in rehearsals, admitting to stage fright, and giving the people what they want. </p> <p>A new edit of the film forsakes the fan and bell-boy interviews of old for pure, undiluted Elvis. For those who still live and breathe the King, this is the definitive version. </p> <p><strong> Sid Shaw, proprietor of Elvisly Yours</strong> </p> <p>The first film wasn't punchy enough, there wasn't enough Elvis and it lost its momentum. This is pure Elvis. It shows the warmth of the man, the personality, the humour, the amazing talent. He puts on his glasses back to front, he falls off his chair... it must have been a real fun experience to rehearse with Elvis because he just wanted to have a good time, entertain people, and make them forget their worries. </p> <p>This version of the film has been around for 17 years, but because the people who own Graceland are so litigious it has been denied to the general public. Finally they have come to their senses, and I think it'll be the resurrection of Elvis. You come out of this film feeling that you've been entertained, and that's what Elvis did. You could listen to Heartbreak Hotel or Jailhouse Rock 1,000 times and they're still fresh. When you listen to a Spice Girls song, after half a dozen hearings you want to bang your head against a wall - but Elvis had something therapeutic in his voice. A lot of handicapped people love Elvis Presley. It's almost like a religious phenomenon, and it's so sad that all these years he hasn't been promoted. </p> <p>This is his year: 2001 was his theme tune. If you add together the year he died, the month he died, and the day he died, it comes to 2001, which is quite uncanny. People always write about the drugs and the hamburgers, but it's the music that will be remembered in the 25th century. OK, he had his personal problems, but he was a great entertainer, the world's best. He had some kind of aura. His voice had matured by the 1970s; like good wine it got better and better. The guy sold a billion records. No one will ever get near that. No one. </p> <p><strong>Shaun Blacker, Essential Elvis magazine</strong> </p> <p>The new version is better because it's got more of Elvis in rehearsal - you see more of the man himself. I think the early Vegas years were his best time, as he was at his peak. He had had enough of the films, he wanted to get back onstage, and this was filmed during the first few dates in Vegas. OK, later on he wasn't so fit, but in 1970 he was 100%, and he was enjoying it. I don't think Elvis really enjoyed his life from the 1960s onwards - I think he was a simple person who wanted to do some thing special, and after he achieved that he was always harking back to his roots. Everyone knows about the drug situation, and that was part of the problem. </p> <p>It's the charisma of the man. When he walked on stage everyone was awestruck. In January, I met Sonny West, Elvis's bodyguard, and he said that he was a real friend. When you see Elvis in the film joking around, that's exactly the way he was: relaxed, doing his music, just a bloke like you or me who happened to be very talented. But a lot of people were frightened of him too, and he had too many yes-men around him. He needed people to tell him where he was going wrong, which was what Sonny and Red West did, and Elvis fired them. He had a low opinion of himself at the time, he didn't think the public thought highly of him. He thought he'd been away too long to go back to the stage, and making this film helped him a lot. </p> <p><strong>Alice Castle, producer of a 15-part series on Elvis for BBC World Service</strong> </p> <p>I like this version of the film firstly because it starts with the date of the first rehearsal, August 7 1970, which was the day I was born, and secondly because it sums up that whole age of the Vegas gang of Sammy Davis Jr and George Hamilton, and the Memphis Mafia [the group of friends and cronies who went everywhere with Elvis]. There's a moment when he's rehearsing and Colonel Parker calls him a \"big-ass\". It shows there was tension between them, and you remember that the reason why Elvis made all of those awful films was to support Colonel Parker's gambling habit. </p> <p>It's easy for us, 30 years on, to look at this film as a showcase for a great entertainer, but that's part of the myth. He was kitsch at the time - I remember my parents saying that anyone who had any taste in music thought Elvis was naff in the early 1970s - but if you speak to the hardcore fans they say this was his greatest moment; maybe because he was essentially a performance artist who didn't write his own material, and this was his biggest performance. If you saw this film on a huge screen, in a drive-in with massive speakers on either side, it would be the closest you'd get to seeing Elvis live. But what's been included are all of the most famous 1950s songs, and anyone who knows a lot about Elvis may be disappointed because their personal favourites aren't there. </p> <p><strong> Elvis impersonator Di and her Elvis-loving manager Shirley</strong> </p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> We got to the last couple of numbers and I realised I was starting to cry. Something said to me: what the hell - or who - put this man on earth? I looked over at Di and she was crying as well. Then you realise: this man invented rock'n'roll. </p> <p><strong>Di:</strong> These days people think Elvis was fat for the whole of the Vegas period, when in reality he was only fat for the last six months of his life. These people just see rhinestones, fat and burgers, but for those who were there when it was happening, it was just phenomenal. That was my first vision of Elvis - when I was nine I saw a picture of him in a white jumpsuit, looking like he did on That's the Way It Is. He made a huge, instant impact on my life. I was only nine. What's that all about? </p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> What's the space between the first single and this film? Fourteen years. Only maybe David Bowie has maintained that impact. Fourteen years and he's still this rock'n'roll star who has this amazing effect on people. </p> <p><strong>Di:</strong> It's an indefinable energy. Elvis wanted to be an angel, which is why he had the cape and the jumpsuit, and he knew he had something special, and that's why he could be something bigger than himself. Watching that energy on screen tonight made me feel so humble. </p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> He was really slim then, too. </p> <p><strong>Di:</strong> It's a shame they took off I Just Can't Help Believing. I remember every time it came on Top of the Pops I used to tape it off the telly with my little tape recorder. Ever since then I've wanted to be an Elvis impersonator but never thought I could because I'm not a man. His energies go right down the middle - he's very feminine with his clothes and his pretty face, but very masculine with his moves. </p> <p><strong>Shirley:</strong> With Di, we're re-glorifying that image by making Elvis beautiful again. He was a very beautiful man. He was the king of rock'n'roll. </p> <p><strong> Mark Carter, long-term Elvis fan</strong> </p> <p> When I was 14 I went on a family holiday to Los Angeles. We drove to Las Vegas to see Elvis in one of the concerts that was recorded for That's the Way It Is, but when we stopped for breakfast we met a couple who told us that you had to queue all day for tickets. I was up for it, but my dad said, \"Fuck it, we won't bother.\" The next time we went to Las Vegas, he died. I've seen That's the Way It Is three times since then. </p> <p>The Vegas years are the best because when Elvis was young and pretty, what he did was rather shallow like all pop music. When he was older, you could see his life was telling on him and his music had more depth. Elvis wasn't particularly political, but when he did protest songs like In the Ghetto and If I Can Dream, he put so much emotion into them that they're more powerful than anything Dylan did. By the time That's the Way It Is came out he was such a huge icon, it would have been hard for the audience to believe that they were seeing him in the flesh. He was a part of history. Unfortunately, by that time he had been so humoured by everyone around him, he wasn't attached to the ground in any way. It was perfectly feasible for him to think he should set up a meeting with President Nixon to become a narcotics agent and wander around the White House with a gun in his pocket. Especially when he was high on speed. </p> <p>Elvis: That's the Way It Is is released next Friday. The single Suspicious Minds and the album The Live Greatest Hits (both RCA) are released on March 26.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A spectacular theft of explosives by presumed members of the Basque group Eta at a warehouse near the French town of Grenoble yesterday raised fears of new bombings across Spain. French police said there were eight suspected Eta gunmen involved. Seven escaped, but police said they had under arrest one who had earlier held five people, including a small child, captive at the home of a warehouse guard while the gang loaded 1.6 tonnes of explosives on lorries. The unidentified suspect was captured at a police checkpoint in Annonay, 50 miles away, early yesterday morning, according to anti- terrorist police, who said he was driving a stolen car and carrying a loaded 9mm pistol and false identity papers. Despite the many checkpoints set up on routes south to the Basque country, there was no sign yesterday of the two lorry loads of explosives, 20,000 detonators and fuses. The early morning raid began when the gunmen burst into a security guard's house at Verey, on the outskirts of Grenoble. His family and friends were forced to the ground and held at gunpoint by two gang members while the guard was taken to the explosives warehouse and forced to open the gates. Two hours later, after the explosives had been driven away, the hostages were freed. Nicole Destenave, one of the captives, said the raiders were polite and well behaved. \"They kept their masks on all the time. They spoke Spanish and were very polite. They were considerate as well, because they asked us several times if we wanted a drink or needed to go to the bathroom,\" she said. In a single operation, Eta is believed to have dramatically increased its capacity to carry out attacks. The separatist group snatched eight tonnes of explosives in a combined raid with a French Breton separatist group in Plevine, western France, in 1999. But much of that haul was discovered by French police before it could be used. Spain's interior ministry said those explosives had now decayed and become unusable. That might explain why Eta bombs in Seville, Malaga and Madrid have failed to explode in recent months, although the group did successfully explode a car bomb in San Sebastian last month, killing two people. France historically has been a place of refuge, training and preparation for Eta. Its leaders have always lived and plotted their campaigns in the towns and villages of the Basque region of south-west France - away from the reach of Spain's anti-terrorist police. The group currently has one armed unit based in France, which travels across the border to carry out attacks, according to police. A few weeks ago French police in the southern region of Les Landes discovered a training ground where Eta members had been learning to use grenade launchers, and Eta's principal military leader, Juan Carlos Garcia Gaztelu, was captured in the south-western French town of Anglet two weeks ago. Eta claims it is fighting for a country of \"seven provinces\". Three of these - Labourd, Soule and Basse Navarre - are in France. It does not, however, carry out killings on French soil. ETA also recruits in the French Basque country. One of it most lethal units, which killed 31 adults and five children in the 80s and 90s, was made up entirely of French Basques. Eta has killed 800 people in 30 years, 26 of whom have died since it called off a 14-month truce in December 1999. Shortly after breaking the truce the group tried, but failed, to carry out a massive bombing campaign in Madrid. Spanish police uncovered two 900kg bombs in separate vans as they headed for the capital. Eta now has sufficient explosives to try a similar attack again and police believe they might be used during the campaign for May elections to the regional Basque government. \"This obviously is not good news,\" said the interior minister, Mariano Rajoy.",

      "body": "<p><strong> NEW YORK TIMES</strong> </p> <p>\"[Tanya] is stuck, uprooted and friendless, in a place where the bleak tones of sea and sky emphasise the general absence of hope. </p> <p>The thoughtful stylishness of Mr Pawlikowski's direction... extends to [Tanya] the dignity and compassion that only art can confer.\" </p> <p><strong>LOS ANGELES TIMES</strong> </p> <p>\"[They end up in] a lonely, isolated tower, surrounded by fences and even barbed wire, located next to a distressed amusement park whose brazen Dreamland Welcomes You sign mocks them with its unconvincing civility... this is the best class of poetic realism, the kind you can believe in without a trace of hesitation.\" </p> <p><strong>HOLLYWOOD REPORTER</strong> </p> <p>\"The film should help position the award-winning documentarian [Pawlikowski] as a feature writer-director of considerable promise. </p> <p>[Margate is portrayed as] a bleak holding tank of a failed resort area. Looking out on to a dilapidated amusement park, the area is a virtual prison.\"</p> <p>It looks like a dump, that's what it looks like - from \"Margate\", the closing chapter of Graham Swift's Last Orders. </p> <p>You have to feel sorry for Margate. There it is, stuck out like an untended boil on the backside of Kent, disowned by its solidly respectable neighbours, Ramsgate and Broadstairs, whose facades seem pulled in a permanent rictus of displeasure and embarrassment at its coarse proletarian pleasures. All through the 1980s, London councils dumped the mad and the bad - their undeserving poor - into the empty bucket-and-spade guesthouses along its broad bay. Even they didn't stay. </p> <p>To top it all, there is Tracey Emin. \"Margate made me what I am,\" the artist once declared. But she won't be bringing charges. \"Because to me, Margate is beautiful, romantic, charismatic, sad, eccentric and screwed-up... You don't lose your virginity there, you have it broken into.\" </p> <p>Like its most illustrious daughter, Margate has had to learn to trade on its own tackiness. Buster Bloodvessel, the gargantuan ska singer, opened a hotel near the front called Fatty Towers as a taste-free retreat for lardy lovers. But despite the reinforced beds and the gut-buster breakfasts (\"2,000 calories in every bite\") it too closed down. </p> <p>Fatty Towers may end up, like most of the old Regency hotels in the Cliftonville area, providing a home for refugees, though the \u00a320 worth of food vouchers they get each week wouldn't keep its former residents in bubble and squeak. </p> <p>Close to 3,000 asylum-seekers have been left to stew in one small district of this town of little more than 45,000 people. Such a glaring example of how, in the words of William Hague, England has been turned into a \"foreign land\" has inevitably attracted Ann Widdecombe as well as the National Front, which has held six rallies in Margate in the past year. Neither Widdecombe nor the Front drew enough supporters to outnumber the police. </p> <p>For, while the locals may not welcome the influx of refugees, they know that even if the flocks of lonely Afghan and Albanian men who walk the streets were allowed to work, there is none for them here. </p> <p>\"For a place where you come to have fun, we've become a net exporter of misery,\" says Mike Pearce, the droll editor of the local paper, the Thanet Times. \"We're either Dole-on-sea, Poverty-on-sea or Refugees-on-sea. They are always making up some godawful name for Margate.\" He doesn't mention The Cat-flap at the End of the A28. Or the town's place at the end of Graham Swift's novel Last Orders: it's to Margate that the four middle-aged, pissed-up south London geezers come to scatter the ashes of their old mate, Jack Dodds. </p> <p>Last winter - a time of year when Margate never looks its best - another bloody foreigner with an unpronounceable name came to Margate. He brought a camera crew with him, and he was making a film about a flaky Russian single mother who had exchanged a crumbling tower block in Moscow for an equally crumbling one overlooking Dreamland, the kind of funfair of which nightmares are made. With a sub-plot that involved cyberporn and pre-teen vodka binges, it was clear that he wasn't making a holiday programme. </p> <p>Which seemed like a gift for Sandy Ezekiel, Thanet's leading Tory, who has never tired of exposing how the Labour-led council has allowed the town to be overrun by refugees. Was not the film's very name, Last Resort, another nail in Margate's coffin? On Tuesday last week, councillor Ezekiel called for the resignation of the tourism chief, Iris Johnston, for allowing this \"derogatory film\" to be shot. </p> <p>One can imagine how much greater his rage would have been if he'd realised the film's maverick director, Pawel Pawlikowski - once a refugee himself - was the same BBC man MPs accused of consorting with enemy during the Bosnian war for making Serbian Epics, a masterly documentary that examined the forces that drive Serb nationalism. Anyone who could persuade the \"psychiatrist and poet\" Radovan Karadzic to stand on the hills above Sarajevo and read his early verses prophesying the city's destruction as his own artillery blew it to bits must be a secret traitor, some Tory MPs reasoned. Fortunately, attempts to ban Serbian Epics failed - so, for his next film, Pawlikowski took a cruise down the Volga with the extreme Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. </p> <p>But all Ezekiel had to go on when he launched his attack in the Thanet Times last week was the imagined slight to Margate. \"Councillor Johnson was well aware of the film and its content,\" he protested. \"Sources within the council have informed us that she went about assisting the production team with the recruitment of asylum-seekers to act in the film.\" </p> <p>This was a serious accusation, as asylum-seekers are forbidden from working. The film, he went on, was \"made entirely in her ward and this amounts to gross negligence. It should have been properly vetted. I have called for an inquiry into how this film was ever allowed to be filmed in Margate.\" </p> <p>Ezekiel, however, was in for a surprise. For Last Resort is not a self-righteous rant against racism or provincial smallmindedness. It does not, for example, contain a single skinhead or a Dr Martens boot. Nor does it make any bones about the fact that its heroine's claim of political asylum is as bogus as a three-pound note. Instead it is a rather sublime and surprising love story about a twice-married, rather dippy Muscovite called Tanya who, with only a year or two left to trade on her doll-like looks, drags her 10-year-old son to England to throw herself at the mercy of a man with whom she has had a fleeting romance. </p> <p>Two days before the row broke out in Margate, the director Pawel Pawlikowski was adding a Bafta for the best British newcomer to the Michael Powell award for best British film at Edinburgh, and the international critics' prize at the London Film Festival. Meanwhile, in the US, the film was getting the kind of reviews American indie directors would sell their Latino maids into slavery for. Both the New York Times and Los Angeles Times raved over Pawlikowski's rare knack of combining \"realism and warmth\", how the film \"leaves you with a feeling of having glimpsed something essential about the way the world is now\". </p> <p>Back in Margate, those councillors who had actually seen the film were breathing a sigh of relief. \"I am getting sick and tired of councillor Ezekiel's promotion of untruths,\" councillor Johnston said. \"Unlike him, I have had a preview of the film which is a tender, gentle love story. There are some remarkable shots of the seafront which can only re-emphasise what we all know - that we have a stunning bay.\" Councillors also point out that the name of the resort in the film has been changed to Stonehaven. </p> <p>Richard Nicholson, the council's Labour leader, and the man behind the plan for a \u00a37m arts centre dedicated to the town's other great artist, JMW Turner, thought it might even enhance Margate's new arty image. \"The story centres on the desperation of a young woman with a young son, abandoned when they reach a foreign country. Obviously, the director needed to invoke this feeling of isolation, and by clever use of parts of Margate in the off season was able to portray this to good effect. I do not think this will harm Margate in any way. This film could actually encourage more visitors who will be pleasantly surprised when they arrive to find not only the evocative locations used in the film, but many other fine aspects of Margate and Thanet.\" </p> <p>Pawlikowski wasn't confident of a positive local reaction when he started filming. \"Back then I called it Russian Lover or something like that. It would have been asking for trouble, just crazy, to put Last Resort on the clapperboard. Many people in Margate were suspicious of us at first and you can't blame them. They thought we had come down to put the boot into them, to take the refugees' side. The locals generally don't like the refugees and they don't want them there - things are tough enough for them. They assume the refugees get all sorts of benefits English people don't get, which is rubbish, of course.\" </p> <p>Pawlikowski wanted to create an imaginative landscape in which Tanya (played by the Russian actress Dina Korzun) and her son Artiom (Artiom Strelnikov) felt both lost and trapped in a kind of Stalag Butlin's, fenced in by arbitrary, unexplained rules, barbed wire and bureaucracy, a landscape without cars or other means of escape, where large groups of sad, unshaven men, Kurds and Afghans, wandered aimlessly all day observed by CCTV cameras. </p> <p>\"When I first when down to Margate,\" he said, \"my first contact was with the Roma, the Gypsies, who were the only refugees really who interacted with the locals. Even with them, what struck me was how little their world extended beyond what they called Margatta. They would make epic journeys to a strange place at the far end of their known world called Greyvas End. You don't have to be there long to realise that most of the asylum-seekers are clueless peasants. They are Kurds and Afghans mostly. Some have not even lived in cities before. They are all stunned, many don't move because they don't know what to do. When the local Margate kids go round spitting at them, you can see their shock because they come from cultures were people have manners, where strangers receive hospitality. To me, they looked like they were living inside a Kafka story.\" </p> <p>In a typical touch, Pawlikowski cast one of those spitting girls - who could have stepped from the scrawled pages of one of Tracey Emin's lurid teenage diaries - as one of the prepubescent gang who introduce 10-year-old Artiom to the joys of smuggled Belgian vodka and cigarettes, and the first, disturbing stirrings of sex. </p> <p>In this Kafkaesque Ingerland where caffs sell batter without fish and meat pies without filling, and where you don't get change from your food vouchers, Tanya and Artiom are befriended by Alfie, a skid-row fixer who works on the slot machines down the arcade and who introduces the boy to the rudiments of English (\"10 Benson &amp; Hedges, please\") and the correct way to mix his chicken tikka. </p> <p>When he first landed in Margate with his skeleton crew, Pawlikowski had little more than a loose semi-autobiographical story to go on. (He came to Britain from Poland with his family when he was 12). \"Initially Alfie [played by Paddy Considine, a former boxer who made a startling screen debut in Shane Meadows's A Room for Romeo Brass] was to be a much more ambiguous, slighty threatened character, but the chemistry with Dina was magical. Paddy is a real phenomenon. We all lived together during the shoot, that is part of my method, so we were able to improvise scenes and come up with new ideas in the evening and over dinner. I am an insomniac, too, so I just kept writing all night sometimes. That is the way I like to work.\" </p> <p>Like its director, Last Resort is a very peculiar animal. It mixes gritty realism with a very un-British dreamlike quality which transcends the grimness of its setting. The handheld, documentary sequences of refugees huddled in shuffling queues for a solitary phonebox or the interior fug of greasy spoons are cut with beautiful, lingering wide-angle landscapes to create the eerie perspective of people who spend their days peering out uncomprehendingly at the strange country beyond their windows. </p> <p>\"I'm interested in the forgotten places, the dumping grounds,\" says Pawlikowski, \" the places we have taken out of our mental picture. I want people to see images of lives that will catch them off balance.\" </p> <p>Surprises is what Pawlikowski is all about. He really surprised the BBC with his last project, Twockers. They commissioned him to go off and make a documentary in Halifax and he returned with a haunting TV film about a boy burglar who befriends a pregnant teenager, a kind of hyper-dysfunctional Kes crossed with the Lord of the Rings. It may sound unutterably depressing - three tabloid \"Rat Boys\" sitting on a settee above a sink estate discussing in their own skroaty slang what old dear to do over next - but it wasn't. Even the break-ins looked balletic. \"The kids we found and improvised with knew what they were doing,\" he says. </p> <p>The only tragic thing about this beautifully-crafted gem was that it could never have been made by a British director. Pawlikowski makes no bones about his belief that, with a few notable exceptions, British film-making sucks. \"I see all these guys running around that are all technique. They have nothing to say and the stupid thing is that they are not even curious and they don't care. They make films the way you and I go to the supermarket, picking this image and that style off the shelves. Everything is either plot, plot, plot or style, style, style and when they try to do something that reflects life or tells a story it turns into some awful issue-based thing. It is really frustrating when you want to see something original, something different. Most of the really interesting film-makers in this country are over 50.\" </p> <p>Pawlikowski has a great Polish love for argument, for taking extreme positions that can't possible be held and clinging on for the hell of it. \"My big problem is that I'm really a feudalist - the world and film-making would be a lot simpler if it was feudal.\" </p> <p>His recipe is simple. \"You have to be a conman to make really good films today,\" he says. \"You have to work inside the system but against it. Take the money and run.\" He has huckstered the BBC into backing his pet projects for the past 10 years. \"It's got harder, but as long as I kept winning prizes they let me get away with it.\" With Dostoevsky's Travels, he spun a hilarious and fantastical documentary around the writer Fyodor's great grandson Dimitri, a St Petersburg tram driver, whom he found struggling to break free of the clutches of an overbearing vegetarian German baroness who had held him prisoner in her schloss in Schleswig- Holstein: \"I rang [the novelist] Nigel Williams, who was editing Bookmark at the time and said, 'I got this great idea, Nigel, send me some money immediately, I'll explain later.' And he did.\" </p> <p>It may sound too bizarre for belief, but Pawlikowski made his name in 1990 with a still more deliciously satirical Bookmark documentary about Benedict Yerofeyev, the leg-pulling laureate of Soviet drinking culture whose hallucinatory masterpiece From Moscow to Pietushki is a sort of aesthetic discourse on the rigours of alcoholism. Every wino in Russia can seemingly quote from its exhaustive menu of cocktails in which eau de Cologne, French polish, and deodorant are among the more favoured ingredients. </p> <p>Pawlikowski's career hasn't been all Felixes, Emmys and Prix Italias, however. For four years the BBC's obsession with voyeurism and fly-on-the-wall documentaries left him out in the cold. Then his one brush with the lilliputian world of British star power produced what Pawlikowski calls \"my near nemesis\", the low-budget BBC and Russian co-production, The Stringer, where Anna Friel took top billing ahead of some of Andrei Tarkovsky's greatest actors. If Twockers and Last Resort were his time in purgatory to pay for the \u00a31.4m he blew on The Stringer, he has used it to hone one of the most distinctive styles of British film-making. </p> <p>\"You have got to go against the grain to stand any chance of making anything that will pass the test of time. When we went to Bosnia to shoot Serbian Epics, we must have been the only crew there who didn't shoot a single frame of fighting. That was a perverse thing to do, but the film we made has not aged like so much else that tried to catch the rage of the moment.\" </p> <p>Now that the world has completely lost interest in Bosnia, he has followed that logic to the letter by returning to Sarajevo. \"It has turned into this weird protectorate. It's crazy. I have this great idea...\" </p> <p>At the Thanet Times, Mike Pearce revels in a similar contrarianism. He wistfully regrets that the furore over Last Resort has run out of steam so quickly. \"I had thought there might be more in it,\" he says, though he is proud of how Margate has stood aloof from the racist excesses of Dover, where the local paper described asylum-seekers as \"human sewage\". </p> <p>Thanet Film Club are planning to show it in nearby Broadstairs, he tells me, but not until the autumn. \"Films like Last Resort don't normally make it to Margate,\" says Mike, \"I'm sure it is great, but it's not my thing. I'm more a tits and bums man myself.\" </p> <p>Last Resort opens at selected cinemas from next Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "NEW YORK TIMES \"[Tanya] is stuck, uprooted and friendless, in a place where the bleak tones of sea and sky emphasise the general absence of hope. The thoughtful stylishness of Mr Pawlikowski's direction... extends to [Tanya] the dignity and compassion that only art can confer.\" LOS ANGELES TIMES \"[They end up in] a lonely, isolated tower, surrounded by fences and even barbed wire, located next to a distressed amusement park whose brazen Dreamland Welcomes You sign mocks them with its unconvincing civility... this is the best class of poetic realism, the kind you can believe in without a trace of hesitation.\" HOLLYWOOD REPORTER \"The film should help position the award-winning documentarian [Pawlikowski] as a feature writer-director of considerable promise. [Margate is portrayed as] a bleak holding tank of a failed resort area. Looking out on to a dilapidated amusement park, the area is a virtual prison.\" It looks like a dump, that's what it looks like - from \"Margate\", the closing chapter of Graham Swift's Last Orders. You have to feel sorry for Margate. There it is, stuck out like an untended boil on the backside of Kent, disowned by its solidly respectable neighbours, Ramsgate and Broadstairs, whose facades seem pulled in a permanent rictus of displeasure and embarrassment at its coarse proletarian pleasures. All through the 1980s, London councils dumped the mad and the bad - their undeserving poor - into the empty bucket-and-spade guesthouses along its broad bay. Even they didn't stay. To top it all, there is Tracey Emin. \"Margate made me what I am,\" the artist once declared. But she won't be bringing charges. \"Because to me, Margate is beautiful, romantic, charismatic, sad, eccentric and screwed-up... You don't lose your virginity there, you have it broken into.\" Like its most illustrious daughter, Margate has had to learn to trade on its own tackiness. Buster Bloodvessel, the gargantuan ska singer, opened a hotel near the front called Fatty Towers as a taste-free retreat for lardy lovers. But despite the reinforced beds and the gut-buster breakfasts (\"2,000 calories in every bite\") it too closed down. Fatty Towers may end up, like most of the old Regency hotels in the Cliftonville area, providing a home for refugees, though the \u00a320 worth of food vouchers they get each week wouldn't keep its former residents in bubble and squeak. Close to 3,000 asylum-seekers have been left to stew in one small district of this town of little more than 45,000 people. Such a glaring example of how, in the words of William Hague, England has been turned into a \"foreign land\" has inevitably attracted Ann Widdecombe as well as the National Front, which has held six rallies in Margate in the past year. Neither Widdecombe nor the Front drew enough supporters to outnumber the police. For, while the locals may not welcome the influx of refugees, they know that even if the flocks of lonely Afghan and Albanian men who walk the streets were allowed to work, there is none for them here. \"For a place where you come to have fun, we've become a net exporter of misery,\" says Mike Pearce, the droll editor of the local paper, the Thanet Times. \"We're either Dole-on-sea, Poverty-on-sea or Refugees-on-sea. They are always making up some godawful name for Margate.\" He doesn't mention The Cat-flap at the End of the A28. Or the town's place at the end of Graham Swift's novel Last Orders: it's to Margate that the four middle-aged, pissed-up south London geezers come to scatter the ashes of their old mate, Jack Dodds. Last winter - a time of year when Margate never looks its best - another bloody foreigner with an unpronounceable name came to Margate. He brought a camera crew with him, and he was making a film about a flaky Russian single mother who had exchanged a crumbling tower block in Moscow for an equally crumbling one overlooking Dreamland, the kind of funfair of which nightmares are made. With a sub-plot that involved cyberporn and pre-teen vodka binges, it was clear that he wasn't making a holiday programme. Which seemed like a gift for Sandy Ezekiel, Thanet's leading Tory, who has never tired of exposing how the Labour-led council has allowed the town to be overrun by refugees. Was not the film's very name, Last Resort, another nail in Margate's coffin? On Tuesday last week, councillor Ezekiel called for the resignation of the tourism chief, Iris Johnston, for allowing this \"derogatory film\" to be shot. One can imagine how much greater his rage would have been if he'd realised the film's maverick director, Pawel Pawlikowski - once a refugee himself - was the same BBC man MPs accused of consorting with enemy during the Bosnian war for making Serbian Epics, a masterly documentary that examined the forces that drive Serb nationalism. Anyone who could persuade the \"psychiatrist and poet\" Radovan Karadzic to stand on the hills above Sarajevo and read his early verses prophesying the city's destruction as his own artillery blew it to bits must be a secret traitor, some Tory MPs reasoned. Fortunately, attempts to ban Serbian Epics failed - so, for his next film, Pawlikowski took a cruise down the Volga with the extreme Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. But all Ezekiel had to go on when he launched his attack in the Thanet Times last week was the imagined slight to Margate. \"Councillor Johnson was well aware of the film and its content,\" he protested. \"Sources within the council have informed us that she went about assisting the production team with the recruitment of asylum-seekers to act in the film.\" This was a serious accusation, as asylum-seekers are forbidden from working. The film, he went on, was \"made entirely in her ward and this amounts to gross negligence. It should have been properly vetted. I have called for an inquiry into how this film was ever allowed to be filmed in Margate.\" Ezekiel, however, was in for a surprise. For Last Resort is not a self-righteous rant against racism or provincial smallmindedness. It does not, for example, contain a single skinhead or a Dr Martens boot. Nor does it make any bones about the fact that its heroine's claim of political asylum is as bogus as a three-pound note. Instead it is a rather sublime and surprising love story about a twice-married, rather dippy Muscovite called Tanya who, with only a year or two left to trade on her doll-like looks, drags her 10-year-old son to England to throw herself at the mercy of a man with whom she has had a fleeting romance. Two days before the row broke out in Margate, the director Pawel Pawlikowski was adding a Bafta for the best British newcomer to the Michael Powell award for best British film at Edinburgh, and the international critics' prize at the London Film Festival. Meanwhile, in the US, the film was getting the kind of reviews American indie directors would sell their Latino maids into slavery for. Both the New York Times and Los Angeles Times raved over Pawlikowski's rare knack of combining \"realism and warmth\", how the film \"leaves you with a feeling of having glimpsed something essential about the way the world is now\". Back in Margate, those councillors who had actually seen the film were breathing a sigh of relief. \"I am getting sick and tired of councillor Ezekiel's promotion of untruths,\" councillor Johnston said. \"Unlike him, I have had a preview of the film which is a tender, gentle love story. There are some remarkable shots of the seafront which can only re-emphasise what we all know - that we have a stunning bay.\" Councillors also point out that the name of the resort in the film has been changed to Stonehaven. Richard Nicholson, the council's Labour leader, and the man behind the plan for a \u00a37m arts centre dedicated to the town's other great artist, JMW Turner, thought it might even enhance Margate's new arty image. \"The story centres on the desperation of a young woman with a young son, abandoned when they reach a foreign country. Obviously, the director needed to invoke this feeling of isolation, and by clever use of parts of Margate in the off season was able to portray this to good effect. I do not think this will harm Margate in any way. This film could actually encourage more visitors who will be pleasantly surprised when they arrive to find not only the evocative locations used in the film, but many other fine aspects of Margate and Thanet.\" Pawlikowski wasn't confident of a positive local reaction when he started filming. \"Back then I called it Russian Lover or something like that. It would have been asking for trouble, just crazy, to put Last Resort on the clapperboard. Many people in Margate were suspicious of us at first and you can't blame them. They thought we had come down to put the boot into them, to take the refugees' side. The locals generally don't like the refugees and they don't want them there - things are tough enough for them. They assume the refugees get all sorts of benefits English people don't get, which is rubbish, of course.\" Pawlikowski wanted to create an imaginative landscape in which Tanya (played by the Russian actress Dina Korzun) and her son Artiom (Artiom Strelnikov) felt both lost and trapped in a kind of Stalag Butlin's, fenced in by arbitrary, unexplained rules, barbed wire and bureaucracy, a landscape without cars or other means of escape, where large groups of sad, unshaven men, Kurds and Afghans, wandered aimlessly all day observed by CCTV cameras. \"When I first when down to Margate,\" he said, \"my first contact was with the Roma, the Gypsies, who were the only refugees really who interacted with the locals. Even with them, what struck me was how little their world extended beyond what they called Margatta. They would make epic journeys to a strange place at the far end of their known world called Greyvas End. You don't have to be there long to realise that most of the asylum-seekers are clueless peasants. They are Kurds and Afghans mostly. Some have not even lived in cities before. They are all stunned, many don't move because they don't know what to do. When the local Margate kids go round spitting at them, you can see their shock because they come from cultures were people have manners, where strangers receive hospitality. To me, they looked like they were living inside a Kafka story.\" In a typical touch, Pawlikowski cast one of those spitting girls - who could have stepped from the scrawled pages of one of Tracey Emin's lurid teenage diaries - as one of the prepubescent gang who introduce 10-year-old Artiom to the joys of smuggled Belgian vodka and cigarettes, and the first, disturbing stirrings of sex. In this Kafkaesque Ingerland where caffs sell batter without fish and meat pies without filling, and where you don't get change from your food vouchers, Tanya and Artiom are befriended by Alfie, a skid-row fixer who works on the slot machines down the arcade and who introduces the boy to the rudiments of English (\"10 Benson &amp; Hedges, please\") and the correct way to mix his chicken tikka. When he first landed in Margate with his skeleton crew, Pawlikowski had little more than a loose semi-autobiographical story to go on. (He came to Britain from Poland with his family when he was 12). \"Initially Alfie [played by Paddy Considine, a former boxer who made a startling screen debut in Shane Meadows's A Room for Romeo Brass] was to be a much more ambiguous, slighty threatened character, but the chemistry with Dina was magical. Paddy is a real phenomenon. We all lived together during the shoot, that is part of my method, so we were able to improvise scenes and come up with new ideas in the evening and over dinner. I am an insomniac, too, so I just kept writing all night sometimes. That is the way I like to work.\" Like its director, Last Resort is a very peculiar animal. It mixes gritty realism with a very un-British dreamlike quality which transcends the grimness of its setting. The handheld, documentary sequences of refugees huddled in shuffling queues for a solitary phonebox or the interior fug of greasy spoons are cut with beautiful, lingering wide-angle landscapes to create the eerie perspective of people who spend their days peering out uncomprehendingly at the strange country beyond their windows. \"I'm interested in the forgotten places, the dumping grounds,\" says Pawlikowski, \" the places we have taken out of our mental picture. I want people to see images of lives that will catch them off balance.\" Surprises is what Pawlikowski is all about. He really surprised the BBC with his last project, Twockers. They commissioned him to go off and make a documentary in Halifax and he returned with a haunting TV film about a boy burglar who befriends a pregnant teenager, a kind of hyper-dysfunctional Kes crossed with the Lord of the Rings. It may sound unutterably depressing - three tabloid \"Rat Boys\" sitting on a settee above a sink estate discussing in their own skroaty slang what old dear to do over next - but it wasn't. Even the break-ins looked balletic. \"The kids we found and improvised with knew what they were doing,\" he says. The only tragic thing about this beautifully-crafted gem was that it could never have been made by a British director. Pawlikowski makes no bones about his belief that, with a few notable exceptions, British film-making sucks. \"I see all these guys running around that are all technique. They have nothing to say and the stupid thing is that they are not even curious and they don't care. They make films the way you and I go to the supermarket, picking this image and that style off the shelves. Everything is either plot, plot, plot or style, style, style and when they try to do something that reflects life or tells a story it turns into some awful issue-based thing. It is really frustrating when you want to see something original, something different. Most of the really interesting film-makers in this country are over 50.\" Pawlikowski has a great Polish love for argument, for taking extreme positions that can't possible be held and clinging on for the hell of it. \"My big problem is that I'm really a feudalist - the world and film-making would be a lot simpler if it was feudal.\" His recipe is simple. \"You have to be a conman to make really good films today,\" he says. \"You have to work inside the system but against it. Take the money and run.\" He has huckstered the BBC into backing his pet projects for the past 10 years. \"It's got harder, but as long as I kept winning prizes they let me get away with it.\" With Dostoevsky's Travels, he spun a hilarious and fantastical documentary around the writer Fyodor's great grandson Dimitri, a St Petersburg tram driver, whom he found struggling to break free of the clutches of an overbearing vegetarian German baroness who had held him prisoner in her schloss in Schleswig- Holstein: \"I rang [the novelist] Nigel Williams, who was editing Bookmark at the time and said, 'I got this great idea, Nigel, send me some money immediately, I'll explain later.' And he did.\" It may sound too bizarre for belief, but Pawlikowski made his name in 1990 with a still more deliciously satirical Bookmark documentary about Benedict Yerofeyev, the leg-pulling laureate of Soviet drinking culture whose hallucinatory masterpiece From Moscow to Pietushki is a sort of aesthetic discourse on the rigours of alcoholism. Every wino in Russia can seemingly quote from its exhaustive menu of cocktails in which eau de Cologne, French polish, and deodorant are among the more favoured ingredients. Pawlikowski's career hasn't been all Felixes, Emmys and Prix Italias, however. For four years the BBC's obsession with voyeurism and fly-on-the-wall documentaries left him out in the cold. Then his one brush with the lilliputian world of British star power produced what Pawlikowski calls \"my near nemesis\", the low-budget BBC and Russian co-production, The Stringer, where Anna Friel took top billing ahead of some of Andrei Tarkovsky's greatest actors. If Twockers and Last Resort were his time in purgatory to pay for the \u00a31.4m he blew on The Stringer, he has used it to hone one of the most distinctive styles of British film-making. \"You have got to go against the grain to stand any chance of making anything that will pass the test of time. When we went to Bosnia to shoot Serbian Epics, we must have been the only crew there who didn't shoot a single frame of fighting. That was a perverse thing to do, but the film we made has not aged like so much else that tried to catch the rage of the moment.\" Now that the world has completely lost interest in Bosnia, he has followed that logic to the letter by returning to Sarajevo. \"It has turned into this weird protectorate. It's crazy. I have this great idea...\" At the Thanet Times, Mike Pearce revels in a similar contrarianism. He wistfully regrets that the furore over Last Resort has run out of steam so quickly. \"I had thought there might be more in it,\" he says, though he is proud of how Margate has stood aloof from the racist excesses of Dover, where the local paper described asylum-seekers as \"human sewage\". Thanet Film Club are planning to show it in nearby Broadstairs, he tells me, but not until the autumn. \"Films like Last Resort don't normally make it to Margate,\" says Mike, \"I'm sure it is great, but it's not my thing. I'm more a tits and bums man myself.\" Last Resort opens at selected cinemas from next Friday.",

      "bodyText": "The Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid, returned from a two-week overseas tour yesterday and within hours flew to the scene of brutal ethnic cleansing to try to silence calls for his resignation and stave off impeachment proceedings. But his whirlwind visit to Central Kalimantan on Borneo, where indigenous Dayaks have killed at least 470 migrants from Madura in the past three weeks and driven out tens of thousand, failed to placate his growing army of critics. Amien Rais, the upper house speaker and a vociferous opponent of Mr Wahid, said that all the main parties had now agreed to send him a second letter of censure: the final warning under the Indonesian constitution before formal impeachment. Impeachment is supposed to take at least three months. But with Mr Wahid still defiant and Indonesia's economic, social and political woes growing daily, more and more politicians are willing to bypass the constitution and accelerate the handover of power to Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri. During Mr Wahid's absence she appeared noticeably more presidential. Mr Wahid's half-hour tour of the riot-torn town of Sampit and meetings in the provincial capital, Palangkaraya, were designed to dispel the allegation that he is indifferent to people's suffering. The allegation was prompted by his insistence on leaving the country after the crisis erupted and his refusal to return early when the scale of the slaughter became clear. His promises of money to rebuild settlements and improve educational opportunities for locals seemed to have little impact on the hundreds of Dayaks who were prevented from airing their grievances at any of the president's appointments. Within minutes of his leaving Palangkaraya the police fire at hundreds of stone-throwing protesters, seriously injuring at least three. \"The bottom line is that Gus Dur [Mr Wahid's nickname] just does not care,\" a presidential palace insider said.\"We've seen it time and again. He's cocooned in his own little world and is not going to change.\" Mr Wahid demonstrated his stubbornness on the flight back to Indonesia on Wednesday night. \"Whatever happens, I must remain president,\" he told reporters, adding that he feared several regions would secede if he stepped down before his term ends in 2004. Such intransigence and refusal to absorb criticism prompted Mr Rais to call for the president to be removed from office as soon as possible. In the past fortnight Mr Rais has organised several meetings involving the six major political parties - including, most significantly, Ms Megawati's Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) - at which he claims it was agreed to proceed with impeachment. If this loose and unlikely coalition of nationalist and Islamic parties holds together, then Mr Wahid has little chance of survival, because his National Awakening party controls just 10% of the legislature. Mr Rais conceded that there was no constitutional basis to hasten the special parliamentary impeachment session. Others are not so sure. Pramono Anung, a senior PDIP members who is close to Ms Megawati, said: \"The situation is getting so out of control so quickly that now we might have to ignore the constitution for the sake of the nation. Besides failing to address crises such as Kalimantan, Mr Wahid has failed to end the sectarian conflict in the Moluccas and appease separatists in Irian Jaya and Aceh.

He defended his widely criticised policy of \"good neighbourliness\" towards Zimbabwe's government in an interview with an Afrikaans news- paper, Beeld, by saying he was in no position to order Mr Mugabe around. But the impression that Pretoria is not only unwilling to criticise Mr Mugabe but has become an apologist for the regime has been reinforced by the South African justice minister, who said he did not believe Zimbabwe's judges were under attack from their government. Mr Mbeki told Beeld that the pleas for sanctions by the South African opposition and European politicians such as Britain's shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, were futile. \"In instituting sanctions, life in Zimbabwe would come to a standstill,\" he said. \"And then what?

      "body": "<p>Five million adults and 2m children live in households where no one is in work. But if they wanted to know how much better off as a result of this \"family-friendly\" Budget, they would have read your supplement (March 8) in vain. The harsh fact is that families suffering from unemployment (or \"workless households\" as they now are) are barely any better off. Working families will gain by up to \u00a336 per week, but many unemployed families - too poor to benefit from any of the panoply of tax credits now on offer - will gain by a meagre \u00a31.50. Gordon Brown continues to focus his generosity on working families, whilst offering only crumbs and ever greater moral pressure on those who are unable (or in the case of many single parents) unwilling to find work.</p> <p>The latest turn of the thumbscrew is to require all single parents, including those with children under five, to attend \"back to work\" interviews. Yet the government's repeated claims that there are now 1m job vacancies to match the headline fig ure of 1m unemployed still ring hollow in many parts of the country. Not to mention the fact that one in five jobs advertised in Job Centres in Greater Manchester are so part time (ie less than 16 hours a week) that they fail to qualify for working families tax credit or any of the other \"welfare to work\" benefits. <b>Niall Cooper </b> <br>National coordinator, Church Action on Poverty<br><a href=\"mailto:churchaction@cwcom.net\">churchaction@cwcom.net</a></p> <p>\u0095 I and my fellow claimants of job seekers' allowance don't appear to benefit from the Budget, but I don't mind. I would gladly give \u00a35 a week from my munificent \u00a352 a week benefit, if it meant the Tories not regaining power. <b>P Day</b><br> Doncaster</p> <p>\u0095 This government can be accused of many things, but joined-up policy making is still not one of them. The \u00a31.7bn handout to the road lobby will severely dent the impact of the \u00a31bn provided for urban regeneration and offset tax changes aimed at those on low incomes. The government's own research shows that one in five urban dwellings are in poor environments, compared with just 4% of suburban or rural dwellings. Towns and cities are much more likely to have problems with poor air quality, heavy traffic and street parking nuisance.</p> <p>So the chancellor reduces the price of owning and using a car.

      "bodyText": "Five million adults and 2m children live in households where no one is in work. But if they wanted to know how much better off as a result of this \"family-friendly\" Budget, they would have read your supplement (March 8) in vain. The harsh fact is that families suffering from unemployment (or \"workless households\" as they now are) are barely any better off. Working families will gain by up to \u00a336 per week, but many unemployed families - too poor to benefit from any of the panoply of tax credits now on offer - will gain by a meagre \u00a31.50. Gordon Brown continues to focus his generosity on working families, whilst offering only crumbs and ever greater moral pressure on those who are unable (or in the case of many single parents) unwilling to find work. The latest turn of the thumbscrew is to require all single parents, including those with children under five, to attend \"back to work\" interviews. Yet the government's repeated claims that there are now 1m job vacancies to match the headline fig ure of 1m unemployed still ring hollow in many parts of the country. Not to mention the fact that one in five jobs advertised in Job Centres in Greater Manchester are so part time (ie less than 16 hours a week) that they fail to qualify for working families tax credit or any of the other \"welfare to work\" benefits. Niall Cooper National coordinator, Church Action on Poverty churchaction@cwcom.net \u0095 I and my fellow claimants of job seekers' allowance don't appear to benefit from the Budget, but I don't mind. I would gladly give \u00a35 a week from my munificent \u00a352 a week benefit, if it meant the Tories not regaining power. P Day Doncaster \u0095 This government can be accused of many things, but joined-up policy making is still not one of them. The \u00a31.7bn handout to the road lobby will severely dent the impact of the \u00a31bn provided for urban regeneration and offset tax changes aimed at those on low incomes. The government's own research shows that one in five urban dwellings are in poor environments, compared with just 4% of suburban or rural dwellings. Towns and cities are much more likely to have problems with poor air quality, heavy traffic and street parking nuisance. So the chancellor reduces the price of owning and using a car. The result will be a continuing rise in long-distance car commuting and urban traffic levels. The consequent noise, fumes and danger will undermine efforts to breathe new life into towns and cities. They will also disproportionately affect those on low incomes, who are more likely to live on or near busy roads.

Football's a proletarian sport and Asians (particularly Indians) don't by and large see themselves as proles. Our parents arrived here hard-wired for embourgeoisement; their concerns being home ownership, saving capital and higher education for their children. The idea of our spending endless hours playing football, rather than doing something constructive, was anathema to them, though it's a prerequisite to becoming even a mediocre semi-professional talent. Though I watch the game, I'm pleased my generation isn't in that working-class trap, vying for a handful of sporting careers seen as the only route to affluence. And I'm depressed by the mass still enthralled by the bread-and-circuses spectacle of football, who ignore the wider issues affecting their lives. Nirpal Dhaliwal London \u0095 How dare Geoffrey Wheatcroft assume that, because I was born in the East End of London not India, to call myself \"Asian\" or \"Indian\" would be \"repellent cant\"? His assertion that it is not due to racism but for historical and cultural reasons that there are no Asian players in the Premiership is itself racist. How does he account for Vaduka, Kewell and Bosnich? I don't recall Australia winning many World Cups. His final paragraph gives away its inherent racism. He wants many more Asians to play cricket so that England may unearth a great spinner. Of course Asians, being puny or timid, wouldn't make great fast bowlers. Just look at Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. Rakesh Patel London",

Mr Museveni has also been accused of harassing his opponents. \"His team have approached everyone on our task force,\" Dr Besigye said. \"Museveni has met some and promised positions in government and money if they leave us. Once they decline, the intimidation begins.\" The tension has been heightened by administrative problems, including a reduction in the time the elecoral register is put on display ofrom 21 days to three. This is bound to cause problems, since the electoral commission had already admitted that there were 2m more people on the original rolls than citizens of eligible voting age. The opinion polls consistently put Mr Museveni ahead, but only with 50% to 54%, far less than he secured in 1996. His critics hope that a smaller margin of victory could shock him into finally listening to his opponent's grievances. But Mr Museveni has already made it clear that he will never offer Dr Besigye a job in his government. \"I'm glad he said that,\" Dr Besigye commented. \"Because I don't think any one of us would ever consider joining him.\"",

      "body": "<p>On July 13 1996, just before the Royal Ballet School's annual matin\u00e9e at Covent Garden was about to begin, applause suddenly erupted from one side of the auditorium. \"It must be Madam,\" said those of us who could not see her, and everyone spontaneously rose to applaud the fragile, white-haired figure who had been wheeled to her place at the side of the stalls circle.</p> <p>Madam it was. Dame Ninette de Valois, who has died aged 102, had made it, as she had made it almost every year, to see the student dancers who would carry forward the work she had started so many years ago - the tiny enterprise that was to grow into the whole edifice of the Royal Ballet and its school.</p> <p>Earlier that year, on February 20, she had made it to Covent Garden for the 50th anniversary of the reopening of the Royal Opera House in 1946 with her company's production of The Sleeping Beauty. And she had come on stage for a standing ovation, led by the Queen from the royal box.</p> <p>She was also at Sadler's Wells that year for the final gala there, before the demolition of the theatre where her company had started. Far from being sentimental or nostalgic, Dame Ninette, although she never ceased to recognise the vital part which that theatre, thanks to Lilian Baylis, had played in the foundation of British ballet, knew it was time for rebuilding and lent her blessing to the enterprise. She had also travelled on a special train, at the age of 92, to celebrate the relocation of the then Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet to Birmingham when it was time for that company to move on and become the Birmingham Royal Ballet of today. She took a great interest in the reopening of the Sadler's Wells Theatre in October 1998, and of the Royal Opera House in November 1999.</p> <p>Characteristically, she spent her 100th birthday at White Lodge in Richmond Park, the junior school of the Royal Ballet, still mentally alert to all that was going on and applauding, as always, the young dancers of the future. For, as she once wrote, \"The work has not been thought out just for the present but for those days, months and years that go to make up the future. In brief there has been planted for you a true heritage. It is your duty to protect this gift - and see that it lives and expands.\" The gift, of course, was the Royal Ballet.</p> <p>The Royal Ballet was Dame Ninette de Valois's ballet, the Royal Ballet School her school. So she regarded them; and no one disagreed. Without her the 20th-century history of ballet in these islands would have been entirely different. Dame Ninette made British ballet. She had lieutenants, of course, but the generalship was hers, and she alone, in the formative years, was irreplaceable.</p> <p>Latterly she could not scrutinise, all the time, the working of both London and Birmingham companies and the school; but her occasional visitations, her questions and whiplash criticism never ceased to matter greatly. She always aroused awe in those, especially the women, who worked under her. To the last it was Madam's approval that blessed, and her disapproval that damned, a budding project.</p> <p>At any time in her long career, \"indomitable\" was one of the right adjectives for her, especially in the last decades of her life, when she refused to give in to the arthritis and other ailments that increasingly afflicted her. She was constantly in demand and was obdurately conscientious in meeting that demand.</p> <p>Hindsight may tell us now that in the 1920s Britain was, at last, due for its turn as a centre of ballet. The Diaghilev company, known in London since 1911, had made a particularly big impression here. So had Pavlova. British dancers - Sokolova, Markova, Dolin, De Valois herself - were beginning to be noticeable among Diaghilev's exalted Russians. But this was also a time when the French title worn by Diaghilev's organisation, Les Ballets Russes, was a pertinent reminder that these exiled Russians had made their artistic home in France, where the tradition of ballet long outdated even the Russian one.</p> <p>It would have been a rare prophet who, at that time, could tell that an enduring consequence of this gorgeous Franco-Russian marriage would be the determination of a young, rather solitary Irish dancer that such delights should be made possible in Britain too.</p> <p>De Valois was born Edris Stannus at Baltiboys, a country house some two miles from the village of Blessington in County Wicklow, and always insisted, like WB Yeats, with whom she worked, \"I am of Ireland.\" Irish she was, by birth and temperament, but it was to England - like the Polish Marie Rambert - that she gave her life. Her first dance was an authentic Irish jig, taught to her by the family cook, Kate, to perform on the stone floor of the kitchen at Baltiboys. Did that jig, which she \"adored\", instil in her the passionate understanding of native dances of the British Isles that she was, much later, to introduce with such sensible determination to the curriculum of the Royal Ballet School?</p> <p>By the age of 11, the family had moved to London and she learned \"fancy dancing\" from the fashionable Mrs Wordsworth, and then more professional exercises at the Lila Field Academy. Halfway through her 14th year she was on tour with the \"Wonder Children\" from that academy, had learned the Dying Swan from having seen Pavlova, and claimed to have danced it - sometimes with encore - \"on the end of every pier in England\".</p> <p>But she realised that more serious training in classical ballet was necessary and went to Edouard Espinosa for classes. She became principal dancer in pantomimes at the Lyceum and in opera ballets at Covent Garden; took classes alongside Diaghilev's dancers in London with Maestro Cecchetti; and became friends with Lydia Lopokova and L\u00e9onide Massine, with whose small company, in 1921, she had her first taste of working with Russians.</p> <p>Already moves were afoot to establish a British national ballet and De Valois, with her usual good sense and foresight, realised that the only way to learn how to run a ballet repertory company was to join one. She went straight for the best and joined, unconditionally as a member of the corps de ballet, Diaghilev's company. She was there from 1923 to 1925, and returned briefly in 1926. She danced and created solo roles in ballets by Massine and Nijinska; she learned about company procedure, choreography and, from her studies with Cecchetti and Nicholas Legat, the classic, academic dance.</p> <p>In 1926 she opened her own school, grandly called the Academy of Choreographic Art, and that same year had her now celebrated interview with Lilian Baylis of the Old Vic. Baylis \"liked her face\", liked her long-term plans for the establishment of a school and company - and the fact that she was not asking for any money. She offered work with her actors and singers at the Vic - \"\u00a3l a week, dear, for the teaching, \u00a32 for arranging a short dance per show\" - and a carrot. She was planning to rebuild the derelict Sadler's Wells Theatre, which would offer space for an embryonic ballet company. De Valois accepted her terms and never wavered in her gratitude for the faith Baylis had in her and for the support she gave.</p> <p>In the years of waiting for the reopening of Sadler's Wells, De Valois busied herself not only with her school but in working with Yeats at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, and with Terence Gray at the Festival Theatre, Cambridge. She was also creating her first choreographies, so that when the time came to close her school and move it into Sadler's Wells she had a nucleus of small ballets on which to build. With but one or two performances a week, and very few dancers, she had little else on which to build. But she had the immense good fortune of securing, right from the start, the services of Constant Lambert as musical director and, as invaluable guests, Markova and Dolin. It was Dolin's performance as Satan in Job and Markova's Giselle that really launched the company.</p> <p>In 1935, when Markova left, De Valois dared, very riskily as it seemed, to make a ballerina of the adolescent Margot Fonteyn. She introduced the great classics, one by one, into the repertory and, there being no more adequate choreographer immediately in sight, she set about supplementing the classics with a British repertory.</p> <p>Of her own choreography she was the toughest of critics, yet she was responsible for making much of that early repertory very British in character. She drew on artists such as Blake, Hogarth and Rowlandson for inspiration and decor, and British compositions old and new, guided by Lambert, for music. Once Frederick Ashton joined her in 1935 as chief choreographer, she was content to delegate much of the choreographic task to him, and in all the postwar years made only one ballet for her company, the unmemorable Don Quixote - to the Roberto Gerhard score. Yet three of her principal prewar works have lived on: Job - made for the Camargo Society, that curtain-raiser to the Vic-Wells company - The Rake's Progress and Checkmate. They have lived because they are well-constructed and distinctively British items in an increasingly Catholic repertory.</p> <p>From 1931 until her retirement from the directorship in 1963, Madam's biography is that of her company, although she allowed, in her enchanting autobiography Come Dance With Me (1957), \"a glimpse of the private side of someone's public life\". It seems in retrospect a story of regally calm progress, but it had its challenges and its crises. Until 1939 there was the formidable rivalry of De Basil's and later Massine's big touring organisations, which had inherited so much of Diaghilev's repertory and talent and came, every summer, to the big theatres of the West End, reducing the enterprise at Sadler's Wells to pygmy size. Yet, even before the war scattered them, these Ballet Russe companies were disintegrating. They had no homes; no Diaghilevs to bind them.</p> <p>During the war the Sadler's Wells company became homeless - and was nearly stranded in Holland by the German invasion. Temporary residence was found at the New (now Albery) Theatre; nationwide touring became necessary; the loss of male dancers to the armed forces was, somehow, surmounted. The momentous step of accepting the invitation to reopen the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, implying recognition of national status, followed in 1946. Perhaps the company was not quite ready. But largely through the new, sumptuous staging of The Sleeping Beauty (supervised by De Valois), it quickly acquired the strength to fit a bigger role. Then came the first visit to the United States in 1949; again a risk, again a triumph.</p> <p>By 1956, the infant Vic-Wells Ballet had gained its Royal Charter - through a brilliantly argued submission written by De Valois - which safely united both companies and their schools under their Royal name. The Royal Ballet had become a setter of international standards, a provider of dancers, choreographers and ballet masters for all save the eastern bloc. And even in that world it proved its quality on its first visit to Moscow and Leningrad in 1961.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the school had expanded into a full-time educational establishment, and when Madam retired from the company in 1963, it was to the school that she devoted her scarcely abated energy.</p> <p>In addition to her work building a national ballet, Dame Ninette lived a happy parallel life as the wife of Dr AB Connell, whom she married in 1935 (he died in 1987). It was an exemplary union of volatility and calm. While Dr Connell practised at Sunningdale, she was known locally simply as \"the doctor's wife\", for she was as efficient and charming in running a household (she was an excellent cook) and in dealing with telephone messages for the doctor as she was in running her company.</p> <p>She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1957 and a Companion of Honour in 1982, and was awarded the ultimate honour, the Order of Merit, in 1992, receiving in the same year the special award of the Society of West End Theatres for her lifetime's achievement. In addition, there were innumerable honorary degrees and decorations, accepted not so much for herself as in recognition of \"the company\".</p> <p>Lilian Baylis was not alone in \"liking her face\".

Her colleagues, her dancers - her children, as they could not help regarding themselves - loved her, especially towards the end when she needed them most.

      "bodyText": "On July 13 1996, just before the Royal Ballet School's annual matin\u00e9e at Covent Garden was about to begin, applause suddenly erupted from one side of the auditorium. \"It must be Madam,\" said those of us who could not see her, and everyone spontaneously rose to applaud the fragile, white-haired figure who had been wheeled to her place at the side of the stalls circle. Madam it was. Dame Ninette de Valois, who has died aged 102, had made it, as she had made it almost every year, to see the student dancers who would carry forward the work she had started so many years ago - the tiny enterprise that was to grow into the whole edifice of the Royal Ballet and its school. Earlier that year, on February 20, she had made it to Covent Garden for the 50th anniversary of the reopening of the Royal Opera House in 1946 with her company's production of The Sleeping Beauty. And she had come on stage for a standing ovation, led by the Queen from the royal box. She was also at Sadler's Wells that year for the final gala there, before the demolition of the theatre where her company had started. Far from being sentimental or nostalgic, Dame Ninette, although she never ceased to recognise the vital part which that theatre, thanks to Lilian Baylis, had played in the foundation of British ballet, knew it was time for rebuilding and lent her blessing to the enterprise. She had also travelled on a special train, at the age of 92, to celebrate the relocation of the then Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet to Birmingham when it was time for that company to move on and become the Birmingham Royal Ballet of today. She took a great interest in the reopening of the Sadler's Wells Theatre in October 1998, and of the Royal Opera House in November 1999. Characteristically, she spent her 100th birthday at White Lodge in Richmond Park, the junior school of the Royal Ballet, still mentally alert to all that was going on and applauding, as always, the young dancers of the future. For, as she once wrote, \"The work has not been thought out just for the present but for those days, months and years that go to make up the future. In brief there has been planted for you a true heritage. It is your duty to protect this gift - and see that it lives and expands.\" The gift, of course, was the Royal Ballet.

It is circulating on our roads, it is in our neighbourhoods, it is encircling us and it is a stain on our culture. It is not hidden or latent - it does not tiptoe about in the dark,\" she said. \"We see it in the plate-glass windows of Antwerp and Hamburg; it inundates the centres and pavements of Amsterdam, Paris, Athens and Rome; it is a product for sale in the markets of London and Madrid.\" Not nearly enough was being done by governments to clamp down on the traffickers or to identify and help the victims of \"this modern day slave trade\", she added. \"A shame on our civilisation, because all of us are in some way responsible. \"We are talking about societies that foster discrimination, poverty and prejudice, about customers - 'consumers' who have put their humanity in their wallets. \"Politicians who refuse to strike the evil at its roots. Citizens whose disapproval merely takes the form of ethical or aesthetic revulsion at a phenomenon which does not concern them - unless it knocks at their door.\" Her aides confirmed that there was growing frustration in Brussels that policies designed to tackle the problem were not achieving their aims, because governments had not bothered to put in place the necessary social infrastructure to look after victims. The EC has repeatedly told member states to closely monitor the working conditions of au-pairs and women who work in bars, massage parlours and sex shows. It has also suggested that the police, social services and health authorities should collaborate to identify and help those being held against their will. \"As far as the commission is aware, no follow-up has been made by the member states of these recommendations, although they have certain means to exert control over employers,\" the commission said. A special meeting was held yesterday at the European parliament to raise awareness of the issue but it failed to produce concrete proposals. The EC says 120,000 women and children are trafficked into western Europe every year, many of whom are bought and sold into forced prostitution, beaten, imprisoned, raped and sometimes killed. Most of them come from eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union, and the CIA estimates that traffickers can earn $250,000 a woman. The most popular countries for finding them are Russia, Ukraine, Poland and the Czech Republic. Three-quarters of the women are under 25 and many are teenagers. Traffickers use marriage and employment agencies and other front companies to smuggle the women into the EU after advertising in the local press for dancers, waitresses and club hostesses. The EU will shortly produce a proposal that will allow victims of the trade the right to claim temporary asylum if they agree to give evidence against traffickers. Women's charities maintain that the residency rights should be permanent.",

Identical twins, who have identical genes and upbringings, tended to get the same scores. Non-identical twins, with similar backgrounds but different genes, had different results. </p> <p>The researchers wanted to find out whether the capacity to carry a tune was linked to hearing ability. The results were surprising. Some partially deaf people turned out to be good at pitch recognition. But there were people with good hearing who simply failed to recognise wrong notes. And it became clear that listening to Mozart in the nursery could not improve a child's musical ability.

      "bodyText": "Karaoke kings and queens are born, not made, according to a study of the musical ability of twins. A team from the National Institute on Deafness in the US and St Thomas's hospital in London studied 284 pairs of female twins and found that the ability to tell the wrong notes in a familiar tune was inherited. The researchers, who report in the journal Science today, played the women a medley of 26 familiar songs - including Silent Night and God Save the Queen - some of which contained altered notes. Identical twins, who have identical genes and upbringings, tended to get the same scores. Non-identical twins, with similar backgrounds but different genes, had different results. The researchers wanted to find out whether the capacity to carry a tune was linked to hearing ability. The results were surprising. Some partially deaf people turned out to be good at pitch recognition. But there were people with good hearing who simply failed to recognise wrong notes. And it became clear that listening to Mozart in the nursery could not improve a child's musical ability. Up to 80% of it was inherited. Tim Spector, from St Thomas's, said: \"This is important because the general perception is that if you come from a musical family you are likely to have better abilities because of your exposure to large amounts of music. It's one I had as well.\"",

I've had messages of congratulations, and lots of people at work have come up to me and shaken me by the hand. On Monday morning I picked up a copy of every published newspaper. Matthew Keating",

The Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) has issued further guidelines on new clinical signs for diagnosis in sheep.</p> <p>Up until then, we felt we were all fairly on the ball about the difficulties of checking the sheep, as we were already aware of the sheep symptoms, and extremely conscious that they are very hard to spot. But we must now look for new signs, which include ewes aborting their lambs (every farmer's biggest nightmare at this time of the year), and apparently healthy lambs dropping dead for no apparent reason.</p> <p>Also, rather alarmingly, it states that sometimes as little as 5% of the animals in a flock may show any symptoms. Since we have almost 1,300 head of sheep spread out across the farm, 5% is only 65. But we'll keep looking. We do look at every single animal every day, and we do know which sheep is last to come for food in each group, or notice if any are looking off colour.</p> <p>We have printed out several copies of the new advice and given one to Graham, who works for us. The biggest problem is that all these \"new\" symptoms are also indications of other conditions that we expect to find at this time of the year. One or two sheep do often abort their lambs, not necessarily because of a disease, sometimes just as a result of being knocked or bullied at the troughs. There are other diseases, and nasty ones, too, which cause abortion, lameness and a condition called twin-lamb disease, which makes ewes very listless and puts them off their food. If left untreated with this condition the ewes die, which, as any cynical sheep farmer will tell you, is an ovine's greatest wish in life anyway.</p> <p>Family after family is now caught up in the spreading crisis. The Brough family keep only six hoggs (last year's lambs) a couple of miles from Heddon-on-the-Wall. These half-dozen animals are destined for the freezer. After the Waugh brothers' pig farm at Heddon was confirmed with foot and mouth at the weekend, Ann Brough and her son, David, took every precaution possible around their small holding. While they were busy with this task involving the use of formaldehyde (in place of disinfectant) their dog - a lurcher, named, Mr Jinks - devoured the family's lunchtime roast chicken.</p> <p>On Monday, one of the hoggs was lame (as sheep frequently are) and a telephone call was made to their own vet. The vet was busy operating and advised the Broughs to ring the ministry. They did, and the farm was duly cordoned off and a sample taken for testing. The following day, relations arrived from the US and were not allowed anywhere near the farm or the family until the final day of their stay, when Ann, under a licence from Maff, was able to break out of confinement to see them.</p> <p>Needless to say the one lame sheep is fully recovered now and there have been no further signs of disease among the other five sheep. Ann says she has never felt so disconsolate in her life and the whole experience has been very degrading. And I can only guess that when these six hoggs are gone, next year's meat will come from the butcher.</p> <p>I've wormed the dogs today, and written this up in our animal medicine book. We are members of a farm assurance scheme (Farm Assured British Beef and Lamb, known as FABBL), part of Assured British Meat (ABM). Under this scheme we are registered and checked by an independent inspector to make sure we farm within the strict guidelines. The criteria set by FABBL cover all sorts of aspects: animal management, feeding, housing, handling and veterinary treatment. And this means that Pearl and Tigger (who cuddles up to the Aga all day long) must be included in the records. I wonder how many people realise that their dog is a potential link in the life cycle of a tapeworm? And that all \"assured\" farmers have such strict rules concerning man's best friend, or in this case the children's best and - owing to foot and mouth - only friends.</p> <p>Terrible news: the chief veterinary officer has just announced that this outbreak is set to run and run.</p> <p>\u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

Arafat really didn't want peace, according to the new consensus. Or if he did, he was much too weak to deliver it. He didn't want Barak, either.

Rabbis John Rayner and Jeffrey Newman said they felt a \"moral imperative\" to participate, adding that any hope of a peaceful future for Israelis and Palestinians must surely lie in their facing \"the truth about themselves\" and learning mutual understanding and respect.</p> <p>Some of the criticism that greeted their initiative was predictable: a British Likud leader said the rabbis had got their facts wrong, that whatever else Deir Yassin was, it occurred during a war for Israel's very existence, and it was not a premeditated massacre.

It accepted the rabbis' good faith, professed to understand their motives, but added: \"When the time comes when a Palestinian leader expresses the desire to attend a memorial day for any of the innocent victims of Arab aggression, I will be very pleased to accompany them to a future Deir Yassin memorial event.\"</p> <p>The older, more familiar political battle lines - in Israel and among Britain's Jews - will surely reappear.

Arafat could not even bring himself to deliver a formulaic expression of regret over the latest suicide-bombing in Israel, mounted during rush-hour near a crowded bus station. He has insisted, meanwhile, that any talks must resume where Barak (humiliated first by Arafat, then by Israeli voters) left off.

All have disappeared: some within 24 hours, some after a week or two, and a handful after several months. What evidence there is strongly suggests they have been trafficked into prostitution in Italy, where some 6o% of street prostitutes are West African.</p> <p>\"Jane\", a 16-year-old Nigerian, is one of only two girls to have surfaced again after vanishing from social services here (the other was found hiding in a church in Italy). Jane sits very still, and seems numb as she recounts her ordeal. Even when she cries, she barely moves.</p> <p>In Nigeria, thinking she was going to a party, Jane was taken by traffickers to a room where there were human heads on spikes. There she was forced to drink the blood of a dead woman. They then cut her with razor blades in small, neat rows, making her promise with each cut not to tell anyone anything, saying they would know because they had voodoo powers. There was another girl there and they forced them to lick each other's wounds.</p> <p>The traffickers then instructed her to return, bringing a friend, but she refused and so they sent her threatening messages. She met a man who, feigning sympathy, offered to help her. The cycle had begun. She was introduced to a man who provided her with a ticket and forged passport and told her to memorise a telephone number which she was to ring on arrival in London.</p> <p>Jane imagined that in London she would go through immigration on her forged passport and find a telephone. She had never been more than a few miles beyond her home before, and didn't know UK currency would be any different to Nigerian naira. She could barely read or write and forgot the telephone number, so when a Gatwick immigration officer asked her where she was going, she said she didn't know. She ended up in the care of West Sussex social services.</p> <p>But two months after her arrival there, she left, only to be arrested three weeks later at a port. The man she was with had been stopped before in the company of young girls, using the same passport as Jane had on this occasion. He had also been arrested in another European country, where an attempt to prosecute him for human trafficking had failed. Port authorities let the man go (despite a Customs and Special Branch request to the contrary). Jane was put in detention for five months, leading her to the brink of suicide before she was released back into West Sussex's care last summer. The Home Office turned down her asylum claim and she is currently appealing.</p> <p>Lynne Chitty, a senior asylum team social worker at West Sussex, who is looking after Jane, has heard many similar stories. She was told that a lawyer had come forward, claiming to have been instructed by Jane's father, and insisting that the girl was older than she said. Jane says this is impossible, that she doesn't even know who her father is. Chitty says that solicitors are used unwittingly by third parties to control the young people.</p> <p>She has watched the tragedy of such cases unfold since the first children disappeared in 1995, and she believes that of the West Sussex list of 71 missing, at least 40 West African girls and 14 West African boys have been trafficked into the sex trade. In January 1998 - by which time 10 children had gone missing - Sussex Police set up Operation Newbridge to gather intelligence on the girls. The boys were not included. A Missing Persons Helpline television programme resulted in a lead from a truck driver who had seen young African girls in lorry parks in Italy.</p> <p>In January 2000, the national crime squad presented a case against a number of men suspected of trafficking and prostitution, but the crown prosecution service rejected it. Current legislation makes convictions virtually impossible, and the authorities regard the few witnesses who might be prepared to come forward as unreliable because they change their stories. Chitty says they change them because they are too frightened to tell the truth until trust has built up between them and social workers.</p> <p>Chitty claims she has seen the traffickers: a woman hanging around a safe house who ran when approached by police; four men in a car outside a meeting of these children, who were watching her as she called police on her mobile phone. She and her family have been threatened. Disturbingly, half a dozen of the young people fitting the \"profile\" are working with the gangs, corrupted by money and power. Chitty knows, and they know she knows.</p> <p>DI Nigel Kent of the National Crime Squad, which led the failed investigation, thinks some girls know what awaits them here, \"believing the UK is the land of milk and honey\". Bisi Olateru Olagbegi, a Nigerian lawyer and women's rights activist, says that some see prostitution as an escape from poverty, but don't realise the horror of the conditions in which they will live and work. Nor do they realise that their debt bondage, usually about \u00a338,000 to traffickers, pimps and madams, will tie them down for years. (At Italian rates, a girl would have to suffer 3,000 clients to expunge the debt.) Olagbegi says that rape and even bestiality are used to control the girls.</p> <p>West Sussex social services has been vigorously proactive in tackling the situation, setting up safe houses, reporting every disappearance, working closely with immigration, police, the Missing Persons Helpline, the Refugee Council and others. Other authorities, notably Kent County Council and Hillingdon, have also lost children. For a few months last year, none left the West Sussex safe houses. But another girl vanished one Sunday lunchtime in October and hasn't been seen since. Chitty, who knew the girl well, and the others in the safe house, insist she would not have gone voluntarily and fear she is in danger.</p> <p>Chitty continues to report every disappearance and supply police with information, but feels it is futile. Detective Superintendent David Gaylor of Sussex police, who was involved at the start of the investigations, shares her concerns but says the police are not to blame: \"We feel neutered and disempowered.\"</p> <p>Gaylor says that when the issue was first raised with the Home Office two years ago, officials responded, \"in so many words, that it wasn't their problem\".

      "bodyText": "Human rights groups responded with outrage to a Chilean court decision yesterday which reduced the charges against the former dictator Augusto Pinochet. The 85-year-old general now faces charges of covering up crimes of murder and kidnapping rather than being responsible for them. \"This is an embarrassment,\" said Vivianna Diaz, president of the Families of the Detained and Disappeared. Speaking in the supreme court building in Santiago, Ms Diaz denounced what she said were political pressures on the court to save Gen Pinochet from further investigation and a possible trial. \"They are looking for a way to protect him,\" she said Carmen Soria, the daughter of the Spanish diplomat Carmelo Soria, who was murdered by Pinochet security forces, was even more blunt. \"This is crazy. If he didn't order it [state-sponsored repression], who did? In my opinion, he was responsible for all the repression. \"He didn't go out and kill people, but was he the intellectual author? Absolutely.\" The ruling by a two-to-one majority confirmed that Gen Pinochet remains under investigation and house arrest. His defence sought to have the investigation closed by arguing that the general could not be directly linked to the thousands of murders carried out during his 1973-1990 rule. But lower ranking army officials, cashing in what they call their \"life insurance\" in an attempt to show they were simply loyal soldiers carrying out sordid orders, continue to leak documents to the press that demonstrate Gen Pinochet's direct involvement in everything from drawing up execution lists to the ensuing coverups. The online Chilean news paper El Mostrador has been rewriting Chilean history recently by publishing a spate of secret decrees and confessions about crimes committed during the Pinochet reign. The judge investigating Gen Pinochet, Juan Guzman, will now move forward in his effort to to establish his role in the \"Caravan of Death\" massacres: the organised murder of political prisoners by a special military unit which travelled the length of Chile. The Caravan of Death is one of more than 200 criminal cases before the courts in which Gen Pinochet is implicated. The evidence in the case is particularly strong, since former army generals have repeatedly testified that murders committed in their areas of jurisdiction were carried out on the direct orders of Gen Pinochet in Santiago. Judge Guzman has repeatedly denounced the efforts of the Chilean government to scuttle his investigation. He was sanctioned by the supreme court, which many observers see as a warning to drop the investigation. But in the year since Gen Pinochet returned to Chile after 16 months of house arrest in England, the investigation has slowly progressed. While human rights activists still see many hurdles in their effort to have Gen Pinochet tried, their anger at the most recent ruling arose from the view that it would delay - not end - the ever more complex effort to prosecute him. \"This is going to be a very interesting year as the judges try to clean up their images - the Chilean public has no faith in them,\" said Ms Soria, who has fought for more than 10 years to have the case of her father's murder reopened. Referring to the dozens of top military officials now under investigation, she smiled and said: \"I love seeing them nervous.\"",

The meeting in Los Pozos, a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia stronghold 430 miles south of Bogota, brought together officials from the UN, Europe and Latin America, but not the US. AFP, Los Pozos Islands face economic crisis The Solomon Islands are weeks away from economic collapse, the governor of the country's central bank, Ric Hou, said yesterday. The economy has been devastated by a two-year civil war that has claimed dozens of lives and displaced 20,000 of the 300,000 population. AFP, Auckland",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Wherever you look, there is another image of his wife - on television, on bus shelters, on billboards all over town. The unshaven man in the red and white striped shirt and the beige cords indicates the magazine rack on one wall of the bustling French cafe in SoHo, a bowl-sized cafe au lait in front of him, the Bill Laswell remix of Bob Marley's Jammin' in the air. </p> <p>There she is again on the cover of yet another glossy, Sarah Jessica Parker, the star of Channel 4's Sex and the City, an actor who has entered the bloodstream of popular culture. \"People are consistently telling me how much they like my wife. That's my cross to bear. You get, 'Hey, Ferris, I love your wife.' At least they remember something. It's hard to walk around with her.\" </p> <p>Broderick, of course, is not exactly an underachiever. At 38, he's won two Tony awards for his work on the New York stage (one before the age of 20) and made 30 movies. Now he's set to star in a new Broadway stage version of the Mel Brooks movie The Producers, which opens next month and looks certain to be a hit, and in the film You Can Count on Me, which has had two Oscar nominations. But who could forget his performance in the title role of Ferris Bueller's Day Off? </p> <p>That was his defining role in the movies, the 1986 slacker film made before Generation X was allowed out without its mother, and he will never be allowed to forget it. \"I've made my peace with him,\" he says. \"I'm not sick of it. If people say something in the street I barely hear it. I suppose I'm abstractly happy, but it was 15 years ago.\" He would just as soon steer the conversation in the direction of his friend since their schooldays, playwright Kenneth Lonergan - once of the Royal Court in London - who is on the Academy Award shortlist for his screenplay for You Can Count on Me. </p> <p>Right now, Broderick is scouring a large article about his friend in a New York weekly to see if he is quoted anywhere. He is not. \"Don't I count at all?\" he asks, employing his best self-deprecating tone. This very night the actor is going to see Lobby Hero, Lonergan's new play. His talk is all Kenny this and Kenny that. </p> <p>Indeed, had they not been friends, it is unlikely that Broderick would have taken the part of Brian, the smalltown bank manager who is possibly even more officious than he is ambitious, in You Can Count on Me. \"I probably would never have heard of it. I think probably it would never have gotten through my agent. I hope it would but they might have sent it to me and I didn't read it. I was doing a play at the time and I might not have wanted to bother. </p> <p>\"Now people tell me, 'You're in my favourite movie of the year.' I never expected that. It's such a small movie. We just hoped it would get in the theatres and get distributed.\" The film has far surpassed those modest aspirations. As well as the screenplay by Lonergan, who wrote the Robert De Niro/Billy Crystal film Analyze This, Laura Linney's performance has earned her an Oscar nomination for best actress. It tells the story of a wayward brother and a superficially respectable single-mother sister whose respectively impetuous and staid worlds collide in rural America. The movie has a rare grip on reality raised by superb acting. </p> <p>The perception of those unaware of Broderick's parallel stage career is that he was a brilliant talent who lost his way in movies, only to rally in Election in 1999 as the teacher warring with Reese Witherspoon's precocious schoolgirl. It was as if Ferris Bueller had grown up to be a stolid, middle-class professional. </p> <p>\"It was just a coincidence,\" he says. \"It wasn't a plan. Election, I just loved the script and I loved having the part. Kenny's was just because it was Kenny's. My career's had its ups and downs really, but suddenly I've had a pretty long movie career. A couple of years ago I had a couple that weren't very good.\" He mentions The Cable Guy, with Jim Carrey, and Inspector Gadget - \"which did make $100m, by the way\" - but says it's impossible now for him to discern during the production of a movie how it will work out. \"You change and people don't want you to change and somehow you have got to bring people along. There aren't that many of us around that came along in the 1980s.\" It's not as though he was blamed unduly for these flops but, still, he was affected. </p> <p>\"If you think I killed Godzilla it's kind of unfair. It's all right. I don't know what people were hoping for. The Road to Wellville... it had Anthony Hopkins, Bridget Fonda, directed by Alan Parker. I hadn't been doing all that well and I was thrilled to get it and it just didn't work. It was a terrible movie but I don't think it's anyone's fault. There's no way I would have said, 'No thanks, I don't want to do it.' There's a lot of luck involved. </p> <p>\"I really don't know. I mean, when I did Election, from the time I read it I thought it was great, and it was the same at the read-throughs. But I've had that feeling before and the movie comes out and it didn't work at all.\" </p> <p>Broderick is still boyish beneath the stubble and the flecks of grey in his hair. He has been almost 20 years in the movie business and has been on the stage even longer. The first Tony was for Brighton Beach Memoirs by Neil Simon, with whom he collaborated frequently. The second, more than 10 years later, was for his musical debut in the Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. </p> <p>He has worked extensively with members of his own family: his first theatre appearance was with his father, James Broderick, who died in 1981 after spending most of his career on the stage; he acted in and directed his mother Patricia's script for Infinity, the biography of the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman; and Sarah Jessica Parker appeared in How to Succeed towards the end of its run. </p> <p>Broderick and Parker married four years ago. \"I imagine we will work together again, but we don't have any plans. It would need to be a genuine project. I'm not totally comfortable using a personal relationship. It bothers me. Sometimes I watch a real couple performing together and it's difficult to believe. I mean, a romantic comedy with my wife about a struggling actor and his director wife, and they live in New York, that would be very uncomfortable. It needs to be something foreign from our lives.\" Off the top of his head, he suggests they could be the competing leaders of two teams of dogs racing across the north pole. </p> <p>For now, though, Broderick is committed to six months in The Producers, while Parker will be shooting the third season of Sex and the City. She is the show's executive producer, and has won a best actress Golden Globe for her role as Carrie, whose slender frame and cascading tresses are the definitive emblem of a show that has infiltrated contemporary life to a phenomenal extent. </p> <p>\"Television makes you very famous. It's very strange. I've never been around that before. It can be very isolating and worrying. Disguises? We always fight about that. I'm always, 'Put a hat on.' She says, 'It doesn't do any good.' I'm a big hider.\" Now, for instance, he is wearing a fetching red woolly number on his head but only, it turns out, because it's cold. </p> <p>\"I've been famous for almost more of my life than I haven't been. It's part of my nature, which is eerie. Luckily, I've never been crazy big, where people can't go out and need bodyguards. It's a complicated thing and I enjoy a lot of it. I could have any table in Chicago (where The Producers had its pre-Broadway run) and people wanted to buy me dinner all the time. No check. In New York they let me pay.\" </p> <p>Broderick's sister suggested to him the other day that he might find life difficult if he had to contend with it as just another guy on the subway, and he agrees. He does not want to wait for ever for an x-ray or a new passport. But there is another side. \"You have a lot of conversations you really don't want to have. It's kind of boring. It's repetitive. Marlon Brando said to me, 'I haven't had an honest moment with a person in 41 years.' All right, you have to consider where that's coming from.\" Life is not entirely other-worldly, though, and Broderick must still confront some of the same dilemmas as us mere mortals. Such as, which of the women in Sex and the City does he like best? \"That's a dangerous question. Sarah, of course. But I guess I'd like to switch around.\" </p> <p>The home his parents bought near Killybegs, in County Donegal, when he was a child, does not allow the couple to escape in the way it might once have done, and not just because of a car crash 14 years ago. (Broderick, his Ferris Bueller co-star Jennifer Grey beside him, was driving on the wrong side of the road in Ireland in 1987. Two people in a car coming the other way were killed. He was fined \u00a3100 for careless driving.) The people of the west coast of Ireland cannot count among their blessings ready access to chains of multiplex cinemas, but they do have satellite television. </p> <p>Broderick's self-mocking side allows him to say that he hates to see other people winning prizes but he will be watching the Oscars on TV this time. \"I have to watch Kenny. It would be great if Kenny wins an Oscar. He was so enraged when he didn't win a Golden Globe. It can get you. I mean, when people say, 'I never could have done it without....' whatever. I don't like it when someone thanks God. I always thought God should be busier than to do the Oscar fix.\" </p> <p>You Can Count on Me is released on March 23.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Wherever you look, there is another image of his wife - on television, on bus shelters, on billboards all over town. The unshaven man in the red and white striped shirt and the beige cords indicates the magazine rack on one wall of the bustling French cafe in SoHo, a bowl-sized cafe au lait in front of him, the Bill Laswell remix of Bob Marley's Jammin' in the air. There she is again on the cover of yet another glossy, Sarah Jessica Parker, the star of Channel 4's Sex and the City, an actor who has entered the bloodstream of popular culture. \"People are consistently telling me how much they like my wife. That's my cross to bear. You get, 'Hey, Ferris, I love your wife.' At least they remember something. It's hard to walk around with her.\" Broderick, of course, is not exactly an underachiever. At 38, he's won two Tony awards for his work on the New York stage (one before the age of 20) and made 30 movies. Now he's set to star in a new Broadway stage version of the Mel Brooks movie The Producers, which opens next month and looks certain to be a hit, and in the film You Can Count on Me, which has had two Oscar nominations. But who could forget his performance in the title role of Ferris Bueller's Day Off? That was his defining role in the movies, the 1986 slacker film made before Generation X was allowed out without its mother, and he will never be allowed to forget it. \"I've made my peace with him,\" he says. \"I'm not sick of it. If people say something in the street I barely hear it. I suppose I'm abstractly happy, but it was 15 years ago.\" He would just as soon steer the conversation in the direction of his friend since their schooldays, playwright Kenneth Lonergan - once of the Royal Court in London - who is on the Academy Award shortlist for his screenplay for You Can Count on Me. Right now, Broderick is scouring a large article about his friend in a New York weekly to see if he is quoted anywhere. He is not. \"Don't I count at all?\" he asks, employing his best self-deprecating tone. This very night the actor is going to see Lobby Hero, Lonergan's new play. His talk is all Kenny this and Kenny that. Indeed, had they not been friends, it is unlikely that Broderick would have taken the part of Brian, the smalltown bank manager who is possibly even more officious than he is ambitious, in You Can Count on Me. \"I probably would never have heard of it. I think probably it would never have gotten through my agent. I hope it would but they might have sent it to me and I didn't read it. I was doing a play at the time and I might not have wanted to bother. \"Now people tell me, 'You're in my favourite movie of the year.' I never expected that. It's such a small movie. We just hoped it would get in the theatres and get distributed.\" The film has far surpassed those modest aspirations. As well as the screenplay by Lonergan, who wrote the Robert De Niro/Billy Crystal film Analyze This, Laura Linney's performance has earned her an Oscar nomination for best actress. It tells the story of a wayward brother and a superficially respectable single-mother sister whose respectively impetuous and staid worlds collide in rural America. The movie has a rare grip on reality raised by superb acting. The perception of those unaware of Broderick's parallel stage career is that he was a brilliant talent who lost his way in movies, only to rally in Election in 1999 as the teacher warring with Reese Witherspoon's precocious schoolgirl. It was as if Ferris Bueller had grown up to be a stolid, middle-class professional. \"It was just a coincidence,\" he says. \"It wasn't a plan. Election, I just loved the script and I loved having the part. Kenny's was just because it was Kenny's. My career's had its ups and downs really, but suddenly I've had a pretty long movie career. A couple of years ago I had a couple that weren't very good.\" He mentions The Cable Guy, with Jim Carrey, and Inspector Gadget - \"which did make $100m, by the way\" - but says it's impossible now for him to discern during the production of a movie how it will work out. \"You change and people don't want you to change and somehow you have got to bring people along. There aren't that many of us around that came along in the 1980s.\" It's not as though he was blamed unduly for these flops but, still, he was affected. \"If you think I killed Godzilla it's kind of unfair. It's all right. I don't know what people were hoping for. The Road to Wellville... it had Anthony Hopkins, Bridget Fonda, directed by Alan Parker. I hadn't been doing all that well and I was thrilled to get it and it just didn't work. It was a terrible movie but I don't think it's anyone's fault. There's no way I would have said, 'No thanks, I don't want to do it.' There's a lot of luck involved. \"I really don't know. I mean, when I did Election, from the time I read it I thought it was great, and it was the same at the read-throughs. But I've had that feeling before and the movie comes out and it didn't work at all.\" Broderick is still boyish beneath the stubble and the flecks of grey in his hair. He has been almost 20 years in the movie business and has been on the stage even longer. The first Tony was for Brighton Beach Memoirs by Neil Simon, with whom he collaborated frequently. The second, more than 10 years later, was for his musical debut in the Broadway revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. He has worked extensively with members of his own family: his first theatre appearance was with his father, James Broderick, who died in 1981 after spending most of his career on the stage; he acted in and directed his mother Patricia's script for Infinity, the biography of the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman; and Sarah Jessica Parker appeared in How to Succeed towards the end of its run. Broderick and Parker married four years ago. \"I imagine we will work together again, but we don't have any plans. It would need to be a genuine project. I'm not totally comfortable using a personal relationship. It bothers me. Sometimes I watch a real couple performing together and it's difficult to believe. I mean, a romantic comedy with my wife about a struggling actor and his director wife, and they live in New York, that would be very uncomfortable. It needs to be something foreign from our lives.\" Off the top of his head, he suggests they could be the competing leaders of two teams of dogs racing across the north pole.

Mr Byers told the Commons that the government would remove an exemption from the 1998 Competition Act that allows practices such as banning barristers from setting up joint businesses with accountants. He said he was acting on recommendations set out by the director general of fair trading and would be considering other suggestions set out in a report. Competition, Mr Byers stressed, was \"essential to an efficient economy\", boosting innovation, pushing down costs and ensuring a good deal for consumers. The director general said he believed the exemption, under Schedule 4 of the act, \"weak ened the incentive of the professions not to engage in anti-competitive activities\". The removal of the exemption will mean the professions can face the threat of financial penalties and actions for damages. The report also attacked lawyers' QC system and the lord chancellor's role in it.",

      "body": "<p>Television regulators were under fire yesterday for allowing ITV to screen News at Ten only twice a week later this month, and for entertaining a plan by Channel 5 to move its main news out of peak time. </p> <p>The weakness of ITV's News at Ten deal, reached with the independent television commission last year, was exposed when TV schedules were published: the bulletin, normally broadcast at 10pm three times a week, is to make way one night for a prison riot in Bad Girls. </p> <p>At the same time, Channel 5 confirmed that it was lobbying to move its 6pm bulletin forward by half an hour. </p> <p>ITV insisted it was not breaking its deal with the ITC, reached last October, when it was agreed that the late news would be usually be shown at 10pm on three nights a week. But the small print says the programme must start at 10pm on an average of three weeknights - ITV will have four bulletins at 10pm next week and two the week after. </p> <p>Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrats' broadcasting spokesman, attacked the arrangement. \"The News at Ten agreement which the ITC reached with ITV was a botched job, although it was better than nothing. But if it is being watered down, that's highly unsatisfactory.\" </p> <p>He also attacked Channel 5's plans to move its main evening news bulletin. \"There is a real question mark as to whether Channel 5 can be regarded as a public service broadcaster. Moving its news forward removes any fig leaf.\" </p> <p>David Liddiment, director of programmes at ITV, said its evening news won high ratings even when it was screened later than 10pm. </p> <p>ITV pointed out that on Wednesday night, its 10.15pm bulletin won just under 6m viewers - almost 2m more than the BBC's Ten O'Clock News. </p> <p>The extra delay in the week beginning March 19 is to make way for the first episode of a new series of Bad Girls, which features a jail riot. </p> <p>An ITC spokesman said: \"Their plans to schedule the news on just two days a week would not present a problem because the deal was that they would only be expected to screen the news 'on average' three nights a week.\"</p>",

The weakness of ITV's News at Ten deal, reached with the independent television commission last year, was exposed when TV schedules were published: the bulletin, normally broadcast at 10pm three times a week, is to make way one night for a prison riot in Bad Girls. At the same time, Channel 5 confirmed that it was lobbying to move its 6pm bulletin forward by half an hour. ITV insisted it was not breaking its deal with the ITC, reached last October, when it was agreed that the late news would be usually be shown at 10pm on three nights a week. But the small print says the programme must start at 10pm on an average of three weeknights - ITV will have four bulletins at 10pm next week and two the week after. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrats' broadcasting spokesman, attacked the arrangement. \"The News at Ten agreement which the ITC reached with ITV was a botched job, although it was better than nothing. But if it is being watered down, that's highly unsatisfactory.\" He also attacked Channel 5's plans to move its main evening news bulletin. \"There is a real question mark as to whether Channel 5 can be regarded as a public service broadcaster. Moving its news forward removes any fig leaf.\" David Liddiment, director of programmes at ITV, said its evening news won high ratings even when it was screened later than 10pm. ITV pointed out that on Wednesday night, its 10.15pm bulletin won just under 6m viewers - almost 2m more than the BBC's Ten O'Clock News. The extra delay in the week beginning March 19 is to make way for the first episode of a new series of Bad Girls, which features a jail riot. An ITC spokesman said: \"Their plans to schedule the news on just two days a week would not present a problem because the deal was that they would only be expected to screen the news 'on average' three nights a week.\"",

The teenagers had been flown into Gatwick from West African countries by human traffickers who use Britain as a transit point into Europe. The girls' original documentation was destroyed by the traffickers, who told them to apply for political asylum on arrival, detectives believe. They were told to claim they were from Sierra Leone, riven by civil war, and not from Nigeria, and also to lie about their age so they were taken into care homes. Traffickers take samples of hair from the girls and warn them that these will be used to carry out voodoo punishments on them or their families if they disobey orders. The girls have gone on to abscond from the care homes and are believed to have been transported to countries, including Italy and Holland, where they are told they will find work as hairdressers or shop assistants. Instead, they are forced into prostitution. Britain is being used as a staging post because the Italian authorities have become alert to direct flights from West Africa. However, travellers from other EU countries are subject to far less scrutiny. Sources said one suspected trafficker, a Dutch national of Nigerian origin, was arrested at Dover with a girl from a West Sussex care home in his care last March, but the only charge that could be brought against him was for allegedly handling stolen credit cards. Detective Sergeant Andy Cummins of Sussex police said: \"The girls are afraid of the men and well drilled in their stories. There is a loophole in the legislation in that there is no specific offence of human trafficking. To prove kidnapping, you need to show the person has gone against their will.\" Police first established a link with the Italian sex trade after one girl escaped and contacted West Sussex social services in December 1999. The girl, whose Roman Catholic beliefs meant she was not afraid of the voodoo threats, was interviewed by detectives but was unable to provide the information needed for a prosecution. \"She did not know who any of the men were. She did not know England and could not describe what route she had taken.\" Police in Turin said yester day they had found Nigerian prostitutes carrying British passports, but were not aware of any girls who had absconded from Britain. Charity workers say that around 40% of Italy's prostitutes come from Nigeria and there are 2,500 West African prostitutes working on the streets of Turin every day. \"Turin is the Italian capital of Nigerian prostitution,\" said Mirta Da Pra, the head of a project on prostitution and human smuggling run by the charitable organisation Gruppo Abele. Nigerian women began arriving in Italy to work as prostitutes in 1988 and today share the market with women from eastern Europe. Their increasing dominance of the market followed the withdrawal of many Italian women in the wake of Aids. Ms Da Pra said: \"They come here to escape from a disastrous social and economic situation in Nigeria, where women have a very low status - they are not even allowed to have their own money - and no prospects.\" The prostitution rings are run by Nigerian madams, often ex-prostitutes themselves, who will buy women for between \u00a35,000 and \u00a37,000 from the \"sponsor\" who facilitated the girls' entry to Italy. Men play a minor role in the organisation, acting as drivers, collecting money and occasionally imposing discipline through physical force. \"Almost everything is run by the women,\" Ms Da Pra said. \"They are quite fearsome and perfectly capable of administering a beating.\" West Sussex social services have now stepped up security around girls arriving from West Africa.",

Yesterday, after her death at her home in Barnes, south west London, he said she had been \"central to my life\".</p> <p>David Bintley, director of the Birmingham Royal Ballet, said: \"Aside from Sergei Diaghilev, I would say she was the most influential figure in dance in the 20th century, not just in Britain but around the world. What people forget about her now is that she was such a modern person: she was a passionate believer in innovation, in using modern music and design, in attaining classical excellence only to build on that to create a British school of dance.\"</p> <p>Ian Albery, chief executive of Sadler's Wells, where her first company was based, said she was the founder of British ballet and her death meant the end of an era. \"She loved the Wells as her spiritual home. She will be missed by us all.\"</p> <p>Dame Ninette's grand adopted title entirely concealed her origins: she was born Edris Stannus, in Wicklow, Ireland, in 1898, child of an army officer and a glass worker. The family moved to England, and within a few years she was on the stage, as one of Lila Field's Wonder Children. She danced Anna Pavlova's Dying Swan, as she recalled, \"dying twice nightly on all the coastal piers for my 'death' was always ferociously encored\".</p> <p>In 1923 she made her debut with Diaghilev's troupe in Monte Carlo, and although she could then have gone anywhere in the world, she came back to England, to start a ballet academy. She worked with Lilian Baylis at the Old Vic, and then founded a small ballet company based at Sadler's Wells.</p> <p>Out of that eventually evolved giants on the international cultural stage, the Royal Ballet, at Covent Garden Opera House, Birmingham Royal Ballet, and the Royal Ballet School.</p> <p>She was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1951, Companion of Honour in 1981, and in 1992 she was appointed to the Order of Merit, to which only 24 people may belong at one time.</p> <p>David Bintley was 18, also at the Royal Ballet School, when they first met. He had to count on his fingers yesterday to work out, with astonishment, that she must already have been an old woman of 79.</p> <p>\"She could be absolutely terrifying and I count it as one of the blessings of my life that I never saw that side of her. She took an early shine to me which never wore off. The dragon manner was business. Outside of that she was the most witty, delightful, intelligent and informed of companions.\"</p> <p>She had been frail for many years, and became so much weaker three years ago that it was feared she would not reach her centenary. She outlived a parade of brilliant figures who she had discovered and nurtured when they were young and she was already elderly, including Margot Fonteyn. \u0095 The ashes of Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who died 70 years ago, will not be returned to her homeland, it has emerged. Trustees at the London Cremation Company, which keeps the urn at Golders Green, north London, were told yesterday that Moscow's mayor, Yury Luzhkov, had cancelled the project.</p>",

What people forget about her now is that she was such a modern person: she was a passionate believer in innovation, in using modern music and design, in attaining classical excellence only to build on that to create a British school of dance.\" Ian Albery, chief executive of Sadler's Wells, where her first company was based, said she was the founder of British ballet and her death meant the end of an era. \"She loved the Wells as her spiritual home. She will be missed by us all.\" Dame Ninette's grand adopted title entirely concealed her origins: she was born Edris Stannus, in Wicklow, Ireland, in 1898, child of an army officer and a glass worker. The family moved to England, and within a few years she was on the stage, as one of Lila Field's Wonder Children. She danced Anna Pavlova's Dying Swan, as she recalled, \"dying twice nightly on all the coastal piers for my 'death' was always ferociously encored\". In 1923 she made her debut with Diaghilev's troupe in Monte Carlo, and although she could then have gone anywhere in the world, she came back to England, to start a ballet academy. She worked with Lilian Baylis at the Old Vic, and then founded a small ballet company based at Sadler's Wells. Out of that eventually evolved giants on the international cultural stage, the Royal Ballet, at Covent Garden Opera House, Birmingham Royal Ballet, and the Royal Ballet School. She was made Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1951, Companion of Honour in 1981, and in 1992 she was appointed to the Order of Merit, to which only 24 people may belong at one time. David Bintley was 18, also at the Royal Ballet School, when they first met. He had to count on his fingers yesterday to work out, with astonishment, that she must already have been an old woman of 79. \"She could be absolutely terrifying and I count it as one of the blessings of my life that I never saw that side of her. She took an early shine to me which never wore off. The dragon manner was business. Outside of that she was the most witty, delightful, intelligent and informed of companions.\" She had been frail for many years, and became so much weaker three years ago that it was feared she would not reach her centenary. She outlived a parade of brilliant figures who she had discovered and nurtured when they were young and she was already elderly, including Margot Fonteyn. \u0095 The ashes of Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova, who died 70 years ago, will not be returned to her homeland, it has emerged. Trustees at the London Cremation Company, which keeps the urn at Golders Green, north London, were told yesterday that Moscow's mayor, Yury Luzhkov, had cancelled the project.",

The study, in this week's British Medical Journal, focuses on the lower levels of breast cancer in the developing world than in affluent countries where food for most is unlimited. Grazyna Jasienska, assistant professor at the institute of public health at Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland, believes there is a link between low food intake and lower levels of the ovarian hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, which are crucial in the development of breast cancer.

After a disastrous opening night at the circus, a post-mortem at Gerry's gaff revealed the problem. Thing is, \"we just love entertaining people\", said one of Gerry's crew, holding a cheese sandwich. Unfortunately, there were only eight people to entertain that night, and four were looking the wrong way. Just as well really, as the Chinese kept falling off their bikes. </p> <p>Gerry roped in PR guru Mark Borkowski to drum up business.

Watching 16 girls repeatedly falling off their bike reminded me of watching Glitter repeatedly failing to be fired from a canon - a low-point for Gazza, surpassed only by getting caught downloading pictures of little boys. </p> <p><strong> Horizon: Children Beyond Control</strong> (BBC2) appeared to be the work of Chris Morris, as most documentaries appear to be these days.

Parents, he says, need to take control. Namely, by grabbing their offspring firmly in an arm lock and sitting on them until their personalities have been wiped into the shag-pile. </p> <p>Federici's bonkers theory is that dysfunctional children need to be broken down, a bit like recruits to the SAS. The bewildered faces of kids and parents, twisted on the carpet in combat, suggested that the only beneficiary was the deeply deranged Federici. </p> <p>Horizon was a sad indication of how estranged many parents now feel from their kids. If they want some respite from the domestic war, I find a session with Postman Pat works wonders.</p>",

Unfortunately, there were only eight people to entertain that night, and four were looking the wrong way. Just as well really, as the Chinese kept falling off their bikes. Gerry roped in PR guru Mark Borkowski to drum up business. Mark suggested getting the girls to cycle in formation onto a motorway. Gerry - also eating a sandwich (this one made with that disgusting Clover stuff) opted for some basic photo-op manoeuvres around a wet Trafalgar Square. The Chinese, increasingly nervy, kept falling off their bikes. Trouble At The Top provided the most poignant portrait of a circus down the pan since Gary Glitter's ill-fated tour of windswept seaside resorts in the early 80s was caught by the BBC for posterity. Watching 16 girls repeatedly falling off their bike reminded me of watching Glitter repeatedly failing to be fired from a canon - a low-point for Gazza, surpassed only by getting caught downloading pictures of little boys. Horizon: Children Beyond Control (BBC2) appeared to be the work of Chris Morris, as most documentaries appear to be these days. After laughing long and hard at this for about 15 minutes, slowly the mirth began to recede. Children are getting increasingly violent, apparently, and someone called Doctor Federici has the answer. Parents, he says, need to take control. Namely, by grabbing their offspring firmly in an arm lock and sitting on them until their personalities have been wiped into the shag-pile. Federici's bonkers theory is that dysfunctional children need to be broken down, a bit like recruits to the SAS. The bewildered faces of kids and parents, twisted on the carpet in combat, suggested that the only beneficiary was the deeply deranged Federici. Horizon was a sad indication of how estranged many parents now feel from their kids. If they want some respite from the domestic war, I find a session with Postman Pat works wonders.",

Their report reveals that between 1984 and 1999 there were occasions when the mortality rate in what was \"a small unit, chronically understaffed and underfunded\" rose above average, but that Professor Yacoub and colleagues quickly identified the reason and improved their methods.</p> <p>They describe Harefield as under pressure and yet taking some of the most difficult child heart cases because of Prof Yacoub's skill and refusal to turn anyone away. Yet Prof Yacoub and colleagues soon noticed if there was a problem. One rise in death rates occurred when two junior surgeons started carrying out a particular heart operation, so it was decided Prof Yacoub alone should do it.</p> <p>It is a very different picture from the scenario at Bristol, where surgeons James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana failed to recognise that they were not performing as well as surgeons in other hospitals - even when other doctors raised it with them - and that too many of the babies in their care were dying. Both were disciplined by the General Medical Council.</p> <p>Even now, six years after the Bristol scandal broke, there is no comprehensive and accurate database for surgeons to compare their results with the averages in the country. Prof Yacoub's unit recognised the occasional rise in death rates and took action to bring them down, but doctors in larger units where a rise in mortality might not be so obvious might fail to realise that too many children are dying.</p> <p>\"Producing this review actually proved to be an extremely difficult exercise because the two currently available national sources on clinical out comes - the Hospital Episode Statistics and the Cardiac Surgical Register - were found to be inadequate in providing accurate, verified comparative data which was understandable and usable.\"</p> <p>He added: \"This represents a serious gap in the system and means that the public might not be properly safeguarded against a repeat of a similar situation to that which arose at the Bristol royal infirmary.\"</p> <p>Dr Hunter said he wanted to see the Department of Health invest some of the money being \"lavishly\" promised for the NHS into a reliable system of national and local record-keeping.</p> <p>Mark Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS trust, said it was \"pleased to see that the evidence which suggested Harefield was a poor centre for paediatric cardiac surgery has not been borne out\".</p>",

Their report reveals that between 1984 and 1999 there were occasions when the mortality rate in what was \"a small unit, chronically understaffed and underfunded\" rose above average, but that Professor Yacoub and colleagues quickly identified the reason and improved their methods. They describe Harefield as under pressure and yet taking some of the most difficult child heart cases because of Prof Yacoub's skill and refusal to turn anyone away. Yet Prof Yacoub and colleagues soon noticed if there was a problem. One rise in death rates occurred when two junior surgeons started carrying out a particular heart operation, so it was decided Prof Yacoub alone should do it. It is a very different picture from the scenario at Bristol, where surgeons James Wisheart and Janardan Dhasmana failed to recognise that they were not performing as well as surgeons in other hospitals - even when other doctors raised it with them - and that too many of the babies in their care were dying. Both were disciplined by the General Medical Council. Even now, six years after the Bristol scandal broke, there is no comprehensive and accurate database for surgeons to compare their results with the averages in the country. Prof Yacoub's unit recognised the occasional rise in death rates and took action to bring them down, but doctors in larger units where a rise in mortality might not be so obvious might fail to realise that too many children are dying. \"Producing this review actually proved to be an extremely difficult exercise because the two currently available national sources on clinical out comes - the Hospital Episode Statistics and the Cardiac Surgical Register - were found to be inadequate in providing accurate, verified comparative data which was understandable and usable.\" He added: \"This represents a serious gap in the system and means that the public might not be properly safeguarded against a repeat of a similar situation to that which arose at the Bristol royal infirmary.\" Dr Hunter said he wanted to see the Department of Health invest some of the money being \"lavishly\" promised for the NHS into a reliable system of national and local record-keeping. Mark Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS trust, said it was \"pleased to see that the evidence which suggested Harefield was a poor centre for paediatric cardiac surgery has not been borne out\".",

      "body": "<p>If the prospect of two French billionaires fighting like cat and dog over an Italian handbag company sounds far fetched - think again. The two-year legal battle between Bernard Arnault's LVMH luxury label combine and Fran\u00e7ois Pinault's PPR group over the ownership of Gucci intensified yesterday, when an Amsterdam court ordered an investigation into alleged mismanagement at Gucci. The decision put LVMH ahead on points, but the fight is not over yet. </p> <p>At first the legal wrangle, which is lining the pockets of European lawyers and financial advisers, was over who should effectively control Gucci. But time has since marched on and LVMH says it does not want Gucci any more. But LVMH does not want PPR to have it either, and if the company's French rivals must have control LVMH want it to cost a fortune. </p> <p>Now the combatants say it is about principles and about treating shareholders \"honourably and fairly\". It is about who started the punch-up in the first place - and it is personal. </p> <p>Aside from the action alleging mismanagement, there are other claims flying around continental courtrooms. PPR is suing LVMH in Paris, accusing Mr Arnault's company of defamation and of dissemination of false information. Gucci, meanwhile, has trotted off to the European competition authorities, claiming that LVMH is not competing fairly. </p> <p>The figureheads at PPR and LVMH are old rivals, who coexisted quite happily until the battle for Gucci. Mr Arnault was overlord of a worldwide luxury empire without equal, while Mr Pinault stuck largely to retailing, mail order and a range of other business interests. Mr Arnault's stable of deluxe labels includes names such as Givenchy, Krug, Chaumet and Christian Dior perfumes, while Mr Pinault had the Printemps store group and the La Redoute mail order business. </p> <p>Nevertheless, to the outsider, it seems that whatever Mr Arnault has and does, Mr Pinault wants too, and vice-versa. </p> <p>The parallels between the two men are uncanny. Mr Pinault has Chateau Latour, Mr Arnault Chateau d'Yquem. The PPR man has Christie's auction house - LVMH has Phillips. Both have Paris stores, huge art collections, Paris mansions, second wives, villas in St Tropez and fortunes estimated just north of \u00a31.2bn. </p> <p>The lawyers' bills have been mounting since Mr Pinault muscled in on Mr Arnault's plan to take a big stake in Gucci. </p> <p>In Paris they call it La Guerre des Requins - the war of the sharks. In London it is the battle of the handbags. </p> <p>The trouble started when LVMH built an unwelcome 34% stake in Gucci. The Italians said the French raiders were trying, without making a full bid, to snaffle control of the group, which had been turned from a bombed out brand to the world's hottest high fashion label through the combined talents of businessman Domenico de Sole and Texan designer Tom Ford. </p> <p>To thwart LVMH, Gucci issued a vast tranche of shares to an employee stock holding trust to dilute LVMH's stake to 20% and did a white-knight deal with Mr Pinault, handing him a controlling 42% of the company in return for $3bn. </p> <p>Gucci's de Sole and Ford claimed that this was just what they wanted - the power to build their own stable of luxury brands to compete with LVMH. They have since gone out and bought a host of brands, albeit mostly rather small ones like shoemaker Sergio Rossi and handbag-maker Bottega Veneta. Cheekily they also snapped up the Alexander McQueen fashion label, even though the talented Mr McQueen is head designer at LVMH's own Givenchy fashion house. It also took over the YSL ready-to-wear label, and Mr Ford has moved in to work his Gucci magic. </p> <p>But LVMH went to the courts in Amsterdam, where Gucci has its main stock market listing, claiming that the new share issue was devised simply to cheat LVMH and that PPR should have been forced to make a full bid, at a premium price, which would have handed LVMH a handy profit on the shares they held. </p> <p>At first the Dutch courts upheld the PPR-Gucci deal, but the supreme court of the Netherlands ordered a review. LVMH upped the stakes, filing a brief accusing Gucci of secretly granting huge share options, worth millions of dollars and representing 5% of the company's share capital, to Mr Ford and Mr de Sole, to encourage them to do the deal with Mr Pinault. LVMH also reported the allegations to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, where Gucci is also listed. </p> <p>The Gucci duo insisted the options and the deal with PPR were unnconnected. Mr de Sole described the allegations as \"very trashy\", but he was forced to file an affidavit with the Amsterdam court setting out the details of the internal negotiations - usually guarded like a state secret - which led to Mr Ford being paid like a pop star with a package worth up to $25m. </p> <p>Yesterday the battle of the egos moved on again, when the Amsterdam Enterprise court backed LVMH's demands and ordered a full investigation of the PPR deal, saying: \"We need to investigate whether or not Gucci harmed the justified interests of its shareholders, one of which is LVMH. </p> <p>\"The PPR deal . . . is justified grounds to doubt good management at Gucci,\" the verdict said. But it will not look at de Sole and Ford's share options - unless they are found to be material to the decision-making process. </p> <p>Yesterday LVMH's advisers were cock-a-hoop. \"Gucci had no strategic reason to do the deal with PPR\", said a spokesman for the luxury empire. \"Before PPR emerged they always said they wanted to remain independent. They got $3bn off PPR and still haven't spent it. They've still got $2.5bn in the bank.\" </p> <p>LVMH want the court to force PPR to mount a hugely expensive full bid - handing the company a huge profit on its 20% stake - or unravel the bid, leaving Gucci out of pocket by $3bn, although LVMH says it would ensure a new $3bn share issue to enable Gucci to build its own empire, this time open to all Gucci shareholders. </p> <p>Gucci is playing it cool. \"We have nothing to fear or hide from the inquiry\", said a spokesman. \"In all cases the company and its management have acted entirely properly. We want to put this whole damn matter to rest and we believe the inquiry will leave the deal with PPR intact.\" </p> <p>The investigation by three prominent Dutch legal and business figures, who will have access to the minutes of Gucci board meetings, is likely to take up to six months. Another court case will follow to rule on the findings. </p> <p>But there is always a chance that the two giant egos locked in combat could call off their fight. Last summer they came close to a deal that would have handed $100 a share to LVMH for its 20m shares to call the whole thing off. The deal fell through at the last minute. </p> <p>As the LVMH spokesman said last night: \"We are always open to finding solutions\" - so long, we assume, as it punishes Mr Pinault in the pocket. </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,448935,00.html\">\"Let my people talk to your people\"</a></p>",

LVMH upped the stakes, filing a brief accusing Gucci of secretly granting huge share options, worth millions of dollars and representing 5% of the company's share capital, to Mr Ford and Mr de Sole, to encourage them to do the deal with Mr Pinault. LVMH also reported the allegations to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, where Gucci is also listed. The Gucci duo insisted the options and the deal with PPR were unnconnected. Mr de Sole described the allegations as \"very trashy\", but he was forced to file an affidavit with the Amsterdam court setting out the details of the internal negotiations - usually guarded like a state secret - which led to Mr Ford being paid like a pop star with a package worth up to $25m. Yesterday the battle of the egos moved on again, when the Amsterdam Enterprise court backed LVMH's demands and ordered a full investigation of the PPR deal, saying: \"We need to investigate whether or not Gucci harmed the justified interests of its shareholders, one of which is LVMH. \"The PPR deal . . . is justified grounds to doubt good management at Gucci,\" the verdict said. But it will not look at de Sole and Ford's share options - unless they are found to be material to the decision-making process. Yesterday LVMH's advisers were cock-a-hoop. \"Gucci had no strategic reason to do the deal with PPR\", said a spokesman for the luxury empire. \"Before PPR emerged they always said they wanted to remain independent. They got $3bn off PPR and still haven't spent it. They've still got $2.5bn in the bank.\" LVMH want the court to force PPR to mount a hugely expensive full bid - handing the company a huge profit on its 20% stake - or unravel the bid, leaving Gucci out of pocket by $3bn, although LVMH says it would ensure a new $3bn share issue to enable Gucci to build its own empire, this time open to all Gucci shareholders. Gucci is playing it cool. \"We have nothing to fear or hide from the inquiry\", said a spokesman. \"In all cases the company and its management have acted entirely properly. We want to put this whole damn matter to rest and we believe the inquiry will leave the deal with PPR intact.\" The investigation by three prominent Dutch legal and business figures, who will have access to the minutes of Gucci board meetings, is likely to take up to six months. Another court case will follow to rule on the findings. But there is always a chance that the two giant egos locked in combat could call off their fight. Last summer they came close to a deal that would have handed $100 a share to LVMH for its 20m shares to call the whole thing off. The deal fell through at the last minute. As the LVMH spokesman said last night: \"We are always open to finding solutions\" - so long, we assume, as it punishes Mr Pinault in the pocket.

It will be necessary to introduce measures to reduce debt, as well as dealing with taxes, local government finances and social security.\" The doom-laden comments came amid a cluster of gloomy economic data that helped to push the Japanese currency to a 19-month low of more than 120 yen to the dollar. The comments are a virtual admission that the government's attempt to spend its way out of a 10-year economic slump have failed. Japan has introduced more than a dozen pump priming packages totalling more than 111 trillion yen (\u00a3653bn) since the economic bubble burst at the end of the 1980s, but in the past five years, it has rarely managed to eke out an annual growth rate of even 1%. The country's addiction to public works has produced a rocketing public debt, which - including central and local governments - is forecast to hit 666 trillion yen (\u00a33.9 trillion), or 128% of national output, by the end of this fiscal year. Coming from the octogenarian Mr Miyazawa, one of the biggest spending finance ministers in history, and who is usually criticised for the delphic nature of his statements, the warning was a shock to many analysts. \"A national minister saying the country's finances will collapse is akin to a company president saying his company will fail,\" a Sanwa Bank currency dealer, Mitsuru Sahara, said. The alarm may have been intended to lower expectations ahead of quarterly gross domestic product data due out on Monday and expected to show that Japan has only just avoided its third recession in five years. Yesterday, a steep fall in machinery orders intensified concerns that Japan's economy, which is bigger than the rest of Asia combined, is deteriorating faster than expected because of weakening export markets in the US and the prolonged stagnation of domestic demand. The orders, which are seen as an indicator of capital investment, fell 11.8% in January, almost twice as far as analysts had expected. Separate data on consumption added to the growing fears of deflation that have been expressed by the Bank of Japan. According to the home affairs ministry, average household spending declined by 0.5% in January. The full economic picture is still far from clear as other figures suggested that corporate investment was up 7.1% in the final three months of last year, while total company pre-tax profits also increased. Politics may be behind the alarmist comments by the finance minister, who is expected to stand down soon, along with the unpopular prime minister, Yoshiro Mori. Mr Miyazawa may feel more free to speak his mind in an attempt to influence the direction of the next government's policies and to increase pressure on Mr Mori, who could quit as early as today, to resign.",

After years of underfunding, leading to fewer productions, smaller casts and the creation of a scrimp and save siege mentality, it can breathe again. Yesterday's news that 194 theatres and companies are going to receive an extra \u00a325m in 2003-04 means that the theatre can plan for growth rather than inexorable decline.</p> <p>Underfunding, so long the norm, is a tragic waste.

After years of underfunding, leading to fewer productions, smaller casts and the creation of a scrimp and save siege mentality, it can breathe again. Yesterday's news that 194 theatres and companies are going to receive an extra \u00a325m in 2003-04 means that the theatre can plan for growth rather than inexorable decline. Underfunding, so long the norm, is a tragic waste. It means that too much of the available money has to go on meeting constant costs rather than where it belongs: on the stage.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On the basis that there is no such thing as a bad draw away from home in European football Liverpool emerged from a pedestrian, almost moribund, skirmish with Porto wearing the fixed smiles of contented men. </p> <p>While it is inconceivable that the Portuguese will play with such timidity a second time at Anfield next week, G\u00e9rard Houllier's team will, nonetheless, be reasonably confident of laying claim to a Uefa Cup semi-final berth. </p> <p>Houllier's boys have learned much on their travels this season. This was an assured, competent and diligent display against opponents with a deserved reputation for football of a flamboyant nature. </p> <p>It was an agonisingly dull evening - in short, precisely what the Merseysiders would have wished for yesterday afternoon as they sat in their hotel watching the rain cascade down from slate-grey skies. </p> <p>\"We now have a good chance but the job is by no means done,\" said Houllier. \" What we musn't do is go into the second game believing that we have already done enough. We resisted well, we played well but they could still break us as they will have far more space when playing away from home.\" </p> <p>At the tail-end of a filthy day even the most cultured of feet were prone to error on a surface which favoured the artisan more than the aristocrat. </p> <p>The Antas stadium pitch was sodden, the tie going ahead only after the Italian referee Pierluigi Collina had undertaken a thorough examination two hours before kick-off. </p> <p>But an ability to adapt to terrain and climate is a useful attribute and over the past few months Houllier's team have proved smart enough to assess and then modify without apparent discomfort. They are men for all seasons, indeed. </p> <p>The diminishing band of critics who persist in decrying the Frenchman's methods, if not his achievements, shouted long and loud in the wake of Saturday's weak performance against Leicester City, insisting that their season had slipped into terminal decline. </p> <p>Houllier's response once on Portuguese soil was to display the sense of adventure which is coming to characterise his Anfield tenure. </p> <p>As in all four previous away games in this competition Houllier went with two forwards, the victim of the rotation system this time being Emile Heskey, relegated to the bench to accommodate Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler. </p> <p>With Christian Ziege adding class, if not pace, down the left side of midfield and Vladimir Smicer a creative outlet down the opposite flank, Liverpool always attempted to carry the game to their opponents. </p> <p>The conditions were so treacherous that much of the football was, of necessity, of a rudimentary nature. But for the most part Liverpool played with intelligence , distributing the ball sensibly and jealously guarding possession. </p> <p>Curiously on an evening that almost seemed designed to suit the predatory forward chances were at a premium. Indeed the game had crawled to its 24th minute before there was even a hint of an opening.

      "bodyText": "On the basis that there is no such thing as a bad draw away from home in European football Liverpool emerged from a pedestrian, almost moribund, skirmish with Porto wearing the fixed smiles of contented men. While it is inconceivable that the Portuguese will play with such timidity a second time at Anfield next week, G\u00e9rard Houllier's team will, nonetheless, be reasonably confident of laying claim to a Uefa Cup semi-final berth. Houllier's boys have learned much on their travels this season. This was an assured, competent and diligent display against opponents with a deserved reputation for football of a flamboyant nature. It was an agonisingly dull evening - in short, precisely what the Merseysiders would have wished for yesterday afternoon as they sat in their hotel watching the rain cascade down from slate-grey skies. \"We now have a good chance but the job is by no means done,\" said Houllier. \" What we musn't do is go into the second game believing that we have already done enough. We resisted well, we played well but they could still break us as they will have far more space when playing away from home.\" At the tail-end of a filthy day even the most cultured of feet were prone to error on a surface which favoured the artisan more than the aristocrat. The Antas stadium pitch was sodden, the tie going ahead only after the Italian referee Pierluigi Collina had undertaken a thorough examination two hours before kick-off. But an ability to adapt to terrain and climate is a useful attribute and over the past few months Houllier's team have proved smart enough to assess and then modify without apparent discomfort. They are men for all seasons, indeed. The diminishing band of critics who persist in decrying the Frenchman's methods, if not his achievements, shouted long and loud in the wake of Saturday's weak performance against Leicester City, insisting that their season had slipped into terminal decline. Houllier's response once on Portuguese soil was to display the sense of adventure which is coming to characterise his Anfield tenure. As in all four previous away games in this competition Houllier went with two forwards, the victim of the rotation system this time being Emile Heskey, relegated to the bench to accommodate Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler. With Christian Ziege adding class, if not pace, down the left side of midfield and Vladimir Smicer a creative outlet down the opposite flank, Liverpool always attempted to carry the game to their opponents. The conditions were so treacherous that much of the football was, of necessity, of a rudimentary nature. But for the most part Liverpool played with intelligence , distributing the ball sensibly and jealously guarding possession. Curiously on an evening that almost seemed designed to suit the predatory forward chances were at a premium. Indeed the game had crawled to its 24th minute before there was even a hint of an opening. When it came it fell Liverpool's way and it should, probably, have been converted. Fowler's lobbed pass set Owen free but he could do no more than steer his shot into the stomach of the goalkeeper Sergey Ovchinnikov after he had outpaced Jorge Andrade. Porto's lethargy became more pronounced as the opening half wore on, although St\u00e9phane Henchoz did have to step in sharply to whip the ball off Jesus Pena's toe as the striker shaped to shoot. The interval beckoned before Porto seriously threatened to embarrass Liverpool, Sander Westerveld saving well from Carlos Chainho after Anderson Deco's pass had forged an opening. Steven Gerrard's raking drive from distance on the hour almost interrupted the tedium but it was Porto who went closest to producing a defining moment, Pena screwing his shot wide when superbly placed midway through the second half. \"We defended magnificently,\" said Houllier, beaming. They did indeed. Porto (4-3-3): Ovchinnikov; Nelson, Costa (Aloisio, 59min), Andrade, Secretario; Paredes, Deco, Chainho; Drulovic (Candido, 74), Pena, Capucho. Liverpool (4-4-2): Westerveld; Babbel, Hyypia, Henchoz, Carragher; Smicer, Gerrard, Hamann, Ziege (Murphy, 55); Fowler (Heskey, 70), Owen (Barmby, 80).

Like its predecessors, the play presents a domestic catastrophe of seismic proportions, the author homing in on the most vulnerable point on the familial fault-line - in this case the reunion of two brothers of widely divergent fortunes who have not spoken in 16 years.

      "bodyText": "While Arthur Miller continues to clog repertory schedules with floods of Death of a Salesman and voluminous numbers of A View From the Bridge, it remains a mystery why there should be such a paucity of The Price - an elegantly tooled miniature from 1968 which articulates Miller's favourite themes more lucidly and pointedly than its baggier, better-known big brothers - and provided the author with his last bona fide Broadway hit. If All My Sons, Death of a Salesman and View From the Bridge are Miller's great Depression symphonies, The Price is a string quartet on a familiar theme. Like its predecessors, the play presents a domestic catastrophe of seismic proportions, the author homing in on the most vulnerable point on the familial fault-line - in this case the reunion of two brothers of widely divergent fortunes who have not spoken in 16 years. Over the course of two coruscating hours of tersely plotted drama we find out why.
