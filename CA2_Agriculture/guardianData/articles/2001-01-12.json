Adair has said he will mount a high court appeal. Security sources had warned that members of the UDA and UFF, many of whom are be coming increasingly disenchanted with the peace process, could use the Adair case as an excuse to attack Roman Catholics. The bomb came as UDA elements were accused of involvement in escalating loyalist violence against nationalists in other parts of the Northern Ireland. Two Larne families narrowly escaped injury in two pipe bomb attacks within 24 hours of each other and 16-year-old boy had a lucky escape after carrying a device from his garden in Kilrea, Co Londonderry. William McCambridge, who has four children, said after a pipe bomb was hurled through the window of his home: \"This is happening week in, week out. Eventually someone is going to get killed.\" He appealed to the loyalist Ulster Democratic party and Progressive Unionists to try to end the violence. There have been more than 30 pipe bombings, an average of two a week, since October. A nationalist SDLP assemblyman, Danny O'Connor, who represents the Larne area, accused loyalists of trying to drive out all Catholics. \"A lot of people don't want to admit it, but there is a form of ethnic cleansing going on in Larne,\" he said. \"If this goes on, sooner or later someone is going to die. Catholics just don't feel safe anywhere.\" Mr O'Connor, whose brother escaped injury when a nail bomb went off in his flat a few months ago, has given a dossier on 160 incidents in the past two years to the British and Irish governments. He called on the RUC to stage more covert operations to catch those responsible, and appealed to the Protestant community to help. \"Someone knows the bully boys who are doing this. I suspect UDA elements are involved,\" he said. RUC sub-divisional commander Karen Kennedy said the attacks were \"cowardly and reckless\" and urged anyone with information to contact the police. Supt Kennedy said her officers had carried out more than 300 operations specifically to combat sectarianism in Larne in recent months.",

      "body": "<p>My eyes shot open. There it was again. Something was moving outside my bure (Fijian for traditional thatched building full of bugs). As my eyes became accustomed to the dark, I saw a hand creep through the open window. It crawled down the wall searching for me and then grabbed me by the shoulder. </p> <p> \"I'm awake, I'm awake!\" I shrilled and leapt out of bed, cracking my head on the bunk above me. As I rolled about on the floor, moaning softly, I heard a voice asking in a puzzled whisper, \"Are you okay, Mr Sam?\" </p> <p> It was 4.30 in the morning. Not my favourite time of day, but I was going on a hike up Wayasera's mountain to see the sunrise. I had been on the island for four days now and thought it was time to do something active. </p> <p> After checking to make sure I was definitely awake (no doubt about that), my guide Naputo moved on to wake the others. I got dressed by torchlight, being careful not to look too closely at the rustling walls. I had seen a spider the size of my hand the night before and had come to the conclusion that denial was the best approach. If I couldn't see the the spiders, they couldn't see me. </p> <p> I walked out and found the others. There were four in our little group: barefoot Naputo, Milan and Helen, both American, and me. With three torches between us we set off up a trail behind the village. </p> <p> After only a few steps I was pouring with sweat. The heat and humidity were intense, and the creaking cicadas all around us seemed to make it worse. We climbed steadily up through the undergrowth, slipping and tripping. </p> <p> As we got higher I could see pale streaks shooting out of the eastern sky. We hurried on - sunrise was not far off. Then we were out of the jungle and climbing over rocks. It was light enough to see now and we left the torches on the path. </p> <p> Naputo said we were almost there. There was just one more hurdle; a walk along a narrow edge with a sheer drop on both sides. We gingerly stepped (or in my case crawled) along it... and there we were, on top of the island. </p> <p> We were just in time. The sun came up 10 minutes later and the sea sparkled. Below stretched the islands of the Yasawas marching off towards the horizon. I guess it was a view worth getting up for. </p> <p> I spent a week relaxing on Wayasera. It's a lovely place; what makes it extra special is that it's run by the island's villagers. All the proceeds from the holiday makers go straight back into the community - to provide new books for the school, for example. And because they live there too, the villagers are always around - calling 'bula' (hello) to you and shaking your hand. There are activities (organised by the smiling Big Jerry) such as snorkelling, a trip to the local village or the hike I did. And I met lots of nice people including two new card playing companions, Zoe and 'pokerface' Cathy. </p> <p> So it was all very pleasant. But after I'd read all my books and reorganised my bag (for the millionth time on this trip - I'm still trying to get it down to a weight that I can lift) I did begin to get a little bored. I know all you people sitting back home in the office won't want to hear this, but there's only so much sitting on the beach you can do. However, after having rushed round the US, I thought a little boredom and time on my hands might not hurt, so rather than going to the airport I went on to another island instead. </p> <p> This one was called Waya and I stayed at the Octopus Resort. It had the most amazing curved, palm-fringed beach and a coral reef right up to the shore. The green hills rose up behind the simple but clean bure accomodation, which sat virtually on the beach. The atmosphere here was rather more like that of a resort with good food than the other island - there was a definite distinction between the management and the local Fijian staff. </p> <p> Still at the end of the day, no matter how beautiful it was, it was still just another beach, and after the initial excitement of looking round a new place I began to feel boredom setting in again. In a desperate attempt to stave this off, I went to the village church (it was Sunday and there was nothing else to do). </p> <p> It's been some time since I last went to church, but I have to say that I thought this was a pretty remarkable service. After the usual readings the priest took the pulpit. He obviously felt his flock had been rather wayward recently, as he launched into an extraordinary fit of rage. There was much shouting and pointing of fingers. It was all in Fijian, so I'm not too sure what we were being berated about. I did ask afterwards but was told it was 'just the Bible'. All the locals seemed to be ignoring him anyway. They (and I) were more interested in the small child who kept trying to steal the hymn books. The choir was very good, though.</p> <p>I left Waya the following day and got a fast boat back to the mainland. With me were a very cheerful Australian couple, Ben and Amber, and a Swedish girl called Hannah. More card playing companions - although these three kept beating me so I didn't like them quite so much - only kidding. Ben and Amber should feature in my tales again since they very kindly - and foolishly - invited me over to see them when I get to Sydney.</p> <p>We stayed a night in a cheap hostel in Nadi (no spiders this time - just cockroaches) and then decided to travel down the Coral Coast to a backpacker place called the Beachhouse which Ben had heard about.</p> <p>I can't recommend this place highly enough. It was clean, freshly painted and they served coffee and cakes in the afternoon. This was my kind of place. The beach wasn't that exciting but I'd had enough of them anyway and the Beachhouse made up for it by having a beautiful garden with hammocks.</p> <p>After a very good night's sleep on a proper mattress, we joined the owner and his family on a hike inland. The local Fijians had just cut a trail through the rainforest up to a long forgotten waterfall and everyone was excited about seeing it for the first time in many years. It took a couple of hot hours of wading through streams and slipping back down muddy slopes before we reached the waterfall. With the sun streaming in, it was stunning. There was noisy rainforest all around and a small bathing pool at the bottom. With the others I climbed up to sit halfway, water pouring on my head and surrounded by little rainbows. As much as I liked the beaches, this is how I will remember Fiji.</p> <p> Now I'm in Auckland, New Zealand. It looks like England only tidier. I'm supposed to go floating down a cave on an inner tube tomorrow - so I'll let you know how that goes next week.</p>",

I will be phoning her soon when it's a decent hour back home. </p> <p> During my last couple of days in Nepal, legs back in working order, I met up with a young French woman, Valerie. We decided to take the trolley bus out to Bhaktapur. It was like being in a rickety tube in the rush hour, but with the added dimensions of spitting on the floor and huge baskets of wares on people's heads. I was dismayed to find that since my last brief visit to the city less than two weeks before, the entrance fee had increased by 150%. Amazing where a little wandering down lanes and up alleys will lead you. This time I did buy a little pottery elephant as a memento. I do love the place. </p> <p> A black spot at this time was when I discovered that I had somehow lost Rachel's tape. It wasn't just the music and the link, but she had put a photo of us having a cuddle in the case and also a little note that I hadn't yet read. I felt very upset - but she is making another one. </p> <p> There are many images of Nepal that will stay with me: the spectacular landscape; the scene at every water tap of the women always washing either the clothes, the children or their long, thick black hair; the calf muscles of the sherpas; the slow steady plod of women walking up the hills carrying huge baskets tied across their heads full of the packs and camping gear of trekkers; waking up to the bustle of the Tamil area of Kathmandu, and the sound of endless hawking and spitting which they do with great gusto; the humour of the people. I will miss it all. </p> <p> On Monday I flew back to Bombay. Having my Swiss army knife removed at the security check, I waited about an hour at the other end for it to be returned to me as promised and then gave up. My bag will be much lighter if I carry on like this. </p> <p> It is amazing what a difference a few weeks makes. Bombay no longer seemed so scary and the hawkers and beggars seemed less interested, or I found it easier to brush them aside, I am not sure which. That evening I met Steve and Bobbie, a pair of wandering musicians from Devon, who had made contact through the website. They took me out to dinner at the Taj hotel, Bombay's poshest. It was a most enjoyable evening in unaccustomed splendour. My thanks to them, it was much appreciated. </p> <p> And so, on late Tuesday evening, I was off to Singapore, where I arrived at 7.30 in the morning. The flight was made more difficult by the man next to me continuously fidgeting and picking at various bits of himself. I am surprised he had any hair or face left by the time we landed. My nephew, Daniel, met me at the airport, easily recognisable by the distinct family likeness, despite the years since we had met. He lives in a flat in a lovely combo, with its own swimming pool and gym (I haven't tried either). It is again a touch of luxury and very enjoyable for a few days. </p> <p> As for Singapore, I could not believe the difference from the Indian subcontinent. It is so clean and green, all the people so affluent and well dressed, the traffic moves in an orderly fashion down the four lane, one-way systems, the taxis and buses ferry you around efficiently in air-conditioned comfort. I found it disconcerting, unreal and alien at first but I confess to being inordinately excited that you could flush the paper down the loo. In fact in some toilets if you take too long the loo flushes automatically. A bit startling at first when you are relaxing and enjoying not having to rush out so that you dare breath again. </p> <p> I spent another incongruous evening in an Irish bar, which could have been an English pub but for the fact that the staff were Singaporian and the band were Australian. I spent Thursday exploring Singapore, mostly on foot, a tiring occupation in the humidity. First, down Orchard road, full of shopping malls. Being one of the few women who does not like shopping I was content to wander, wondering how so many people can shop so much in so many shops. On to Raffles, to soak up the colonial atmosphere. Not having been able to stand gin since I was very ill on it as a student, I didn't have a gin sling. Next a boat ride on the river in a 'bum boat'. There was an immaculately timed taped commentary as you passed each landmark. I was doing really well finding my way about until I wanted to go back after eating, at about 9.30. Scorning the long taxi queue I walked, trying to hail one as I went. Soon utterly lost and very tired, I stood under many street lights trying to read the map until I managed to find my way back to Orchard road and a taxi. At that time of night the taxis will not pick you up if it is time for them to eat or if you are not going in the direction they fancy. I finally reached Daniel's at 11.30. </p> <p> Today I have booked a flight to Kuching in Eastern Malaysia for Sunday, made contact with my son's girlfriend's Uncle Steven and posted off my first parcel home, which includes Rachel's birthday present. It will probably arrive about April. The thought was there today! I also went to China town, which had some of the vibrancy and colour that I have missed since arriving here. I will probably go to Sentosa Island tomorrow as I want to ride the cable car that several of you have mentioned. It was going to be the night safari tonight but, as ever, this report has taken longer than expected, so sorry Gemma, I am probably going to choose my bed instead. Maybe on my way back. Singapore is very comfortable and enjoyable, but I am looking forward to exploring again in Malaysia.</p> <p> Time to ring my daughter now. Bye until next week from Malaysia.</p>",

The meeting follows a failed attempt by the Conservatives for three separate debates between the leaders of the three parties. \"We have rejected plans by the Conservatives, because we would have to include Sky in the debate,\" said Steve Anderson, ITV's controller of news, current affairs, religion and arts. Mr Anderson added that he thought three hours of election debates would have been \"too much\" for viewers. BBC sources were more circumspect, but one said: \"The feeling is that we wanted to keep it just to terrestrial broadcasters\". Plans put forward by the Conservative party were for three debates, each featuring two of the three party leaders. The Conservatives were keen to bring Sky News on board. But the terrestrial broadcasters were unwilling to air programming produced by Rupert Murdoch-owned Sky News. Mr Anderson denied reports that the \"intransigence\" of broadcasters and the Conservative party had \"put the kibosh\" on the debates. \"The BBC and ITV have cleared an hour each and to unpick that would mean creating a division between BBC and ITV.\" A BBC insider claimed that it was now only Labour that was stalling on the plans. The three political parties have an end-of-January deadline to come back to broadcasters to accept or reject the proposals. The current plan would be for two three-way debates between the party leaders, one, on the BBC, hosted by David Dimbleby, and the second, on ITV, by his brother Jonathan.

      "bodyText": "William Hague yesterday claimed that his own brand of Eurosceptic realism was better-placed to protect Britain's interests in Europe - and to revitalise the EU - than Tony Blair's \"heart of Europe\" strategy. Addressing a conference of rightwing European party leaders in Berlin, the Tory leader rehearsed his election campaign plan to put reform of the EU's farm policy at the centre of the drive to achieve enlargement of the 15-nation union to the south and east by 2003 if possible. In what Tory aides billed as a constructive and positive approach - which contrasted with Labour claims that Mr Hague was heading for total withdrawal from the EU - Mr Hague also warned fellow-members of the European Democrat Union that applicant states must not be forced into \"a rigid straitjacket of legislation especially on social policy.\" He also invoked what may prove a campaign slogan, the right of different EU states \"to combine in different combinations for different purposes and to a different extent, what we call a network Europe\" - in contrast to talk of \"pioneer groups\" and inner cores by some EU leaders. But the key element in the Conservatives' new approach was an emphasis on overhauling the 45 year-old common agricultural policy. It was the EU's most anomalous and costly mechanism, still taking half the budget, and the most fiercely defended by key agri-states led by France. At yesterday's EDU meeting, attended by leaders from inside and outside the EU, Mr Hague branded the CAP \"indefensible socially, economically, ecologically, environmentally and morally\". He added: \"It needs change\". In a document strongly influenced by Tory thinking, the leaders of the parties making up the EDU committed themselves to making CAP reform a priority. The admission of less developed states like Poland, with huge farm industries, would render an unreformed CAP insupportably expensive. However, their joint declaration also pointed to glaring differences between British and continental conservatives on other key issues, a point gleefully highlighted by Labour HQ in London. The last EDU declaration endorsed such priorities for Europe as the promotion and protection of human rights; social responsibility; the protection of the environment; effective decisionmaking, a euphemism for majority voting; and strong support for European security and stability, a topic which alarms pro-Nato Tories. Yesterday Mr Hague spoke glowingly of enlarging the EU. \"It is simply unacceptable that we are meeting in Berlin today over a decade after the collapse of communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall while there is still no clear end in sight for the applicant states\", he told the meeting. This is scarcely what had been expected from the leader of a party which rejected the outcome of last month's Nice summit, held specifically to prepare for enlargement by improving decision-making. Mr Blair has mocked the Conservatives for threatening to veto enlargement to as many as 27 EU members simply because the Nice package included more qualified majority voting in the Brussels council of ministers. At Mr Hague's side yesterday Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said the Conservatives could sign up to a Nice treaty that was solely about enlargement. \u0095 An ICM poll, commissioned by Business for Sterling, found that 56% of British voters (66% in the 18-24 age range) wanted to stay in the EU and keep the pound. Only 15% chose to leave the EU and only 21% wanted to join the euro.",

      "body": "<p>That next day in Wollangambe was undoubtedly my favourite of the trip so far. Shaun the hostel owner had left early for work, leaving the residents to their own devices. The night before, the knowledgeable American fellow hosteller Scott had described a sheer cliff which sits on an incredibly deep dam, and I'd been dying to get there. Armed with his scribbled map we set out through the bush, beating off the flies with a stick, and after about half an hour came across the place. </p> <p>It had been my ambition to jump from the top into the dam - both Scott and Shaun's son had said it was fine. However after a short swim and a 25-foot climb it did look pretty high up there! It wasn't until a 15-year old local boy did the jump first that I had the courage to leap. . . and it was incredibly exhilarating! Josh was just seconds behind me and I think for him it must have been worse as he's scared of heights - still, those few seconds of hanging and falling will stick in my memory! </p> <p>After a quick swim we headed back for the lodge just in time to escape the thunder storm that had been brewing. We were desperate for it to die down as I wanted to go kangaroo searching in the evening. I wasn't disappointed. Again using a map drawn by Scott we set out just before dusk for a spot where travellers before had seen 'roos and wallabies, and were rewarded by seeing three different types of wallaby including a relatively rare black rock one. My first Australian marsupials!</p> <p>Returning to the lodge we cooked dinner and were pretty early to sleep - because I was making Josh get up at 4.30 the next morning! I wanted to watch the sunrise which begins at about 5.30. At exactly that time we were positioned on a rock overlooking one of the valleys just down from Shaun's back garden. It was a slow sunrise and the colours and the clouds slowly glowing pink were beautiful. We returned to the lodge for a swift siesta before starting the 50 minute trek complete with backpacks so we could catch the train out of Wollangambe again (Shaun was out at work and he was our only means of transport). It was pretty exhausting but we made the train in time, now bound for Katoomba to see some of the more obvious sights of the blue mountains. </p> <p>We intended to have just one night at the YHA there, but after being heavily rained on we extended our stay for another night to get in a full day's exploration. Luckily the next day, the rain stopped so we hopped on one of the tourist buses and got off at Gordon Falls. We intended to do the short walk between there and the next falls before getting back on the bus, but us being us, we ended up walking the entire cliff route - still, all this walking is doing wonders for my legs! </p> <p>The walk includes some absolutely breathtaking views across the blue mountains (so called because of the blue mist that rises from the eucalyptus trees), including the much photographed Three Sisters Rocks. Other highlights included the Leura cascades and falls, the gruelling 900 step climb, and for me the ultimate highlight - getting a lizard to eat bread off my hand!! We'd found it bathing in the sun and I couldn't believe it would be that tame - that definitely made my day. And I introduced Josh to peanut butter and banana sandwiches, which he agreed were good</p> <p>Next morning was check-out from Katoomba, and we headed back to Sydney. On the way we stopped at Wentworth Falls to follow the Charles Darwin walk down to the waterfalls. They were very beautiful, but personally I was still exhausted after the day before so we didn't really do much walking! </p> <p>When we got to Sydney we went straight out again for Coogee - which as I've said before is where I hope to settle for a bit - and to the Coogee Beach Backpackers Hostel. Its location by the beach (besides being on a very steep hill) certainly makes it ideal. In the evening we went to the Beach Palace hotel - one of the two main venues in Coogee where you can have a few quiet drinks and a bit of much needed recuperation! </p> <p>Our next day involved an exploration of the town, and my first attempts at job-hunting as I filled in a couple of application forms at the two biggest bars there. We bought a big pile of fresh groceries from the stunningly good value food shops with the intention of making something with nutritional value - noodle and vegetable stir-fry. I started to think it might be quite nice to live here for a while - life by the beach in a smallish friendly area, while back home I receive reports of cold wet days. . . life is definitely looking good! </p> <p>Tuesday 9th was Josh's last full day with me, and we spent the morning shopping around Coogee. In the evening we went out for dinner to a funky restaurant called Rice which is just two minutes walk from the hostel and does all manner of Asian-style meals. It also gave me the chance to eat aubergine which is one of my world's favourite foods so I was happy! That's one thing about Australia - when food is such incredibly good value it makes it tempting just to eat out all the time! </p> <p>The Wednesday morning I saw Josh off at the airport, which was pretty depressing. Still, I picked myself up by writing lots of emails back home, although it was hard suddenly being alone again. I moved into a dorm, which was a good idea - no sooner had I got there than my room-mate invited me out for the evening. A group of us went to the Palace hotel to play 'toss the boss'.

      "bodyText": "That next day in Wollangambe was undoubtedly my favourite of the trip so far. Shaun the hostel owner had left early for work, leaving the residents to their own devices. The night before, the knowledgeable American fellow hosteller Scott had described a sheer cliff which sits on an incredibly deep dam, and I'd been dying to get there. Armed with his scribbled map we set out through the bush, beating off the flies with a stick, and after about half an hour came across the place. It had been my ambition to jump from the top into the dam - both Scott and Shaun's son had said it was fine. However after a short swim and a 25-foot climb it did look pretty high up there! It wasn't until a 15-year old local boy did the jump first that I had the courage to leap. . . and it was incredibly exhilarating! Josh was just seconds behind me and I think for him it must have been worse as he's scared of heights - still, those few seconds of hanging and falling will stick in my memory! After a quick swim we headed back for the lodge just in time to escape the thunder storm that had been brewing. We were desperate for it to die down as I wanted to go kangaroo searching in the evening. I wasn't disappointed. Again using a map drawn by Scott we set out just before dusk for a spot where travellers before had seen 'roos and wallabies, and were rewarded by seeing three different types of wallaby including a relatively rare black rock one. My first Australian marsupials! Returning to the lodge we cooked dinner and were pretty early to sleep - because I was making Josh get up at 4.30 the next morning! I wanted to watch the sunrise which begins at about 5.30. At exactly that time we were positioned on a rock overlooking one of the valleys just down from Shaun's back garden. It was a slow sunrise and the colours and the clouds slowly glowing pink were beautiful. We returned to the lodge for a swift siesta before starting the 50 minute trek complete with backpacks so we could catch the train out of Wollangambe again (Shaun was out at work and he was our only means of transport). It was pretty exhausting but we made the train in time, now bound for Katoomba to see some of the more obvious sights of the blue mountains. We intended to have just one night at the YHA there, but after being heavily rained on we extended our stay for another night to get in a full day's exploration. Luckily the next day, the rain stopped so we hopped on one of the tourist buses and got off at Gordon Falls. We intended to do the short walk between there and the next falls before getting back on the bus, but us being us, we ended up walking the entire cliff route - still, all this walking is doing wonders for my legs! The walk includes some absolutely breathtaking views across the blue mountains (so called because of the blue mist that rises from the eucalyptus trees), including the much photographed Three Sisters Rocks. Other highlights included the Leura cascades and falls, the gruelling 900 step climb, and for me the ultimate highlight - getting a lizard to eat bread off my hand!! We'd found it bathing in the sun and I couldn't believe it would be that tame - that definitely made my day. And I introduced Josh to peanut butter and banana sandwiches, which he agreed were good Next morning was check-out from Katoomba, and we headed back to Sydney. On the way we stopped at Wentworth Falls to follow the Charles Darwin walk down to the waterfalls. They were very beautiful, but personally I was still exhausted after the day before so we didn't really do much walking! When we got to Sydney we went straight out again for Coogee - which as I've said before is where I hope to settle for a bit - and to the Coogee Beach Backpackers Hostel. Its location by the beach (besides being on a very steep hill) certainly makes it ideal. In the evening we went to the Beach Palace hotel - one of the two main venues in Coogee where you can have a few quiet drinks and a bit of much needed recuperation! Our next day involved an exploration of the town, and my first attempts at job-hunting as I filled in a couple of application forms at the two biggest bars there. We bought a big pile of fresh groceries from the stunningly good value food shops with the intention of making something with nutritional value - noodle and vegetable stir-fry. I started to think it might be quite nice to live here for a while - life by the beach in a smallish friendly area, while back home I receive reports of cold wet days. . . life is definitely looking good! Tuesday 9th was Josh's last full day with me, and we spent the morning shopping around Coogee. In the evening we went out for dinner to a funky restaurant called Rice which is just two minutes walk from the hostel and does all manner of Asian-style meals. It also gave me the chance to eat aubergine which is one of my world's favourite foods so I was happy! That's one thing about Australia - when food is such incredibly good value it makes it tempting just to eat out all the time! The Wednesday morning I saw Josh off at the airport, which was pretty depressing. Still, I picked myself up by writing lots of emails back home, although it was hard suddenly being alone again. I moved into a dorm, which was a good idea - no sooner had I got there than my room-mate invited me out for the evening. A group of us went to the Palace hotel to play 'toss the boss'. You order your drinks and the server flips a coin. If you guess right you get your drink free, if not you pay. I was rewarded with a free jug of beer, so I was pretty pleased! It was good fun, and they're a decent crowd of people, so I reckon everything's going to work out ok again.. . and tomorrow I've agreed to go and watch tennis at the Olympic park, so I'll be able to report how the champions are getting on. Until next time (when I'll still be in the sun - it really is a tough life this you know) Milly",

      "body": "<p>Bill Gates was angry when he arrived at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January 1998. </p> <p>His anger was palpable, and it surprised many who did not know him but knew well the multiple reasons he had not to be angry: the planet's richest man was the co-founder of Microsoft, a company that for 23 years had outflanked and outthought its competitors, a company whose Windows software now served as the essential code in about 90% of all personal computers, a company whose stock price made it the world's most highly valued. </p> <p>Unlike stock market meteors such as Amazon.com and Broadcast.com that produced paper billionaires but globs of red ink, Microsoft's profits, nearly $4.5bn, were twice as large as those of the world's largest company, General Motors. </p> <p>What's more, Bill Gates had come to look forward to this annual summit of about 2,000 CEOs and government, academic, and media leaders, who came to this tiny Alpine village for three to five days, dipping into seminars on topics from genetic engineering to Islam, listening to and giving speeches, maybe skiing, and, of course, scheduling one-on-one business meetings, all under the protective eye of the machine gun-toting Swiss army. </p> <p>Not President Clinton or the presidents of China or Russia or the CEO of GE or Warren Beatty was a bigger rock star here than Bill Gates. For the past several years, the coveted Sunday luncheon speech before the international press was reserved for Bill Gates. He enjoyed the attention, and the efficiency of Davos even more. At Microsoft, he carefully budgeted his time, allocating a set number of annual face-time hours to each senior executive and five speeches per year to software developers. </p> <p>For a busy executive, Davos was like one-stop shopping: in just a few days, Gates could assemble and speak with hundreds of his biggest customers, prearrange appointments to discuss deals, stack up private sessions with CEOs or government chiefs, and gather in one room correspondents from the world's most prestigious publications. </p> <p>Yet whatever reasons Bill Gates might have had to be ebullient going into Davos were overwhelmed by his burgeoning sense that he was a victim. He believed Microsoft was the engine of the new economy. So why, he wondered, was the US government treating him like Al Capone? </p> <p>At the Sunday lunch, I was seated next to Gates at a table for 10 that included his wife, Melinda, and the then chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola, Douglas Ivester. Before the salad arrived, he had already berated me for a panel I'd moderated a few nights earlier called \"Monopolies and Technology\". He complained that I had allowed enemies of Microsoft to pummel his chief technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold. Gates was not mollified to hear that Myhrvold more than held his own in the exchange. Gates sat huddled over, his arms folded across his chest, his brown hair unparted, unwashed, and combed straight down like a boy's. He rocked back and forth in his chair, his eyes fixed on the floor. </p> <p>His manner was gruff, and he was either unwilling or unable to hide his rage. Melinda Gates, a personable former Microsoft executive, tried discreetly to capture his attention, but he would not look up. The eight other guests at the table stared at him in wonder. Suddenly, his voice rising to a shrill pitch, Gates proclaimed, \"Neither Nathan nor anyone from Microsoft will ever appear again on such a panel!\" Those of us sharing his luncheon table in Davos were stunned by the rawness of the emotion Bill Gates couldn't contain, but we assumed he would compose himself for his eagerly awaited speech to a room filled with a worldwide press corps. </p> <p>And, indeed, after he was introduced, Gates at first skillfully camouflaged his rage. He fastened on his best CEO mask and, displaying a half smile, spoke calmly for about 20 minutes. </p> <p>He responded easily to questions from reporters about Microsoft's legal woes and about whom he saw as its potential business competitors. But then I rose and asked what could have been construed as an innocuous question: \"Unlike other companies, Microsoft is now stalked by an 800lb gorilla, the government. And without passing judgment on the merits of the case, the government does have legitimate responsibilities: to seek to protect the public from monopolies, or from price gouging, or from invasions of privacy. What do you say to those who believe Microsoft has behaved arrogantly, as if the government had no right to ask questions?\" </p> <p>Perhaps it was the word arrogant that provoked an eruption, for Gates plunged into a five-minute rant memorable less for what he said than for the deep hurt he betrayed. After curtly taking several more questions, Gates returned to the table and, hovering behind me, bellowed, \"What do you mean arrogant?\" Douglas Ivester's eyes widened, and the look on his face said: \"This is not how Fortune 500 CEOs behave!\" Melinda Gates looked stricken.\"Remember when you said neither Nathan nor anyone from Microsoft would appear on a panel again?\" I said. \"That was arrogant.\" </p> <p>Just as suddenly as it had erupted, the storm subsided, and the belligerent Gates became a vulnerable adolescent. \"What should I do?\" he asked plaintively, in a subdued voice. Like everyone at the table, I froze in awkward silence until the luncheon mercifully concluded. </p> <p>Although Bill Gates barely noticed, Microsoft's approach was isolating it from many of the corporate leaders gathered in Davos. At an annual Sun Valley retreat put on by Allen &amp; Company, News Corporation's Rupert Murdoch, NBC's Robert Wright, Sony's Nobuyuki Idei - among others - were shocked during a Gates presentation when he boasted: \"I'm going to destroy three companies: Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and Netscape.\" </p> <p>Everyone in this audience wanted to beat the competition - but destroy them? Gates seemed so, well, immature. To these executives, business was business; it wasn't personal. </p> <p>In 2000, it was apparent that, unlike in prior years, Gates was no longer the magnet at this event. Earlier that year Steve Case's America Online deployed $165bn of its \"invasion currency\" to gobble up the world's largest media company, TimeWarner. Case was the new rock star of Davos. It was Case that US secretary of state Madeleine Albright asked to be seated next to at a dinner Saturday night, and Case that King Abdallah bin al-Hussein of Jordan was seated beside Sunday night. </p> <p>Case fielded most of the questions in Davos - as if the audience expected this from him. Gates seemed to sink back into his beige leather armchair, hesitant to contribute. Gates looked markedly older than he had the year before. His face was marked by more wrinkles, and the skin under his eyes sagged. </p> <p>I asked Case if he sensed a shift of focus away from Gates. He acknowledged he was now \"a little more\" like a rock star and that the spotlight of celebrity now pursued him. \"It goes with the territory,\" he said. He was also struck that Gates, with whom he's been on panels and attended conferences and had more than a few fractious negotiations, was \"a little subdued. He seemed to be going out of his way to be more of a statesman.\" </p> <p>Not for one minute, however, did Case believe Gates when he said Microsoft would stick to software. \"It's highly likely that the destiny of our two companies is to duke it out for many years to come. We are wary of them. We don't see them as a software company. We see them as a to-the-death competitor. And they have determined, probably correctly, that if they want to be the most valuable company in the future they can't just be a software company.\" </p> <p>If Gates really meant not to be in the content business, said Case, \"then he would have divested MSN and Expedia and all those businesses that are not software businesses\". It is second nature for Case not to take Gates at his word. </p> <p>This lack of trust was increasingly mentioned by other companies who contemplated partnering with Microsoft. Even John Malone, who probably has as many joint ventures with Microsoft as anyone, thought Microsoft's aggressive culture could disadvantage them in the future. \"They want to win,\" he said. \"They don't want their team to win. They're not team players by nature. They're ball hogs.\" </p> <p>Surely trust was now a missing ingredient in the relationship between Nobuyuki Idei and Gates. Idei is a trained economist who pushes his company to spend about the same on R&amp;D ($3.7bn) as does Microsoft ($3.8bn). </p> <p>Idei still saw Microsoft as \"the biggest competitor of Sony\". The two corporations were engaged, he said, in a series of \"regional wars, not a world war\". They battled in the game market, battled in designing software operating systems for cable boxes, battled in e-commerce, would battle when he launched a Sony-branded portal, as he had in Japan, to compete with MSN and others, and they would battle when the new Sony PlayStation became an inexpensive operating system for all home appliances. </p> <p>Idei had a private meeting in Davos with Gates, as he did each year, but this year tensions flared. \"He feels PlayStation is a real threat to them,\" Idei said. Microsoft aspired to provide the operating system for PlayStation, as well as for cable boxes or servers or PCs. Idei was unmoved. </p> <p>Idei thought Gates had reason to be unsure: \"Microsoft is very uncertain about their future business model.\" In the two decades he had known Gates, Idei had never seen him so tentative. In halting English, this thin, taciturn man who wore a white silk shirt with a round collar buttoned at the top, said he thought Microsoft was slipping because their \"business model is totally in danger.\" </p> <p>\"Gates is an OS [operating system] dinosaur,\" he said, at a time when power is shifting. To get very large, companies required the right ideas, and Idei no longer thought Gates had these. \"His mind-set is old,\" he said. He would no longer be able to license Windows as he once had. </p> <p>\"Bill Gates is the IBM of today _ He wrote a book about the road ahead, but it is really the road back.\" Microsoft is losing good executives, he continued. Microsoft wants to build its model around MSN, but when they head overseas AOL, Sony, and others have huge head starts. </p> <p>Microsoft wants to find partners, but human relationships are not its core strength. \"Microsoft's soldiers try to behave like Bill Gates. They act more important than you,\" said Idei, making it clear that this further poisoned partnership prospects. Idei still saw Microsoft and America Online as the two principal future competitors with Sony. He hoped to reduce the battle to a one-on-one fight, which meant he might partner with either foe, though he wasn't sure he could trust Microsoft. However, even if Idei succeeded in eliminating a major enemy, he knew others would surface. </p> <p>Big companies will be assaulted by hordes of what Idei called \"ants\" - by free-software programmers using Linux, by copyright pirates, by makers of portable devices that access the internet.\"A big company, like a dinosaur, will be eaten up by the ants,\" he said. Only the very large or the very small may survive, with those in between nibbled to death by the ants or crushed. </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4112240,00.html\">January 4 2001 Microsoft faces $5bn discrimination claim</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4097411,00.html\">November 28 2000 Microsoft says trial infected with error</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4027069,00.html\">June 8 2000 What once was unthinkable is now a court order'</a><br></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/freedomtoinnovate/\"> News of the lawsuit from Microsoft.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www0.mercurycenter.com/business/microsoft/trial/\"> The San Jose Mercury's trial special</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/\"> The US Department of Justice</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/pdf/news/microsoft/ms-conclusions.pdf\"> Judge Jackson's final decision</a><br></p> <p>\u00a9 Ken Auletta 2001, from WORLD WAR 3.0: Microsoft and its Enemies by Ken Auletta, published by Profile Books Ltd at \u00a317.99 on January 15</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,423027,00.html\">Read part three</a></p>",

At an annual Sun Valley retreat put on by Allen &amp; Company, News Corporation's Rupert Murdoch, NBC's Robert Wright, Sony's Nobuyuki Idei - among others - were shocked during a Gates presentation when he boasted: \"I'm going to destroy three companies: Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and Netscape.\" Everyone in this audience wanted to beat the competition - but destroy them? Gates seemed so, well, immature. To these executives, business was business; it wasn't personal. In 2000, it was apparent that, unlike in prior years, Gates was no longer the magnet at this event. Earlier that year Steve Case's America Online deployed $165bn of its \"invasion currency\" to gobble up the world's largest media company, TimeWarner. Case was the new rock star of Davos. It was Case that US secretary of state Madeleine Albright asked to be seated next to at a dinner Saturday night, and Case that King Abdallah bin al-Hussein of Jordan was seated beside Sunday night. Case fielded most of the questions in Davos - as if the audience expected this from him. Gates seemed to sink back into his beige leather armchair, hesitant to contribute. Gates looked markedly older than he had the year before. His face was marked by more wrinkles, and the skin under his eyes sagged. I asked Case if he sensed a shift of focus away from Gates. He acknowledged he was now \"a little more\" like a rock star and that the spotlight of celebrity now pursued him. \"It goes with the territory,\" he said. He was also struck that Gates, with whom he's been on panels and attended conferences and had more than a few fractious negotiations, was \"a little subdued. He seemed to be going out of his way to be more of a statesman.\" Not for one minute, however, did Case believe Gates when he said Microsoft would stick to software. \"It's highly likely that the destiny of our two companies is to duke it out for many years to come. We are wary of them. We don't see them as a software company. We see them as a to-the-death competitor. And they have determined, probably correctly, that if they want to be the most valuable company in the future they can't just be a software company.\" If Gates really meant not to be in the content business, said Case, \"then he would have divested MSN and Expedia and all those businesses that are not software businesses\". It is second nature for Case not to take Gates at his word. This lack of trust was increasingly mentioned by other companies who contemplated partnering with Microsoft. Even John Malone, who probably has as many joint ventures with Microsoft as anyone, thought Microsoft's aggressive culture could disadvantage them in the future. \"They want to win,\" he said. \"They don't want their team to win. They're not team players by nature. They're ball hogs.\" Surely trust was now a missing ingredient in the relationship between Nobuyuki Idei and Gates. Idei is a trained economist who pushes his company to spend about the same on R&amp;D ($3.7bn) as does Microsoft ($3.8bn). Idei still saw Microsoft as \"the biggest competitor of Sony\". The two corporations were engaged, he said, in a series of \"regional wars, not a world war\". They battled in the game market, battled in designing software operating systems for cable boxes, battled in e-commerce, would battle when he launched a Sony-branded portal, as he had in Japan, to compete with MSN and others, and they would battle when the new Sony PlayStation became an inexpensive operating system for all home appliances. Idei had a private meeting in Davos with Gates, as he did each year, but this year tensions flared. \"He feels PlayStation is a real threat to them,\" Idei said. Microsoft aspired to provide the operating system for PlayStation, as well as for cable boxes or servers or PCs. Idei was unmoved. Idei thought Gates had reason to be unsure: \"Microsoft is very uncertain about their future business model.\" In the two decades he had known Gates, Idei had never seen him so tentative. In halting English, this thin, taciturn man who wore a white silk shirt with a round collar buttoned at the top, said he thought Microsoft was slipping because their \"business model is totally in danger.\" \"Gates is an OS [operating system] dinosaur,\" he said, at a time when power is shifting. To get very large, companies required the right ideas, and Idei no longer thought Gates had these. \"His mind-set is old,\" he said. He would no longer be able to license Windows as he once had. \"Bill Gates is the IBM of today _ He wrote a book about the road ahead, but it is really the road back.\" Microsoft is losing good executives, he continued. Microsoft wants to build its model around MSN, but when they head overseas AOL, Sony, and others have huge head starts. Microsoft wants to find partners, but human relationships are not its core strength. \"Microsoft's soldiers try to behave like Bill Gates. They act more important than you,\" said Idei, making it clear that this further poisoned partnership prospects. Idei still saw Microsoft and America Online as the two principal future competitors with Sony. He hoped to reduce the battle to a one-on-one fight, which meant he might partner with either foe, though he wasn't sure he could trust Microsoft. However, even if Idei succeeded in eliminating a major enemy, he knew others would surface. Big companies will be assaulted by hordes of what Idei called \"ants\" - by free-software programmers using Linux, by copyright pirates, by makers of portable devices that access the internet.\"A big company, like a dinosaur, will be eaten up by the ants,\" he said. Only the very large or the very small may survive, with those in between nibbled to death by the ants or crushed.

The 60-minute documentary, about a group of lesbians who took a package holiday to the Greek island of Lesbos and got a hostile reception from the local mayor, drew 1.5m and a hefty 16% share from 10.55pm. BBC2 survival gameshow Bare Necessities returned for a new series last night, with teams of clerics and bookies competing to get through a week living outdoors in Romania. It drew 2.2m and a 9% share, 8-9pm, beating Channel 4's Lost Gardens, which had 1.7m.",

Mmm, chips.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"This is the equivalent of David Beckham going to join Arsenal\" - Triumphant Mirror editor Piers Morgan announces his new signing ... top Express astrologer Jonathon Cainer.</p> <p><strong>FIRE!</strong></p> <p>Wimbledon's Sam Hammam, the Cardiff chairman, is a crazy man. When he's not smearing extra-strength Fiery Jack ointment onto his players' jockstraps, he's usually announcing plans to change the club's name to the Cardiff Celts, complete with a green-and-white-hooped kit - original, eh? - or dreaming up new ways to deliver Wales from 700 years of English oppression.</p> <p>With this in mind, Crazy Sam hatched another crazy idea. Wouldn't it be a great wheeze, he thought, to let supporters buy a Cardiff shirt for half price - provided they handed in a strip of an English club for him to burn (along with an effigy of the hated Edward I, no doubt)? \"The idea is to get people to wear Welsh club shirts rather than any other football club shirts,\" explained an innocent sounding club spokesman. \"Sam Hammam's view is if you are Welsh, why are you wearing a Manchester United or a Barcelona or any other shirt when you should be wearing a Welsh football club shirt?\"</p> <p>Exactly right, you might think - although if you did, you'd soon get an earful from anti-racist groups and the police. The Kick It Out campaign has condemned Hammam's idea for its \"extremely xenophobic and nationalistic overtones\". Meanwhile, Gerry Toms of South Wales Police agreed, saying: \"I certainly do not support the proposal and believe it needs a rethink.\" With criticism raining down from all sides, Crazy Sam this afternoon decided to ditch his controversial plans. But don't worry, he's already mulling over a new idea: midnight guerrilla raids on Shrewsbury. Remember, you read it here first.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Bulgarian champions Levski Sofia are hoping to sign West Ham's out-of-favour striker Davor Suker. \"Our attractive point is the participation in [Big Cup],\" said Levski coach Ljupko Petrovic. \"I haven't yet got a negative answer.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, West Ham are hoping to sign Alaves striker Javi Moreno - who is the top scorer in the Primera Liga - for around \u00a35.5m. \"He's a top quality player,\" Harry Redknapp admitted. \"He has lot of qualities that I admire, but I don't know if we can compete for him. I would love to get a front man in to partner Freddie Kanoute - that would be frightening.\"</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Bradford defender Dan Petrescu has completed his move to Southampton after the two clubs agreed a nominal fee. </p> <p>Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of David Johnson from Ipswich Town for \u00a33.5m. Manager David Platt admitted: \"It's a tremendous lift for us and it's no secret that we've been looking for a goalscorer for a long time. This is a boost for everyone at the club.\"</p> <p>Aston Villa manager John Gregory will complete the signing of River Plate's Juan Pablo Angel for \u00a39.5m within the next 48 hours.</p> <p>Arsenal are hoping to complete the signing of Brazilian midfielder Edu from Corinthians early next week. \"Edu is in Portugal at the moment and has the document which gives him Portuguese citizenship and should now bring him the right passport,\" said Arsene Wenger. \"If all goes well the deal to sign him should be completed by Monday or Tuesday.\"</p> <p>Sunderland manager Peter Reid has been named Carling Manager of the Month award for December. Southampton striker James Beattie has won the Player of the Month award.</p> <p>Disgraced German coach Christoph Daum has finally admitted taking cocaine. \"I admit I have taken cocaine in the past,\" he said, after returning from a three-month exile in Florida. Daum had been lined up to coach the German national team but was ruled out of contention amid allegations of cocaine-fuelled orgies with prostitutes.</p> <p>Nationwide Conference chiefs have attacked the Football League for stalling on an agreement to increase the number of clubs promoted from the Conference to two. A statement on behalf of the Conference read: \"It is understood that The Football League have not defined their decision-making process. The Conference are urgently seeking a joint meeting with the FA and The Football League for the purpose of reaching a satisfactory conclusion.\"</p> <p>West Ham manager Harry Redknapp is hopeful he can seal the transfer of Rangers defender Lorenzo Amoruso \"after the weekend\". Redknapp told the official West Ham website: \"Lorenzo is very much a player I want. He has said what he wanted and it's not cheap but all things considered it's not silly either.\" Swindon have failed with a bid to take Bradford striker Stan Collymore on loan until the end of the season.</p> <p>Blackburn full-back Simon Grayson has joined Stockport on a three-month loan deal.</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: World Football (3.40am) </p> <p>\"Seven or eight years ago, I was in Euston Station one morning getting off a train from Manchester (no, I'm not a Red fan returning home),\" writes Dennis O'Neill.</p> <p>Sky Sports 1: Futbol Mundial (5pm) </p> <p>\"My passage was blocked by a well turned out, well-built elderly gent, with an equally well turned out good lady on his arm.\"</p> <p>Premier League Preview (11.30pm, 4.30am) </p> <p>\"I tried to shimmy past one way, then the other, but he plainly couldn't sense my presence and wasn't moving.\"</p> <p>Sky Sports 2: Live Second Division Football - Luton v Wycombe (7pm, 12midnight SS1, 4.30am) </p> <p>\"Next thing, his missus turns round, sees me and gives the man a good bollocking.

I will still only be 26 in April and there is a lot more to come from me.\" 7. Decide to have slap-up celebratory meal. Mmm, chips. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"This is the equivalent of David Beckham going to join Arsenal\" - Triumphant Mirror editor Piers Morgan announces his new signing ... top Express astrologer Jonathon Cainer. FIRE! Wimbledon's Sam Hammam, the Cardiff chairman, is a crazy man. When he's not smearing extra-strength Fiery Jack ointment onto his players' jockstraps, he's usually announcing plans to change the club's name to the Cardiff Celts, complete with a green-and-white-hooped kit - original, eh? - or dreaming up new ways to deliver Wales from 700 years of English oppression. With this in mind, Crazy Sam hatched another crazy idea. Wouldn't it be a great wheeze, he thought, to let supporters buy a Cardiff shirt for half price - provided they handed in a strip of an English club for him to burn (along with an effigy of the hated Edward I, no doubt)? \"The idea is to get people to wear Welsh club shirts rather than any other football club shirts,\" explained an innocent sounding club spokesman. \"Sam Hammam's view is if you are Welsh, why are you wearing a Manchester United or a Barcelona or any other shirt when you should be wearing a Welsh football club shirt?\" Exactly right, you might think - although if you did, you'd soon get an earful from anti-racist groups and the police. The Kick It Out campaign has condemned Hammam's idea for its \"extremely xenophobic and nationalistic overtones\". Meanwhile, Gerry Toms of South Wales Police agreed, saying: \"I certainly do not support the proposal and believe it needs a rethink.\" With criticism raining down from all sides, Crazy Sam this afternoon decided to ditch his controversial plans. But don't worry, he's already mulling over a new idea: midnight guerrilla raids on Shrewsbury. Remember, you read it here first. THE RUMOUR MILL Bulgarian champions Levski Sofia are hoping to sign West Ham's out-of-favour striker Davor Suker. \"Our attractive point is the participation in [Big Cup],\" said Levski coach Ljupko Petrovic. \"I haven't yet got a negative answer.\" Meanwhile, West Ham are hoping to sign Alaves striker Javi Moreno - who is the top scorer in the Primera Liga - for around \u00a35.5m. \"He's a top quality player,\" Harry Redknapp admitted. \"He has lot of qualities that I admire, but I don't know if we can compete for him. I would love to get a front man in to partner Freddie Kanoute - that would be frightening.\" NEWS IN BRIEF Bradford defender Dan Petrescu has completed his move to Southampton after the two clubs agreed a nominal fee. Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of David Johnson from Ipswich Town for \u00a33.5m. Manager David Platt admitted: \"It's a tremendous lift for us and it's no secret that we've been looking for a goalscorer for a long time. This is a boost for everyone at the club.\" Aston Villa manager John Gregory will complete the signing of River Plate's Juan Pablo Angel for \u00a39.5m within the next 48 hours. Arsenal are hoping to complete the signing of Brazilian midfielder Edu from Corinthians early next week. \"Edu is in Portugal at the moment and has the document which gives him Portuguese citizenship and should now bring him the right passport,\" said Arsene Wenger. \"If all goes well the deal to sign him should be completed by Monday or Tuesday.\" Sunderland manager Peter Reid has been named Carling Manager of the Month award for December. Southampton striker James Beattie has won the Player of the Month award. Disgraced German coach Christoph Daum has finally admitted taking cocaine. \"I admit I have taken cocaine in the past,\" he said, after returning from a three-month exile in Florida. Daum had been lined up to coach the German national team but was ruled out of contention amid allegations of cocaine-fuelled orgies with prostitutes. Nationwide Conference chiefs have attacked the Football League for stalling on an agreement to increase the number of clubs promoted from the Conference to two. A statement on behalf of the Conference read: \"It is understood that The Football League have not defined their decision-making process. The Conference are urgently seeking a joint meeting with the FA and The Football League for the purpose of reaching a satisfactory conclusion.\" West Ham manager Harry Redknapp is hopeful he can seal the transfer of Rangers defender Lorenzo Amoruso \"after the weekend\". Redknapp told the official West Ham website: \"Lorenzo is very much a player I want. He has said what he wanted and it's not cheap but all things considered it's not silly either.\" Swindon have failed with a bid to take Bradford striker Stan Collymore on loan until the end of the season. Blackburn full-back Simon Grayson has joined Stockport on a three-month loan deal.

      "bodyText": "A woman and her boyfriend were jailed for life today for the murder of an eight-year-old girl who suffered \"truly unimaginable\" abuse and neglect at their hands. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, has ordered a statutory inquiry into the death of Anna Climbie - one of the worst child abuse cases in Britain. She died at the hands of her great aunt Marie Therese Kouao and Kouao's boyfriend Carl Manning even though police, social workers and hospital staff had been alerted to her plight. As well as the government inquiry, eight London police officers are facing a police complaints authority probe and a social worker has been suspended pending disciplinary procedures. The jury in the Old Bailey trial heard harrowing accounts of the tragic life of Anna, who was brought to London by Kouao, a year before she died. She was tied up in a black plastic bag and made to sleep in a bath for months. She was beaten with a variety of weapons including a bicycle chain and wire coat hanger. The frail child began to stoop like an old woman, and slowly starved because she was fed leftover scraps \"like a dog\". Kouao, 44, and Manning, 28, of Tottenham, north London, stood impassive as the guilty verdicts - by a majority of 10 to two - were delivered on the fifth day of deliberations. Kouao put her hand over her mouth as she heard the verdicts. Judge Richard Hawkins said: \"What Anna endured was truly unimaginable. She died at both your hands, a lonely drawn out death. I pass the only sentence I am entitled to pass, and that is life imprisonment.\" He gave Kouao a 10-year concurrent sentence for child cruelty. Manning was given eight years for child cruelty to run concurrently. Judge Hawkins said lessons had to be learned \"about the failure of social services and police in this case\". A doctor said Anna \"felt like a block of ice\" when she was taken to hospital. Home Office pathologist Nathaniel Carey said the case was \"the worst case of child abuse I have seen\". The little girl, who did not lose her beautiful smile as she hid her suffering from others, died of hypothermia in February last year. She was malnourished and had 128 bruises on her body. She came to London from Africa via Paris, in search of a better education but never attended a British school. Bus driver Manning denied murder but admitted manslaughter and child cruelty. He said he was responsibly for only about a third of Anna's injuries and he admitted hitting her over the head with a bicycle chain. Widowed Kouao, a French citizen, who had three grown up sons in Paris, denied murder, manslaughter and cruelty to Anna at the tiny studio flat the couple shared in Tottenham. She initially told police the child's condition was caused by witchcraft. In court, she denied all knowledge of cruelty. The trial, which began on November 20 last year, was frequently interrupted by Kouao's outbursts. The court was told that Anna was left tied up in the bath sometimes for more than 24-hours. One woman claimed Kouao told her she left Anna there for \"two or three days\". And in a chilling confession read in court, Manning told police: \"You could beat her and she would not cry at all. She could take the beatings and pain like anything.\" Anna's death resulted in two inquires by police, health officials and social services. Incredibly, the little girl died even though police child protection officers and social service workers from three London boroughs were involved in her case, and she was admitted to two hospitals. A child protection team investigation of Anna's case, which allowed her to be returned to Kouao and Manning, was criticised in court as \"blindingly incompetent\". Linda Stern QC, prosecuting, told the jury: \"You may think they did not do their jobs properly because if they had, she would not have been returned, and her death may have been prevented.\" The results of internal inquiries to be held as a result of Anna's death will be sent to the Department of Health to see what lessons can be learned. Haringey social worker Lisa Arthurworrey has been suspended and child protection officer Pc Karen Jones is one of eight police officers who are subject to the second inquiry by the police complaints authority. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children today called for a complete overall of child protection procedures to develop a new national strategy. Director Mary Marsh said: \"Anna suffered a living hell of misery and terror at the hands of her carers.\" She said one or two children died each week at the hands of parents or carers - and the figure had not fallen over the past 25 years. Detectives are still trying to trace two other children who may have been handed to Kouao so that she could bring them to Europe from the Ivory Coast. Court records show an adoption hearing involving a boy named Aime, who was 15, took place in the Ivory Coast in 1996. In Paris, a girl named Christelle was subject of guardianship proceedings in 1993. Detective Inspector Keith Niven said: \"We are still actively inquiring into the whereabouts of these children. We will keep going until we find the answers.\" A third child, Claudine, said to be Kouao's adoptive daughter, is now 17 and is still living in France. Kouao and Manning face having to serve their sentences in isolation. Kouao told the court that she was attacked and abused in Holloway Prison after details of Anna's horrific death were made public. Anna's parents, Berthe Ehouri, 40, and Francis Climbie, left their six other children in their shanty town home in the Ivory Coast to attend court. Mrs Ehouri also testified during the trial. But the couple were prevented from returning for the verdict - they returned to the Ivory Coast for the Christmas recess - and collecting Anna's body because of civil unrest in their country. Mrs Ehouri said she had trusted Kouao with her child - but that by the time she received a card saying her daughter was well, Anna was already dead. Det Insp Niven said: \"The family has been emotionally destroyed by what happened to Anna. It beggars belief. One cannot imagine why anyone would inflict such injuries on a child.\" Judge Hawkins said today: \"Plainly, lessons must be learnt about the failure of social services and the police inquiry following Anna's release from the North Middlesex hospital in august 1999. \"It is not for me to go into detail. I would like to be kept informed as to the result of any inquiry.\" Manning and Kouao showed no emotion as the sentence was passed.Extra security staff stood in the dock, but the couple left quietly - Kouao clutching a bible. Judge Hawkins had told them: \"This very serious case of murder concerns a lovely child, Anna. \"She left the Ivory Coast a lovely child full of hope and love.\" But by the time Anna reached Britain in the spring of 1999 with Kouao, she had become doubly incontinent due to the \"emotional abuse\" she subjected her to. After joining Manning, Anna had become an inconvenience to them and was repeatedly beaten with an array of weapons. \"By her death, she was covered from head to toe in injuries,\" the judge said. Talk about it Are social services to blame?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uranium/story/0,7369,421519,00.html\">Read the first part of the debate</a> <p><b>caymantinsel </b><br> Mark, according to the Italian press, it was a wizard wheeze of those at Sellafield who tout for business to dispose of the world's nuclear waste - what better idea than to turn it into weapons, use them on our enemies (who we've already demonised into perceived subhumanity) and then leave them to clear it up. </p> <p><b>MalcolmHooper </b><br> caymantinsel- there are 4 major reasons why DU is used 1. It is cheap - provided at low cost or at no cost. There are around 1 million tons of the waste product from the nuclear industry lying around the world. It is intermediate nuclear waste and therefore must be monitored, stored and cannot be buried. A very costly process. Anything to reduce this stockpile and make money is welcome 2. It makes a very powerful weapon. 3. Any advantage to the USA and the UK has been lost by selling it other countries- at least 17 have these weapons including Pakistan/India, Taiwan/China, Egypt/Israel etc BIG BUCKS ARE INVOLVED WAR PROFITEERS (INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRADE) WILL LOSE OUT- PRINCIPALLY THE UK AND USA 4. Clean-up costs are colossal for 69 tons of DU fired at the jefferson proving grounds clean-up was estimated at $4-5 BILLION. the USA did not agree to clean up the Gulf battlefields Malcolm H </p> <p><b>silvere </b><br> I have some few questions about this affair. First, at this stage the talks seem to be limited between NATO members and whether depleted uranium weapons might be toxic or not. But let's do some \"politic-fiction\", UN soldiers won't be the only ones to show some health troubles, the civil population might be hit as well. So is it possible to see in the future years Kosovo sue at an International Court (TPI in French) NATO and more precisely America for empoisenement? Secondly I really don't see why the ban on depleted uranium weapons shouldn't pass. I remind some people that not so long ago Europe decided a complete ban on the well-know \"farines animales\". Why do we have the feeling that every time governements are dealing with lobbies the rule seems to be \"Let's do whatever we fancy and if afterwards casualties occur we'll correct some drifts\"? </p> <p><b>Ian70 </b> <br> Mark, the connection is by no means clear. As a question, several posters have pointed to the effects on the local population. Ibrahim Rugova, the elected leader of the Kosovo Albanians, has stated this; 'the depleted uranium scare is being misused by those who opposed the NATO intervention in the hope that it would lead to the withdrawl of the NATO-led peacekeeping force.' This newspaper also quoted Pleurat Sejdiu, joint head of the Kosovo health department, Sejdiu dismissed the concerns as 'propoganda'. What do they know that we don't? </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor </b><br> Ian70, Sure the wave of concern in Europe is partly political - the Kosovo bombing was very unpopular in Italy for example. But equally Rugova is making a political point. A more general point - raised by others - we talk about Nato veterans, but what about those - including children - close to DU bombsights - in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq ? </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor </b><br> Hello,I'm Richard Norton-Taylor, security editor of the Guardian. I'm in no way a scientist but i have been following (and trying to uncover) Government secrecy for many years. I'm here now and look forward to seeing your questions. Keep them coming. </p> <p><b>youngphilosopher </b><br> Why is depleted uranium used at all in the shells? </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor </b><br> youngphilosopher, because it's hard and because it's a very cheap product - a byproduct of the nuclear industry. Defence companies have developed tungsten shells but it is more expensive and (say governments) not as efficient. Only 3 nuclear powers - the US, Britain, and France, produce DU-coated weapons. </p> <p><b>MalcolmHooper </b><br> I would add also that DU is pyrophoric- it catches fire on impact giving rise to intense fires of ~10,000 degrees centigrade the dust cloud produced can contain up to 70% of respirable small particles ~1 mg. A sabot fin round contains 5,350 gm of DU other munitions vary down to 200 gm. We are not dealing with DU coated munitions it is solid 100 % uranium (strictly ~ 99.8% uranium -238 and ~ 0.2% uranium -235) that is used in the munitions. Malcolm </p> <p><b>GulfWarVeterans </b><br> Good Afternoon everybody , I am now online if you have any questions you wish to ask me. To those of you who do not know me ,I am an ex cposa (chief petty officer-stores accountant) - I joined in 1975 and left (sadly) in june 1999 due to increasing health problems which are now of a chronic nature . To find out more please visit my web-site on <a href=\"http://www.editor.uk-gwvn.desert-storm.com\"> www.editor.uk-gwvn.desert-storm.com</a> I look forward to receiving your questions . Best wishes Terry Gooding - Editor UK-GWVN Scottish Area Co-Ordinator Gulf Veterans Association. An Active Member of The SNP. </p> <p><b>caymantinsel </b><br> Hello Richard, I read today that Robertson's answer to the Italian request for a moratorium was an extremely dismissive and disingenous one - nothing to discuss, there's no war now they they're not currently being used anyway. Is this the seriousness that the government of a member state of Nato can expect when it is mandated by parliament to ask about something that is of concern to its population? How much would you like to bet that next time there is a war, Robertson or his successor'll tell us there's not time for such discussions in time of war? </p> <p><b>jamalade </b><br> Is there the old first world war \"gulf\" division between the arrogance of the upper echelons of the army and the humble soldier on the ground; do these people have colleagues in the nulcear industry whom they consulted and were informed that DU's were \"safe\"; and, will we be sure that these \"colleagues\" will not be benefitting (esp. financially), in the inevitable clean-up industry that will follow when we are sued? </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor </b><br> caymantinsel - You remind me of a letter a defence minister - Jeremy Hanley - wrote in 1993. He told the Labour MP, Paul Flynn that the government did not give advice to British troops in the 1991 Gulf war about the dangers of DU weapons because of the 'urgency attached to bringing into service such a critical capability which at the start of the crisis was still under development'. Spellar told MPs on Tuesday that DU weapons were 'ideally suited for kinetic-energy penetration'. </p> <p><b>Meatloaf </b><br> What is the likelihood of Nato forces having used other types of chemical/toxic weapons in recent conflicts? </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor </b> <br> Meatloaf, The ministry of defence is developing a heat-and-pressure-bomb for urban warfare. Devastating effect on anybody caught up in the blast - said by US researchers to be similar to that of a tactical nuclear bomb. </p> <p><b>tamara </b><br> What did the army use before DU? Were the old weapons really not very good - as the MoD seems to be saying? </p> <p><b>jamalade </b><br> Is there a difference between using \"weapons of mass destruction\" and DUs, that may harm populations for generations to come? </p> <p><b>Saramago </b><br> DU tipped shells are said to be used for armour piercing. We are told that some 31 000 such shells were used in the Kosovo conflict. In view of the fact that only 13 tanks and perhaps double that of armoured vehicles were destroyed, would you say that DU tipped shells were used for other targets in Kosovo? </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor </b><br> Saramago, Maybe not intentionally. But they could well have landed on other targets which US pilots thought were the sites of Serb tanks and armour. </p> <p><b>Ian70 </b><br> Very good point. Although of course, APC's and trucks will have been attacked raising the number of targets struck, and the potential exposure. Only 26? The alternative explanation is that a lot of shells are lying around, that missed their targets, that pose no threat to anyone. </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor </b><br> To all, One of the problems in all this is that history has shown you cannot trust the Ministry of Defence, certainly can't take its assurances at face value. It is not surprising, it has a huge vested interest - not least, in protecting itself against claims for compensation and negligence. (Secrecy and bureaucratic and financial considerations are not, of course, confined to the MoD in Whitehall. The MoD refused even to recognise the existence of a 'Gulf War syndrome' until well after the US agreed there was reason for concern. (Not that the US has been completely open, far from it). There is another point - in complex areas involving scientific research, ministers have to rely on their expert advisers. Too many ministers don't ask the difficult questions. </p> <p> <b>jsd104 </b><br> Depleted Uranium is radioactive. Radioactivity is dangerous. QED. The idea that DU is safe, being pedalled by the likes of George Robertson is patently false. He is either a liar, or he is stupid. Of course, it is unfortunate if soldiers from any country have been contaminated by this poison. But they at least could have been expected to have some idea that it was dangerous. But what about the Kosovan Albanians for whom our politicians shed such huge crocodile tears in 1999? Here are some of the reported effects of DU. </p> <p>Journalist Felicity Arbuthnot visited southern Iraq and reported in 1999 that \"Iraq's leukemia rate has leapt 70 percent since the Gulf War\". As well as such cancers, she found \"an astonishing rise in congenital abnormalities\". </p> <p>She described seeing in one hospital a typical victim, \"a baby born an hour ago. \"The tiny being made small bleating noises. It had no genitalia, no eyes, nose, tongue, oesophagus or hands. Twisted legs were joined by a thick web of flesh from the knees.\" She reported that \"vegetation in the area shows up to 84 times background radiation\". The potential effects on pregnant women are all too obvious. Bosnia has suffered similarly. </p> <p>After US forces bombed the Ramont Institute near the town of Brataunac in 1995 Yugoslav scientists reported: \"There are unusual and unnatural occurrences in vegetation, among animals and human beings. Bizarre, massive illness has affected cows. Rapid hair loss is happening to boys of school age.\" An official investigation by the United Nations Environment Programme in Kosovo this year confirmed fears of depleted uranium contamination. Head of the programme Pekka Haavisto said, \"There remains a risk for the local population. Much ammunition is deep in the ground and affects groundwater.\" </p> <p>DU is a weapon of mass destruction and those authorising its use are guilty of war crimes. </p> <p><b>Ian70 </b><br> DU has very low levels of radioactivity, so do many other materials, everywhere has background radioactivity. Everywhere is not dangerous. You have proved nothing. </p> <p>See my other post to bring some doubt on the role of DU in Iraq. </p> <p>Quoting official sources from Yugoslavia, prior to October 2000, is even more dangerous than trusting the MOD. </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor</b><br></p> <p>Well, I'm off now to hear what the MoD is saying next. Keep at it and thanks for your contributions. My email address is: richard.norton-taylor@theguardian.com Cheerio</p>",

      "bodyText": "Read the first part of the debate caymantinsel Mark, according to the Italian press, it was a wizard wheeze of those at Sellafield who tout for business to dispose of the world's nuclear waste - what better idea than to turn it into weapons, use them on our enemies (who we've already demonised into perceived subhumanity) and then leave them to clear it up. MalcolmHooper caymantinsel- there are 4 major reasons why DU is used 1. It is cheap - provided at low cost or at no cost. There are around 1 million tons of the waste product from the nuclear industry lying around the world. It is intermediate nuclear waste and therefore must be monitored, stored and cannot be buried. A very costly process. Anything to reduce this stockpile and make money is welcome 2. It makes a very powerful weapon. 3. Any advantage to the USA and the UK has been lost by selling it other countries- at least 17 have these weapons including Pakistan/India, Taiwan/China, Egypt/Israel etc BIG BUCKS ARE INVOLVED WAR PROFITEERS (INTERNATIONAL ARMS TRADE) WILL LOSE OUT- PRINCIPALLY THE UK AND USA 4. Clean-up costs are colossal for 69 tons of DU fired at the jefferson proving grounds clean-up was estimated at $4-5 BILLION. the USA did not agree to clean up the Gulf battlefields Malcolm H silvere I have some few questions about this affair. First, at this stage the talks seem to be limited between NATO members and whether depleted uranium weapons might be toxic or not. But let's do some \"politic-fiction\", UN soldiers won't be the only ones to show some health troubles, the civil population might be hit as well. So is it possible to see in the future years Kosovo sue at an International Court (TPI in French) NATO and more precisely America for empoisenement? Secondly I really don't see why the ban on depleted uranium weapons shouldn't pass. I remind some people that not so long ago Europe decided a complete ban on the well-know \"farines animales\". Why do we have the feeling that every time governements are dealing with lobbies the rule seems to be \"Let's do whatever we fancy and if afterwards casualties occur we'll correct some drifts\"? Ian70 Mark, the connection is by no means clear. As a question, several posters have pointed to the effects on the local population. Ibrahim Rugova, the elected leader of the Kosovo Albanians, has stated this; 'the depleted uranium scare is being misused by those who opposed the NATO intervention in the hope that it would lead to the withdrawl of the NATO-led peacekeeping force.' This newspaper also quoted Pleurat Sejdiu, joint head of the Kosovo health department, Sejdiu dismissed the concerns as 'propoganda'. What do they know that we don't? NortonTaylor Ian70, Sure the wave of concern in Europe is partly political - the Kosovo bombing was very unpopular in Italy for example. But equally Rugova is making a political point. A more general point - raised by others - we talk about Nato veterans, but what about those - including children - close to DU bombsights - in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq ? NortonTaylor Hello,I'm Richard Norton-Taylor, security editor of the Guardian. I'm in no way a scientist but i have been following (and trying to uncover) Government secrecy for many years. I'm here now and look forward to seeing your questions. Keep them coming. youngphilosopher Why is depleted uranium used at all in the shells? NortonTaylor youngphilosopher, because it's hard and because it's a very cheap product - a byproduct of the nuclear industry. Defence companies have developed tungsten shells but it is more expensive and (say governments) not as efficient. Only 3 nuclear powers - the US, Britain, and France, produce DU-coated weapons. MalcolmHooper I would add also that DU is pyrophoric- it catches fire on impact giving rise to intense fires of ~10,000 degrees centigrade the dust cloud produced can contain up to 70% of respirable small particles ~1 mg. A sabot fin round contains 5,350 gm of DU other munitions vary down to 200 gm. We are not dealing with DU coated munitions it is solid 100 % uranium (strictly ~ 99.8% uranium -238 and ~ 0.2% uranium -235) that is used in the munitions. Malcolm GulfWarVeterans Good Afternoon everybody , I am now online if you have any questions you wish to ask me. To those of you who do not know me ,I am an ex cposa (chief petty officer-stores accountant) - I joined in 1975 and left (sadly) in june 1999 due to increasing health problems which are now of a chronic nature . To find out more please visit my web-site on www.editor.uk-gwvn.desert-storm.com I look forward to receiving your questions . Best wishes Terry Gooding - Editor UK-GWVN Scottish Area Co-Ordinator Gulf Veterans Association. An Active Member of The SNP. caymantinsel Hello Richard, I read today that Robertson's answer to the Italian request for a moratorium was an extremely dismissive and disingenous one - nothing to discuss, there's no war now they they're not currently being used anyway. Is this the seriousness that the government of a member state of Nato can expect when it is mandated by parliament to ask about something that is of concern to its population? How much would you like to bet that next time there is a war, Robertson or his successor'll tell us there's not time for such discussions in time of war? jamalade Is there the old first world war \"gulf\" division between the arrogance of the upper echelons of the army and the humble soldier on the ground; do these people have colleagues in the nulcear industry whom they consulted and were informed that DU's were \"safe\"; and, will we be sure that these \"colleagues\" will not be benefitting (esp. financially), in the inevitable clean-up industry that will follow when we are sued? NortonTaylor caymantinsel - You remind me of a letter a defence minister - Jeremy Hanley - wrote in 1993. He told the Labour MP, Paul Flynn that the government did not give advice to British troops in the 1991 Gulf war about the dangers of DU weapons because of the 'urgency attached to bringing into service such a critical capability which at the start of the crisis was still under development'. Spellar told MPs on Tuesday that DU weapons were 'ideally suited for kinetic-energy penetration'. Meatloaf What is the likelihood of Nato forces having used other types of chemical/toxic weapons in recent conflicts? NortonTaylor Meatloaf, The ministry of defence is developing a heat-and-pressure-bomb for urban warfare. Devastating effect on anybody caught up in the blast - said by US researchers to be similar to that of a tactical nuclear bomb. tamara What did the army use before DU? Were the old weapons really not very good - as the MoD seems to be saying? jamalade Is there a difference between using \"weapons of mass destruction\" and DUs, that may harm populations for generations to come? Saramago DU tipped shells are said to be used for armour piercing. We are told that some 31 000 such shells were used in the Kosovo conflict. In view of the fact that only 13 tanks and perhaps double that of armoured vehicles were destroyed, would you say that DU tipped shells were used for other targets in Kosovo? NortonTaylor Saramago, Maybe not intentionally. But they could well have landed on other targets which US pilots thought were the sites of Serb tanks and armour. Ian70 Very good point. Although of course, APC's and trucks will have been attacked raising the number of targets struck, and the potential exposure. Only 26? The alternative explanation is that a lot of shells are lying around, that missed their targets, that pose no threat to anyone. NortonTaylor To all, One of the problems in all this is that history has shown you cannot trust the Ministry of Defence, certainly can't take its assurances at face value. It is not surprising, it has a huge vested interest - not least, in protecting itself against claims for compensation and negligence. (Secrecy and bureaucratic and financial considerations are not, of course, confined to the MoD in Whitehall. The MoD refused even to recognise the existence of a 'Gulf War syndrome' until well after the US agreed there was reason for concern. (Not that the US has been completely open, far from it). There is another point - in complex areas involving scientific research, ministers have to rely on their expert advisers. Too many ministers don't ask the difficult questions. jsd104 Depleted Uranium is radioactive. Radioactivity is dangerous. QED. The idea that DU is safe, being pedalled by the likes of George Robertson is patently false. He is either a liar, or he is stupid. Of course, it is unfortunate if soldiers from any country have been contaminated by this poison. But they at least could have been expected to have some idea that it was dangerous. But what about the Kosovan Albanians for whom our politicians shed such huge crocodile tears in 1999? Here are some of the reported effects of DU. Journalist Felicity Arbuthnot visited southern Iraq and reported in 1999 that \"Iraq's leukemia rate has leapt 70 percent since the Gulf War\". As well as such cancers, she found \"an astonishing rise in congenital abnormalities\". She described seeing in one hospital a typical victim, \"a baby born an hour ago. \"The tiny being made small bleating noises. It had no genitalia, no eyes, nose, tongue, oesophagus or hands. Twisted legs were joined by a thick web of flesh from the knees.\" She reported that \"vegetation in the area shows up to 84 times background radiation\". The potential effects on pregnant women are all too obvious. Bosnia has suffered similarly. After US forces bombed the Ramont Institute near the town of Brataunac in 1995 Yugoslav scientists reported: \"There are unusual and unnatural occurrences in vegetation, among animals and human beings. Bizarre, massive illness has affected cows. Rapid hair loss is happening to boys of school age.\" An official investigation by the United Nations Environment Programme in Kosovo this year confirmed fears of depleted uranium contamination. Head of the programme Pekka Haavisto said, \"There remains a risk for the local population. Much ammunition is deep in the ground and affects groundwater.\" DU is a weapon of mass destruction and those authorising its use are guilty of war crimes. Ian70 DU has very low levels of radioactivity, so do many other materials, everywhere has background radioactivity. Everywhere is not dangerous. You have proved nothing. See my other post to bring some doubt on the role of DU in Iraq. Quoting official sources from Yugoslavia, prior to October 2000, is even more dangerous than trusting the MOD. NortonTaylor Well, I'm off now to hear what the MoD is saying next. Keep at it and thanks for your contributions. My email address is: richard.norton-taylor@theguardian.com Cheerio",

      "body": "<b>diva631</b> <br> Why is so little attention being given to the hapless civilian populations which cannot avoid ongoing exposure to depleted uranium all over their environment? I refer specifically to Iraqis as well as those living in Serbia and Kosovo. It seems that unless a NATO soldier gets ill, there is simply no problem. <p> <b>GulfWarVeterans</b> <br> Diva631 I totally agree with you ,a few media articles and programmes have highlighted these very points. It is also worth mentioning the many civilians who assisted our forces in this time of need, the gallant men and women of The Royal Fleet AUX and the many civilian engineers and specialists who assited us testing and maintaing our equipment, one who springs too mind is Paul Connelly, like our campaign more media coverage will quosh public apathy and misunderstanding about this subject.</p> <p><br> <b>wilsontown </b><br> I have a couple of questions on this. The first thing I want to know is what are the risks of DU ammunition, and are these risks a result of radioactivity or heavy metal toxicity, or a combination of both? Assuming that DU is a problem, how long will areas affected be contaminated for? <br> Concerns about NATO use of DU ammunition were raised at the time of the Kosovo conflict. Why has it taken so long for this issue to be addressed in any way by the UK government? </p> <p><b>MalcolmHooper</b> <br> At low level of exposure where the material is INSOLUBLE, INTERNALISED, IMMOBILISED following INHALATION into the lung it is the CUMULATIVE radiological dose that is the danger. The toxic metal effects are concentration dependent - generally lower concentration = lower toxicity. But the cumulative radiological toxicity increases with time - eg 1 mg of DU give 12.4 alpha particles and 24.8 beta particles per SECOND. Over 1 year this accumulates to &gt;390 million alpha particles and 780 million beta particles. Some Gulf Veterans have been found to be excreting small amounts of DU 8 years after the Gulf War They have therefore been exposed to an increasing radiological dose vastly in excess of any limits ~8000 times in 1 year according to Leonard Dietz. Alpha particles are 20 times more damaging to tissues when internalised - Malcolm H </p> <p><b>Koldo10</b> <br> I do not want to give any opinion about the toxicity or not of the DU ammunition. I am not an expert and I believe that scientists have the last say. But should this \"say\" be positive as so far it looks like, should the Iraqi Goverment or Iraqi people be elegible for any kind of compensation? What about the Serbs? These weapons may be the cause of dangerous illness for innocent civilians but... surely and sadly they will not be compensated at all. At the end of the day they are nationals of a defeated \"enemy country\" so who cares? well I do. </p> <p><b>sdmawby</b><br> Who was it who first thought of using depleted Uranium in weapons and how did he justify it? </p> <p><b>bbobb</b><br> DU is like many heavy metals toxic, in that when it is ingested, or inhaled in some gaseous compound is not good for you, but radioactivity is very low (you will find basements in many houses in Cornwall are far worse). It should be noted that lead when vaporised in a collision as a high velocity projectile, forms compounds which are not particulary good for you (lead paint, pipes, petrol). Maybe we should also ban lead as a projectile in ammunition. </p> <p><b>inks</b><br> Could exposure to DU produce the symptoms that appear to constitute \"Gulf War syndrome\"? It was certainly mentioned at the time, along with organophosphates and anti-nerve gas pills. <br> Are these symptoms similar to the illnesses affecting Balkan war veterans? <br> I understood that the UK did not use DU at the time of the Gulf War, instead we had anti-tank weapons that exploded a lump of explosive on the outside of the tank shell to kill the crew. </p> <p>If so, when did we change to using DU ammunition? </p> <p>Does DU have any other applications? Is it used commercially? </p> <p>Is the manufacture of DU ammunition a convenient way of disposing of radioactive waste? </p> <p><b>NortonTaylor</b> <br> Inks, in reply to your last question, yes, though not sure 'convenient' is quite the right word. A Nato spokesman proudly said yesterday it is also used in airlines and in boat keels. </p> <p><b>damngoodraddle</b> <br> A Nato spokesman proudly said yesterday it is also used in airlines where the risks have long been known by the US Federal Aviation Administration. </p> <p>U.S. FAA Advisory Circular No. 20-123: Avoiding Or Minimizing Encounters With Aircraft Equipped With Depleted Uranium Balance Weights During Accident Investigations , Dec. 20, 1984 </p> <p>http://www.faa.gov/fsdo/orl/files/ADVCIR/ac20-123.asc (it's a text file - open with notepad or somesuch ) </p> <p>some studies following crashes: Risk analysis of depleted uranium following an aircraft crash http://www.cyclone.nl/bijlmer/bijlmer.htm </p> <p><b>MalcolmHooper </b> <br> Yes- but the situation is complicated by the presence of other toxins on the battlefield that can also cause cancers, and other chronic illnesses including 1. vaccines given incorrectly or without proper research - this happened with anthrax/pertussis. 2. organophosphate and other pesticides. 3. oil and smoke from the fires. 4. chemical war agents - nerve agents and mustard gases. 5 use of pyridostigmine bromide as a prophyllactic against Soman nerve gas. - Malcolm H </p> <p><b>zoestec</b> <br> I too am very puzzled about what exactly the problem is. One man was reported to have everything wrong bar his leg falling off the other day,and not all the symptoms sounded like radiation sickness or leukaemia. Surely the fact that it is a heavy metal can partly account for some of the symptoms? Why was a metal with a long half-life chosen? Was it traded off for a low radiation emission metal? That means that the indigenous people will have to put up with long exposure to low doses. Nice! That is quite an effective way to get leukaemia some people believe... </p> <p><b>Adira </b> <br> Hapless civilians indeed! I saw the John Pilger documentary about Iraq a couple of months ago, and a number of doctors there have noticed that cancer rates have greatly increased since the Gulf War. Of course sanctions mean that there is no way of treating these cancer patients properly... </p> <p><b>Amazonas </b><br> When one takes into account the little regard that these governments have for their own forces, it becomes all too apparent just how little thought the plight of innocent civilians occupies in their minds. Of course, there is nothing new in this attitude, as we know from the cases of Iraq and Vietnam to mention a few. </p> <p>Hence, in the statement made to Parliament yesterday by the Secretary of State for Defence, reference of the risks to civilian populations exposed to this type of contamination was only made superficially. Not surprisingly, the likelihood that these civilian populations get the treatment and care they need and deserve is what it has always been - zero.</p> <p><b>mwm24 </b> <br> Journalists should speak to Doug Rokke, professor of environmental engineering and nuclear physics at Jacksonville State University, Alabama, USA. Rokke was the head of the US Army Theatre DU Assessment Team in the Gulf and was recalled to active duty in the US Army as DU Project Director. He has a 1943 Memorandum from the Manhattan Project to Brigadier General Groves discussing the use of DU as a terrain contaminant, a gas warfare instrument for inhalation amd a contaminator of the environment. Rokke has become a major campaigner against DU after seeing the men of his team sick and die, the US government refuse to circulate the reports he himself wrote. Rokke spoke in the conference of the Cambridge Campaign against Sanctions in Iraq last year (see website http://welcome.to/CASI) and, by his honour, knowledge and Southern American religiosity, reduced the audience to tears. </p> <p><b>csemmens </b> <br> I have two contributions to make to this debate: </p> <p>I hear the distinction being made between the \"radiation hazard\" and the \"toxic hazard\".There is some potential for confusion here and I would like you to make things clearer for everyone. </p> <p>When the uranium is outside the body, any radiation only impinges upon the body while it is close to the source of the radiation. Assuming this is only for a short time, the total damage caused by the radiation will be small. In addition, external radiation is attenuated by passage through any clothing and skin, before reaching live cells. In the case of alpha radiation, this attenuation is significant. </p> <p>Once swallowed or inhaled, the uranium may remain in the body for much longer periods of time. This increases the time during which damage can be caused, and also increases the proportion of radiation that reaches live cells - very substantially in the case of alpha radiation. This can be described as internal contamination with radioactive material. </p> <p>When the distinction is being made between \"radiation hazard\" and \"toxic hazard\", it would be quite possible to present the external radiation hazard as \"the radiation hazard\", treating the internal contamination as an issue of toxicity; and then to discuss the heavy metal toxicity as though that were similar to any other heavy metal - which it might well be. </p> <p>Is it not in fact the case that exposure to internal radiation from ingested uranium is a very much greater hazard than any chemical toxicity in the normal heavy metal sense? Of course the damage caused by such radiation is chemical; this must not be used to obfuscate the issue. </p> <p>Much is made of the fact that this uranium is depleted, that is, that the more radioactive U235 is partially removed, and that therefore the material is less radioactive than natural uranium. As I understand it, the economics of uranium isotope separation are such that only a fraction of the U235 is removed, so that the depleted uranium still contains a significant amount of U235. A few kilograms of depleted uranium contains as much U235 as a kilogram of natural uranium. </p> <p>However, in either case, the bulk of the radioactivity comes from U238, which is only 6 times less radioactive than U235, and constitutes over 99% of the material. </p> <p>It is quite disingenuous to suggest that depleted uranium is significantly less radioactive than natural uranium. Clive K Semmens, B.Sc. B.A. Cambridge UK </p> <p><b>MalcolmHooper </b> <br> csemmens - you are absolutely right. The MOD makes much of the toxic metal props and ignores the CUMULATIVE RADIOLOGICAL DOSE which from internalised immobilised insoluble uranium will build up whilst the particles remain in the body. In this way there is a gradual build up of alpha radiation in the region of a small number of cells whihc will cause mutations and therefore haave the possibility of initiating cancers and other diseases. 1mg of DU will generate 12.4 alpha particles per second with twice that number of beta rays (electrons) . Over 1 year this amounts to some 8000 times the present safe limits that are insecure and the focus of much debate. A paper on the dose limits for low level alpha radiatin in PNAS 1997 shows that even a single alpha particle can cause a mutation which might possibly lead to a cancer being fomed. I FIND THIS DISTURBING </p> <p><b>mudz </b><br> If it's safe, as you claim, why don't you send your family there on holiday. You may take Tony, Robin and Albright families together with Bill and his friends. Spend couple of months there and we will all believe you (maybe). The right thing would be now, for all you loot at NATO, to give yourself up to the War Crimes tribunal, but before that I'll suggest to appoint an independent judge first. We all know that it's not advisable to bite the hand that feeds you. </p> <p><b>Anthony12 </b><br> When I posted about two weeks ago there were just six cases here. They have now increased to 30 amongst Italian soldiers that served in the Balkans. </p> <p><b>damngoodraddle </b><br> csemmens - nice bit of pinning down of false arguments The MOD in http://www.mod.uk/index.php3?page=990 only mentions inhalation risk of oxides. It appears from high volume air sampling near gunnery sites that DU is detectable near point of firing not just target area. </p> <p>\"DU metal is covered by a protective coating\" worn off and DU particles formed by erosion in gun barrels ? </p> <p><b>MalcolmHooper </b> <br> damngoodraddle - Again you hit the nail on the head. The assertion that DU particles will only fall round within 10 metre range of the target is incorrect. From their own manuals and from a civilian case small particles can travel up to 25-30 miles on moderate breezes. It is these small particles that are the most dangerous since they most easily enter the deep lung on inhalation. The MOD's own memo states that the insoluble uranium oxide particles will lodge in the lung and remain there for years- possibly for ever! INSOLUBLE INHALED INTERNALISED IMMOBILISED - the 4 Is for DU to become a dangerous hazard with the capacity to cause \"lung, lymph, and brain cancers\" (from MOD document. I would add bone cancer since the slow elimination of particles from the lung involves scavenging cells that go into the lymphatic system). Uranium (like lead) is deposited in bone. Osteoporosis in Gulf Veterans and organophosphate poisoned farmers is now known to occur - it is very unusual in young MEN. DU and OPs could have a synergistic effect in this tissue. Additionally in the bone marrow are the blood forming stem cells which would therefore be open to radiation damage leading to other cancers of the blood. This material is best avoided. Malcolm Hooper </p> <p><b>mark012345 </b> <br> Any debate about whether and how harmful DU ammunition may be is about as enlightening as a discussion about the link between smoking and cancer, i.e. not at all, since by now the connection is obvious to even the most severely intellectually challenged.

      "bodyText": "diva631 Why is so little attention being given to the hapless civilian populations which cannot avoid ongoing exposure to depleted uranium all over their environment? I refer specifically to Iraqis as well as those living in Serbia and Kosovo. It seems that unless a NATO soldier gets ill, there is simply no problem. GulfWarVeterans Diva631 I totally agree with you ,a few media articles and programmes have highlighted these very points. It is also worth mentioning the many civilians who assisted our forces in this time of need, the gallant men and women of The Royal Fleet AUX and the many civilian engineers and specialists who assited us testing and maintaing our equipment, one who springs too mind is Paul Connelly, like our campaign more media coverage will quosh public apathy and misunderstanding about this subject. wilsontown I have a couple of questions on this. The first thing I want to know is what are the risks of DU ammunition, and are these risks a result of radioactivity or heavy metal toxicity, or a combination of both? Assuming that DU is a problem, how long will areas affected be contaminated for? Concerns about NATO use of DU ammunition were raised at the time of the Kosovo conflict. Why has it taken so long for this issue to be addressed in any way by the UK government? MalcolmHooper At low level of exposure where the material is INSOLUBLE, INTERNALISED, IMMOBILISED following INHALATION into the lung it is the CUMULATIVE radiological dose that is the danger. The toxic metal effects are concentration dependent - generally lower concentration = lower toxicity. But the cumulative radiological toxicity increases with time - eg 1 mg of DU give 12.4 alpha particles and 24.8 beta particles per SECOND. Over 1 year this accumulates to &gt;390 million alpha particles and 780 million beta particles. Some Gulf Veterans have been found to be excreting small amounts of DU 8 years after the Gulf War They have therefore been exposed to an increasing radiological dose vastly in excess of any limits ~8000 times in 1 year according to Leonard Dietz. Alpha particles are 20 times more damaging to tissues when internalised - Malcolm H Koldo10 I do not want to give any opinion about the toxicity or not of the DU ammunition. I am not an expert and I believe that scientists have the last say. But should this \"say\" be positive as so far it looks like, should the Iraqi Goverment or Iraqi people be elegible for any kind of compensation? What about the Serbs? These weapons may be the cause of dangerous illness for innocent civilians but... surely and sadly they will not be compensated at all. At the end of the day they are nationals of a defeated \"enemy country\" so who cares? well I do. sdmawby Who was it who first thought of using depleted Uranium in weapons and how did he justify it? bbobb DU is like many heavy metals toxic, in that when it is ingested, or inhaled in some gaseous compound is not good for you, but radioactivity is very low (you will find basements in many houses in Cornwall are far worse). It should be noted that lead when vaporised in a collision as a high velocity projectile, forms compounds which are not particulary good for you (lead paint, pipes, petrol). Maybe we should also ban lead as a projectile in ammunition. inks Could exposure to DU produce the symptoms that appear to constitute \"Gulf War syndrome\"? It was certainly mentioned at the time, along with organophosphates and anti-nerve gas pills. Are these symptoms similar to the illnesses affecting Balkan war veterans? I understood that the UK did not use DU at the time of the Gulf War, instead we had anti-tank weapons that exploded a lump of explosive on the outside of the tank shell to kill the crew. If so, when did we change to using DU ammunition? Does DU have any other applications? Is it used commercially? Is the manufacture of DU ammunition a convenient way of disposing of radioactive waste? NortonTaylor Inks, in reply to your last question, yes, though not sure 'convenient' is quite the right word. A Nato spokesman proudly said yesterday it is also used in airlines and in boat keels. damngoodraddle A Nato spokesman proudly said yesterday it is also used in airlines where the risks have long been known by the US Federal Aviation Administration. U.S. FAA Advisory Circular No. 20-123: Avoiding Or Minimizing Encounters With Aircraft Equipped With Depleted Uranium Balance Weights During Accident Investigations , Dec. 20, 1984 http://www.faa.gov/fsdo/orl/files/ADVCIR/ac20-123.asc (it's a text file - open with notepad or somesuch ) some studies following crashes: Risk analysis of depleted uranium following an aircraft crash http://www.cyclone.nl/bijlmer/bijlmer.htm MalcolmHooper Yes- but the situation is complicated by the presence of other toxins on the battlefield that can also cause cancers, and other chronic illnesses including 1. vaccines given incorrectly or without proper research - this happened with anthrax/pertussis. 2. organophosphate and other pesticides. 3. oil and smoke from the fires. 4. chemical war agents - nerve agents and mustard gases. 5 use of pyridostigmine bromide as a prophyllactic against Soman nerve gas. - Malcolm H zoestec I too am very puzzled about what exactly the problem is. One man was reported to have everything wrong bar his leg falling off the other day,and not all the symptoms sounded like radiation sickness or leukaemia. Surely the fact that it is a heavy metal can partly account for some of the symptoms? Why was a metal with a long half-life chosen? Was it traded off for a low radiation emission metal? That means that the indigenous people will have to put up with long exposure to low doses. Nice! That is quite an effective way to get leukaemia some people believe... Adira Hapless civilians indeed! I saw the John Pilger documentary about Iraq a couple of months ago, and a number of doctors there have noticed that cancer rates have greatly increased since the Gulf War. Of course sanctions mean that there is no way of treating these cancer patients properly... Amazonas When one takes into account the little regard that these governments have for their own forces, it becomes all too apparent just how little thought the plight of innocent civilians occupies in their minds. Of course, there is nothing new in this attitude, as we know from the cases of Iraq and Vietnam to mention a few. Hence, in the statement made to Parliament yesterday by the Secretary of State for Defence, reference of the risks to civilian populations exposed to this type of contamination was only made superficially. Not surprisingly, the likelihood that these civilian populations get the treatment and care they need and deserve is what it has always been - zero. mwm24 Journalists should speak to Doug Rokke, professor of environmental engineering and nuclear physics at Jacksonville State University, Alabama, USA. Rokke was the head of the US Army Theatre DU Assessment Team in the Gulf and was recalled to active duty in the US Army as DU Project Director. He has a 1943 Memorandum from the Manhattan Project to Brigadier General Groves discussing the use of DU as a terrain contaminant, a gas warfare instrument for inhalation amd a contaminator of the environment. Rokke has become a major campaigner against DU after seeing the men of his team sick and die, the US government refuse to circulate the reports he himself wrote. Rokke spoke in the conference of the Cambridge Campaign against Sanctions in Iraq last year (see website http://welcome.to/CASI) and, by his honour, knowledge and Southern American religiosity, reduced the audience to tears. csemmens I have two contributions to make to this debate: I hear the distinction being made between the \"radiation hazard\" and the \"toxic hazard\".There is some potential for confusion here and I would like you to make things clearer for everyone. When the uranium is outside the body, any radiation only impinges upon the body while it is close to the source of the radiation. Assuming this is only for a short time, the total damage caused by the radiation will be small. In addition, external radiation is attenuated by passage through any clothing and skin, before reaching live cells. In the case of alpha radiation, this attenuation is significant. Once swallowed or inhaled, the uranium may remain in the body for much longer periods of time. This increases the time during which damage can be caused, and also increases the proportion of radiation that reaches live cells - very substantially in the case of alpha radiation. This can be described as internal contamination with radioactive material. When the distinction is being made between \"radiation hazard\" and \"toxic hazard\", it would be quite possible to present the external radiation hazard as \"the radiation hazard\", treating the internal contamination as an issue of toxicity; and then to discuss the heavy metal toxicity as though that were similar to any other heavy metal - which it might well be. Is it not in fact the case that exposure to internal radiation from ingested uranium is a very much greater hazard than any chemical toxicity in the normal heavy metal sense? Of course the damage caused by such radiation is chemical; this must not be used to obfuscate the issue. Much is made of the fact that this uranium is depleted, that is, that the more radioactive U235 is partially removed, and that therefore the material is less radioactive than natural uranium. As I understand it, the economics of uranium isotope separation are such that only a fraction of the U235 is removed, so that the depleted uranium still contains a significant amount of U235. A few kilograms of depleted uranium contains as much U235 as a kilogram of natural uranium. However, in either case, the bulk of the radioactivity comes from U238, which is only 6 times less radioactive than U235, and constitutes over 99% of the material. It is quite disingenuous to suggest that depleted uranium is significantly less radioactive than natural uranium. Clive K Semmens, B.Sc. B.A. Cambridge UK MalcolmHooper csemmens - you are absolutely right. The MOD makes much of the toxic metal props and ignores the CUMULATIVE RADIOLOGICAL DOSE which from internalised immobilised insoluble uranium will build up whilst the particles remain in the body. In this way there is a gradual build up of alpha radiation in the region of a small number of cells whihc will cause mutations and therefore haave the possibility of initiating cancers and other diseases. 1mg of DU will generate 12.4 alpha particles per second with twice that number of beta rays (electrons) . Over 1 year this amounts to some 8000 times the present safe limits that are insecure and the focus of much debate. A paper on the dose limits for low level alpha radiatin in PNAS 1997 shows that even a single alpha particle can cause a mutation which might possibly lead to a cancer being fomed. I FIND THIS DISTURBING mudz If it's safe, as you claim, why don't you send your family there on holiday. You may take Tony, Robin and Albright families together with Bill and his friends. Spend couple of months there and we will all believe you (maybe). The right thing would be now, for all you loot at NATO, to give yourself up to the War Crimes tribunal, but before that I'll suggest to appoint an independent judge first. We all know that it's not advisable to bite the hand that feeds you. Anthony12 When I posted about two weeks ago there were just six cases here. They have now increased to 30 amongst Italian soldiers that served in the Balkans. damngoodraddle csemmens - nice bit of pinning down of false arguments The MOD in http://www.mod.uk/index.php3?page=990 only mentions inhalation risk of oxides. It appears from high volume air sampling near gunnery sites that DU is detectable near point of firing not just target area. \"DU metal is covered by a protective coating\" worn off and DU particles formed by erosion in gun barrels ? MalcolmHooper damngoodraddle - Again you hit the nail on the head. The assertion that DU particles will only fall round within 10 metre range of the target is incorrect. From their own manuals and from a civilian case small particles can travel up to 25-30 miles on moderate breezes. It is these small particles that are the most dangerous since they most easily enter the deep lung on inhalation. The MOD's own memo states that the insoluble uranium oxide particles will lodge in the lung and remain there for years- possibly for ever! INSOLUBLE INHALED INTERNALISED IMMOBILISED - the 4 Is for DU to become a dangerous hazard with the capacity to cause \"lung, lymph, and brain cancers\" (from MOD document. I would add bone cancer since the slow elimination of particles from the lung involves scavenging cells that go into the lymphatic system). Uranium (like lead) is deposited in bone. Osteoporosis in Gulf Veterans and organophosphate poisoned farmers is now known to occur - it is very unusual in young MEN. DU and OPs could have a synergistic effect in this tissue. Additionally in the bone marrow are the blood forming stem cells which would therefore be open to radiation damage leading to other cancers of the blood. This material is best avoided. Malcolm Hooper mark012345 Any debate about whether and how harmful DU ammunition may be is about as enlightening as a discussion about the link between smoking and cancer, i.e. not at all, since by now the connection is obvious to even the most severely intellectually challenged. I don't know whose bright idea it was to start making radioactive bullets, but I imagine they probably made at least as much money out of it as the idiot who dreamed up the animal feed that started BSE. And people are now wasting their time debating whether it was a bad idea? Time someone took the arms manufacturers to court for crimes against humanity. MalcolmHooper Right on Mark - we must not allow the bland unsubstantiated assurances of so-called experts rob us of our common sense. Your parallel is a good one. Another would be the organophosphate story especially as it applied in the Gulf. NO SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF DU RELEASED ON THE BATTLEFIELD OR ELSEWHERE- THERE IS NO DATA THEREFORE COMMONSENSE MUST BE OUR GUIDE.

      "bodyText": "Christopher Stoddart revealed today that he has been \"looking for the right opportunity\" outside GMTV for the past two years. Mr Stoddart, who is leaving in May to become chief executive of TV horseracing consortium Go Racing, said he \"had had previous opportunities to move\", but turned them down. He added: \"I decided I had to stay and see GMTV into profitability. But since the licence renewal I have been looking for the right opportunity.\" Mr Stoddart joined GMTV in 1992 before it launched. Of the broadcaster's troubled early years, he said: \"At the beginning there was a lot more competition more quickly than we could have contemplated. But we got through that quite quickly.\" He added that he had enjoyed the buzz of being with a live TV outfit, with a \"team working hard to bring fresh stories and features to viewers each day\". Commercially, Mr Stoddart said securing the licence renewal had been a high point. He said that he was also proud that so many GMTV staff had stayed with the station so long. \"Something like 50 staff out of 250 have been here since 1993.\" Fittingly, the November 1998 renewal of GMTV's broadcasting licence by the Independent Television Commission is regarded as the greatest achievement of Mr Stoddart's tenure at the firm. For the new licence came with a \u00a330m reduction in the \u00a350m annual licence payment to the Treasury that nearly sank GMTV after it went on air on January 1 1993. In those early years the breakfast broadcaster lost money and was criticised by the ITC fine over the poor quality of its programming. Mr Stoddart has since guided the company into calmer financial and editorial waters. GMTV broke even in 1995 and in 2000 posted 20% year-on-year increase in profit before tax to \u00a37.6m.",

      "body": "<p>To most outsiders, and of course to many Americans too, it seems barely believable that any modern, serious politician in the United States should express a hankering, however obliquely and conditional, for the ideals of the southern confederacy.</p> <p>Yet incredibly that is the situation which the US senate now faces as it prepares to conduct confirmation hearings for two of George W Bush's cabinet nominees - John Ashcroft of Missouri, the would-be attorney-general, and Gale Norton of Colorado, who has been nominated as interior secretary - both of whom have publicly praised the pro-slavery confederacy.</p> <p>We are not talking youthful indiscretion here. Mr Ashcroft's praise was offered only two years ago in an extensive interview with a magazine called Southern Partisan. In the course of the interview, Ashcroft said it was important to defend \"southern patriots\" like Jefferson Davis and Robert E Lee.</p> <p>\"Traditionalists must do more. I've got to do more. We've all got to speak up in this respect, or else we'll be taught that these people were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes and their honour to some perverted agenda,\" Ashcroft said.</p> <p>To many people, the meaning of such words is difficult to misunderstand. Preserving slavery, Ashcroft is implying, is not a perverted agenda.</p> <p>Ashcroft is not a fool. He knew well enough that the Southern Partisan thinks of itself as part of the so-called \"neo-confederate moverment\". In his interview he praised the magazine for helping \"to set the record straight\".</p> <p>Yet the magazine's views include a 1996 defence of slave owners for \"encouraging strong slave families\" and a 1990 claim that the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was \"a populist spokesperson for a recapturing of the American ideal\".</p> <p>Gale Norton's public praise for the confederacy came in 1996, when she told a conservative group in a speech in Denver \"We lost too much\" when the south was defeated in the civil war of 1861-5.</p> <p>In her speech, given when she was Colorado attorney general, Norton did not offer support for slavery. But she did extol the confederacy during her speech supporting states' rights.</p> <p>\"We certainly had bad facts in that case where we were defending state sovereignty by defending slavery,\" Norton told the Independence Institute. \"But we lost too much.

      "bodyText": "To most outsiders, and of course to many Americans too, it seems barely believable that any modern, serious politician in the United States should express a hankering, however obliquely and conditional, for the ideals of the southern confederacy. Yet incredibly that is the situation which the US senate now faces as it prepares to conduct confirmation hearings for two of George W Bush's cabinet nominees - John Ashcroft of Missouri, the would-be attorney-general, and Gale Norton of Colorado, who has been nominated as interior secretary - both of whom have publicly praised the pro-slavery confederacy. We are not talking youthful indiscretion here. Mr Ashcroft's praise was offered only two years ago in an extensive interview with a magazine called Southern Partisan. In the course of the interview, Ashcroft said it was important to defend \"southern patriots\" like Jefferson Davis and Robert E Lee. \"Traditionalists must do more. I've got to do more. We've all got to speak up in this respect, or else we'll be taught that these people were giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes and their honour to some perverted agenda,\" Ashcroft said. To many people, the meaning of such words is difficult to misunderstand. Preserving slavery, Ashcroft is implying, is not a perverted agenda. Ashcroft is not a fool. He knew well enough that the Southern Partisan thinks of itself as part of the so-called \"neo-confederate moverment\". In his interview he praised the magazine for helping \"to set the record straight\". Yet the magazine's views include a 1996 defence of slave owners for \"encouraging strong slave families\" and a 1990 claim that the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was \"a populist spokesperson for a recapturing of the American ideal\". Gale Norton's public praise for the confederacy came in 1996, when she told a conservative group in a speech in Denver \"We lost too much\" when the south was defeated in the civil war of 1861-5. In her speech, given when she was Colorado attorney general, Norton did not offer support for slavery. But she did extol the confederacy during her speech supporting states' rights. \"We certainly had bad facts in that case where we were defending state sovereignty by defending slavery,\" Norton told the Independence Institute. \"But we lost too much. We lost the idea that the states were to stand against the federal government having too much power over our lives.\" As Norton's remarks make clear, the issue for many modern conservatives is the issue of states' rights, which was also the issue which drove the confederate states into rebellion in 1861. Ashcroft would probably claim that this was all that he was supporting, too, though the tone of his remarks is more equivocal on slavery than Norton's. Both Ashcroft and Norton live in the modern world. They are perfectly well aware that in the eyes of almost all black Americans - and probably of most white Americans too - to praise the confederacy is at some level to condone the phenomenon most intimately associated with the war between the states: black slavery. The modern world indisputably has an honoured place for what Americans call states' rights. Britain has carried out a series of devolutionary reforms. The European Union embraces the doctrine of \"subsidiarity\" in which decisions should be made at the closest possible level to the people who are directly affected by them. Transparency, the reinvention of civil society, and the importance of regional and city self-government are all concepts that are close to the hearts of those on the progressive left as well as those on the traditional anti-centralising right. Federalism, in the true meaning of the term, remains in vogue both in the US and outside it, perfectly properly.

      "bodyText": "Staff at Express Digital Media have taken their protest over the handling of the sale of the Express websites to trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers. Staff led by Michael Streeter, editor of express.co.uk, are seeking the minister's views on the handling of the sale of the Express's digital arm, which has left them without jobs or the offer of redundancy payments. In a letter sent today, Michael Streeter said: \"We believe the whole affair raises serious issues of public interest and we are seeking your views on the matter. \"Naturally, we are taking legal advice, (though the case is not yet sub judice). But in the meantime, we would urge you to look into the matter as soon as possible.\" Ministers have the power to halt Mr Desmond's takeover of the Express Newspapers on the grounds that it is against the public interest. An early day motion lodged last year and signed by 10 MPs expressed \"grave concerns that national newspapers within the Express Group should have fallen under the ownership of a publisher of pornography\". But Mr Byers is thought to be unlikely to refer the merger to the Competition Commission for investigation. Staff are seeking legal advice after the sale of the websites to investment group Seymour Pierce, which has put the sites into liquidation. Mr Streeter has branded the circumstances of the sale as \"a cynical ploy\" to avoid paying redundancy payments. Meanwhile, Express Newspapers is also being sued by a software firm for \u00a3159,000 in unpaid invoices for technical work. Express spokesmen said that they do not believe the employees have a legal case.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's 10.30am and Tom Hanks is feeling jiggy. \"I think I'm on my ninth coffee of the day,\" he says. \"So I'm a little ... jiggy.\" Jiggy? There's a brisk, emphatic nod. \"Yeah, you know. Jiggy. The way you feel when you're on your ninth coffee of the day. Jiggy. That's what I am.\" Which is fine. After all, when you're Tom Hanks, who's going to argue? So, he's feeling jiggy; he's carrying a delicate silver teaspoon (\"I need something to do with my hands\") and sporting the first nervous tufts of an incipient moustache, half-grown for a role in Sam Mendes' forthcoming Road to Perdition. Such is the prerogative of Hollywood's favourite son. He leans in, poised and attentive. \"OK. It's a pleasure. Nice to chat with you.\" </p> <p>Or, in other words, to business: more specifically to Cast Away, his latest vehicle in which he reunites with Forrest Gump director Robert Zemeckis, and in which he stars as Chuck Noland, a punctilious delivery man marooned on a sub-tropical island following a cataclysmic plane crash. This much will be familiar to anyone acquainted with the film's bizarrely action-packed trailer, currently splashed all over British TV. \"You like it?\" he asks. \"Oh, good. Me too.\" </p> <p>But there's something the kinetic nature of the trailer doesn't quite convey about Cast Away, and that's the fervour for authenticity involved in making it. Because, hovering between arch-professionalism and outright lunacy, one-man-show Hanks threw himself into his role with a zeal not seen since the heyday of Robert De Niro. </p> <p>First came colossal weight gain. \"I was 40lb over. Just horribly fat.\" Next, three months filming on the obscure Fijian island of Monuriki, home of little beyond the critically endangered crested iguana. Then, nothing. Nothing but a year to lose his excess heft and more besides; a year eating \"miserly\" portions and cultivating the unkempt Crusoe beard that left him wandering the awards ceremonies of LA like a hobo in Armani. Finally, five stone lighter, he and Zemeckis (who spent the hiatus making the thriller What Lies Beneath) returned to Monuriki, only to be interrupted when a blister on Hanks's knee, untreated in the heat, turned septic. Back to California; straight into hospital. </p> <p>He must have discussed the entire experience countless times while promoting the film in America. Yet there's still a vague tremor to his voice when he recalls, for example, the cable connecting his rubber raft to the crew snapping one afternoon, leaving him drifting quietly into the Pacific. \"I was there 40 minutes. I mean, I wasn't in any real danger but at the same time, you realise that there's no one else around, and no place else to go. That's it. You and the sea. It's kind of freaky.\" So, all things considered, did he enjoy Monuriki? \"Ah, no. No. In certain ways it was incredible, but in lots of ways it was excruciating. Most of the time, I was just exhausted.\" </p> <p>And then you remember that this is the man who not only gladly submitted to military boot camp for his role in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, but convinced his co-stars to stick with the Spam and assault courses when they threatened to mutiny. You can't help wondering if there's something telling in his attraction to Method gusto and physical discomfort, as if the business of acting wasn't enough for him without a frisson of cold, painful reality. Amused, if not entirely convinced, he toys with his spoon. </p> <p>\"Well, you do what the job calls for. With Ryan there had to be a familiarity with all that was required - you know, how much the equipment weighed, how it changed your body shape. With this, certainly for the first half, I didn't do anything. Literally. I did not do a thing except eat. I mean, taking that into account, the physicality of the movie was ...\" He hesitates. I'm expecting him to say Immensely Gratifying or A Fantastic Challenge. \"Back-breaking. No fun for anybody. Just arduous and difficult and backbreaking.\" </p> <p>He brightens. \"But, in fact, with the fat and then the beard, it was a great freedom. Because you're going to look terrible whatever you do. You no longer have a good side. So you get past the self-consciousness and say, 'Well, this is what I look like because this is what is called for.' You know? It's like being squeezed through an hourglass. And you come out the other side and see this great opportunity to go and explore.\" </p> <p>And what he chooses to explore is the interesting part. Certainly, Cast Away is a remarkable piece of film-making, in its use of something you never hear in movies any more: silence. In place of a voiceover or rousing soundtrack, there's just the heavy swell of hush, broken after 60 noiseless minutes by Chuck's conversations with a volleyball, rescued from one of his packages. Hollywood's first existential blockbuster? </p> <p>\"Oh yeah,\" he says. \"And that's what we were trying to do from the start. But look, if we were to say to the studio, 'Hey guys, we want to make this kind of ambiguous, Sisyphean drama', they're not going to jump up and down and say, 'Gee Tom! That's exactly the movie we wanna make too!' You know? But yeah, we tried to break some rules.\" </p> <p>Ignoring the glass in front of him, he takes an almighty swig from his water bottle. \"Because there is a standard way of telling this story, and that's to have a rich, snotty guy who's obviously not in touch with what's important and blah, blah, blah and then he learns a lesson and he's not like that any more. But Chuck learns no great lessons. He's just this guy who has this job, fate deals him this hand, and suddenly he's standing there saying, 'My God, you know, over and above good and bad, isn't life strange?' So there's a protracted philosophical discussion to be had around this story. And now I can't even remember what the question was.\" For a second, he looks perplexed. \"Maybe I'm working too hard.\" </p> <p>Still, for his pains, he should - according to rumour - soon be making another of his famously ardent Oscar acceptance speeches. If so, it'll be his third in a decade (following 1993's Philadelphia and the aforementioned Gump), another gong in a career built on scale and prestige, on blue-chip movies to which he brings the promise of near-certain box office omnipotence. The man's bulletproof - amid the Sleepless In Seattles and Saving Private Ryans, who even remembers his role in the clunking, commercially disastrous Bonfire of the Vanities? </p> <p> With his benign sarcasm and uncertain facial hair, he could be an accountant from Kentucky or a cab driver from Oregon, in town on vacation. Only he's not. He is, by popular estimate, the biggest and brightest of them all; bigger than Mel Gibson, bigger than Tom Cruise, bigger than Jim Carrey, Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt put together. Immaculate in his courtesy, witty and precise in conversation, he still isn't here - tapping his spoon and swigging his water - to be your friend. He's here on business. And when Tom Hanks wants to do business, the world wants in. So what's it like, knowing an entire industry is waiting for the click of your fingers? </p> <p>\"Well, perspective is the thing. And perspective is very gossamer. Very fragile. I mean, in terms of work, just because someone can get something done, that doesn't mean it should be done. Sure, I could go into a studio and say, 'I'd like to make a movie about coal miners', and someone will produce a story about coal miners, and someone will direct it and we'll make a movie about coal miners. And no one will care. But if there's already a great story out there about coal miners, then maybe something could happen. The responsibility is to go into whatever it is full-bore. You can't have a passing interest. Because once I give them a yes, the trucks start pulling up and it starts costing money.\" </p> <p>Talking of which, I say, and he smiles. Because with the clout comes the money, and these days the money comes in $20m bundles. Does that leave him feeling guilty? \"Guilty? No.\" Uneasy? \"Sometimes. The most accurate representation of how I feel is that I'm incredibly lucky to be working in this structure where people get paid millions to read the news on TV. And, yes, it is insane. And there is nothing I can say beyond acknowledging my immense good fortune, and being aware that I'm blessed, and aware that it isn't going to last forever. You know? The tricky part is making it stick.\" </p> <p> Making it stick. Despite his protestations, he's made a fine job of it - and all without venturing too far from his time-honoured, well-honed persona. Cast Away may have its hopelessness and melancholy - unlike his nearest peer Tom Cruise's actorly forays with Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia, it doesn't oblige its star to attend orgies or use genital expletives. \"Those movies are amazing things,\" he shrugs. \"But I'm attracted to what I'm attracted to. I'm not interested in doing something edgy with a capital E just so everyone knows, 'Oh, OK, now he's showing us he can do edgy.'\" </p> <p>So would he have done Sam Mendes' American Beauty, thereby requiring him to masturbate, smoke dope and threaten his (male) boss with sexual harassment charges? \"Oh, if I'd read it, I'd have done it. God, yeah. It's like, uh, any movies you wish you'd made? Yeah - that one. That would've been nice.\" Which, presumably, is why he's working with the director on Road to Perdition, playing a fictional henchman of Al Capone? \"Well, partly. I mean, I've known Sam a while.\" Suddenly excited, he plucks a magazine from the table. Jude Law gazes out from its cover. \"Jude Law is in it too!\" he says. \"Jude Law! Jude Law!\" He waves the British actor's face in front of his own. I'm not sure what to say. He puts the magazine back neatly where he found it. \"But that's another case where it's not a generic choice of what type of film I want to make. It's a very specific thing, where I know exactly where I'm going.\" </p> <p>And wherever that is, his public will surely follow. Because, in a way that precious few film stars have ever become, even at his end of the firmament, Hanks, to his fans, is more than just a face on a magazine cover. He's one of them: an average Joe, an Everyman, America's fondest self-image made flesh. Nice is how he's routinely, inescapably described - nice to his co-stars, nice to autograph hunters, even nice to Monuriki, with the World Wildlife Fund thanking him for helping preserve the island's flora and fauna (including the crested iguana). </p> <p>And nice he is, genuinely so. Except nice belies his brightness, a presence of mind sufficiently acute to know that no one is quite as nice as Hanks is supposed to be. Which must constitute some serious pressure. \"No,\" he says. \"It doesn't. It would if I slavishly adhered to that branding, and did nothing but attempt to cash in on it. But look, I was born in 1956, the peak year for births in US history. I think I'm very representative of many of the thought processes my generation have been through and, by and large, people of my age have had their imprint planted on the consciousness of western society for a long time. So that's how it adds up. I mean, I've pursued jobs that have fascinated me as an individual. The other stuff has just somehow miraculously fallen into some sort of place.\" </p> <p>The other stuff meaning the awe-inspiring likeability which has long fuelled earnest talk - though not from him - of an eventual move into politics. The presidency is often mentioned. A reliable contributor to Democratic funds (albeit one who regretted supporting Clinton's impeachment defence), he bridles slightly when you raise the subject. </p> <p>\"Well, I'm politically aware. I talk about politics all the time, and I do so quite animatedly in the privacy of my own... salon. But actors with political views are a dime a dozen. And the only reason this comes up is that the New Yorker once ran a very funny article about me where their whole take was, 'Here's a guy that's running for president.' And it's insane. I'm not. Never have been. Never would. But once that gets out, there's nothing you can do about it. And I'm not apolitical - I'm very specific in my politics. But a lot of the time it's nobody's business unless you're over at my house having dinner.\" </p> <p>Which is exactly the sort of decent, eminently sensible comment you might expect. I tell him the concept of President Hanks probably holds so much water because he's so obviously not the kind of guy who would ever want the job. Just like he's not the kind of guy you typically find with Hollywood in the palm of his hand. There are, after all, plenty of nice, smart people working at McDonald's. Yet, when you study his face for signs of how he made it from college drop-out to all-purpose icon, you come up blank. There's no dart in the eyes, no curl of the lip. Does he think he's ruthless? Careerist even? </p> <p>\"I don't think I am.\" He sounds as if he's considering the issue for the first time in his life. \"No, I don't think I am.\" So how would he explain his success? \"Well, you know, it's been a little pokey here and there. But... look, it's very hard to say no. And rather than being able to say yes to the right things, I think I've been able to say no to the wrong things. Which is hard, because a lot of the time the story is good, the people are great, and it's a nice chunk of change they offer you. But if it's not right, it's not right. And that requires a degree of discipline, and no small amount of understanding of the work you want to do. I think that's the only way we really get to define ourselves - not so much by what we say yes to, as what we say no to.\"</p> <p> OK. Just so we're clear on this: there is no masterplan. Hanks does the parts he wants, and the parts he wants are the parts that interest him. Simple. In which case, what is it about those parts, besides their niceness and their perennial appeal to Oscar voters? Glance back through his career and the thread you find, running through Forrest Gump and Sleepless In Seattle, through Philadelphia, Toy Story and now - most definitively - through Cast Away, is loneliness. Loneliness and transience. And then it's hard not to think of Hanks at five, being spirited away by his hotel chef father, Amos, to spend the rest of his childhood moving nomadically around the suburbs of California, with a different set of stepmothers and temporary siblings every six months. He takes another swig of water. Is there any correlation there? </p> <p>\"Oh, I think there is. Sure. But I also think all of the great stories in literature deal with loneliness. Sometimes it's by way of heartbreak, sometimes it's by way of injustice, sometimes it's by way of fate. There's an infinite number of ways to examine it. And if there's a reason it always seems to be there with me, it's because it's so palpable to all of us. You can turn everything into an aspect of that battle against quiet despair, because we all fight it at some point in order to feel we're part of humanity. And sure, the work gives me a chance to re-examine that from the places I've been as a human being. But the battles against loneliness that I fought when I was 16 are very different from those I fought when I was 27, and those are very different from the ones I fight at 44.\" </p> <p>So he's still lonely now? \"Oh sure. Like I say, aren't we all? And I think that it's infinitely fascinating.\" There are two last questions I want to ask about Cast Away. The first is whether the name of his volleyball companion on Monuriki, Wilson, is coincidence: his wife of 12 years being actress Rita Wilson, sitting upstairs as we speak. \"Oh, that was in the script,\" he says. \"Anyway, it's a much better name than Adidas.\" The second concerns a scene in which - in a rare moment on dry, inhabited land - he finds himself driving to a crossroads. The symbolism's obvious, verging on the glaring. But does Hanks ever wonder about the road not taken? Or the road ahead? He looks at me like I've asked him to name the capital of France. </p> <p>\"Oh God. You don't think about that. That's not the important stuff.\" He stares at his bottle, his spoon, then me. \"The important stuff is who else is in the car.\" </p> <p> <strong>From drop-out to superstar</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> 1956:</strong> Born in Concord, California. <br></p> <p><strong> 1961:</strong> Parents separate.

      "bodyText": "It's 10.30am and Tom Hanks is feeling jiggy. \"I think I'm on my ninth coffee of the day,\" he says. \"So I'm a little ... jiggy.\" Jiggy? There's a brisk, emphatic nod. \"Yeah, you know. Jiggy. The way you feel when you're on your ninth coffee of the day. Jiggy. That's what I am.\" Which is fine. After all, when you're Tom Hanks, who's going to argue? So, he's feeling jiggy; he's carrying a delicate silver teaspoon (\"I need something to do with my hands\") and sporting the first nervous tufts of an incipient moustache, half-grown for a role in Sam Mendes' forthcoming Road to Perdition. Such is the prerogative of Hollywood's favourite son. He leans in, poised and attentive. \"OK. It's a pleasure. Nice to chat with you.\" Or, in other words, to business: more specifically to Cast Away, his latest vehicle in which he reunites with Forrest Gump director Robert Zemeckis, and in which he stars as Chuck Noland, a punctilious delivery man marooned on a sub-tropical island following a cataclysmic plane crash. This much will be familiar to anyone acquainted with the film's bizarrely action-packed trailer, currently splashed all over British TV. \"You like it?\" he asks. \"Oh, good. Me too.\" But there's something the kinetic nature of the trailer doesn't quite convey about Cast Away, and that's the fervour for authenticity involved in making it. Because, hovering between arch-professionalism and outright lunacy, one-man-show Hanks threw himself into his role with a zeal not seen since the heyday of Robert De Niro. First came colossal weight gain. \"I was 40lb over. Just horribly fat.\" Next, three months filming on the obscure Fijian island of Monuriki, home of little beyond the critically endangered crested iguana. Then, nothing. Nothing but a year to lose his excess heft and more besides; a year eating \"miserly\" portions and cultivating the unkempt Crusoe beard that left him wandering the awards ceremonies of LA like a hobo in Armani. Finally, five stone lighter, he and Zemeckis (who spent the hiatus making the thriller What Lies Beneath) returned to Monuriki, only to be interrupted when a blister on Hanks's knee, untreated in the heat, turned septic. Back to California; straight into hospital. He must have discussed the entire experience countless times while promoting the film in America. Yet there's still a vague tremor to his voice when he recalls, for example, the cable connecting his rubber raft to the crew snapping one afternoon, leaving him drifting quietly into the Pacific. \"I was there 40 minutes. I mean, I wasn't in any real danger but at the same time, you realise that there's no one else around, and no place else to go. That's it. You and the sea. It's kind of freaky.\" So, all things considered, did he enjoy Monuriki? \"Ah, no. No. In certain ways it was incredible, but in lots of ways it was excruciating. Most of the time, I was just exhausted.\" And then you remember that this is the man who not only gladly submitted to military boot camp for his role in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, but convinced his co-stars to stick with the Spam and assault courses when they threatened to mutiny. You can't help wondering if there's something telling in his attraction to Method gusto and physical discomfort, as if the business of acting wasn't enough for him without a frisson of cold, painful reality. Amused, if not entirely convinced, he toys with his spoon. \"Well, you do what the job calls for. With Ryan there had to be a familiarity with all that was required - you know, how much the equipment weighed, how it changed your body shape. With this, certainly for the first half, I didn't do anything. Literally. I did not do a thing except eat. I mean, taking that into account, the physicality of the movie was ...\" He hesitates. I'm expecting him to say Immensely Gratifying or A Fantastic Challenge. \"Back-breaking. No fun for anybody. Just arduous and difficult and backbreaking.\" He brightens. \"But, in fact, with the fat and then the beard, it was a great freedom. Because you're going to look terrible whatever you do. You no longer have a good side. So you get past the self-consciousness and say, 'Well, this is what I look like because this is what is called for.' You know?

      "bodyText": "Sir Sean Connery is set to throw his weight behind the Scottish period drama, Mary, Queen of Scots, although there are apparently no plans for the 70-year-old to appear in the project. Screen Daily reports that the Scottish actor's production company, Fountainbridge Films (named after the birthplace of the former Bond star), is joining forces with BBC Films and Intermedia to fund the lavish drama. At \u00a320m, the film, apparently one of the BBC's most expensive projects to date, is part of BBC director general Greg Dyke's stated ambition to take on Hollywood with British films (see earlier story ). Jimmy McGovern, who has garnered acclaim for scripting TV dramas Hillsborough and Cracker and more recently wrote the screenplay for Stephen Frears' Liam, is working on the script for the film and according to Screen Daily has already finished a first draft. It is also reported that McGovern has confirmed that Fountainbridge, which recently produced Entrapment, starring Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, is to co-produce with Scotland's Raging Star Films. The film will focus on the Queen's time as a young woman in Scotland and her love affair with an earl. \u0095 More information about Mary, Queen of Scots.",

In life, though, she never invaded his patch; once inside the churchyard gate he was on his own ground, in his element. He was good at funerals, being gaunt and lined, marked with mortality. He had a scar down his hollow cheek too, which Grandma had done with the carving knife one of the many times when he came home pissed and incapable.</p> <p>That, though, was when they were still 'speaking', before my time. Now they mostly monologued and swore at each other's backs, and he (and I) would slam out of the house and go off between the graves, past the yew tree with a hollow where the cat had her litters and the various vaults that were supposed to account for the smell in the vicarage cellars in wet weather. On our right was the church; off to our left the graves stretched away, bisected by a grander gravel path leading down from the church porch to a bit of green with a war memorial, then - across the road - the mere. The church was popular for weddings because of this impressive approach, but he wasn't at all keen on the marriage ceremony, naturally enough. Burials he relished, perhaps because he saw himself as buried alive.</p> <p>One day we stopped to watch the gravedigger, who unearthed a skull - it was an old churchyard, on its second or third time around - and grandfather dusted off the soil and declaimed: 'Alas poor Yorick, I knew him well...' I thought he was making it up as he went along. When I grew up a bit and saw Hamlet and found him out, I wondered what had been going through his mind. I suppose the scene struck him as an image of his condition - exiled to a remote, illiterate rural parish, his talents wasted and so on. On the other hand his position afforded him a lot of opportunities for indulging secret, bitter jokes, hamming up the act and cherishing his ironies, so in a way he was enjoying himself. Back then, I thought that was what a vicar was, simply: someone bony and eloquent and smelly (tobacco, candle grease, sour claret), who talked into space. His disappointments were just part of the act for me, along with his dog-collar and cassock. I was like a baby goose imprinted by the first mother-figure it sees - he was my black marker.</p> <p>It was certainly easy to spot him at a distance too. But this was a village where it seemed everybody was their vocation. They didn't just 'know their place', it was as though the place occupied them, so that they all knew what they were going to be from the beginning. People's names conspired to colour in this picture. The gravedigger was actually called Mr Downward. The blacksmith who lived by the mere was called Bywater. Even more decisively, the family who owned the village were called Hanmer, and so was the village. The Hanmers had come over with the Conqueror, got as far as the Welsh border and stayed ever since in this little rounded isthmus of North Wales sticking out into England, the detached portion of Flintshire (Flintshire Maelor) as it was called then, surrounded by Shropshire, Cheshire and - on the Welsh side - Denbighshire. There was no town in the Maelor district, only villages and hamlets; Flintshire proper was some way off; and (then) industrial, which made it in practice a world away from these pastoral parishes, which had become resigned to being handed a Labour MP at every election. People in Hanmer well understood, in almost a prideful way, that we weren't part of all that. The kind of choice represented by voting didn't figure large on the local map and you only really counted places you could get to on foot or by bike.</p> <p>The war had changed this to some extent, but not as much as it might have because farming was a reserved occupation and sons hadn't been called up unless there were a lot of them, or their families were smallholders with little land. So Hanmer in the 1940s in many ways resembled Hanmer in the 1920s, or even the late 1800s except that it was more depressed, less populous and more out of step - more and more islanded in time as the years had gone by. We didn't speak Welsh either, so that there was little national feeling, rather a sense of stubbornly being 'where you were' and that was that. Also very un-Welsh was the fact that Hanmer had no chapel to rival Grandfather's church: the Hanmers would never lease land to Nonconformists and there was no tradition of Dissent, except in the form of not going to church at all. Many people did attend, though, partly because he was locally famous for his sermons, and because he was High Church and went in for dressing up and altar boys and frequent communions. Not frequent enough to explain the amount of wine he got through, however. Eventually the Church stopped his supply and after that communicants got watered-down Sanatogen from Boots the chemist in Whitchurch, over the Shropshire border.</p> <p>The delinquencies that had denied him preferment seemed to do him little harm with his parishioners. Perhaps the vicar was expected to be an expert in sin. At all events he was 'a character'. To my childish eyes people in Hanmer were divided between characters and the rest, the ones and the many. Higher up the social scale there was only one of you: one vicar, one solicitor, each farmer identified by the name of his farm and so sui generis. True, there were two doctors, but they were brothers and shared the practice. Then there was one policeman, one publican, one district nurse, one butcher, one baker ... Smallholders and farm labourers were the many and often had large families too. They were irretrievably plural and supposed to be interchangeable (feckless all), nameable only as tribes. The virtues and vices of the singular people turned into characteristics. They were picturesque. They had no common denominator and you never judged them in relation to a norm. Coming to consciousness in Hanmer was oddly blissful at the beginning: the grown-ups all played their parts to the manner born. You knew where you were.</p> <p>Which was a hole, according to Grandma. A dead-alive dump. A muck heap. She'd shake a trembling fist at the people going past the vicarage to church each Sunday, although they probably couldn't see her from behind the bars and dirty glass. She didn't upset my version of pastoral. She lived in a different dimension, she said as much herself. In her world there were streets with pavements, shop windows, trams, trains, teashops and cinemas. She never went out except to visit this paradise lost, by taxi to the station in Whitchurch, then by train to Shrewsbury or Chester. This was 'life'. Scented soap and chocolates would stand in for it the rest of the time - most of the time, in fact, since there was never any money. She'd evolved a way of living that resolutely defied her lot. He might play the vicar, she wouldn't be the vicar's wife. Their rooms were at opposite ends of the house and she spent much of the day in bed. She had asthma, and even the smell of him and his tobacco made her sick. She'd stay up late in the evening, alone, reading about scandals and murders in the News of the World by lamplight among the mice and silverfish in the kitchen (she'd hoard coal for the fire up in her room and sticks to relight it if necessary). She never answered the door, never saw anyone, did no housework. She cared only for her sister and her girlhood friends back in South Wales and - perhaps - for me, since I had blue eyes and blonde hair and was a girl, so just possibly belonged to her family line. She thought men and women belonged to different races and any getting together was worse than folly. The 'old devil', my grandfather, had talked her into marriage and the agony of bearing two children, and he should never be forgiven for it. She would quiver with rage whenever she remembered her fall. She was short (about four foot ten) and as fat and soft-fleshed as he was thin and leathery, so her theory of separate races looked quite plausible. The rhyme about Jack Sprat ('Jack Sprat would eat no fat, / His wife would eat no lean, / And so between the two of them / They licked the platter clean') struck me, when I learned it, as somehow about them. Looking back, I can see that she must have been a factor - along with the booze (and the womanising) - in keeping him back in the Church. She got her revenge, but at the cost of living in the muck heap herself.</p> <p>Between the two of them my grandparents created an atmosphere in the vicarage so pungent and all-pervading that they accounted for everything. In fact, it wasn't so. My mother, their daughter, was there; I only remember her, though, at the beginning, as a shy, slender wraith kneeling on the stairs with a brush and dustpan, or washing things in the scullery. They'd made her into a domestic drudge after her marriage - my father was away in the army and she had no separate life. It was she who answered the door and tried to keep up appearances, a battle long lost. She wore her fair hair in a victory roll and she was pretty but didn't like to smile. Her front teeth were false - crowned, a bit clumsily - because in her teens, running to intervene in one of their murderous rows, she'd fallen down the stairs and snapped off her own. During these years she probably didn't feel much like smiling anyway. She doesn't come into the picture properly yet, nor does my father. My only early memory of him is being picked up by a man in uniform and being sick down his back. He wasn't popular in the vicarage, although it must have been his army pay that eked out Grandfather's exiguous stipend.</p> <p>The grandparents weren't grateful. They both felt so cheated by life, they had their histories of grievance so well worked out, that they were owed service, handouts, anything that was going. My mother and her brother they'd used as hostages in their wars and otherwise neglected, being too absorbed in each other, in their way, to spare much feeling. With me it was different: since they no longer really fought they had time on their hands and I got the best of them. Did they love me? The question is beside the point, somehow. Certainly they each spoiled me, mainly by giving me the false impression that I was entitled to attention nearly all the time. They played. They were like children, if you consider that one of the things about being a child is that you are a parasite of sorts and have to brazen it out self-righteously. I want. They were good at wanting and I shared much more common ground with them than with my mother when I was three or four years old. Also, they measured up to the magical monsters in the story books. Grandma's idea of expressing affection to small children was to smack her lips and say, 'You're so sweet, I'm going to eat you all up!' It was not difficult to believe her, either, given her passion for sugar. Or at least I believed her enough to experience a pleasant thrill of fear. She liked to pinch, too, and she sometimes spat with hatred when she ran out of words.</p> <p>Domestic life in the vicarage had a Gothic flavour at odds with the house, which was a modest eighteenth-century building of mellowed brick, with low ceilings, and attics and back stairs for help we didn't have. At the front it looked on to a small square traversed only by visitors and churchgoers. The barred kitchen window faced this way, but in no friendly fashion, and the parlour on the other side of the front door was empty and unused, so that the house was turned in on itself, against its nature. A knock at the door produced a flurry of hiding-and-tidying (my grandmother must be given time to retreat, if she was up, and I'd have my face scrubbed with a washcloth) in case the visitor was someone who'd have to be invited in and shown to the sitting-room at the back which - although a bit damp and neglected - was always 'kept nice in case'.</p> <p>If the caller was on strictly Church business, he'd be shown upstairs to Grandfather's study, lined with bookcases in which the books all had the authors' names and titles on their spines blacked out as a precaution against would-be borrowers who'd suddenly take a fancy to Dickens or Marie Corelli. His bedroom led off his study and was dark, under the yew tree's shadow, and smelled like him. Across the landing was my mother's room, where I slept too when I was small, and round a turn to the right my grandmother's, with coal and sticks piled under the bed, redolent of Pond's face cream, powder, scent, smelling salts and her town clothes in mothballs, along with a litter of underwear and stockings.</p> <p>On this floor, too, was a stately lavatory, wallpapered in a perching peacock design, all intertwined feathers and branches you could contemplate for hours - which I did, legs dangling from the high wooden seat. When the chain was pulled the water tanks on the attic floor gurgled and sang. In the other attics there were apples laid out on newspaper on the floors, gently mummifying. It just wasn't a spooky house, despite the suggestive cellars, and the fact that we relied on lamps and candles. All of Hanmer did that, in any case, except for farmers who had their own generators. In the kitchen the teapot sat on the hob all day and everyone ate at different times.</p> <p>There was a word that belonged to the house: 'dilapidations'. It was one of the first long words I knew, for it was repeated like a mantra. The Church charged incumbents a kind of levy for propping up its crumbling real estate and those five syllables were the key. If only Grandfather could cut down on the dilapidations there'd be a new dawn of amenity and comfort, and possibly some change left over. Leaks, dry rot, broken panes and crazy hinges (of which we had plenty) were, looked at rightly, a potential source of income. Whether he ever succeeded I don't know. Since the word went on and on, he can't have got more than a small rebate and no one ever plugged the leaks. What's certain is that we were frequently penniless and there were always embarrassments about credit. Food rationing and clothes coupons must have been a godsend since they provided a cover for our indigence. As long as austerity lasted, the vicarage could maintain its shaky claims to gentility. There was virtue in shabbiness. Grandfather had his rusty cassock, Grandmother her mothballed wardrobe and my mother had one or two pre-war outfits that just about served. Underwear was yellowed and full of holes, minus elastic. Indoors, our top layers were ragged too: matted jumpers, socks and stockings laddered and in wrinkles round the ankles, safety pins galore. Outside we could pass muster, even if my overcoat was at first too big (I would grow into it), then all at once too small, without ever for a moment being the right size.</p> <p>In those years almost the whole country wore this ill-fitting uniform designed for non-combatants - serviceable colours, grating textures, tell-tale unfaded hems that had been let down, bulky tucks. Our true household craziness and indifference didn't express itself in clothes, but in more intimate kinds of squalor: for instance, nearly never washing the bits no one could see. This was almost a point of vicarage principle, a measure of our hostility to the world outside and separateness from it. Inside our clothes civilisation had lapsed. And this wasn't to do with money.</p> <p>Grandma had the scented soap, but she didn't use it - she bought it for its smell, and kept it wrapped in tissue paper in drawers and trunks. Her line was that her skin was too sensitive for soap and water. We even had a bathroom, but somehow the only way to wash was to boil the kettle and fill a bowl, and do bits - very little bits and usually the same bits - at a time. The resulting tidemarks, in my case round my neck, wrists and legs, would be desperately scrubbed at from time to time. Hair was another problem, a tangle of troubles: brushing was usually felt to be enough of a trauma, without the business of tangling it up all over again with washing, so that my pigtails stayed plaited for days on end. Our secret grubbiness was yet another thing that set us apart. If other children were dirty, that meant they were common, their parents were foully neglectful and slummy, you could catch things from them. One of Grandma's favourite terms of abuse, in fact, was 'dirty' - villagers were dirty, callers were dirty, I mustn't play with dirty children. So there were two different kinds of dirt, theirs and ours. It was a most metaphysical distinction, as befitted the vicarage.</p> <p>As if to demonstrate the point, next door to us, also fronting on to the square, was a sixteenth-century tumbledown timber and brick cottage crammed with children I wasn't supposed to mix with - the Duckets, one of Hanmer's most shameless tribes. The wall that divided us from them provided me with a perch from which I could look down into their back garden. Our side had a lawn with borders and apple trees, and was neglected and overgrown and peaceful. Theirs was like a bomb-site, a muddy, cratered expanse with twisted pieces of old prams and bike frames, and shards of crockery embedded among straggly weeds and currant bushes. The Duckets epitomised what my grandmother meant by 'dirty': they were openly poor (the father was a farm labourer), they bred like rabbits and they spilled out of their house wearing their ragged hand-me-downs for all to see.</p> <p>The vicarage was a secret slum, but the Duckets' doors were always open, so you could see Mrs Ducket with her hair in curlers running about bare-legged in slippers, or - even more scandalously - sitting down with a cup of tea and a fag. They had no secrets. Their kitchen drain (on the opposite side to us) disgorged a slow stream of soapy slime and tea-leaves into the open gutter that ran along the main village street. The Duckets kept yappy dogs and skinny cats, and had kittens and ferrets in their pockets; they didn't go to church, although sometimes one or two of the children would be spruced up and sent to Sunday School. While I was forbidden the square, they were positively driven out of their house, back and front, in all weathers, clutching wedges of bread and damson jam. They reached over our wall and picked the apples, according to Grandma. And (the crowning horror) they had bugs in their hair.</p> <p>The Duckets made me feel lonely. Even the bugs were more fascinating than frightening. Once or twice I managed to 'play' with Edna, the girl nearest to my own age, through the crack in our side gate. She squatted in the square, I squatted in the vicarage kitchen yard; I squeezed my dolls through the gap one by one for her to look at and she squeezed them back. But otherwise I'd climb the wall and sit astride, watching Duckets in the plural, whenever I was left to my own devices. Which wasn't often. Grandpa and I must have pottered about in church almost every day, and the echoing spaces, the stained glass and the smell of Brasso, chrysanthemums, damp pew-oak and iron mould from the choir's surplices were heady compensations for isolation. He'd tell me stories and read me to sleep at night, when he'd often drop off first, stretched out on the couch, mouth open, snoring, his beaky profile lit up by the candle. In fact, he got so impatient with my favourite books (which both he and I knew by heart) that one momentous day, before I was four, he taught me to read in self-defence. This confirmed me as his creature.</p> <p>I knew my name came out of one of the blacked-out books - Lorna from Lorna Doone - and that he'd chosen it. Now he'd given me a special key to his world. We were even closer allies afterwards, so that when he took me with him in the rattling Singer to Whitchurch, and into the bar of the Fox and Goose down Green End, it never occurred to me to tell on him. There were several expeditions like that. He was well known in drinking circles and was looked on as something of a speciality act, a cynical and colourful talker, always with his dog-collar to set him apart. I was the perfect alibi, since neither my mother nor my grandmother had any idea that there were pubs so low and lawless that they would turn a blind eye to children. Few were willing to, however; and there were other times when I found myself sitting outside on the steps of one of his favourite haunts, an unfriendly place with a revolving door called the Lord Hill, in the company of streetwise kids a lot more scary than the Duckets. Perhaps I did tell about that, or perhaps someone spotted me: at any rate, the pub outings came to an end.</p> <p>Not the collusion, though. I'd kneel on the threadbare rug in his study while he worked on his sermon, or talked to the odd visitor, pulling out the books and puzzling over big words. Sometimes he'd show off my reading to strangers, but for the most part I was meant (this was the point of it, after all) to be quiet. When he was in very good moods he would draw pictures for me, starting mysteriously from the vanishing point and drawing out the rest into perspective. I learned that trick too, never very well, but well enough to disconcert people. Our mutual 'minding' turned by untidy stages into a sort of education. Since he was a man of many wasted talents, not only with words and images but also music, I might have had a full set of pre-school 'accomplishments', except that I was tone-deaf. Despite that, I was made a member of the choir as soon as I could sit still long enough - under strict instructions to open and shut my mouth in silence, along with the words. I was quite useful, in fact: I could be shifted across from the girls' bench to the boys' (my pigtails bundled up into my cap) depending on where there were the most gaps. Watching Grandpa dress up in the vestry, processing behind him, listening to him intone the liturgy and preach, I basked in his reflected glory.</p> <p>I took to lining up my toys in a corner of the garden I called 'the secondary school', where I lectured them and told them stories. More than once they got left out overnight and were brought in sodden in the morning, to be dried out in the oven of the kitchen range. My teddy, a utility bear with a flabby square stomach made out of flowered cotton, was scorched ever after. An omen there.</p> <p>I was going to have to go to school soon and that meant the village school, which would make nonsense of the dirt distinction, and - as it turned out - leave scorch-marks on my spoiled soul too. There was some reluctance to send me there sooner than need be, but the temptation must have become irresistible. When Grandpa was out, or hung-over, or not in the mood, I would wander the house in an ecstasy of self-pity, wailing 'What can I do-o-o?' over and over again, tears dripping down. This was my own precocious contribution to the economy of frustration and want, and nobody could stand it. If the day was fine, Grandma might take me out into the garden, where we'd exorcise my misery by attacking the brambles and nettles with sharp scissors, pretending they were Grandpa, or Duckets, or other people on her hit list ('Ugh! Nasty old thing! Wicked old devil!'). She got even more fun out of this than I did, but she often didn't feel energetic enough for such games. So at four and a bit I went to school, and the whole village gave a shake and rearranged itself. I got bugs in my hair and started to lead a double life: one of the many - Hanmer school had a hundred-odd pupils, aged four to fourteen, in 1947 - and yet the sole vicarage child. I put about the story that you could play in the churchyard if you played with me.</p>",

He often found things to do in the vestry, excuses for getting out of the vicarage (kicking the swollen door, cursing) and so long as he took me he couldn't get up to much. I was a sort of hobble; he was my minder and I was his. He'd have liked to get further away, but petrol was rationed. The church was at least safe. My grandmother never went near it - except feet first in her coffin, but that was years later, when she was buried in the same grave with him. Rotting together for eternity, one flesh at the last after a lifetime's mutual loathing. In life, though, she never invaded his patch; once inside the churchyard gate he was on his own ground, in his element. He was good at funerals, being gaunt and lined, marked with mortality. He had a scar down his hollow cheek too, which Grandma had done with the carving knife one of the many times when he came home pissed and incapable. That, though, was when they were still 'speaking', before my time. Now they mostly monologued and swore at each other's backs, and he (and I) would slam out of the house and go off between the graves, past the yew tree with a hollow where the cat had her litters and the various vaults that were supposed to account for the smell in the vicarage cellars in wet weather. On our right was the church; off to our left the graves stretched away, bisected by a grander gravel path leading down from the church porch to a bit of green with a war memorial, then - across the road - the mere. The church was popular for weddings because of this impressive approach, but he wasn't at all keen on the marriage ceremony, naturally enough. Burials he relished, perhaps because he saw himself as buried alive. One day we stopped to watch the gravedigger, who unearthed a skull - it was an old churchyard, on its second or third time around - and grandfather dusted off the soil and declaimed: 'Alas poor Yorick, I knew him well...' I thought he was making it up as he went along. When I grew up a bit and saw Hamlet and found him out, I wondered what had been going through his mind. I suppose the scene struck him as an image of his condition - exiled to a remote, illiterate rural parish, his talents wasted and so on. On the other hand his position afforded him a lot of opportunities for indulging secret, bitter jokes, hamming up the act and cherishing his ironies, so in a way he was enjoying himself. Back then, I thought that was what a vicar was, simply: someone bony and eloquent and smelly (tobacco, candle grease, sour claret), who talked into space. His disappointments were just part of the act for me, along with his dog-collar and cassock. I was like a baby goose imprinted by the first mother-figure it sees - he was my black marker. It was certainly easy to spot him at a distance too. But this was a village where it seemed everybody was their vocation. They didn't just 'know their place', it was as though the place occupied them, so that they all knew what they were going to be from the beginning. People's names conspired to colour in this picture. The gravedigger was actually called Mr Downward. The blacksmith who lived by the mere was called Bywater. Even more decisively, the family who owned the village were called Hanmer, and so was the village. The Hanmers had come over with the Conqueror, got as far as the Welsh border and stayed ever since in this little rounded isthmus of North Wales sticking out into England, the detached portion of Flintshire (Flintshire Maelor) as it was called then, surrounded by Shropshire, Cheshire and - on the Welsh side - Denbighshire. There was no town in the Maelor district, only villages and hamlets; Flintshire proper was some way off; and (then) industrial, which made it in practice a world away from these pastoral parishes, which had become resigned to being handed a Labour MP at every election. People in Hanmer well understood, in almost a prideful way, that we weren't part of all that. The kind of choice represented by voting didn't figure large on the local map and you only really counted places you could get to on foot or by bike. The war had changed this to some extent, but not as much as it might have because farming was a reserved occupation and sons hadn't been called up unless there were a lot of them, or their families were smallholders with little land. So Hanmer in the 1940s in many ways resembled Hanmer in the 1920s, or even the late 1800s except that it was more depressed, less populous and more out of step - more and more islanded in time as the years had gone by. We didn't speak Welsh either, so that there was little national feeling, rather a sense of stubbornly being 'where you were' and that was that. Also very un-Welsh was the fact that Hanmer had no chapel to rival Grandfather's church: the Hanmers would never lease land to Nonconformists and there was no tradition of Dissent, except in the form of not going to church at all. Many people did attend, though, partly because he was locally famous for his sermons, and because he was High Church and went in for dressing up and altar boys and frequent communions. Not frequent enough to explain the amount of wine he got through, however.

It was one of the first long words I knew, for it was repeated like a mantra. The Church charged incumbents a kind of levy for propping up its crumbling real estate and those five syllables were the key. If only Grandfather could cut down on the dilapidations there'd be a new dawn of amenity and comfort, and possibly some change left over. Leaks, dry rot, broken panes and crazy hinges (of which we had plenty) were, looked at rightly, a potential source of income. Whether he ever succeeded I don't know. Since the word went on and on, he can't have got more than a small rebate and no one ever plugged the leaks. What's certain is that we were frequently penniless and there were always embarrassments about credit. Food rationing and clothes coupons must have been a godsend since they provided a cover for our indigence. As long as austerity lasted, the vicarage could maintain its shaky claims to gentility. There was virtue in shabbiness. Grandfather had his rusty cassock, Grandmother her mothballed wardrobe and my mother had one or two pre-war outfits that just about served. Underwear was yellowed and full of holes, minus elastic. Indoors, our top layers were ragged too: matted jumpers, socks and stockings laddered and in wrinkles round the ankles, safety pins galore. Outside we could pass muster, even if my overcoat was at first too big (I would grow into it), then all at once too small, without ever for a moment being the right size. In those years almost the whole country wore this ill-fitting uniform designed for non-combatants - serviceable colours, grating textures, tell-tale unfaded hems that had been let down, bulky tucks. Our true household craziness and indifference didn't express itself in clothes, but in more intimate kinds of squalor: for instance, nearly never washing the bits no one could see. This was almost a point of vicarage principle, a measure of our hostility to the world outside and separateness from it. Inside our clothes civilisation had lapsed. And this wasn't to do with money. Grandma had the scented soap, but she didn't use it - she bought it for its smell, and kept it wrapped in tissue paper in drawers and trunks. Her line was that her skin was too sensitive for soap and water. We even had a bathroom, but somehow the only way to wash was to boil the kettle and fill a bowl, and do bits - very little bits and usually the same bits - at a time. The resulting tidemarks, in my case round my neck, wrists and legs, would be desperately scrubbed at from time to time. Hair was another problem, a tangle of troubles: brushing was usually felt to be enough of a trauma, without the business of tangling it up all over again with washing, so that my pigtails stayed plaited for days on end. Our secret grubbiness was yet another thing that set us apart. If other children were dirty, that meant they were common, their parents were foully neglectful and slummy, you could catch things from them. One of Grandma's favourite terms of abuse, in fact, was 'dirty' - villagers were dirty, callers were dirty, I mustn't play with dirty children. So there were two different kinds of dirt, theirs and ours. It was a most metaphysical distinction, as befitted the vicarage. As if to demonstrate the point, next door to us, also fronting on to the square, was a sixteenth-century tumbledown timber and brick cottage crammed with children I wasn't supposed to mix with - the Duckets, one of Hanmer's most shameless tribes. The wall that divided us from them provided me with a perch from which I could look down into their back garden. Our side had a lawn with borders and apple trees, and was neglected and overgrown and peaceful. Theirs was like a bomb-site, a muddy, cratered expanse with twisted pieces of old prams and bike frames, and shards of crockery embedded among straggly weeds and currant bushes. The Duckets epitomised what my grandmother meant by 'dirty': they were openly poor (the father was a farm labourer), they bred like rabbits and they spilled out of their house wearing their ragged hand-me-downs for all to see. The vicarage was a secret slum, but the Duckets' doors were always open, so you could see Mrs Ducket with her hair in curlers running about bare-legged in slippers, or - even more scandalously - sitting down with a cup of tea and a fag. They had no secrets. Their kitchen drain (on the opposite side to us) disgorged a slow stream of soapy slime and tea-leaves into the open gutter that ran along the main village street. The Duckets kept yappy dogs and skinny cats, and had kittens and ferrets in their pockets; they didn't go to church, although sometimes one or two of the children would be spruced up and sent to Sunday School. While I was forbidden the square, they were positively driven out of their house, back and front, in all weathers, clutching wedges of bread and damson jam. They reached over our wall and picked the apples, according to Grandma. And (the crowning horror) they had bugs in their hair. The Duckets made me feel lonely. Even the bugs were more fascinating than frightening. Once or twice I managed to 'play' with Edna, the girl nearest to my own age, through the crack in our side gate. She squatted in the square, I squatted in the vicarage kitchen yard; I squeezed my dolls through the gap one by one for her to look at and she squeezed them back. But otherwise I'd climb the wall and sit astride, watching Duckets in the plural, whenever I was left to my own devices. Which wasn't often. Grandpa and I must have pottered about in church almost every day, and the echoing spaces, the stained glass and the smell of Brasso, chrysanthemums, damp pew-oak and iron mould from the choir's surplices were heady compensations for isolation. He'd tell me stories and read me to sleep at night, when he'd often drop off first, stretched out on the couch, mouth open, snoring, his beaky profile lit up by the candle. In fact, he got so impatient with my favourite books (which both he and I knew by heart) that one momentous day, before I was four, he taught me to read in self-defence. This confirmed me as his creature. I knew my name came out of one of the blacked-out books - Lorna from Lorna Doone - and that he'd chosen it. Now he'd given me a special key to his world. We were even closer allies afterwards, so that when he took me with him in the rattling Singer to Whitchurch, and into the bar of the Fox and Goose down Green End, it never occurred to me to tell on him. There were several expeditions like that. He was well known in drinking circles and was looked on as something of a speciality act, a cynical and colourful talker, always with his dog-collar to set him apart. I was the perfect alibi, since neither my mother nor my grandmother had any idea that there were pubs so low and lawless that they would turn a blind eye to children. Few were willing to, however; and there were other times when I found myself sitting outside on the steps of one of his favourite haunts, an unfriendly place with a revolving door called the Lord Hill, in the company of streetwise kids a lot more scary than the Duckets. Perhaps I did tell about that, or perhaps someone spotted me: at any rate, the pub outings came to an end. Not the collusion, though. I'd kneel on the threadbare rug in his study while he worked on his sermon, or talked to the odd visitor, pulling out the books and puzzling over big words. Sometimes he'd show off my reading to strangers, but for the most part I was meant (this was the point of it, after all) to be quiet. When he was in very good moods he would draw pictures for me, starting mysteriously from the vanishing point and drawing out the rest into perspective. I learned that trick too, never very well, but well enough to disconcert people. Our mutual 'minding' turned by untidy stages into a sort of education. Since he was a man of many wasted talents, not only with words and images but also music, I might have had a full set of pre-school 'accomplishments', except that I was tone-deaf. Despite that, I was made a member of the choir as soon as I could sit still long enough - under strict instructions to open and shut my mouth in silence, along with the words. I was quite useful, in fact: I could be shifted across from the girls' bench to the boys' (my pigtails bundled up into my cap) depending on where there were the most gaps. Watching Grandpa dress up in the vestry, processing behind him, listening to him intone the liturgy and preach, I basked in his reflected glory. I took to lining up my toys in a corner of the garden I called 'the secondary school', where I lectured them and told them stories. More than once they got left out overnight and were brought in sodden in the morning, to be dried out in the oven of the kitchen range. My teddy, a utility bear with a flabby square stomach made out of flowered cotton, was scorched ever after. An omen there. I was going to have to go to school soon and that meant the village school, which would make nonsense of the dirt distinction, and - as it turned out - leave scorch-marks on my spoiled soul too. There was some reluctance to send me there sooner than need be, but the temptation must have become irresistible. When Grandpa was out, or hung-over, or not in the mood, I would wander the house in an ecstasy of self-pity, wailing 'What can I do-o-o?' over and over again, tears dripping down. This was my own precocious contribution to the economy of frustration and want, and nobody could stand it. If the day was fine, Grandma might take me out into the garden, where we'd exorcise my misery by attacking the brambles and nettles with sharp scissors, pretending they were Grandpa, or Duckets, or other people on her hit list ('Ugh! Nasty old thing! Wicked old devil!'). She got even more fun out of this than I did, but she often didn't feel energetic enough for such games. So at four and a bit I went to school, and the whole village gave a shake and rearranged itself. I got bugs in my hair and started to lead a double life: one of the many - Hanmer school had a hundred-odd pupils, aged four to fourteen, in 1947 - and yet the sole vicarage child. I put about the story that you could play in the churchyard if you played with me.",

      "body": "<p>The largest study of the controversial MMR vaccination ever undertaken has ruled out any link to other conditions in children, it was reported today. </p> <p>The research, revealed on the same day a study highlighted widespread concerns with MMR among British health professionals, will be welcomed by campaigners concerned about falling immunisation levels in the UK and the risk of a measles outbreak. </p> <p>Finnish researchers followed up three million doses of the vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella and found no link to cases of autism and serious bowel disorders. </p> <p>Previous studies have suggested a possible link between MMR and these conditions although supporters claim the vast majority of research has given MMR a clean bill of health. </p> <p>With MMR, children are a given a combined jab against measles, mumps and rubella at 12 to 15 months and a second booster dose at between three and five years old. </p> <p>Because of the concerns, opponents of MMR, including Tory MP Julie Kirkbride, want children to be immunised separately against the three diseases. </p> <p>Around 2,000 families in Britain have taken legal action claiming their children have been damaged by the MMR jab, with many believing it has triggered autism. </p> <p>The Finnish research will bolster claims by health officials in the UK that the single doses are unnecessary and costly. </p> <p>However, another study, published today in the British Medical Journal, suggests that many health professionals in the UK are yet to be totally convinced that MMR is entirely risk free. </p> <p>The survey found that nearly half of family doctors, health visitors and practice nurses have reservations about giving children their second dose of the MMR vaccination. </p> <p>Almost one in five GPs had not read official advice about the combined jab and 46% said they wanted more information and training. Up to a third of nurses believe the triple vaccine is linked to serious adverse side effects such as Crohn's disease and autism. </p> <p>The study was published a week after government experts warned that the UK was at risk of a potentially fatal outbreak of measles because immunisation levels had dropped dramatically. </p> <p>Public fears that the vaccine could be linked to autism and Crohn's disease have led to thousands of parents refusing to have their children vaccinated. </p> <p>Immunisation levels in some parts of the country have fallen to as low as 75%, way below the World Health Organisation threshold of 95% needed to guarantee so-called \"herd immunity\" for the whole population. </p> <p>Doctors' own concerns about the jab may be exacerbating the worrying fall in immunisation levels, the study authors said.

      "bodyText": "The largest study of the controversial MMR vaccination ever undertaken has ruled out any link to other conditions in children, it was reported today. The research, revealed on the same day a study highlighted widespread concerns with MMR among British health professionals, will be welcomed by campaigners concerned about falling immunisation levels in the UK and the risk of a measles outbreak. Finnish researchers followed up three million doses of the vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella and found no link to cases of autism and serious bowel disorders. Previous studies have suggested a possible link between MMR and these conditions although supporters claim the vast majority of research has given MMR a clean bill of health. With MMR, children are a given a combined jab against measles, mumps and rubella at 12 to 15 months and a second booster dose at between three and five years old. Because of the concerns, opponents of MMR, including Tory MP Julie Kirkbride, want children to be immunised separately against the three diseases. Around 2,000 families in Britain have taken legal action claiming their children have been damaged by the MMR jab, with many believing it has triggered autism. The Finnish research will bolster claims by health officials in the UK that the single doses are unnecessary and costly. However, another study, published today in the British Medical Journal, suggests that many health professionals in the UK are yet to be totally convinced that MMR is entirely risk free. The survey found that nearly half of family doctors, health visitors and practice nurses have reservations about giving children their second dose of the MMR vaccination. Almost one in five GPs had not read official advice about the combined jab and 46% said they wanted more information and training. Up to a third of nurses believe the triple vaccine is linked to serious adverse side effects such as Crohn's disease and autism. The study was published a week after government experts warned that the UK was at risk of a potentially fatal outbreak of measles because immunisation levels had dropped dramatically. Public fears that the vaccine could be linked to autism and Crohn's disease have led to thousands of parents refusing to have their children vaccinated. Immunisation levels in some parts of the country have fallen to as low as 75%, way below the World Health Organisation threshold of 95% needed to guarantee so-called \"herd immunity\" for the whole population. Doctors' own concerns about the jab may be exacerbating the worrying fall in immunisation levels, the study authors said. One doctor said: \"I personally will not let my children have their second MMR but I don't influence parents in any way. \"I would be frightened to urge parents to have the second MMR in case there were problems afterwards. I would not want anyone to blame me for persuading them.\" A Department of Health spokesman said that in the study, which he said was carried out more than two years ago, GPs were not questioning the giving of the MMR vaccine. The study highlighted that some health professionals lacked awareness of up-to-date information on the rationale for the second dose of MMR, he said. \"It is important for health professionals to keep up to date with all of the available scientific literature and this study shows that those health professionals who were more informed were more confident about the vaccine.\" The spokesman added: \"Repeated studies have given MMR a clean bill of health - it is the safest way of protecting children against these potentially life-threatening diseases.\" The head of vaccination at the Department of Health, Dr David Salisbury, said that if vaccinations were administered separately, instead of the combined MMR jab, it would increase the risks to children. \"They will get measles, some of them will die,\" he said. \"They will get rubella and they will infect their pregnant mothers and they will infect their mothers' pregnant friends and they will have children who will be severely damaged by rubella. \"This is bad advice. It is dangerous to separate the vaccines.\" He said that in Japan, where the vaccinations were administered separately, there had been 79 deaths from measles between 1992 and 1997. \"They export measles like they export cars,\" he said. However, shadow health secretary Liam Fox said that, while he accepted the MMR vaccination was safe, the vaccinations should be available separately until public confidence was restored in MMR. \"There is no point in sitting on the high moral ground watching an epidemic taking place. \"It has been a failure of government public health policy neither to reassure the public about the safety of MMR successfully nor to provide an alternative. \"We have to get immunisation rates up one way or another because children are being put at risk.\" Marilyn Smith, a member of the anti-vaccination group, Jabs, said: \"When you've got a child it's the most precious thing in the world and no amount of figures can change the concerns we have about MMR.\"",

Mr Hytner, a former marketing boss at Sega and Sky TV and currently marketing director at Channel 5, has written to Greg Dyke removing himself from the race on the eve of his interview with the BBC director-general. Apparently Channel 5 chief executive Dawn Airey has pulled a two-month spell at Wharton Business School in Philadelphia out of the bag to persuade Mr Hytner to stay. The lure of a stint at an American business school was a tactic once used to persuade Ms Airey to stay at the station. Mr Hytner has apparently told friends he wants to move into general management within the next two years so has decided not to pursue other marketing opportunities. His decision means that the smart money at the BBC is now on Jane Frost, the corporation's sales and marketing director for BBC technology. She has been the favourite from the start even though the BBC hired headhunters to find candidates. Ms Frost was the woman behind the BBC's highly acclaimed Perfect Day video featuring a galaxy of rock stars including Tom Jones, Elton John, Tammy Wynette and Heather Small. As there were only two on the very short shortlist for the job, it seems the job will be Ms Frost's. Either that or the headhunters will have to start all over again.",

He said he was responsibly for only about a third of Anna's injuries and he admitted hitting her over the head with a bicycle chain. </p> <p>Widowed Kouao, a French citizen, who had three grown up sons in Paris, denied murder, manslaughter and cruelty to Anna at the tiny studio flat the couple shared in Tottenham. </p> <p>She initially told police the child's condition was caused by witchcraft. In court, she denied all knowledge of cruelty. </p> <p>The trial, which began on November 20 last year, was frequently interrupted by Kouao's outbursts. </p> <p>The court was told that Anna was left tied up in the bath sometimes for more than 24-hours. One woman claimed Kouao told her she left Anna there for \"two or three days\". </p> <p>And in a chilling confession read in court, Manning told police: \"You could beat her and she would not cry at all. She could take the beatings and pain like anything.\" </p> <p>Anna's death resulted in two inquires by police, health officials and social services. </p> <p>Incredibly, the little girl died even though police child protection officers and social service workers from three London boroughs were involved in her case, and she was admitted to two hospitals. </p> <p>A Child Protection Team investigation of Anna's case, which allowed her to be returned to Kouao and Manning, was criticised in court as \"blindingly incompetent\". </p> <p>Miss Linda Stern QC, prosecuting, told the jury: \"You may think they did not do their jobs properly because if they had, she would not have been returned, and her death may have been prevented.\" </p> <p>The results of internal inquiries to be held as a result of Anna's death will be sent to the Department of Health to see what lessons can be learned. </p> <p>Haringey social worker Lisa Arthurworrey has been suspended and child protection officer Pc Karen Jones is one of eight police officers who are subject to the second inquiry by the Police Complaints Authority. </p> <p>The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children today called for a complete overhaul of child protection procedures to develop a new national strategy. </p> <p>Director Mary Marsh said: \"Anna suffered a living hell of misery and terror at the hands of her carers.\" </p> <p>She said one or two children died each week at the hands of parents or carers - and the figure had not fallen over the past 25 years. </p> <p>Detectives are still trying to trace two other children who may have been handed to Kouao so that she could bring them to Europe from the Ivory Coast. </p> <p>Court records show an adoption hearing involving a boy named Aime, who was 15, took place in the Ivory Coast in 1996. </p> <p>In Paris, a girl named Christelle was subject of guardianship proceedings in 1993. </p> <p>Detective Inspector Keith Niven said: \"We are still actively inquiring into the whereabouts of these children. We will keep going until we find the answers.\" </p> <p>A third child, Claudine, said to be Kouao's adoptive daughter, is now 17 and is still living in France. </p> <p>Kouao and Manning face having to serve their sentences in isolation. Kouao told the court that she was attacked and abused in Holloway Prison after details of Anna's horrific death were made public. Anna's parents, Berthe Ehouri, 40, and Francis Climbi\u00e9, left their six other children in their shanty town home in the Ivory Coast to attend court. Mrs Ehouri also testified during the trial. </p> <p>But the couple were prevented from returning for the verdict - they returned to the Ivory Coast for the Christmas recess - and collecting Anna's body because of civil unrest in their country. </p> <p>Mrs Ehouri said she had trusted Kouao with her child - but that by the time she received a card saying her daughter was well, Anna was already dead. </p> <p>Det Insp Niven said: \"The family has been emotionally destroyed by what happened to Anna. It beggars belief. One cannot imagine why anyone would inflict such injuries on a child.\"</p> <p>Judge Hawkins said today: \"Plainly, lessons must be learnt about the failure of social services and the police inquiry following Anna's release from the North Middlesex Hospital in august 1999. </p> <p>\"It is not for me to go into detail. I would like to be kept informed as to the result of any inquiry.\" </p> <p>Manning and Kouao showed no emotion as the sentence was passed.Extra security staff stood in the dock, but the couple left quietly - Kouao clutching a bible. </p> <p>Judge Hawkins had told them: \"This very serious case of murder concerns a lovely child, Anna. </p> <p>\"She left the Ivory Coast a lovely child full of hope and love.\" </p> <p>But by the time Anna reached Britain in the Spring of 1999 with Kouao, she had become doubly incontinent due to the \"emotional abuse\" she subjected her to. </p> <p>After joining Manning, Anna had become an inconvenience to them and was repeatedly beaten with an array of weapons. </p> <p>\"By her death, she was covered from head to toe in injuries,\" the judge said.</p>",

Director Mary Marsh said: \"Anna suffered a living hell of misery and terror at the hands of her carers.\" She said one or two children died each week at the hands of parents or carers - and the figure had not fallen over the past 25 years. Detectives are still trying to trace two other children who may have been handed to Kouao so that she could bring them to Europe from the Ivory Coast. Court records show an adoption hearing involving a boy named Aime, who was 15, took place in the Ivory Coast in 1996. In Paris, a girl named Christelle was subject of guardianship proceedings in 1993. Detective Inspector Keith Niven said: \"We are still actively inquiring into the whereabouts of these children. We will keep going until we find the answers.\" A third child, Claudine, said to be Kouao's adoptive daughter, is now 17 and is still living in France. Kouao and Manning face having to serve their sentences in isolation. Kouao told the court that she was attacked and abused in Holloway Prison after details of Anna's horrific death were made public. Anna's parents, Berthe Ehouri, 40, and Francis Climbi\u00e9, left their six other children in their shanty town home in the Ivory Coast to attend court. Mrs Ehouri also testified during the trial. But the couple were prevented from returning for the verdict - they returned to the Ivory Coast for the Christmas recess - and collecting Anna's body because of civil unrest in their country. Mrs Ehouri said she had trusted Kouao with her child - but that by the time she received a card saying her daughter was well, Anna was already dead. Det Insp Niven said: \"The family has been emotionally destroyed by what happened to Anna. It beggars belief. One cannot imagine why anyone would inflict such injuries on a child.\" Judge Hawkins said today: \"Plainly, lessons must be learnt about the failure of social services and the police inquiry following Anna's release from the North Middlesex Hospital in august 1999. \"It is not for me to go into detail. I would like to be kept informed as to the result of any inquiry.\" Manning and Kouao showed no emotion as the sentence was passed.Extra security staff stood in the dock, but the couple left quietly - Kouao clutching a bible. Judge Hawkins had told them: \"This very serious case of murder concerns a lovely child, Anna. \"She left the Ivory Coast a lovely child full of hope and love.\" But by the time Anna reached Britain in the Spring of 1999 with Kouao, she had become doubly incontinent due to the \"emotional abuse\" she subjected her to. After joining Manning, Anna had become an inconvenience to them and was repeatedly beaten with an array of weapons. \"By her death, she was covered from head to toe in injuries,\" the judge said.",

DoubleClick said that revenues from its media division, which sells advertising over the net, would fall by up to 30% in 2001 due to the absence of search engine AltaVista as a client and a slump in the US economy. The statement was issued alongside fourth quarter earnings figures, which showed a profit of \u00a3144,000 against a loss of \u00a31.19m for the same period last year. Kevin Ryan, chief executive of the globe-spanning group, said that DoubleClick's \u00a3585m cash pile and innovative Dart advertising monitoring technology would see it through the rocky patch ahead. \"I am very proud of how well our organisation executed in a tough industry environment,\" he said. \"Our strong balance sheet and relentless focus on productivity position us very well going into 2001.\" DoubleClick remains bullish about its long-term prospects, confident that the internet's share of the advertising market can only improve and its technology business will continue to boost income. Stephen Collins, chief financial officer of DoubleClick, said: \"Today, by some estimates, 2% of media spending goes to the internet while 9% of people's media time is spent on the internet. \"We believe these figures will inevitably converge, as they have in virtually every other type of media over time. \"At the end of the day, this is the most fundamental argument as to why internet advertising will be a fast growing, large segment of worldwide media spend for years to come.\" However, the company's announcement is the latest in a series of blows to rain down on the advertising sector over the last few days. US internet giant Yahoo! issued a profit warning on Wednesday after experiencing a slowdown in advertising growth, and yesterday it was revealed that spending by the UK's top 30 advertisers fell by \u00a364m last year. Advertising trends are a bellwether for the media sector, as they provide a significant slice of companies' income. Analysts will be keeping a very close eye US media giant Viacom, owner of MTV and CBS, which relies heavily on advertising for its income. Advertising has been hit by a downturn in the US economy and spending cutbacks at cash-strapped dotcom startups.

      "bodyText": "The largest study of the controversial MMR vaccination ever undertaken has ruled out any link to other conditions in children, it was reported today. The research, revealed on the same day a study highlighted widespread concerns with MMR among British health professionals, will be welcomed by campaigners concerned about falling immunisation levels in the UK and the risk of a measles outbreak. Finnish researchers followed up three million doses of the vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella and found no link to cases of autism and serious bowel disorders. Previous studies have suggested a possible link between MMR and these conditions although supporters claim the vast majority of research has given MMR a clean bill of health. With MMR, children are a given a combined jab against measles, mumps and rubella at 12 to 15 months and a second booster dose at between three and five years old. Because of the concerns, opponents of MMR, including Tory MP Julie Kirkbride, want children to be immunised separately against the three diseases. Around 2,000 families in Britain have taken legal action claiming their children have been damaged by the MMR jab, with many believing it has triggered autism. The Finnish research will bolster claims by health officials in the UK that the single doses are unnecessary and costly. However, another study, published today in the British Medical Journal, suggests that many health professionals in the UK are yet to be totally convinced that MMR is entirely risk free. The survey found that nearly half of family doctors, health visitors and practice nurses have reservations about giving children their second dose of the MMR vaccination. Almost one in five GPs had not read official advice about the combined jab and 46% said they wanted more information and training. Up to a third of nurses believe the triple vaccine is linked to serious adverse side effects such as Crohn's disease and autism. The study was published a week after government experts warned that the UK was at risk of a potentially fatal outbreak of measles because immunisation levels had dropped dramatically. Public fears that the vaccine could be linked to autism and Crohn's disease have led to thousands of parents refusing to have their children vaccinated. Immunisation levels in some parts of the country have fallen to as low as 75%, way below the World Health Organisation threshold of 95% needed to guarantee so-called \"herd immunity\" for the whole population. Doctors' own concerns about the jab may be exacerbating the worrying fall in immunisation levels, the study authors said. One doctor said: \"I personally will not let my children have their second MMR but I don't influence parents in any way. \"I would be frightened to urge parents to have the second MMR in case there were problems afterwards. I would not want anyone to blame me for persuading them.\" A Department of Health spokesman said that in the study, which he said was carried out more than two years ago, GPs were not questioning the giving of the MMR vaccine. The study highlighted that some health professionals lacked awareness of up-to-date information on the rationale for the second dose of MMR, he said. \"It is important for health professionals to keep up to date with all of the available scientific literature and this study shows that those health professionals who were more informed were more confident about the vaccine.\" The spokesman added: \"Repeated studies have given MMR a clean bill of health - it is the safest way of protecting children against these potentially life-threatening diseases.\" The head of vaccination at the Department of Health, Dr David Salisbury, said that if vaccinations were administered separately, instead of the combined MMR jab, it would increase the risks to children. \"They will get measles, some of them will die,\" he said. \"They will get rubella and they will infect their pregnant mothers and they will infect their mothers' pregnant friends and they will have children who will be severely damaged by rubella. \"This is bad advice.

We hesitated between appreciating her reliably on-the-fashion-button taste and retching at this display of designer overload (all, incidentally, were at her intimate do).

You looked like an over-stylised, spoilt little teenager with too many PRs clamouring for product placement on your overexposed body. Unable to decide which outfit to sport, you settled on the whole wardrobe. It suggests that your personality is insufficient and you need to divert others with this fashion bingeing. </p> <p>Foolish fashion bingeing, it turns out.

      "bodyText": "These have been bad, bad weeks. To see not one but two idols take up residence in fashion victim territory is enough to cause disillusionment in the stoutest of souls. First there was Madonna at her wedding where, our sources can reveal, she wore Stella McCartney for the ceremony, Gaultier for the dinner, Versace for the party. We hesitated between appreciating her reliably on-the-fashion-button taste and retching at this display of designer overload (all, incidentally, were at her intimate do). Monday settled our indecision when Britney Spears wore five outfits to the American Music Awards, demonstrating all too clearly that too many frocks spoil the celebrity. Britney, petal, you did not look imaginative, you did not demonstrate fashion nous. You looked like an over-stylised, spoilt little teenager with too many PRs clamouring for product placement on your overexposed body. Unable to decide which outfit to sport, you settled on the whole wardrobe. It suggests that your personality is insufficient and you need to divert others with this fashion bingeing. Foolish fashion bingeing, it turns out. This week, the misguided clothes horse topped the annual American list, Blackwell's Worst Dressed Women. Sarah Jessica Parker tried to make a joke of this celebrity costume changing craze at the MTV Movie Awards last summer, when she changed outfits 12 times. Unfortunately, she looked quite good in each of them, which seems to have encouraged fellow celebrities. Ladies, enough. At least have the fashion sense to choose a dress that is good enough to wear for an hour.",

It's all about finding and developing talent\". Natural Nylon has already produced the David Cronenburg film eXistenZ and Nora, in which McGregor played a young James Joyce. Asked if he would be appearing at the Young Vic where the plays will open, McGregor said, \"Possibly. No, I'm not telling you. Oh all right, very probably.\" Law, who has just finished shooting Steven Spielberg's new sci-fi film AI, was more forthcoming, saying he would love to appear on stage with McGregor. \"There is only so long you can go from film to film to film. Theatre is a more raw experience. I don't want to sound pretentious, but for an actor a live audience is creative inspiration.\" Two of the first three plays to be produced by Natural Nylon are classics - Dr Faustus and Christopher Hampton's translation of Chekhov's Three Sisters. The third will be an adaptation of John Fowles's novel The Collector.",

      "body": "<p>Starting a memoir, you open a door on to the past. The moment Bad Blood became real to me was when, in my mind's eye, I saw just which door, and who was leading the way: </p> <p>\"Grandfather's skirts would flap in the wind along the churchyard path and I would hang on.\" </p> <p>I am still pleased with the book's first words, though I had no idea what I was letting myself in for. My bitter, theatrical vicar-grandfather, stagnating in the remote rural parish of Hanmer in North Wales for his sins (women and drink, mostly), was my reference point, my black flag on the map of the past, my arrow pointing - \"You were here\", this is where you begin. </p> <p>\"He often found things to do in the vestry, excuses for getting out of the vicarage (kicking the swollen door, cursing) and so long as he took me he couldn't get up to much. I was a sort of hobble, he was my minder and I was his. He'd have liked to get further away, but petrol was rationed. The church was at least safe. My grandmother never went near it - except feet first in her coffin, but that was years later, when she was buried in the same grave with him. </p> <p>\"Rotting together for eternity, one flesh at the last after a lifetime's mutual loathing. In life, though, she never invaded his patch; once inside the churchyard gate he was on his own ground, in his element. He was good at funerals, being gaunt and lined and marked with mortality. He had a scar down his hollow cheek, too, which Grandma had done with the carving knife one of the many times when he came home pissed and incapable.\" </p> <p>He died when I was only nine, but that strengthened his hold on my imagination. He did not let me down as he had all the others, starting with my grandmother and my mother, their daughter. Instead he vanished into the dark with his mystique intact. </p> <p>When, in my teens, I quarrelled with my mother, she would say in despair and disgust, \"You're just like your grandfather,\" meaning that I was promiscuous, sex-obsessed, that the bad blood was coming out. My bookishness was part of that inheritance too, and though she and my father approved in theory of my love of reading, and my coming top in exams, we all knew that books had a sinister, Grandpa side to them. You could always tell which were his books because he had had the bright idea of inking out their titles and authors' names in case visitors to his study asked to borrow a Dickens or a Marie Corelli. </p> <p>My name, Lorna, came out of one of the blacked-out books, Lorna Doone, and he had chosen it when my father was away in the war. He also taught me to read when I was three, and that confirmed me as his creature. After he was dead I'd commune with him in the vicarage books that no one else read. My mother never opened them; she had given up on all that when she turned against him and chose Grandma's side. </p> <p>Writing about him, trying to bring him back to life, I succeeded in ways I hadn't expected. Family legend had it that my grandmother, who slept at the opposite end of the house and did not speak to him, had blackmailed him for years with the threat of showing his diaries to the bishop. Certainly she had a tidy sum in the post office, and it was true that he was always completely broke, but was that why? My mother was dead, but my father had no hesitation.</p> <p> Certainly it was true. But how did he know? Well, he had the diaries; my mother had kept them: two small volumes filled with cramped handwriting covering the years 1933 and 1934, when he had first arrived in Hanmer, and - as it turned out - fallen from grace almost immediately. </p> <p>Suddenly, instead of my own vivid but patchy childhood memories, I had his words before me, with ironical marginalia from Grandma: \"Here the fun begins\" and \"Love begins (fool!)\". I transcribed them with difficulty, and with growing fascination, all one summer, peering back to the very different summer of 1933, when he arrived in his new parish, and tried to recapture how it was: </p> <p>\"Everything is suddenly on the move, unfixed, the old landmarks of his depression left behind in the Rhondda - along with his wife and son and [my mother] Valma, too, for the moment ... All at once he's alone in this new place (\"a lovely spot\") where people don't know him from Adam. Mobility. Freedom of a kind. He must take up his duties immediately, now that the old Canon, long ailing, has finally admitted defeat and been persuaded to go. </p> <p>His two churches are three miles apart down shaggy, meandering country roads blistered with cowpats and hemmed in by weedy ditches. He acquires a bicycle, and finds himself walking it up gentle hills (no mountains here) and freewheeling down again the other side. The diary shows him threading his way along a necklace of new place names - Bangor-on-Dee, Wrexham, Ellesmere, Horseman's Green, Eglwys Cross, Bronington, Bettisfield, Whitchurch - marking out a map on which, more and more often, his path crosses that of the District Nurse, Nurse Burgess, who of course has a bicycle too. </p> <p>Just days before, ironically enough, he is all prepared to be lonely and bored. \"Hanmer is very quiet,\" he notes ominously, \"very ... Time hangs somewhat on my hands in this place.\" Then the new bike arrives. </p> <p>There is an August heatwave, the kids are swimming in the mere just as we would 20 years on (except that in 1933 it's only the boys) and on the very day he admits taking his first ride with the nurse (\"Here the fun begins\") they are both summoned to the mereside in their professional capacities, because one of the young men has drowned ... His body doesn't surface for three days and the whole of Hanmer keeps a vigil, people standing in hot huddles talking under their breath, gazing at the innocent flat water only dimpled with fish taking flies. </p> <p>He was a strong swimmer, too, so there's a niggling element of mystery about his death: cramp, or weed, or cold currents must have got him, and it's true - was still true 20 years later - that sometimes when the water near the edge was soupy warm you'd suddenly find your legs entwined with cold streams snaking in under the lily pads, just before the bottom shelved right away. </p> <p>Grandpa was swiftly out of his depth as well, but he was having a marvellous time and only noticed how far he'd gone when his family actually turned up. Out of his depth and in his element. He and Nurse Burgess, now MB for short in the diary, pedal to paradise every day of the week, including Sunday. Trailing a cloud of midges, they'd hump their bikes off the road, through some muddy gateway and, behind the hedge, hug and knead each other among the mallows and Queen Anne's lace and nettles dusty with pollen. </p> <p>Perhaps they spread his tobacco-scented black cassock on the ground to protect them from ants and the crawling wasps drunk on crab apples. Or more likely they'd keep their uniforms on and each get to know the other's body in hits. He is lean and wiry, MB in her starched blue linen is substantial but not yet stout, well muscled because of all the exercise she gets, her arms mottled pink and white from soap and sun. She has a midwife's hands. </p> <p>His fingers are inky and curve to caress an imaginary pipe bowl, or a preacher's palmful of air, and - now - the generous breast where her watch ticks away. It's nearly always afternoon, they are supposed to be out to tea, strawberry jam and fruitcake, and so they are, so they are ...\" </p> <p>A voyeur across the years, I conjured them up in as much fleshly and fruity detail as I could, thinking of the paintings of Arcimbaldo, in defiance of my puritanical mother. Well, yes, I am like him. </p> <p>But as I read on, the picture darkened: Grandma arrived and of course found out, and there were epic, all-night rows. Taking stock at the end of the year, he hands the whole messy intrigue over to God: \"So ends a most memorable year for me. I have had the move I wished for to a lovely country church ... I have met MB and therein hangs all the tale of the future. What will that be I wonder? God knows, since it is his doing that all this has come about. So then I commit the future to God.\" </p> <p>After reading between his lines for long weeks at a time, I became convinced that this solemn talk meant that he was wondering if God was proposing to make him a widower. He had made some sort of vow to MB on the Bible, and Hilda had been very ill indeed with asthma in south Wales ... If I'm right, he must have felt cheated, for the move from the Rhondda to Hanmer proved very good for Grandma, who got much stronger in the country. </p> <p> Certainly his relationship with MB now rapidly soured, to the point where he found himself longing to believe that she had, as gossip suggested, another lover. But in the event it was he himself who was unfaithful to her, and this was another of the diaries' revelations. I had known vaguely about the affair with Nurse Burgess - it was part of village mythology - but not about Marjorie, \"Marj\" for short. People knew about that too, but did not talk about it, because it was too shocking, for Marj was my 16-year-old mother's best friend, only 17 herself. </p> <p>\"This was the sin that spoiled his relationship with my mother for good, prevented his promotion in the church, and made him such a shady character in Hanmer, though people flocked to hear his sermons. And even that wasn't quite the end of the diary story either, for it looks as if MB wasn't the first. Perhaps he was on the run when he arrived in Hanmer. </p> <p>\"I realised that I didn't really want to take after Grandpa when it came to deviousness and self-pity and self-dramatisation. There were moments when he seemed to reach a skinny hand out of the past to take hold of me, as when he confided to the diary, \"Today\" (October 7 1934) \"I had the old inspiration back again to write\"; and again in December, \"I make another resolution to spend my time in journalism and writing. I think I can make good now ...\" Well he didn't, but in a strange way he was now doing it through me.\" </p> <p>I still thought of him - still think of him - as my great familiar and mentor, the making of me, though I now see that that carries all sorts of baggage with it that I had not expected. Writing about his sins, his sermons, his last illness (he had a stroke in mid-flow in the pulpit, I was there in the front row of the choir), I gave myself the impetus to go on to explore my parent's lives and my own first marriage, at 16. </p> <p>Indeed, marriage, and its changing nature over the years, became one of the book's themes, and so did secrets and lies. He represents for me now the glamour of the past, and its sinister pull, like the force of gravity inside your life. He refuses to die. When Grandma was packing up to move out of the vicarage I called by on my way from school and she told me that she had met him on the stairs. </p> <p>I was thrilled, but she took it in her stride - it was just the kind of theatrical trick he would pull. \"If the old bugger thinks he can frighten me that way,\" she wheezed, \"he's got another think coming.\" And I treasured up the story for future reference, though it took me nearly half a century to get around to writing it down. </p> <p>\u0095 Lorna Sage's memoir Bad Blood is published by Fourth Estate, priced \u00a315.99.</p> <p><strong>Lorna Sage: a life in literature</strong><br><strong>Stephen Moss</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Born 13 January 1943, the eldest child of Eric Stockton, a haulage contractor who was in the army when Lorna was born, and Valma, the daughter of an Anglican clergyman.

      "bodyText": "Starting a memoir, you open a door on to the past. The moment Bad Blood became real to me was when, in my mind's eye, I saw just which door, and who was leading the way: \"Grandfather's skirts would flap in the wind along the churchyard path and I would hang on.\" I am still pleased with the book's first words, though I had no idea what I was letting myself in for. My bitter, theatrical vicar-grandfather, stagnating in the remote rural parish of Hanmer in North Wales for his sins (women and drink, mostly), was my reference point, my black flag on the map of the past, my arrow pointing - \"You were here\", this is where you begin. \"He often found things to do in the vestry, excuses for getting out of the vicarage (kicking the swollen door, cursing) and so long as he took me he couldn't get up to much. I was a sort of hobble, he was my minder and I was his. He'd have liked to get further away, but petrol was rationed. The church was at least safe. My grandmother never went near it - except feet first in her coffin, but that was years later, when she was buried in the same grave with him. \"Rotting together for eternity, one flesh at the last after a lifetime's mutual loathing. In life, though, she never invaded his patch; once inside the churchyard gate he was on his own ground, in his element. He was good at funerals, being gaunt and lined and marked with mortality. He had a scar down his hollow cheek, too, which Grandma had done with the carving knife one of the many times when he came home pissed and incapable.\" He died when I was only nine, but that strengthened his hold on my imagination. He did not let me down as he had all the others, starting with my grandmother and my mother, their daughter. Instead he vanished into the dark with his mystique intact. When, in my teens, I quarrelled with my mother, she would say in despair and disgust, \"You're just like your grandfather,\" meaning that I was promiscuous, sex-obsessed, that the bad blood was coming out. My bookishness was part of that inheritance too, and though she and my father approved in theory of my love of reading, and my coming top in exams, we all knew that books had a sinister, Grandpa side to them. You could always tell which were his books because he had had the bright idea of inking out their titles and authors' names in case visitors to his study asked to borrow a Dickens or a Marie Corelli. My name, Lorna, came out of one of the blacked-out books, Lorna Doone, and he had chosen it when my father was away in the war. He also taught me to read when I was three, and that confirmed me as his creature. After he was dead I'd commune with him in the vicarage books that no one else read. My mother never opened them; she had given up on all that when she turned against him and chose Grandma's side. Writing about him, trying to bring him back to life, I succeeded in ways I hadn't expected. Family legend had it that my grandmother, who slept at the opposite end of the house and did not speak to him, had blackmailed him for years with the threat of showing his diaries to the bishop. Certainly she had a tidy sum in the post office, and it was true that he was always completely broke, but was that why? My mother was dead, but my father had no hesitation. Certainly it was true.

The drastic cutbacks could start as early as next month as the US giant seeks to trim up to 10% of its workforce. According to reports in America's Variety, plans were drawn up before Christmas. An NBC spokesman confirmed that the company had a hiring freeze in place, but declined to comment further on possible job cuts. NBC's last round of lay-offs came two years ago, when up to 300 jobs went in a belt-tightening exercise prompted by the increased cost of hanging on to hit shows such as Friends and ER. The move comes as media in the US and the UK experience decline in advertising revenues. Yesterday rumours were circulating that CNN is considering axing up to 1,000 jobs in a streamlining operation partly triggered by the merger of parent group Time Warner with AOL.

Mr Brown has also allocated \u00a370m for the Children's Fund, announced as part of the summer spending review. A further \u00a350m will be given to community groups in deprived areas to recruit volunteers, especially the over-50s. Research has shown that volunteering is declining among older people. A survey of 1,000 people in December for CitizensConnection.net revealed that 40% had no involvement in their community. Up to 170,000 people already volunteer in the NHS, while 350,000 are school governors. Julia Middleton, chief executive of CitizensConnection and a trustee of the thinktank Demos, said the announcement was flawed, since \"government and civil servants do not have a great track record in motivating citizens\". The shadow home affairs spokesman, David Lidington, derided Labour's \"conversion\" to volunteering: \"As a party and a government, they have championed centralisation.\"",

Certainly, if the aim was to use them to squeeze and reduce the service provided by paid professionals.

Mr Brown is not searching for a cheapskate way of cutting services. The prime minister has already signalled that further large investments will be needed beyond the second comprehensive spending period. </p> <p>It will not be easy to find all these new recruits. Voluntary organisations have been struggling with the dip in volunteering for a decade. One reason for the fall is the longer working hours - of men, but particularly women - and the increased demand an ageing population places on its carers.

They have more time, but do less volunteering than other age groups. The last two categories - and the unemployed - would benefit from the sense of satisfaction that volunteering can generate. </p> <p>The mechanisms which ministers have sponsored are sensible: TimeBank, which has compiled separate national registers to help match people wanting to volunteer with voluntary organisations seeking more help; the promotion of employer-based volunteering programmes; and myriad anti-poverty programmes, such as Sure Start for under four-year-olds in deprived areas, which uses a mix of paid and unpaid workers.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The government's vision of the good society is there, even if it blinks on and off erratically sometimes. Yesterday the chancellor spelt it out again. Announcing new funds for encouraging a million more people to volunteer, he spoke eloquently: \"A new era - the age of active citizenship and the enabling state - is within our grasp and at its core is a renewal of civic society\". He proclaimed an end to \"centralising government\". He said the man from Whitehall no longer knows best, but the woman from the WRVS does. </p> <p>Ministers keep saying it - the key to success in social programmes is through breathing new life into communities. Research into what works in urban renewal finds engaging the people is the only answer. On Monday the new \"neighbourhood renewal action plan\" is launched, designed to reach down into the heart of the poorest places, promising to rebuild communities from the bottom upwards. The word is local \"empowerment\". </p> <p>The vision of the celestial city looks something like this: parents are involved daily with schools. Churches and local groups run after-school clubs, tenants on estates control their own budgets. All local departments pool their budgets, working together to offer whatever local people want most. Mentors guide and support young offenders, aspirant businesses, struggling readers, prisoners or depressed young mothers, connecting the disconnected. Thus local government is re born as people use the rusty levers of power in their communities. City mayors breathe new pride into public works. The comfortable aid the miserable, and in doing so find new meaning in their own lives. Happiness comes not from money - neither in high pay, nor in benefit cheque - but from a sense of inclusion and purpose, fulfilment for rich and poor alike. Community participation spreads warmth and becomes a good in itself, regardless of its output. \"You get more out than you put in\" is the slogan of the government's TimeBank* initiative, run by the BBC, the gateway to draw in new volunteers. Two thirds of the population should be giving two hours a week by 2005: the good society will wrap us all in its embrace. </p> <p>And it is a good vision. But it sounds odd on the government's lips, an afterthought like a dusting of icing sugar, not the cake. The Tories were quick to point out the contradictions. This highly centralising government is suddenly \"empowering\" others? The woman from the WRVS knows better than Ofsted? Under Labour every social programme comes with rigorous targets to be monitored ruthlessly. Every penny of public money is tied up in a public service agreement, where departments deliver or die on their Treasury contracts. Yet suddenly the chancellor talks of letting go? </p> <p>Labour has just tripped over the great dilemma for all modern social democracies. Progressives rightly believe in the power of government to do good. And yet as central government takes command and delivers, the democratic roots dry up. Evidence-based policy making means centralised policy making. But if the good society means people doing things for themselves and one another, then communities need to be given a long rein and money without strings, free to make mistakes. Schools are the most thriving focus for communities, but would David Blunkett entrust them to the local whims of parents? </p> <p>Community decisions may often be better than Whitehall's but they might also be much worse. Currently all the target-setting, league tables, national plans and Whitehall thumb-screws are beginning to deliver measurably better services. Is the Whitehall whip to be hung up? Universal standards and community empowerment are admirable but contradictory goals. </p> <p>Another oddity: there is no clamour for community involvement. It is a top-down prescription in a time when people have deserted the churches, the Rotary Club, the WI, political parties and trade unions. They don't tell the pollsters they hanker after committees, minutes and points of order. Suggesting turning out for a neighbourhood meeting gets a dusty answer. Thatcherite individualism bred the idea that all fun is private and paid for, not public and communal. It is television at home, a meal at a restaurant table, a cinema ticket in the dark. With money now for luxury leisure, who but the desperate and the divinely dedicated seeks fun in a chilly Boy Scout hall with neon strip lights? The government is urging people to do it because it's good for them, like exercise and eating greens. \"Enabling\" sounds splendid, but how will people be levered out of their armchairs? </p> <p>Can a new volunteering age happen? Can government do it? It will need a new spirit of enthusiasm for public things. Perhaps if people see local groups have real power and money, then investing time would seem worthwhile. If this is a serious policy then spending needs to bend towards what does induce a genuine sense of community. For parents, a beautiful nursery and creche with after-school clubs all sited together, right on their doorstep would build the first geographical bond between city-dwellers seeking company and mutual support. </p> <p>If public places like these were welcoming and enjoyable, if schools and doctors' surgeries were pleasant places to meet, then local activism might spring naturally out of these hubs. Imagine adult education centres for fun or for employable skills that weren't run-down, filthy places starved of funds. </p> <p>Why not free sports centres better than private gyms? Public places have to match the comfort and pleasure of private homes if people are to be enticed back into the public sphere to do communal things. In Joseph Chamberlain's day the civic offered things to be proud of - magnificent public libraries, colleges, swimming pools, schools and meeting rooms that outshone anything people had at home. Now the reverse its true, where most council flat front rooms are more comfortable. Gordon Brown said this was not a left/right issue, but it is. The right would abandon the welfare state to private philanthropy, forcing charity to take over. The progressive approach has to be a generous and enabling state welcoming people lavishly back into a proud public life. </p> <p>The time is right.

      "bodyText": "The government's vision of the good society is there, even if it blinks on and off erratically sometimes. Yesterday the chancellor spelt it out again. Announcing new funds for encouraging a million more people to volunteer, he spoke eloquently: \"A new era - the age of active citizenship and the enabling state - is within our grasp and at its core is a renewal of civic society\". He proclaimed an end to \"centralising government\". He said the man from Whitehall no longer knows best, but the woman from the WRVS does. Ministers keep saying it - the key to success in social programmes is through breathing new life into communities. Research into what works in urban renewal finds engaging the people is the only answer. On Monday the new \"neighbourhood renewal action plan\" is launched, designed to reach down into the heart of the poorest places, promising to rebuild communities from the bottom upwards. The word is local \"empowerment\". The vision of the celestial city looks something like this: parents are involved daily with schools. Churches and local groups run after-school clubs, tenants on estates control their own budgets. All local departments pool their budgets, working together to offer whatever local people want most. Mentors guide and support young offenders, aspirant businesses, struggling readers, prisoners or depressed young mothers, connecting the disconnected. Thus local government is re born as people use the rusty levers of power in their communities. City mayors breathe new pride into public works. The comfortable aid the miserable, and in doing so find new meaning in their own lives. Happiness comes not from money - neither in high pay, nor in benefit cheque - but from a sense of inclusion and purpose, fulfilment for rich and poor alike. Community participation spreads warmth and becomes a good in itself, regardless of its output. \"You get more out than you put in\" is the slogan of the government's TimeBank* initiative, run by the BBC, the gateway to draw in new volunteers. Two thirds of the population should be giving two hours a week by 2005: the good society will wrap us all in its embrace. And it is a good vision. But it sounds odd on the government's lips, an afterthought like a dusting of icing sugar, not the cake. The Tories were quick to point out the contradictions. This highly centralising government is suddenly \"empowering\" others? The woman from the WRVS knows better than Ofsted? Under Labour every social programme comes with rigorous targets to be monitored ruthlessly. Every penny of public money is tied up in a public service agreement, where departments deliver or die on their Treasury contracts. Yet suddenly the chancellor talks of letting go? Labour has just tripped over the great dilemma for all modern social democracies. Progressives rightly believe in the power of government to do good. And yet as central government takes command and delivers, the democratic roots dry up. Evidence-based policy making means centralised policy making. But if the good society means people doing things for themselves and one another, then communities need to be given a long rein and money without strings, free to make mistakes. Schools are the most thriving focus for communities, but would David Blunkett entrust them to the local whims of parents? Community decisions may often be better than Whitehall's but they might also be much worse. Currently all the target-setting, league tables, national plans and Whitehall thumb-screws are beginning to deliver measurably better services. Is the Whitehall whip to be hung up? Universal standards and community empowerment are admirable but contradictory goals. Another oddity: there is no clamour for community involvement. It is a top-down prescription in a time when people have deserted the churches, the Rotary Club, the WI, political parties and trade unions. They don't tell the pollsters they hanker after committees, minutes and points of order. Suggesting turning out for a neighbourhood meeting gets a dusty answer. Thatcherite individualism bred the idea that all fun is private and paid for, not public and communal. It is television at home, a meal at a restaurant table, a cinema ticket in the dark. With money now for luxury leisure, who but the desperate and the divinely dedicated seeks fun in a chilly Boy Scout hall with neon strip lights? The government is urging people to do it because it's good for them, like exercise and eating greens. \"Enabling\" sounds splendid, but how will people be levered out of their armchairs? Can a new volunteering age happen? Can government do it? It will need a new spirit of enthusiasm for public things. Perhaps if people see local groups have real power and money, then investing time would seem worthwhile. If this is a serious policy then spending needs to bend towards what does induce a genuine sense of community. For parents, a beautiful nursery and creche with after-school clubs all sited together, right on their doorstep would build the first geographical bond between city-dwellers seeking company and mutual support. If public places like these were welcoming and enjoyable, if schools and doctors' surgeries were pleasant places to meet, then local activism might spring naturally out of these hubs. Imagine adult education centres for fun or for employable skills that weren't run-down, filthy places starved of funds. Why not free sports centres better than private gyms? Public places have to match the comfort and pleasure of private homes if people are to be enticed back into the public sphere to do communal things. In Joseph Chamberlain's day the civic offered things to be proud of - magnificent public libraries, colleges, swimming pools, schools and meeting rooms that outshone anything people had at home. Now the reverse its true, where most council flat front rooms are more comfortable. Gordon Brown said this was not a left/right issue, but it is. The right would abandon the welfare state to private philanthropy, forcing charity to take over. The progressive approach has to be a generous and enabling state welcoming people lavishly back into a proud public life. The time is right. There is an emptiness in many well-off lives and many would welcome involvement beyond their narrow worlds. But government exhortation sounds suspect while disconnected from any other policy. Citizens giving their time freely for the common good needs the government to give up some things too. Time is in short supply because Labour policy has made us the hardest worked nation in Europe, in desperate need of a better work/life balance, which only the government can effect. As for empowering the people, will the chancellor be first to let go? TimeBank polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

The physical and mental endurance involved will be extraordinary to watch.\" Glenn Barden of the production company, Vashca, said: \"The competition will see raw emotional drama as it pushes people to their absolute limit.\" For viewers who just cannot get enough excitement from the daily prime-time show, the spectacle will be carried live on the Channel 5 website. In the US it was called Hands on a Hardbody. The winner, Warren Hearne, lasted 125 hours and 37 minutes. The search is on for 26 contestants to take part in the event, at Lakeside shopping centre in Thurrock, Essex. Participants must not fall asleep and must touch the vehicle at all times, except during appointed breaks. They will strive to distract each other to take their hand off the prize, and friends or family will try to keep them awake.",

But yesterday Tony Hall, the BBC executive best known for removing newsreader Martyn Lewis, took on the poisoned chalice of running the Royal Opera House. So keen was the director of BBC News on a job that has dented many a shining reputation, he is believed to have taken a \u00a3120,000 pay cut to go to Covent Garden. He takes over as executive director from the American Michael Kaiser, who, after steering the opera house through a fraught first year of reopening after rebuilding without any major disasters, has got out while the going is good. Mr Hall, 49, an opera fan, whose experience of running a theatre is limited to a directorship of the defiantly working-class Theatre Royal, Stratford East, is seen as a hard-nosed administrator who demonstrated at the BBC that nothing, not even Martyn Lewis was sacred. Sir Colin Southgate, the chairman of the opera house board, said they were lucky to get Mr Hall, who would be consulted about major decisions before he officially takes over in April. A head of a continental opera house had also been on the shortlist, but Mr Hall - with his powerful connections in broadcasting and within the government - got the nod because of his success in reorganising the equally tricky and much larger BBC news department. \"His extensive experience of managing complex budgets and working in a fast-moving, creative environment make him ideally suited to this position at the Royal Opera House,\" Mr Southgate said. The culture secretary, Chris Smith, who is believed to have been consulted, last night described Mr Hall as a \"very capable administrator\". \"I am delighted that Tony Hall has been selected,\" he said. \"Michael Kaiser has done an extremely good job at turning round the fortunes of the opera house over the last couple of years and I am sure that Tony Hall will be able to continue the progress that has been made.\" The appointment comes at a time of great change at Covent Garden, with artistic leadership of both the Royal Opera and Royal Ballet being passed on to a younger generation.

      "bodyText": "Biljana Plavsic, the most senior Bosnian Serb politician to stand trial for crimes against humanity, made her first appearance at the international criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia in the Hague yesterday and calmly protested her innocence. Mrs Plavsic, 70, once known as the Iron Lady of the Bosnian Serbs, betrayed no emotion as she stood in the dock to hear the presiding judge read out a series of charges relating to the 1992-95 Bosnian war. Dressed in a lavender suit and wearing a crucifix necklace, she held her head high as she was accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, violation of the laws or customs of war, and a grave breach of the Geneva Convention. \"I received the indictment yesterday, I have fully understood it and I plead not guilty on all counts,\" she said. Mrs Plavsic, who turned herself in earlier this week, is accused of masterminding the systematic ethnic cleansing of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats in the years before and during the Bosnian war. She is the first woman indicted by the tribunal, and arguably its most significant prisoner after Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the Bosnian Serb wartime assembly, who was arrested last year. \"She is a very significant catch for us and this is very important for the prosecutor's strategy of ... bringing the most senior people responsible for what happened in the former Yugoslavia to justice,\" the tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said after the hearing. The chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, asked the court to try Mrs Plavsic jointly with Mr Krajisnik, because they are accused of many of the same crimes. Together with the tribunal's most wanted man, Radovan Karadzic, they were members of the Bosnian Serb presidency in charge during the war. Mrs Plavsic, a former biology professor, became president in 1996, when Mr Karadzic was forced from office, and held the post until 1998. The long indictment alleges that she was aware that terrible crimes were being perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces under her control but did not use her power to intervene or punish the guilty. \"Having knowledge of such crimes, Biljana Plavsic instead condoned and publicly congratulated the forces that had taken part,\" it says. Mrs Plavsic was in fact one of the most fervent proponents of ethnic cleansing as part of the drive to create a Greater Serbia, and even the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic criticised her for being too extreme. He said she belonged in a mental hospital while his wife Mirjana Markovic once famously called her \"a female Mengele\" - a reference to the Nazi doctor who carried out appalling medical experiments on live victims. A 1992 photograph shows her stepping over the body of a dead Muslim to congratulate the hated Serb paramilitary leader Zeljko \"Arkan\" Raznatovic, who was assassinated in Belgrade last year. Mrs Plavsic's lawyer tried to have her moved out of the tribunal's maximum security prison in nearby Scheveningen, arguing that it had been designed only for men and was therefore unsuitable for his client, who is the only woman held there. The Bosnian Serb government asked for her return yesterday, promising to ensure that she attended her trial in the Hague, which may not start for some time.",

At first the international criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia looked pathetically ineffective. The US did note like it, the Europeans did not want to put their soldiers at risk picking up indicted war criminals, and the long arm of international law did not appear to stretch to Bosnia. The massacres went on. One war criminal was so terrified of his indictment that he rented his summer-house to the French soldiers sent to arrest him. But yesterday, at around 11am, when a woman of 70 stood in the dock, the tribunal finally came of age. Biljana Plavsic, a former Bosnian Serb leader who once said that Muslims were \"genetically deformed\" and ethnic cleansing was a \"natural phenomenon\", may or may not have her hands covered in the blood of Bosnian Muslims. It is known that she kept bad company for most of 90s. Infamously, she was photographed stepping over the body of an executed Muslim in the town of Bijlena in April 1992, to kiss Arkan, Serbia's most brutal paramilitary leader. She told reporters: \"I exchange kisses only with heroes.\" It will be years before the meticulous and methodical tribunal will reach a verdict. Her decision to surrender herself to the tribunal could mean that she genuinely believes that she had nothing to do with the mass killing of hundreds of thousands of Muslims. Equally, it could mean that, even for the highest of Bosnian Serb leaders, there is now no escape from international justice, and that by cooperating now she may shorten her eventual sentence. Next month the tribunal will set up an office in Belgrade, just streets away from the office from where its most wanted man, Slobodan Milosevic, helped orchestrate the destruction of a multi-ethnic Yugoslavia. Not far away in west Belgrade the second man on the tribunal's most wanted list, General Ratko Mladic, has retired to a three story villa at 119 Vlagoja Parovica street.

      "body": "<p>The lawyer's evaluation of George Rivas might have sounded more chilling when the town on the border with Mexico was known as America's six-gun capital. \"He is the most dangerous man in El Paso,\" said the prosecutor. \"He never gives up, he's always got a plan and that's what makes him so dangerous.\"</p> <p>That was six years ago and 30-year-old Rivas has since been upgraded to the most dangerous man in Texas. Whether he and the six other prison escapees he is thought to lead are in the state at all is a different matter. Since they broke out of jail about 60 miles south-east of San Antonio a month ago tomorrow, there have been \"sightings\" in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Colorado and Oklahoma - some of them simultaneous.</p> <p>About one thing, though, there is no doubt. All seven face the death penalty after a policeman was shot dead in a raid on a sports shop in a Dallas suburb. The gang has contradicted the Texas rule of three - that prison escapees invariably are caught within three days and three miles of the breakout - and stoked a mythology to fill the void created by their success in avoiding arrest. A $200,000 (\u00a3135,000) reward offered for information leading to their arrest has failed so far to stretch the loyalty of those thought to be harbouring them.</p> <p>At first they were The Malevolent Seven, a corruption of the title of the 1960 John Sturges movie, The Magnificent Seven, starring Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen; the hunt is the most extensive in the south since that in the 1930s for the bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967); now they are being described as the Seven Deadly Sins (Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and others, 1962).</p> <p>It is only a matter of time before someone recalls The Long Riders, Walter Hill's 1980 elegy to the passing of the old West expressed through the story of Jesse James and his cohorts. But Rivas and his gang, aged between 23 and 38, are anything but romantic figures: two murderers, two rapists, a robber, a kidnapper and a child abuser, all serving long sentences.</p> <p>\"I guarantee you that with the life sentences these people are facing, they're not going to go easily,\" said Richard \"Bo\" Dietel, a private eye and former detective. \"People are going to be hurt, if not killed. They know they're going to fry because, whoever killed that cop, it's a conspiracy. They're not going to want to go back. They'll definitely get the death penalty. They know that.\"</p> <p>Three notes left behind by the fugitives when they made their escape helped to intensify the belief that it will end in bloodshed. \"You haven't heard the last of us yet,\" said one. Another, fantasising about starting a revolution and railing against the \"tyranny of the Texas prison system,\" quoted from the Kris Kristofferson song Me and Bobby McGee: \"Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.\"</p> <p>Rivas put his escape plan into action on December 13, leading the others out of the maximum security Connally Unit in Kenedy, south of San Antonio, in a prison pick-up truck with 14 stolen handguns, a rifle, a shotgun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition.</p> <p>Two days later came the first of only two confirmed sightings: two of the convicts robbed a Radio Shack electrical store 250 miles away in Houston and got away with walkie-talkies and police scanners. Then, on Christmas Eve, all seven are thought to have taken part in a robbery at a sports shop near Dallas, another 230 miles to the north. This one netted $70,000, 25 weapons and ammunition, and left a 29-year-old police officer dead, his body run over after taking 11 bullets, six in the head.</p> <p><b> Roadblocks</b><br></p> <p>Since then, the police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Rangers have received more than 1,200 tips, but little else to show for roadblocks throughout the state and wanted posters under the counter in hotels and shops.</p> <p>They have been \"spotted\" eating fried chicken in San Marcos, 30 miles south of Austin, the state capital, using computers in the town's public library, in a pizza parlour and whiling away an afternoon in a pool hall.</p> <p>At the same time, they have been \"seen\" on Greyhound buses headed for Austin and Laredo, city buses in Dallas and in a barn far away in the midwest. \"The majority of the calls are law-abiding citizens that want to assist and we deeply appreciate their help,\" said Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas department of criminal justice. \"But it's also brought out the weirdos, the bored and the psychics. The people who have seen Elvis have called and, yes, I've had one call from Hollywood. They want the story to make a movie.\"</p> <p>The ending is still in question, but another piece of the narrative was put in place yesterday when a report to the criminal justice department said that the seven overpowered a prison supervisor and then other members of staff as they returned to the maintenance room from lunch. Over two-and-a-half hours they made their way to the prison tower, where they stole weapons after getting in when an officer failed to check their identities. Security guards did not respond after a fire alarm was set off and an officer who saw unsupervised men did nothing, said the report.</p> <p>Prison officers, though, said that the blame went deeper than lapses by a few individuals. \"Mistakes are made but, be that as it may, I am still under the belief that lack of staffing is at the root of the problem,\" said Brian Olsen, deputy director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The Connally Unit was about 22 officers below its complement of 600 on the day of the escape.</p> <p>\"Someone has to take some responsibility and I think it's at the capitol,\" said Mr Olsen. The capitol, of course, has just been relinquished by George W Bush, in between jobs as governor of Texas and president of the United States.</p> <p>Prison officers in Texas start on $1,577 a month and Mr Olsen said that one had resigned recently to work at a taco franchise. \"He made better money and the benefits were better.\"</p> <p>The Texas prison system is 2,476 officers short of its 26,218 staffing level and their pay puts them 43rd out of the 50 states. An experienced officer receives a salary of $28,000, against a national average of $34,000.</p> <p>But whoever is to blame, the principals are still at large. \"We haven't seen something like this since the 1920s and 30s,\" said Tony Caeti, assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of North Texas. \"Seven guys escape from prison and stay together, commit crimes together. This is the kind of thing you don't see in modern-day crime.

      "bodyText": "The lawyer's evaluation of George Rivas might have sounded more chilling when the town on the border with Mexico was known as America's six-gun capital. \"He is the most dangerous man in El Paso,\" said the prosecutor. \"He never gives up, he's always got a plan and that's what makes him so dangerous.\" That was six years ago and 30-year-old Rivas has since been upgraded to the most dangerous man in Texas. Whether he and the six other prison escapees he is thought to lead are in the state at all is a different matter. Since they broke out of jail about 60 miles south-east of San Antonio a month ago tomorrow, there have been \"sightings\" in Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Colorado and Oklahoma - some of them simultaneous. About one thing, though, there is no doubt. All seven face the death penalty after a policeman was shot dead in a raid on a sports shop in a Dallas suburb. The gang has contradicted the Texas rule of three - that prison escapees invariably are caught within three days and three miles of the breakout - and stoked a mythology to fill the void created by their success in avoiding arrest. A $200,000 (\u00a3135,000) reward offered for information leading to their arrest has failed so far to stretch the loyalty of those thought to be harbouring them. At first they were The Malevolent Seven, a corruption of the title of the 1960 John Sturges movie, The Magnificent Seven, starring Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen; the hunt is the most extensive in the south since that in the 1930s for the bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967); now they are being described as the Seven Deadly Sins (Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and others, 1962). It is only a matter of time before someone recalls The Long Riders, Walter Hill's 1980 elegy to the passing of the old West expressed through the story of Jesse James and his cohorts. But Rivas and his gang, aged between 23 and 38, are anything but romantic figures: two murderers, two rapists, a robber, a kidnapper and a child abuser, all serving long sentences. \"I guarantee you that with the life sentences these people are facing, they're not going to go easily,\" said Richard \"Bo\" Dietel, a private eye and former detective. \"People are going to be hurt, if not killed. They know they're going to fry because, whoever killed that cop, it's a conspiracy. They're not going to want to go back. They'll definitely get the death penalty. They know that.\" Three notes left behind by the fugitives when they made their escape helped to intensify the belief that it will end in bloodshed. \"You haven't heard the last of us yet,\" said one. Another, fantasising about starting a revolution and railing against the \"tyranny of the Texas prison system,\" quoted from the Kris Kristofferson song Me and Bobby McGee: \"Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose.\" Rivas put his escape plan into action on December 13, leading the others out of the maximum security Connally Unit in Kenedy, south of San Antonio, in a prison pick-up truck with 14 stolen handguns, a rifle, a shotgun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition. Two days later came the first of only two confirmed sightings: two of the convicts robbed a Radio Shack electrical store 250 miles away in Houston and got away with walkie-talkies and police scanners. Then, on Christmas Eve, all seven are thought to have taken part in a robbery at a sports shop near Dallas, another 230 miles to the north. This one netted $70,000, 25 weapons and ammunition, and left a 29-year-old police officer dead, his body run over after taking 11 bullets, six in the head. Roadblocks Since then, the police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Texas Rangers have received more than 1,200 tips, but little else to show for roadblocks throughout the state and wanted posters under the counter in hotels and shops. They have been \"spotted\" eating fried chicken in San Marcos, 30 miles south of Austin, the state capital, using computers in the town's public library, in a pizza parlour and whiling away an afternoon in a pool hall. At the same time, they have been \"seen\" on Greyhound buses headed for Austin and Laredo, city buses in Dallas and in a barn far away in the midwest. \"The majority of the calls are law-abiding citizens that want to assist and we deeply appreciate their help,\" said Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas department of criminal justice. \"But it's also brought out the weirdos, the bored and the psychics. The people who have seen Elvis have called and, yes, I've had one call from Hollywood. They want the story to make a movie.\" The ending is still in question, but another piece of the narrative was put in place yesterday when a report to the criminal justice department said that the seven overpowered a prison supervisor and then other members of staff as they returned to the maintenance room from lunch. Over two-and-a-half hours they made their way to the prison tower, where they stole weapons after getting in when an officer failed to check their identities. Security guards did not respond after a fire alarm was set off and an officer who saw unsupervised men did nothing, said the report. Prison officers, though, said that the blame went deeper than lapses by a few individuals. \"Mistakes are made but, be that as it may, I am still under the belief that lack of staffing is at the root of the problem,\" said Brian Olsen, deputy director of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The Connally Unit was about 22 officers below its complement of 600 on the day of the escape. \"Someone has to take some responsibility and I think it's at the capitol,\" said Mr Olsen. The capitol, of course, has just been relinquished by George W Bush, in between jobs as governor of Texas and president of the United States. Prison officers in Texas start on $1,577 a month and Mr Olsen said that one had resigned recently to work at a taco franchise. \"He made better money and the benefits were better.\" The Texas prison system is 2,476 officers short of its 26,218 staffing level and their pay puts them 43rd out of the 50 states. An experienced officer receives a salary of $28,000, against a national average of $34,000. But whoever is to blame, the principals are still at large. \"We haven't seen something like this since the 1920s and 30s,\" said Tony Caeti, assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of North Texas. \"Seven guys escape from prison and stay together, commit crimes together. This is the kind of thing you don't see in modern-day crime. In this case you've got some clearly intelligent leadership going on.\" Rivas, a former employee at a car parts store who is serving a life sentence for aggravated robbery and robbery, is considered the only one of the seven capable of fulfilling this role. Richard Coons, a forensic psychiatrist who examined Rivas for his 1994 kidnapping trial, said: \"He demonstrates an unusual degree of interest, creativity and intensity in his craft. He is a mastermind and a leader. He is confident and arrogant. He has no conscience and does not speak the truth.\" Rivas, whose interest in guns was so great that he called his dogs Ruger and Beretta, told friends that he had but one ambition, even as he started on his career of crime more than 10 years ago: he wanted to be a policeman.

The trade secretary, Stephen Byers, will make a revised offer within weeks on underwriting the bid by the US Luxos Group to build two cruise liners at Birkenhead. </p> <p>Ministers originally offered to guarantee 60% of the \u00a3300m cost but with strings attached to protect taxpayers' money. </p> <p>Luxos, who had been seeking an 80% underwriting deal, said the offer would not secure the investment needed. At stake are 500 long-term jobs, 500 apprenticeships and spin-offs in supply industries. </p> <p><strong> Vauxhall unions seek redress</strong><br> </p> <p>Union leaders are seeking to mount a legal challenge to General Motors' decision to close its Vauxhall car plant at Luton with the loss of up to 2,000 jobs. </p> <p>Tony Woodley, the T&amp;G's car industry negotiator, yesterday told MPs that GM had broken British and European labour laws. \"We have taken legal advice and are still awaiting the outcome of that.\" </p> <p>The unions believe GM should have consulted workers' representatives before deciding to close the plant. They claim the closure was a short-term measure to cut costs and had nothing to do with GM's overcapacity in Europe. </p> <p>Mr Woodley said that in 1998 Vauxhall workers had sacrificed pay in return from an undertaking from Vauxhall that the replacement for the Vectra model would be built at Luton. </p> <p>But Nick Reilly, Vauxhall's chairman, told the Commons trade and industry select committee that a clause in the deal entitled it to \"revisit\" its undertaking in the event of a dramatic change in circumstances. </p> <p><strong> B\u00f6rse shortens listing schedule</strong><br> </p> <p>The Deutsche B\u00f6rse yesterday underlined its determination to fast track its stock market listing when it dropped two proposed elements threatening to complicate the offer.

      "bodyText": "DTI to help Cammell Laird The government is to increase aid to bring a life-saving shipbuilding contract to Cammell Laird. The trade secretary, Stephen Byers, will make a revised offer within weeks on underwriting the bid by the US Luxos Group to build two cruise liners at Birkenhead. Ministers originally offered to guarantee 60% of the \u00a3300m cost but with strings attached to protect taxpayers' money. Luxos, who had been seeking an 80% underwriting deal, said the offer would not secure the investment needed. At stake are 500 long-term jobs, 500 apprenticeships and spin-offs in supply industries. Vauxhall unions seek redress Union leaders are seeking to mount a legal challenge to General Motors' decision to close its Vauxhall car plant at Luton with the loss of up to 2,000 jobs. Tony Woodley, the T&amp;G's car industry negotiator, yesterday told MPs that GM had broken British and European labour laws. \"We have taken legal advice and are still awaiting the outcome of that.\" The unions believe GM should have consulted workers' representatives before deciding to close the plant. They claim the closure was a short-term measure to cut costs and had nothing to do with GM's overcapacity in Europe. Mr Woodley said that in 1998 Vauxhall workers had sacrificed pay in return from an undertaking from Vauxhall that the replacement for the Vectra model would be built at Luton. But Nick Reilly, Vauxhall's chairman, told the Commons trade and industry select committee that a clause in the deal entitled it to \"revisit\" its undertaking in the event of a dramatic change in circumstances. B\u00f6rse shortens listing schedule The Deutsche B\u00f6rse yesterday underlined its determination to fast track its stock market listing when it dropped two proposed elements threatening to complicate the offer. Shares in the Frankfurt exchange are expected to start trading on February 5, well ahead of initial projections of a May listing. The speed with which the bourse is moving will be seen as indicating that it wants the flotation out of the way in order to increase its freedom of manoeuvre amid increasing European consolidation and competition.",

      "bodyText": "Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida and brother of president-elect George W Bush, was hauled in front of the US civil rights commission yesterday to face questions about the irregularities which allegedly discriminated against voters from ethnic minorities. He was one of the first called to testify at the two-day hearing of the allegations that thousands of people were denied the right to vote in Florida on November 7 by harassment, registration irregularities, illegal polling purges and intimidating police road blocks. On Wednesday campaigners began a legal action against state officials for institutionalised racism. Mr Bush told the eight commissioner: \"I am delighted that you are here to sort out any discrepancies that might exist [in the election process].\" As he did during the controversial recounting of votes, he tried to distance himself from the proceedings, saying he had no \"direct responsibility\" for state elections. But campaigners in Florida accused him of turning a blind eye to the real issues with his \"politic\" appearance before the commission. Larry Spalding, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida, said: \"What the governor wants to focus on is technology, but what needs to be discussed is ... why some people were not permitted to vote, and why so many problems were found in minority or Hispanic-speaking areas.\" JoNel Newman, speaking for the Florida Equal Voting Rights Project, told the commissioners that many voters arrived at polling booths only to find that they had been purged from the electoral lists or that they were mistakenly listed as felons and thus barred from voting. He also said that many election officials refused to provide bilingual ballots or assistance to disabled voters on election day. In Florida, 93% of black votes counted were for Vice-President Al Gore. Mr Newman's group has called for extensive reform of the Florida system. It urged the commission to recommend sweeping changes, and not just the improvement of \"poor and unequal voting technology\". Mr Spalding said the ACLU was a party to the lawsuit as well as the government hearings because it lacked faith in the local legislature. \"The people asked to make the changes benefited from the system the way it is,\" he said. George W Bush was eventually named the winner after the supreme court decided to stop manual recounts in Florida. The Republicans had won there by less than a 1,000 votes, and allegations of irregularities emerged. This week's lawsuit asked a federal judge to outlaw the use of the punch-card ballots used in 25 Florida counties. The counting of \"chads\" - the punched-out pieces of paper - became a key source of contention. The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and the ACLU are also demanding federal oversight of Florida elections for the next 10 years. The Florida allegations come at a sensitive time as the president-elect prepares for nomination hearings on several controversial cabinet appointments. He has made a huge effort to portray his party as inclusive but his cabinet has been rocked this week by the revelation that Gale Norton, his nominee for secretary of the interior, delivered a speech in 1996 invoking the Confederacy and slavery in fighting for states' rights. The civil rights commission is expected to recommend remedies to Congress and the president in a final report this summer.",

      "byline": "Diana Rowntree",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The architect of the Royal National Theatre, Sir Denys Lasdun, who has died aged 86, was already an impressive figure as a student at the Architectural Association in the 1930s. His upright carriage, the sculpted head and commanding eyes, perfectly expressed the sureness with which he was to chart his way through an embattled profession.</p> <p>At coffee time in Ching's Bar, Denys would not be engaged in noisy debate. He would sit with one other person, honing his architectural beliefs. Tradition, for him - as for the rest of us - was the modern movement. He saw classicism as a constant, discreetly hidden in every revolution, and recognised the paradoxical link between the desire for total renewal in art and a deep attachment to the past.</p> <p>Although the principal, EAA Rowse, was a lifelong influence - along with Maxwell Fry and Berthold Lubetkin - Lasdun left the AA early, without a diploma, to work with Wells Coates, a member of the MARS Group, the intellectual sounding board of modernism. Two years later, he joined Tecton, Lubetkin's practice, on which all modern eyes were turned. Before war put a stop to such things, he built a house, 32 Newton Road, Paddington, strictly following Le Corbusier's domino principle. Later, Ronald Searle bought it and dreamed up the awful girls of St Trinian's there.</p> <p>From 1939 to 1945, Lasdun served with the Royal Engineers, and was awarded an MBE before returning to Tecton as a partner. When the firm was dissolved in 1947, he set up in practice with Lindsay Drake, and continued to work on a Paddington housing scheme, the Hallfield estate.</p> <p>Links with the London County Council architect's department, a centre of excellence, brought them the commission for Hallfield primary school, on which they were able to demonstrate, they believed for the first time, that a primary school should appear physically as the centre of an area. This was a generation of architects excited by the possibilities offered by reinforced concrete, and powered by social commitment.</p> <p>Next came the chance to build cluster blocks for Bethnal Green, east London. This innovative idea consisted of four 14-storey stacks of flats linked to a central stair and lift tower. It allowed for piecemeal renewal on bombed sites, and and was probably the most interesting built example of Le Corbusier's \"streets in the air\".</p> <p>Art was endemic in the Lasdun family. His father, an engineer and businessman who died when Denys was only five, was a cousin of the artist Leon Bakst, who worked with the Ballets Russes. His mother was a pianist, so his childhood was spent among music and musicians. He was educated at Rugby school.</p> <p>His marriage to Susan Bendit, in 1954, continued the artistic tradition. She had been at Camberwell art school, and went on to study graphics, and to write. Their honeymoon was spent visiting the classic modern buildings of America. Susan understood the nature and the problems of architecture, and later worked on the interiors and colour of the National Theatre, among other buildings.</p> <p>Late in the 1950s - and a far cry from Bethnal Green - a stunningly simple block of flats arose overlooking Green Park, in the West End of London, and gracefully took its place between two classical buildings without a single cry of outrage. 26 St James's Place was London's first experience of strata, though the idea had been fermenting in Lasdun's mind for 20 years.</p> <p>He said that \"strata express the visual organisation of social spaces in geometrical terms; they recall the streets and squares of the city and contour lines of the hills; and, at a more profound level, they bear witness to the roots of an architectural language inspired by natural geological forms.\" When fighting his corner against the derangement of strata at the National Theatre, Lasdun claimed, \"strata have given the Thames back to London.\"</p> <p>The 1950s ended triumphantly for Lasdun with the commission for the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), on a site in the circle of Nash's terraces overlooking Regent's Park, north London. I believe that the prestige of the college, and the honour of designing for such a site, gave this son of Russian Jewry a place he had desired in Britain's establishment - and the Royal Institute of British Architects' 1992 trustees' medal.</p> <p>I remember Lasdun saying that he regretted not having been to university, and wondering what a man of such presence, with such marvellous command of English, and of so philosophical a bent, imagined a university could do for him. The RCP became his favourite among his buildings: \"It accorded with the Nash terraces without imitating them.\" And 30 years later, a meeting room he added to the building turned out to be one of the three \"entirely satisfactory spaces\" of his oeuvre.</p> <p>The National Theatre was a live project in the office, by then Denys Lasdun and Partners, for 13 years. The architect was appointed in 1963. While other contenders faced the board as a multi-professional team, Sir Peter Hall has recalled the drama - amounting to pathos - of Lasdun's solo performance.</p> <p>Any building called upon to accommodate three theatres (one seating 1,100 people), their audiences, scenery, props, workshops, foyers, restaurants and bars, is bound to provoke controversy. At the National, admiration tends to centre on the magic of the foyers and the Olivier Theatre, which was inspired by the ancient amphitheatre at Epidaurus - the largest of Lasdun's \"entirely satisfactory\" spaces. Criticism is mostly of backstage arrangements, the lack of signposting, and, of course, the concrete. This material enabled Lasdun to open up the public spaces of the building to the public view. He likened the project to planning a small city.</p> <p>Lasdun was very skilled in the use of concrete. He told Sir Peter Hall: \"Concrete is a very intractable material, but it can be a beautiful material if it is used in the way its own nature intends it to be used ... It is a sort of sculpture that you can only do with reinforced concrete, but you need to work to a certain scale ... It is not a cosy little material.\"</p> <p>In 1976, Lasdun's long struggle to reconcile the wishes of a many-headed client with his own highly disciplined vision was marked by a knighthood. I think the award of the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture represented a consensus of British architects in acknowledging his stature.</p> <p>With such architects' work, the question repeatedly arises: should the key buildings of an architectural epoch be altered as their use continually demands?

      "bodyText": "The architect of the Royal National Theatre, Sir Denys Lasdun, who has died aged 86, was already an impressive figure as a student at the Architectural Association in the 1930s. His upright carriage, the sculpted head and commanding eyes, perfectly expressed the sureness with which he was to chart his way through an embattled profession. At coffee time in Ching's Bar, Denys would not be engaged in noisy debate. He would sit with one other person, honing his architectural beliefs. Tradition, for him - as for the rest of us - was the modern movement. He saw classicism as a constant, discreetly hidden in every revolution, and recognised the paradoxical link between the desire for total renewal in art and a deep attachment to the past. Although the principal, EAA Rowse, was a lifelong influence - along with Maxwell Fry and Berthold Lubetkin - Lasdun left the AA early, without a diploma, to work with Wells Coates, a member of the MARS Group, the intellectual sounding board of modernism. Two years later, he joined Tecton, Lubetkin's practice, on which all modern eyes were turned. Before war put a stop to such things, he built a house, 32 Newton Road, Paddington, strictly following Le Corbusier's domino principle. Later, Ronald Searle bought it and dreamed up the awful girls of St Trinian's there. From 1939 to 1945, Lasdun served with the Royal Engineers, and was awarded an MBE before returning to Tecton as a partner. When the firm was dissolved in 1947, he set up in practice with Lindsay Drake, and continued to work on a Paddington housing scheme, the Hallfield estate. Links with the London County Council architect's department, a centre of excellence, brought them the commission for Hallfield primary school, on which they were able to demonstrate, they believed for the first time, that a primary school should appear physically as the centre of an area. This was a generation of architects excited by the possibilities offered by reinforced concrete, and powered by social commitment. Next came the chance to build cluster blocks for Bethnal Green, east London. This innovative idea consisted of four 14-storey stacks of flats linked to a central stair and lift tower. It allowed for piecemeal renewal on bombed sites, and and was probably the most interesting built example of Le Corbusier's \"streets in the air\". Art was endemic in the Lasdun family. His father, an engineer and businessman who died when Denys was only five, was a cousin of the artist Leon Bakst, who worked with the Ballets Russes. His mother was a pianist, so his childhood was spent among music and musicians. He was educated at Rugby school. His marriage to Susan Bendit, in 1954, continued the artistic tradition. She had been at Camberwell art school, and went on to study graphics, and to write. Their honeymoon was spent visiting the classic modern buildings of America. Susan understood the nature and the problems of architecture, and later worked on the interiors and colour of the National Theatre, among other buildings. Late in the 1950s - and a far cry from Bethnal Green - a stunningly simple block of flats arose overlooking Green Park, in the West End of London, and gracefully took its place between two classical buildings without a single cry of outrage. 26 St James's Place was London's first experience of strata, though the idea had been fermenting in Lasdun's mind for 20 years. He said that \"strata express the visual organisation of social spaces in geometrical terms; they recall the streets and squares of the city and contour lines of the hills; and, at a more profound level, they bear witness to the roots of an architectural language inspired by natural geological forms.\" When fighting his corner against the derangement of strata at the National Theatre, Lasdun claimed, \"strata have given the Thames back to London.\" The 1950s ended triumphantly for Lasdun with the commission for the Royal College of Physicians (RCP), on a site in the circle of Nash's terraces overlooking Regent's Park, north London. I believe that the prestige of the college, and the honour of designing for such a site, gave this son of Russian Jewry a place he had desired in Britain's establishment - and the Royal Institute of British Architects' 1992 trustees' medal. I remember Lasdun saying that he regretted not having been to university, and wondering what a man of such presence, with such marvellous command of English, and of so philosophical a bent, imagined a university could do for him. The RCP became his favourite among his buildings: \"It accorded with the Nash terraces without imitating them.\" And 30 years later, a meeting room he added to the building turned out to be one of the three \"entirely satisfactory spaces\" of his oeuvre. The National Theatre was a live project in the office, by then Denys Lasdun and Partners, for 13 years. The architect was appointed in 1963. While other contenders faced the board as a multi-professional team, Sir Peter Hall has recalled the drama - amounting to pathos - of Lasdun's solo performance. Any building called upon to accommodate three theatres (one seating 1,100 people), their audiences, scenery, props, workshops, foyers, restaurants and bars, is bound to provoke controversy. At the National, admiration tends to centre on the magic of the foyers and the Olivier Theatre, which was inspired by the ancient amphitheatre at Epidaurus - the largest of Lasdun's \"entirely satisfactory\" spaces. Criticism is mostly of backstage arrangements, the lack of signposting, and, of course, the concrete. This material enabled Lasdun to open up the public spaces of the building to the public view. He likened the project to planning a small city. Lasdun was very skilled in the use of concrete. He told Sir Peter Hall: \"Concrete is a very intractable material, but it can be a beautiful material if it is used in the way its own nature intends it to be used ... It is a sort of sculpture that you can only do with reinforced concrete, but you need to work to a certain scale ... It is not a cosy little material.\" In 1976, Lasdun's long struggle to reconcile the wishes of a many-headed client with his own highly disciplined vision was marked by a knighthood. I think the award of the Royal Gold Medal for Architecture represented a consensus of British architects in acknowledging his stature. With such architects' work, the question repeatedly arises: should the key buildings of an architectural epoch be altered as their use continually demands? The fact that user requirements change was the reason why modern theory favoured lightweight and demountable buildings. At the National Theatre, the absence of weightbearing walls is conducive to change, but the reinforced concrete strata are not. Is the masterpiece in reinforced concrete on the South Bank not as worthy of preservation as Somerset House, that earlier masterpiece on the north bank? At Christ's College, Cambridge, Lasdun's superb, stepped residential building met with disaster, when the college, pressed for more accommodation, allowed a lesser building to be tacked on to the street facade, and so to prevent the terraced block from being seen ever again in its entirety. He was luckier at the University of East Anglia, where the architects who succeeded him as master planner have respected his plan and its intentions. Chief among these is the protection of the site's natural form. The Teaching Wall, which follows a contour line, is still the dominating presence, and the sheen produced by skilled casting is still visible. Like other architects, Lasdun designed many projects that never got built. Among these is a powerful, geometric design, defined by four pairs of towers, for the ancient site of the Hurvah synagogue in Jerusalem. After Louis Kahn's death in 1974, it looked as though it might go ahead, but this now seems unlikely. I do not know when Lasdun wrote, \"Every building has, at its heart, a generating idea, which must express itself through every part and in every detail.\" Looking back at the Hallfield school, its plan now appears overdesigned. With each building of his since then, the details, still lovingly designed, seem to merge more smoothly into the impression of the whole, which is of ever increasing scale.

Denys Lasdun is survived by his wife and three children, all of whom work in the arts; Louisa as a composer, James as a writer and William as a sculptor. \u0095 Fiona MacCarthy writes: Denys was in ebullient mood, greeting his friends with bear hugs, when I saw him last month at the opening of the British Museum great court.

The culture secretary, Chris Smith, is in trouble with the powerful museum and gallery lobby because his culture and recreation bill will give him sweeping powers to be \"consulted\" about the appointment of their chairmen and to amend their constitutions without consulting parliament. At issue is the independence of publicly-funded bodies - from the Royal Armouries in Leeds to research institutions like the Natural History Museum in Kensington - from excessive interference by ministers in both parties seeking to promote their own cultural agenda. Mr Smith, who denies that he has been \"bounced\" by his officials into dishonouring a promise last autumn not to go down this road, believes the museums, opposition MPs and peers and the media are over-excited about \"a storm in a teacup\". He also denies any \"Stalinist\" ambitions in what Whitehall calls a simple \"tidying up\" exercise on museum powers. Though Mr Smith is publicly resisting further compromise he may be willing to insert changes that would entrench the principle of \"consent\" by the trustees. He meets his critics to try and thrash out a deal in private on Monday, three days before the bill gets its second reading in the Lords. But the danger to Mr Smith will come during the committee stage as peers join forces to wreck the plan, knowing that ministers will not have the time to get an opposed bill through both Lords and Commons before the expected May election.

Nationalist SDLP assemblyman Danny O'Connor, who represents Larne where most of the attacks have occurred, accused loyalists of trying to drive out all Catholics. \"A lot of people don't want to admit it, but there is a form of ethnic cleansing going on in Larne,\" he said. \"If this goes on, sooner or later someone is going to die. Catholics just don't feel safe anywhere.\" Mr O'Connor, whose brother escaped injury when a nail bomb went off in his flat a few months ago, has given a dossier on 160 incidents in the past two years to the British and Irish governments. He called on the RUC to stage more covert operations to catch those responsible. He appealed to the Protestant community to help. \"Someone knows the bully boys who are doing this. Please help the police, so the decent citizens of Larne, Protestant and Catholic, can sleep soundly in their beds,\" he said. Larne's Ulster Unionist mayor, David Fleck, also condemned the attacks, as did Sean Neeson, leader of the Alliance party. The RUC sub-divisional commander, Superintendent Karen Kennedy, said the attacks were \"cowardly and reckless\" and urged anyone with information to contact the police. She said her officers had carried out more than 300 operations specifically to combat sectarianism in Larne in recent months.",

      "bodyText": "Detectives in Greater Manchester yesterday began an inquiry into the deaths of 62 more patients of serial killer Harold Shipman, who was convicted a year ago of 15 murders. The deaths, not previously investigated, emerged as suspicious during a clinical audit commissioned by the Department of Health and published last week. Families of the 62 patients had not made contact with the police when the original investigation began in 1998 after the exhumation of the body of Kathleen Grundy, Shipman's last known victim. The clinical audit, carried out by Richard Baker of Leicester University, suggested that Shipman could have been responsible for up to 300 murders. Detective Chief Superintendent Bernard Postles said that police had carried out a comparison between the deaths originally investigated and those classified by Professor Baker as suspicious or highly suspicious. \"This has identified 62 deaths which have not yet been investigated by police,\" said Mr Postles. He said the original inquiry, which he headed, had examined cases where relatives and friends had come forward with suspicions. \"The priority at this stage is for the police to make contact with the relatives or friends of the people whose deaths are regarded as suspicious,\" said Mr Postles. \"We are in the process of carrying this out, although this will obviously take some time.\" The investigation is unlikely to bring Shipman back to court since the crown prosecution service had already ruled out further prosecutions. The fresh inquiry means that police will have investigated the deaths of a total of 254 patients of the GP, who practised first in Todmorden, west Yorkshire, and for 20 years in Hyde, Greater Manchester. Fifteen cases led to Shipman's prosecution and conviction at Preston crown court. Police also drew up a list of 24 other cases in which they believed there was enough evidence to convict. Inquests have this week been held on the first three of those 24 and the south Manchester coroner John Pollard has recorded that each patient was unlawfully killed. Prof Baker's examination of Shipman's clinical records found that Shipman had certified 297 more deaths among his patients than doctors in similar practices. He said that, allowing for error, the figure could be as high as 345. But he believed the true total to be 236, the number of patients who had died at home. Later this month, Prof Baker will travel to the north-west to explain to relatives of Shipman's patients how he identified potential victims. The new police inquiry was welcomed by the families of Shipman's former patients and the lawyers who represent them. BMA briefing on the Shipman case DoH clinical audit of the Shipman practice",

Now, having lived for a while beside the transitional phases of a friend's transsexual journey, I see both sides of the story. Your personal path is a minefield, but so is the path that your friends are taking in relation to you. They used to have a man friend; you're asking them to have a woman friend. For people of either gender that's a very different sort of friendship. </p> <p>For people who meet you for the first time, who might be uncertain whether you're male or female or something in between, it's a strange and discomforting experience - and not one to be undertaken in the goldfish-bowl atmosphere of a wedding. </p> <p>This is their day, not yours. Thank your friend warmly and say you'll cut the ceremony if they don't mind, but you'd love to come and see them in their own home a few weeks later. Go as a woman, take your present and a bunch of flowers, and give your friend and her new husband time to adjust to your new identity at a time when you all feel more relaxed. <br><b>Alison Leonard</b><br> Chester </p> <p><b> She should fight for you</b><br> </p> <p> These people are not enlightened and it is best to stay out of it. Something similar happened to me in 1995 when my brother was to marry. He phoned me after sending out the invitations to let me know that it was \"inappropriate\" that I bring my same-gender partner to the wedding. It was the usual argument that I should keep my sexuality to myself. My partner was reduced to my sexuality, just as you as a person have been reduced to your transsexuality by both your friend and her future husband. </p> <p>A decision about a wedding and its guests involves two people, and if one of the parties has reservations in inviting someone based not on somebody's character or friendship but on their transsexuality, sexuality or skin colour, then it is up to the friend or relative of the guest in question to stand up for their values. </p> <p>Otherwise their own values and opinions get swallowed up in those of their partner, which means that you are persona non grata to your friend as well as for your friend's husband. I know how painful this is, and I also know what violent recriminations can ensue if one starts calling each other names over it. I did not go to the wedding and wouldn't have, even if all hell hadn't broken loose, which of course it did. </p> <p>Let your friend know that it is just as much her decision as his whether you come to the wedding. If you are not invited it is a sign that your friend is not able to be an equal partner in their relationship and is unable to stand up for who you are. In short, let them know how you feel without making any attacks on them, and then remove yourself from the scene.

He described it as the world's biggest rail offer, saying he hoped it would give a \"kick start\" to rail's recovery. It will cost Virgin \u00a310m, but Sir Richard said it was worth it to regain passengers' confidence. Other companies, on the back of a promise by Railtrack that 85% of the network will be back to normal by the end of the month, are expected to follow suit. South West Trains, which operates commuter and long distance services to the West Country, is planning a similar promotion. Within hours of Sir Richard's announcement Great North Eastern Railway said it would be reducing scheduled journey times by up to 74 minutes in its latest timetable. It was now able to run 85% of its services on the east coast main line. Christopher Garnett, GNER chief executive, said: \"We are well on the way to restoring the full level of fast, frequent services that passengers have come to expect.\" Promising \"no catch\" deals, Sir Richard said it would be possible to travel between London and Manchester and Liverpool for \u00a310 return. A first class return from London to Manchester will be reduced from \u00a3230 to \u00a3115, and from London to Birmingham from \u00a3137 to \u00a368.50. Cut price returns from London to Glasgow are reduced from \u00a377 to \u00a338.50. Sir Richard said that the risk was worth taking and that over the next 12 months Virgin would get its money back. Virgin expects to attract an extra 1m passengers during the promotion, which will apply to most tickets. The industry's continuing problems were highlighted yesterday by the revelation that up to 800 passengers on seven trains outside Brighton were abandoned for several hours in the dark in an incident several months ago. Some got out of their trains and walked through a tunnel along electrified lines to get to safety. Wendy Toms, chairwoman of the rail passengers' committee for southern England, last night warned that the situation was becoming so critical that passengers were threatening staff. \"It is incredible that this is happening, but one can hardly blame them. \"The driver of the first train which broke down abandoned his post and no other staff were around to explain what was happening.\" Ms Toms said that staff at Brighton station became so alarmed for their safety that they called police, who dispersed the angry crowds. Connex, one of the two companies involved in the incident, has promised to pay each passenger \u00a325, regardless of the ticket type held, for the inconvenience, although the weakness of current franchise agreements on the railway means that it is not obliged to do so. Rory Cantwell, a passenger in one of the trains, said: \"The only way to get any redress is for passengers to revolt en masse. Connex should be sued for its failure to live up to its basic contract between a passenger and a transport system.\" He said: \"It took people more than six hours to complete an hour's journey from London.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Coming from a working-class Pakistani family that migrated to England in the 70s, I never really understood what my fellow Britons would describe as a holiday. My family would save their pennies and every few years we'd go back to the \"homeland\", making that all-important trip to Pakistan. It was the most exciting thing we ever did, but looking back now I would hardly describe it as a holiday.</p> <p>I suppose the common understanding of a holiday is a break from the norm, a journey to a different place made purely for the sake of pleasure. In that sense of the word I had never had a holiday in my life. I started to become aware of this fact a few years ago and suddenly felt cheated that what I thought of as holidays were in fact family necessities. Births, deaths and marriages were the real reason we'd go to Pakistan, coupled with the fact that the family wanted to meet their relatives.</p> <p>That's when I decided that I was going to make up for lost years by going on \"real holidays\". For a Muslim the concept of a holiday is not a familiar one. But an inherent part of the Islamic tradition is the idea of making a journey for the sake of God. The pilgrimage to Mecca was something I had grown up hearing about. <br><br>As a child I would sit for hour after hour listening to stories about the journey that millions of Muslims still describe as the most amazing experience of their life. These tales of Mecca had such a mythical quality that they belonged more to the realm of fantasy than reality. It was as though Mecca was, quite literally, out of this world.</p> <p>As the yearning for Mecca was sown in my heart from early childhood, it was naturally the first place I wanted to go. As a Muslim I couldn't justify travelling anywhere merely for the sake of pleasure before first travelling to the most sacred place on earth for the sake of God. I remember telling a friend that I had been deprived of holidays all my life and that I was going to start taking them - after first going to Mecca. \"The only problem is,\" she said, \"once you've been to Mecca you'll never want to go anywhere else.\"</p> <p>That sounded like a romantic idea; I did not expect that it would bear so much truth. Last year, in the Christmas break that coincided with the Islamic month of Ramadan, I made my first pilgrimage to Mecca. This year I did the same thing. Now I have barely been back in England a week and my plans for next year are already starting to take shape. The thought of spending more than a year away from Mecca is almost unbearable.</p> <p>People often ask what it's like going to Mecca, but if words could describe it millions would not make the journey to experience it for themselves. Going to Mecca is more than fulfilling a religious obligation. It is travelling to the spiritual centre of the Muslim world, to the House of God, towards which Muslims across the globe face five times a day in prayer. It is an opportunity to stand before God in humility, admitting your faults, seeking His forgiveness and relying on His mercy. <br><br>There, in detachment from the world they leave behind, pilgrims see their lives in their real context. When all worldly distractions are put aside, the magnificence of God starts to become apparent and pilgrims can only bow down in prostration and praise, recognising themselves as nothing but the servants of God.</p> <p>Leaving Mecca is like leaving your heart and home. Those who have been once long to go back, and every time they leave they depart making one prayer: \"O Lord, invite me here again.\" Having been to the most sacred of places, my desire to go anywhere else was diminished. I suppose now I might never get a chance to understand what a holiday means to the average British person.</p> <p>Even as a child I would wonder why people don't live in the present and why they constantly dream of that annual escape. It is as though life is what happens in those two weeks abroad - the other 50 weeks of the year just fill the time in between. But somewhat ironically, it is also only after going back to Mecca that I can start to comprehend this British obsession with holidays.</p> <p>While the desires that drive a holidaymaker to the beach and a pilgrim to Mecca are as different as heaven and earth, there is an interesting analogy in the need to get away from everyday life. It is in the sun, sea and sand that the tourist takes relief from the strains of life by escaping to the most pleasurable parts of the world, living out fantasies and dreaming of better days to come. The pilgrim, on the other hand, takes refuge in God from the world itself, seeking forgiveness and praying for a better predicament in the afterlife.</p> <p>Unlike the holidaymaker, the pleasure of the pilgrim is not in escaping from reality but in going to the place where it can be seen most clearly. For both however, there is something inherently human in the need to live in hope of a better future. The only difference between the holidaymaker and the pilgrim is that the former's dreams are lived out within the confines of the earth; the latter's are located far beyond.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Coming from a working-class Pakistani family that migrated to England in the 70s, I never really understood what my fellow Britons would describe as a holiday. My family would save their pennies and every few years we'd go back to the \"homeland\", making that all-important trip to Pakistan. It was the most exciting thing we ever did, but looking back now I would hardly describe it as a holiday. I suppose the common understanding of a holiday is a break from the norm, a journey to a different place made purely for the sake of pleasure. In that sense of the word I had never had a holiday in my life. I started to become aware of this fact a few years ago and suddenly felt cheated that what I thought of as holidays were in fact family necessities. Births, deaths and marriages were the real reason we'd go to Pakistan, coupled with the fact that the family wanted to meet their relatives. That's when I decided that I was going to make up for lost years by going on \"real holidays\". For a Muslim the concept of a holiday is not a familiar one. But an inherent part of the Islamic tradition is the idea of making a journey for the sake of God. The pilgrimage to Mecca was something I had grown up hearing about. As a child I would sit for hour after hour listening to stories about the journey that millions of Muslims still describe as the most amazing experience of their life. These tales of Mecca had such a mythical quality that they belonged more to the realm of fantasy than reality. It was as though Mecca was, quite literally, out of this world. As the yearning for Mecca was sown in my heart from early childhood, it was naturally the first place I wanted to go. As a Muslim I couldn't justify travelling anywhere merely for the sake of pleasure before first travelling to the most sacred place on earth for the sake of God. I remember telling a friend that I had been deprived of holidays all my life and that I was going to start taking them - after first going to Mecca. \"The only problem is,\" she said, \"once you've been to Mecca you'll never want to go anywhere else.\" That sounded like a romantic idea; I did not expect that it would bear so much truth. Last year, in the Christmas break that coincided with the Islamic month of Ramadan, I made my first pilgrimage to Mecca. This year I did the same thing. Now I have barely been back in England a week and my plans for next year are already starting to take shape. The thought of spending more than a year away from Mecca is almost unbearable. People often ask what it's like going to Mecca, but if words could describe it millions would not make the journey to experience it for themselves. Going to Mecca is more than fulfilling a religious obligation. It is travelling to the spiritual centre of the Muslim world, to the House of God, towards which Muslims across the globe face five times a day in prayer. It is an opportunity to stand before God in humility, admitting your faults, seeking His forgiveness and relying on His mercy. There, in detachment from the world they leave behind, pilgrims see their lives in their real context. When all worldly distractions are put aside, the magnificence of God starts to become apparent and pilgrims can only bow down in prostration and praise, recognising themselves as nothing but the servants of God. Leaving Mecca is like leaving your heart and home. Those who have been once long to go back, and every time they leave they depart making one prayer: \"O Lord, invite me here again.\" Having been to the most sacred of places, my desire to go anywhere else was diminished. I suppose now I might never get a chance to understand what a holiday means to the average British person. Even as a child I would wonder why people don't live in the present and why they constantly dream of that annual escape. It is as though life is what happens in those two weeks abroad - the other 50 weeks of the year just fill the time in between. But somewhat ironically, it is also only after going back to Mecca that I can start to comprehend this British obsession with holidays. While the desires that drive a holidaymaker to the beach and a pilgrim to Mecca are as different as heaven and earth, there is an interesting analogy in the need to get away from everyday life. It is in the sun, sea and sand that the tourist takes relief from the strains of life by escaping to the most pleasurable parts of the world, living out fantasies and dreaming of better days to come. The pilgrim, on the other hand, takes refuge in God from the world itself, seeking forgiveness and praying for a better predicament in the afterlife. Unlike the holidaymaker, the pleasure of the pilgrim is not in escaping from reality but in going to the place where it can be seen most clearly. For both however, there is something inherently human in the need to live in hope of a better future. The only difference between the holidaymaker and the pilgrim is that the former's dreams are lived out within the confines of the earth; the latter's are located far beyond.",

We were invited by friends and fellow Christians from Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Missouri, who were looking forward our visit as much as we were. They had worked hard to organise a series of lectures, preaching engagements and important meetings for me. However, I found myself sitting in my office in Bethlehem writing this instead.</p> <p>What would it take for an average American to travel abroad, besides a valid passport, a visa and a ticket? Not much more, I would say. Yet a Palestinian cannot leave the country without a travel permit. The permits are issued by the Israeli military based in the illegally built settlement bloc by the name of Gosh Ezion, six miles south of Bethlehem. Yet, how can one reach Gosh Ezion if Bethlehem is sealed off and one is allowed to drive, in a Palestinian green licence-plate car, in a one-mile radius only? First, I had to get a yellow licence-plate taxi to travel on one of the so called bypass roads built on confiscated Palestinian land, yet designed mainly for the use of Israeli settlers. I met the taxi on December 28 at one of the many roadblocks.</p> <p>Once we reached our destination, my wife and I submitted our applications. We were told that it was forbidden for Palestinians to leave the country unless they had foreign passports. We were instructed to come back in three days. Then I was told that my wife had been given a permit, but that I had not. The reason given was that my wife had a green card and I didn't. I told them that I have, as a clergyman, a Vatican passport. The soldier said: \"Then, you should fill new forms, attach a copy of your passport and apply again.\" I did as I was told. I drove to the roadblock, but found that there was a small opening in the road that would allow my car through. I decided to take a chance. During the six-mile journey my wife and I were afraid of what might happen if a settler decided that our presence on the road is not to his or her liking. Finally, we reached our destination and got our permits. We returned to the roadblock, but an Israeli military vehicle blocked the way. A gun was pointed at us and we were told to go back to the place we'd come from.</p> <p>For more than an hour we drove from roadblock to roadblock, looking for an opening. Finally, we found one and were able to pass through before the soldiers saw us and closed it.</p> <p>On January 4 at 09:30 we set off (in a yellow licence-plate car) for Ben Gurion airport, which is about 30 miles north-west of Bethlehem, to catch our 16:35 flight. The soldiers at the entrance of Bethlehem stopped the car, asked for the permits, checked them and allowed us through. We arrived at the airport early and were first in line.</p> <p>We handed our passports, tickets and permits to the security official, who looked at the permit and then at us and at the permits again. She said our permits were not valid and that we could not fly. \"But the people who issued them reassured me yesterday on the phone that they are,\" I argued. She said that she would check with the airport police, who then told her that the permits were invalid. Being prepared for anything, I had the phone number of the military authorities who issued the permits and I called them.</p> <p>I spoke to the captain, who reassured me that the permits were valid. I gave my cell phone to the security officer to hear it for herself. She sent another officer to the airport police, who returned with the answer: \"No Palestinian is allowed to leave the country.\" \"Let me talk to the police authorities myself,\" I said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, her boss arrived and shouted at her for wasting her time talking to us. I went in search of the police (leaving my wife at the counter with the luggage), but one can reach the airport police only if you already have a boarding pass.</p> <p>Finally, I was told to walk to police headquarters, which is outside the main building in the airport.

      "body": "<p>When Dan Penn and Chips Moman paused during a poker session to write The Dark End Of The Street, in a Nashville hotel room in 1966, they created probably the most beautifully proportioned and viscerally affecting of all soul ballads. The song was to enter the repertoire of many great singers and musicians, from Aretha Franklin to Ry Cooder. But in James Carr, who has died aged 58, the composers were fortunate to find its first and finest interpreter.</p> <p>There are plenty of eminent observers - Peter Gural- nick, Charlie Gillett, Barney Hoskyns, Andy Kershaw, and the Memphis music historian Robert Gordon among them - who consider Carr to have been among the most remarkable singers of his type.</p> <p>Soul fans notoriously reserve a special affection for the fugitive and the obscure, and, in recent years, Carr has been widely championed as a better man than the far more widely known Otis Redding, whose origins and style were comparable. Certainly, anyone who wants to know how good a singer James Carr was needs only listen closely to his delivery of The Dark End Of The Street: \"At the dark end of the street/ That's where we always meet/ Hiding in shadows, where we don't belong/ Living in darkness to hide our wrong.\"</p> <p>The song is 44 bars long, in an AABA structure - a kind of modified 12-bar blues with an eight-bar bridge passage. The recording, made at the Hi studios in Memphis, opens with a shivering, tremolo-laden guitar arpeggio before the entry of Carr's dark, gaunt baritone voice. When he gets to the third line of the first verse, he does something that establishes his right to be considered a great singer.</p> <p>Over the sort of medium-slow tempo that would encourage most soul singers to lay back behind the rhythm, Carr chooses instead to push the word \"hiding\" ahead of the beat, an effect suggesting the urgent catharsis of confession. And at the end of the line, he lingers over \"belong\", lightly ornamenting the second syllable in a way that freights a single word with a world of sorrow.</p> <p>Throughout the record, Carr sounds deeply troubled. He usually did; the best of his mid-60s recordings were filled with grief and lamentation. Some of this was the result of conscious artistry, but there seems to have been another cause. His life, as it turned out, was an unhappy and confused journey, whose detours prevented him from capitalising on his undoubted talent.</p> <p>The son of a Baptist preacher, he was born in Coahoma, Mississippi, in Delta blues territory, but, when he was three, the family migrated north to the relative prosperity of Memphis. At six, James was singing solos in church. At nine, he was a member of a gospel quartet, the Harmony Echoes.

      "bodyText": "When Dan Penn and Chips Moman paused during a poker session to write The Dark End Of The Street, in a Nashville hotel room in 1966, they created probably the most beautifully proportioned and viscerally affecting of all soul ballads. The song was to enter the repertoire of many great singers and musicians, from Aretha Franklin to Ry Cooder. But in James Carr, who has died aged 58, the composers were fortunate to find its first and finest interpreter. There are plenty of eminent observers - Peter Gural- nick, Charlie Gillett, Barney Hoskyns, Andy Kershaw, and the Memphis music historian Robert Gordon among them - who consider Carr to have been among the most remarkable singers of his type. Soul fans notoriously reserve a special affection for the fugitive and the obscure, and, in recent years, Carr has been widely championed as a better man than the far more widely known Otis Redding, whose origins and style were comparable. Certainly, anyone who wants to know how good a singer James Carr was needs only listen closely to his delivery of The Dark End Of The Street: \"At the dark end of the street/ That's where we always meet/ Hiding in shadows, where we don't belong/ Living in darkness to hide our wrong.\" The song is 44 bars long, in an AABA structure - a kind of modified 12-bar blues with an eight-bar bridge passage. The recording, made at the Hi studios in Memphis, opens with a shivering, tremolo-laden guitar arpeggio before the entry of Carr's dark, gaunt baritone voice. When he gets to the third line of the first verse, he does something that establishes his right to be considered a great singer. Over the sort of medium-slow tempo that would encourage most soul singers to lay back behind the rhythm, Carr chooses instead to push the word \"hiding\" ahead of the beat, an effect suggesting the urgent catharsis of confession. And at the end of the line, he lingers over \"belong\", lightly ornamenting the second syllable in a way that freights a single word with a world of sorrow. Throughout the record, Carr sounds deeply troubled. He usually did; the best of his mid-60s recordings were filled with grief and lamentation. Some of this was the result of conscious artistry, but there seems to have been another cause. His life, as it turned out, was an unhappy and confused journey, whose detours prevented him from capitalising on his undoubted talent. The son of a Baptist preacher, he was born in Coahoma, Mississippi, in Delta blues territory, but, when he was three, the family migrated north to the relative prosperity of Memphis. At six, James was singing solos in church. At nine, he was a member of a gospel quartet, the Harmony Echoes. In his teens, he began to take engagements as a solo artist in the distinctly secular clubs clustered around Beale Street, while earning a living in a furniture factory. Roosevelt Jamison, an amb-itious young songwriter, became his manager and mentor. In 1965, they signed a deal with a new record label, Goldwax, run by Quinton Claunch, a former air-conditioning salesman who planned to challenge the local hegemony of Stax Records, whose stars included Redding. Carr's initial releases made little impact but, with the intense She's Better Than You, it was evident that he had found his voice. You've Got My Mind Messed Up gave him his first hit, followed by Love Attack, Pouring Water On A Drowning Man and, in the last weeks of 1966, The Dark End Of The Street. But as success came, so Carr became more difficult to work with. A simple man, who had been taught to read and write only when Jamison took him in hand, he was prone to vagueness at the best of times, a trait exacerbated by a fondness for reefer and by the medication he took to counter fits of depression. He needed patient handling if he was to be coaxed into giving a performance. His lack of ambition, and inclination to drift into semi-catatonic trances, sabotaged all attempts to further his career, whether by Jamison or by Otis Redding's management team, which briefly assumed control of his affairs, before recognising the impossibility of the task. He recorded unsuccessfully for Atlantic in 1971, but then lapsed into a silence briefly broken by tours of Japan and Italy. On his last night in the Far East, he seized up on stage.

      "body": "<p>Haythem Abdel Aziz looked bewildered as he stood in the early morning sun amid the tangled iron rods and rubble of what just hours earlier had been his home. Aziz, a carpenter, aged 42, had been having breakfast with his wife, four sons and his parents on January 2 in the village of Ein-Yabroud on the West Bank when the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) arrived with a bulldozer. He was not allowed time to take out all his belongings.</p> <p>He pointed to various spots where he thought his fridge, washing-machine, chairs, bed and sofa might be buried, crushed under concrete. His wife, Jihad, aged 34, said yesterday: \"I saw the bulldozer coming with soldiers and five Jeeps. I hoped it was to clear the road but it was soon obvious it was coming here.\"</p> <p>Four other homes in the village were bulldozed the same day. The presence in strength of the IDF was because 48 hours earlier a Jewish extremist, Binyamin Kahane, and his wife had been killed by Palestinians in a roadside ambush. He lived at the Jewish settlement of Ofra, only a few hundred yards from Ein-Yabroud. The two communities are divided by a road.</p> <p>Why had the IDF bulldozed the homes? Maybe the IDF had spotted someone firing a shot the previous night from Mr Aziz's roof and turned up in the morning to punish him? Maybe the IDF had intelligence that Mr Aziz, in spite of his air of innocence, was a Palestinian gunman? A request for an explanation from the IDF mentioned neither shots from his roof or any terrorist background. The IDF explanation was more mundane: \"There were five cases of unlawful building in the area of the fatal terrorist attack which were bulldozed.\"</p> <p>It is an inadequate explanation for destroying a family's home and belongings. There are tens of thousands of homes on the West Bank without planning permission because the Israeli government, while permitting Jewish settlers to build, give the okay only to a small percentage of Palestinians. Mr Aziz had applied for planning permission, failed to get a permit and, like everyone else on the West Bank, had just gone ahead anyway. That was 17 years ago.</p> <p>The reason for the bulldozing is that it was a punitive measure because Jewish settlers had been killed. On the same day that the homes were destroyed, the IDF cut off all access roads to Ein-Yabroud, using the bulldozers to build up 6ft high mounds of earth across the tarmac. A lawyer, farmers, a taxi driver, an American Palestinian over on holiday for a fortnight, a local councillor: all were standing around, unable to leave, facing a long day of inactivity. The lawyer, Haithim al-Sheik, ready for work in suit and tie, sympathised with Mr Aziz and complained about how it was impossible for a Palestinian to lead a normal life. They did not know how many days they would be cut off.</p> <p>There are hundreds of Ein-Yabrouds throughout the West Bank and Gaza every day: abuses, small and large, committed by the IDF again and again. The West Bank and Gaza are supposed to be run by the Palestinian Authority, a step on the way eventually to complete independence. In reality, it is occupied territory: the IDF is the oppressor and the Palestinians the oppressed. Any time spent on either the West Bank or Gaza shows it is as stark as that.</p> <p>Gaza is totally cut off. As in the film Escape from New York, all the ways in and out are sealed and those inside are left to make do as best they can in a community isolated from the rest of the world. The West Bank, with its long borders, is harder to block off totally.</p> <p>Every day the Israelis make new enemies. Israeli soldiers on the West Bank and Gaza are predominantly 18- and 19-year-olds doing national service. They often behave badly out of fear, knowing that a bullet or a rock may not be far away. But their disdainful attitude is often born out of racism, a sense that Palestinians are inferior. It is evident in the remarks they make and in the contempt an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint shows to a Palestinian old enough to be his grandfather.</p> <p>The Palestinians face lots of indignities, frustrations and anger every day. It is the lorrydriver stuck nosedown in a ditch, having foolishly attempted to drive across the desert because the roads to his village were blocked. It is the lost days of employment; it is the cessation of economic activity; it is the man raging at the Israeli-Gaza border because he is refused permission to visit his wife; it is the destruction of an olive grove because it is claimed Palestinian snipers could hide there; it is a newborn child dead because an ambulance would not be allowed through.</p> <p>Members of the Palestinian leadership, from senior officials to representatives of the Fatah youth movement, are assassinated by the IDF. The British government always denied such a policy in Northern Ireland. The Israeli government boasts about it.</p> <p>Reporters have been writing about the assassinations policy in recent days, prompted by the killing last week of a high-ranking Palestinian. But most of the other human rights abuses in the West Bank and Gaza are poorly covered, and often not at all. Few Israeli journalists now go to the West Bank and Gaza, afraid of being killed. Many American journalists self-censor their copy, knowing that their editors will tend to be pro-Israeli, reflecting the strength of the Jewish lobby in the United States.</p> <p>The disastrous consequence of the Israeli treatment of the Palestinians is to create hostility where it had not existed before. A new generation has learnt hatred. Israel was never going to stop Islamic Jihad or Hamas but, since the Israeli-Palestinian agreement at Oslo in 1993, there were signs of the two communities at least coexisting, even if uneasily. That is now gone.</p> <p>The tentative discussions in Washington towards a peace settlement are now irrelevant. A settlement is possible on paper: compromises can be worked out over the Palestinian refugees, the territorial boundaries, the division of Jerusalem and sovereignty over the holy site in the Old City. The problem is how to make it work on the ground. Even if the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, put their signatures to a deal today, it would not hold on for even 24 hours, such is the level of distrust and acrimony created since the Palestinian uprising began in September.</p> <p>Israeli officers and officials defend their behaviour on the West Bank, saying it is a war. Would it not be better, given that they are always going to have Palestinians as neighbours, to treat them in a civilised manner? An officer in the IDF said a soldier at a checkpoint did not know whether the Palestinian in front of him was an innocent or a Hamas bomber. He said the Palestinians had opted for violence: it had not been sparked by the visit of the former Israeli defence minister, Ariel Sharon, near the Muslim holy site, the Dome on the Rock, but had been deliberately sought by the Palestinians to secure more concessions in negotiations. Would it not be better to try to build up the Palestinian economy instead of trying to destroy it: Palestinians with jobs and a good standard of living might be less inclined to fight? The Israeli officer agreed but asked what was the point of giving money to the Palestinian Authority when so much of it was squandered by corrupt leaders.</p> <p>Why does Israel just not pull out of the West Bank and Gaza and let the Palestinian Authority leader, Yasser Arafat, declare independence? The Israeli answer is that too many questions about the border would remain unanswered, a permanent source of aggravation and conflict.</p> <p>An Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, published a report yesterday on abuses on the West Bank and Gaza. It said the restrictions imposed by Israel on movement was \"one of the primary reasons for the increasing destitution and despair in the Occupied Territories and has made the lives of the population unbearable\". It added the sweeping restrictions on the entire population rather than specific individuals were justified by the Israeli government on security grounds but the organisation disputed the effectiveness of the policy and pointed to the \"blatant discrimination between the two populations living in the Occupied Territories ... solely on the basis of nationality. The restrictions are imposed exclusively on the Palestinian population.\"</p> <p>The Israelis have a siege mentality, touchy about any criticism of their behaviour, present or past. They refuse to acknowledge the injustice of what they did in the first place, taking the land from the Palestinians in 1948. That refusal is central of the main Palestinian claim of a right of return for refugees to Israel. When Benny Morris, one of the new generation of Israeli historians, wrote that the Israelis had been less than lily-white in their behaviour in 1948, he was vilified by Israelis.</p> <p>He opens a history of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict with a quote from WH Auden about the second world war. It is as relevant to the present uprising as it was to the last 53 years of conflict.</p> <p>\"I and the public know</p> <p>What the schoolchildren learn,</p> <p>Those to whom evil is done</p> <p>Do evil in return.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, amid the ruins of what had been her home up until last week, Mrs Aziz said she had asked a soldier why they were planning to bulldoze her house and he had replied \"revenge\". In a sad reply, she told him: \"There is no peace between us and it is getting worse every day.\"</p>",

Israel Radio said the foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, and a prime ministerial aide, Gilead Sher, were to meet the Palestinian negotiators Yasser Abed Rabbo and Saeb Erakat. The Nobel peace laureate Shimon Peres might join in the talks, the radio said. Other reports said the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, Abu Ala, might also attend. Last night's hastily arranged meeting followed signs earlier yesterday that, after giving up hope of reaching a full-scale agreement in the nine days remaining of Mr Clinton's term, the two sides were stepping up their efforts to agree on the principles that will guide future negotiations. But the burst of diplomatic activity is overshadowed by the instability of Israeli politics. Four weeks before the prime ministerial election the incumbent, Ehud Barak, is trailing far behind the hawkish Likud party challenger, Ariel Sharon, in opinion polls. Mr Sharon has said he will not honour agreements made by Mr Barak, and that the Oslo accords, which have governed the negotiations for seven years, \"no longer exist\". The moves in the diplomatic arena reflect positive changes on the ground, where the Israeli army removed the roadblocks which sliced the Gaza strip in two and eased its blockade in some parts of the West Bank yesterday. The joint Israeli-Palestinian security patrols, which were suspended within days of the eruption of the intifada, may be resumed in the coming days, Palestinian officials said. In public, Palestinian officials have sharply criticised Mr Clinton's proposals for peace. These include a Palestinian state covering all of Gaza and parts of the West Bank, the latter divided into three or four cantons by the preservation of the main Jewish settlement blocks; Palestinian sovereignty over the Arab, and Israeli sovereignty over the Jewish, quarters of Jerusalem; and the surrender by the Palestinians of the right of return for 3.7m registered refugees.

When Mrs Grant said she had only 1,000 pesos the men grabbed the girl and fled to two speedboats waiting on the nearby river.</p> <p>The kidnappers, who have not made a ransom demand, are thought to be members of the radical Abu Sayyaf separatist group.</p> <p>Mrs Grant pleaded for her daughter's life on a local radio broadcast: \"Please don't hurt her. Please, I beg you to free my daughter.\" She said the kidnappers threatened to kill the child if she informed the police or armed forces.</p> <p>The family were due to travel to Scotland in April to join Mr Grant, who returned home last summer because his parents were ill.</p> <p>Speaking from Inverness, he said he and his wife were distraught. \"There is a tremendous culture of hospitality in the Philippines, and while Mina was giving them the water they grabbed Eiman ...

      "bodyText": "A British man yesterday said he feared for the life of his stepdaughter, aged six, who was kidnapped by Islamic extremists in the Philippines. Douglas Grant, 50, from Inverness, was waiting for news of Eiman April Grant, who was snatched from her home on the island of Basilan on Wednesday night after her mother was unable to pay an extortion demand. The island, 550 miles south of the capital, Manila, is a hotbed of Islamic secessionist groups in the predominantly Roman Catholic country. A military spokesman on the neighbouring island of Mindanao, Fredesivindo Covarrubias, said Eiman had been watching television with her mother, Mina Rasul Grant, when four men armed with assault rifles burst in. Mr Covarrubias said the abductors asked for a drink of water, then demanded 100,000 pesos (\u00a31,300). When Mrs Grant said she had only 1,000 pesos the men grabbed the girl and fled to two speedboats waiting on the nearby river. The kidnappers, who have not made a ransom demand, are thought to be members of the radical Abu Sayyaf separatist group. Mrs Grant pleaded for her daughter's life on a local radio broadcast: \"Please don't hurt her. Please, I beg you to free my daughter.\" She said the kidnappers threatened to kill the child if she informed the police or armed forces. The family were due to travel to Scotland in April to join Mr Grant, who returned home last summer because his parents were ill. Speaking from Inverness, he said he and his wife were distraught. \"There is a tremendous culture of hospitality in the Philippines, and while Mina was giving them the water they grabbed Eiman ... I think they might have taken the whole family but had second thoughts because Mina and I have an 18-month-old daughter, Khadija, and that might have been a hindrance to them. \"My biggest fear is that these guys have killed before. About a year ago they kidnapped priests, teachers and children from a school in one of the other islands. The priests' bodies were returned beheaded, the teachers were mutilated, while some of the children were returned unharmed and others ran away. \"They are capable of extreme violence, and I am just hoping against hope that they would not harm a terrified little girl.\" Mr Grant, a former soldier in the Catering Corps, met his wife and her daughter when he worked for the US embassy in Kuwait from 1994 until 1999. After getting married, he became a Muslim and the family moved to Basilan, where he ran a small taxi business. \"Eiman will be very stressed at being apart from her mother and her sister,\" he said. \"She is a clever little girl who was into computers from the age of four. There is a tremendous bond between the two girls.

      "bodyText": "As Basilan is in a region of the Philippines where private armies are commonplace, kidnappings happen regularly and it is rare to settle disputes without drawing assault rifles, the list of potential kidnappers of April Grant is enormous. But the authorities believe the perpetrators are probably one of two militant Islamic separatist groups fighting separately for an independent state in the southern Philippines. The main suspect is an element of the Abu Sayyaf, an organisation that has become notorious for its terrorist approach to campaigning for independence, specialising in abductions and bombings. It shot to international prominence last year when it seized 21 hostages from a Malaysian diving resort and took them to the inhospitable island of Jolo, about 100 miles south-west of Basilan. One of them, a Malaysian man, is still being held along with an American seized later. Abu Sayyaf made well over \u00a310m from that exercise in ransom money, as a result of which its numbers ballooned from less than 400 to more than 4,000. This sudden growth, combined with the Philippine army's continual military operation against the guerrillas on Jolo since September, made the organisation unmanageable and it has splintered into several factions. It is thought there is little left of last year's ransom money and so the abduction of April could well be one group's latest fund-raising bid. Abu Sayyaf has engaged in kidnapping on Basilan for years. One of its operations a year ago - when 31 people were seized in a school - backfired when another armed gang kidnapped the local Abu Sayyaf leader's pregnant wife and son and threatened to kill them unless the first group of captives was freed. As with most such cases on the island, the dispute was eventually resolved but not before several innocent people had been killed. If none of the Abu Sayyaf factions is responsible for April's disappearance the next most likely candidate is the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. This group is based on the larger island of Mindanao, north-east of Basilan. The MILF, a breakaway arm of the Moro National Liberation Front, has been fighting for a separate country for almost three decades.

It had to be under the microscope because it was so darn minuscule, though it might have survived a night in Transylvania more comfortably than the ministers and bookies. </p> <p>Apparently, depending on whom you believed, microscopic life could have lived on Mars in freezing temperatures for millions of years. Well, whoopee. It may have been engrossing in a worthy way, but Horizon failed to understand that, to your average Joe, it's no big deal if microscopic life existed on Mars. </p> <p>He - me, if you will - wants proper aliens with legs and arms and plans to take over the Earth. Microscopic organisms are so dull. They just organise microscopically. Hardly The X-Files, is it? Hell, it's not even Invasion: Earth.

Billed as \"a comedy and music show\", you can at least see where the music comes from - people play instruments, some of them quite well. It's the comedy bit that seems sadly amiss.

Apparently, depending on whom you believed, microscopic life could have lived on Mars in freezing temperatures for millions of years. Well, whoopee. It may have been engrossing in a worthy way, but Horizon failed to understand that, to your average Joe, it's no big deal if microscopic life existed on Mars. He - me, if you will - wants proper aliens with legs and arms and plans to take over the Earth. Microscopic organisms are so dull. They just organise microscopically. Hardly The X-Files, is it? Hell, it's not even Invasion: Earth. And with an enemy that could be dispatched with a judicious dose of kitchen cleaner, it's certainly not an opportunity to do your bit in a battle for Earth, all daring missions and exploding spaceships. I'd like to give Channel 4 marks for perseverance, but seeing as they're persevering with The Richard Blackwood Show (Channel 4), despite the obvious talent vacuum at the heart of the concept, it's nil points for them. Billed as \"a comedy and music show\", you can at least see where the music comes from - people play instruments, some of them quite well. It's the comedy bit that seems sadly amiss. The man deserves a night in a Romanian youth hostel. Or a night of passion with himself.",

      "bodyText": "Interbrew is considering a high-risk option of defying the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, by selling its Whitbread breweries, instead of its Bass beer operations. Advisers have suggested that if it sold the much smaller Whitbread business, Interbrew could be in a position to seek an order from the European authorities overturning the British government's regulatory review. Sources close to the Belgian company stress that this is only one of a variety of possibilities under consideration. However, Interbrew is determined to hang on to at least part of its Bass acquisition. Interbrew paid \u00a3400m for the Whitbread breweries, in Manchester, Salmesbury and Magor, Gwent, last May. The business owns brands such as Boddingtons, Wadworth 6X and Murphy's Irish Stout. This deal was eclipsed later in the year by the Belgian firm's \u00a32.3bn purchase of Bass Brewers, which makes Carling, Tennent's and Worthington. Mr Byers last week ordered Interbrew to sell its Bass operations, following a recommendation from the competition commission, on the grounds that the two deals gave the firm a dominant market share of between 33% and 37%. Some advisers believe that by substantially diminishing this share by disposing of Whitbread, Interbrew could argue that the landscape had changed, and the entire regulatory process should be re-started. However, if the gamble failed, the company could be left with no breweries in Britain at all. Interbrew is unlikely to decide on its next move for at least another week.",

Although the statement stopped short of the formal apology and acceptance of guilt sought by many in South Korea, the Pentagon is reported to have agreed to pay $1m to build a monument near the now infamous South Korean village, and $750,000 to create a memorial scholarship for Korean students. Pentagon investigators examined more than 1m documents and interviewed about 170 veterans of the 1950-53 Korean war after reports of the massacre by US troops appeared in 1999. They found that young, poorly trained recruits fired on a group of refugees sheltering under a railway bridge during the early days of the war, in July 1950. The soldiers, who were in confused retreat, were said to have panicked because they had been warned that enemy North Korean troops were disguised as civilians. The refugees were killed by \"small arms, machine guns, mortar and artillery fire\", the report quoted US veterans as saying. It also cited Korean witnesses, who said the refugees were strafed by US planes. The investigators said they had found no evidence that the massacre was carried out on the orders of military leaders, however, contradicting the Associated Press articles which broke the story in 1999. According to AP, the 25th infantry division was told that civilians should be \"considered as unfriendly and shot\". Yesterday's report said only that US soldiers \"were legitimately fearful of the possible infiltration of North Korean soldiers who routinely entered American lines in groups disguised as civilians in refugee columns and then attacked American positions from the rear\".

      "body": "<p>In the auditorium of the Lakeside country club, Frimley, two heavily disguised women are wrestling to contain their excitement. Raising their false moustaches for a cigarette and mindful not to ignite their chest hair, they keen in their seats for a better view of the stage door.<br><br> Enquiries as to who they are dressed as - Kevin Keegan seems a strong possibility - elicit a pitying response. \"We're Steve,\" says Mel Barlow after a short silence. She is an officer for the Cheshire police. \"Beaton,\" clarifies her friend Kate Davies, who has flown in from Majorca and will change her costume three times over the course of the evening. \"The Adonis,\" they say in unison.</p> <p>Backstage at the Embassy World Darts Championship, Steve \"the Adonis\" Beaton is warming up at the practice board. The 36-year-old from Coventry is only 20th in the world, but his resemblance to a 70s porn star - crinkle-cut mullet, heavy moustache, runaway chest hair - commands the sort of fanship that other darts players can only envy.</p> <p>Of the 32 players entered in this year's championship, only Andy \"The Viking\" Fordham has the right combination of swirly chin growth and thunderous belt-size to inspire this level of kitsch devotion (Mel and Kate are later to be seen in Viking helmets and wizardy beards). As the championship moves into its second week, so a small corner of Surrey succumbs to such excesses as are inspired by the immortal rejoinder, \"Let's ... play ... darts.\"</p> <p>The tenor of the darts world can be measured by a section of its governing body's website devoted to local clubs \"from around the world\", in which the world is represented by Harlow, Bolton and Bideford, north Devon. While other sports stars hustle for the Nike or the Adidas contract, premiere darts players eke out sponsorship on more modest slopes.</p> <p>John \"John Boy\" Walton, the top-10 player from Yorkshire, is supplied courtesy of Jim's Darts of Kirkby. Trina Gulliver, the women's world number one, is sponsored by Reeves Boatbuilders of Napton, Warwickshire and has appearances coming up at the Fox and Hounds, Daventry, and Ketton Sports Complex, Leicestershire. Martin \"Wolfie\" Adams, England team captain and a competition favourite, would like to thank the Towngate Inn, Lakeside, for its continuing support.</p> <p>The Lakeside country club can hold up to 1,000 people, the majority of whom, at Wednesday night's second round match, are arranged around long trestle tables groaning beneath plates of curry and pint glasses. The compere eases the crowd into a state of ecstasy with a joke that turns on the line, \"Sorry love, I thought you were a bloke\".</p> <p>While Beaton limbers up beneath the framed photos of former Lakeside acts - Gary Wilmot, Edwina Curry and Spit the Dog - the sound system pumps out hooks from Ricky Martin's Livin' La Vida Loca and Queen's Another One Bites the Dust.</p> <p>Beaton's opponent in this round is the number two seed, Raymond Barneveld, a 33-year-old Dutchman notable for his cleft chin and dynamic fans, who, on this occasion have travelled from the Hague dressed in \"Barney\" T-shirts and orange fright wigs. \"It's a very exciting game,\" says Andres Brugmans, 29, who comes from Barney's hometown and wears an alice band sprouting two silver orbs on springs. \"I prefer soccer, of course, but you go to a soccer match and you get your head kicked in.\"</p> <p>The only aggression to be found at Lakeside tonight is the camp, \"hoo-ya\" showmanship more familiar to the world of WWF wrestling. Unlike the grudging courtesies submitted to by most sports stars, the relationship between professional darts players is an extension of the pub banter they have marinated in since their first game. Roger Carter, the former world champion from Atlanta, Georgia, enjoyed a lively exchange with his British rival, Phil \"The Power\" Taylor this week, when Taylor logged onto the American's website, typed \"I AM THE BEST\" and logged off again.</p> <p>By 7pm, the Dutch TV crews have squeezed themselves into place below the stage and the crowd is poised to receive its heroes. \"Former semi-finalist of the Denmark Open,\" chimes the compere (Mel and Kate twitch to attention), \"Embassy World Champion, 1996 ... would you please welcome, Steve ... Beaton!\" Across the auditorium, hands emerge from packets of Golden Wonder crisps to beat the air. Beaton smoothes down his moustache and the game begins.</p> <p>While the match is undeniably exciting, the atmosphere of the event is generated away from the devoted fans at the front and in the rowdy mass of pleasure seekers at tables nearer the bar. When they got on the train at Neath, South Wales, this morning, Tim, Gavin, James, Gary and Chris opened their first cans of lager and drank to being 18. Tickets to the championship cost them \u00a34.50, the train ride \u00a340, the Welsh flag jester hats another \u00a310. \"Darts,\" says Gavin, straining to articulate his thoughts through the alcohol, \"is a national institution.\" He gives it a moment's foggy contemplation. \"Like Christmas.\"</p> <p>\"He's a twat, don't listen to him,\" says Tim. \"Darts isn't the Six Nations, granted, but the drinking is unbeatable.\" Rather surprisingly Tim is drinking Baileys, a girls' tipple I venture, before being nudged towards the pint of lager he is mixing it with it. They leave to be sick before the match is over.</p> <p>\"We're here for the mullets,\" says Andrew Macpherson, with heavy sarcasm. He and his friends - Ralph, Tim, Neil and Andrew - are down from Cambridge, deploying the defensive irony of students in late adolescence.</p> <p>\"Yeah,\" says Tim, \"we expected it to be full of sweaty men with big guts, and we haven't been disappointed. We're supporting Kevin Painter cos he's from Ipswich. Can you get Ray Stubbs to come out of the VIP lounge for us?\"</p> <p>Surprisingly in an audience as mixed as the Embassy's, the excesses of the young don't seem to infuriate the older and marginally more sober fans. There are no outlandish costumes on Bryan Huxted's table, but Pringle sweaters and muted match analysis.</p> <p>Huxted, a technical manager from Cheshire, is rooting for the flamboyant Barney. \"I like the characters,\" he says, indicating a group of youths waving inflatable hammers, \"but darts isn't just for the fanatic, it's for the ordinary person too. You get all walks of life here, not just the working classes - I don't mean anything by that. It's the tension, the atmosphere, the matches could go either way and any one of about 10 people could win it. Management has done a lot with this event. With the music and lights it's just like the wrestling.\"</p> <p>Huxted's great sadness is that after a fall out between organisers, the darts world has been split into two camps, with a breakaway Skol world championship held every year in Purfleet, Essex. \"There shouldn't be one in Purfleet,\" he sighs.

      "bodyText": "In the auditorium of the Lakeside country club, Frimley, two heavily disguised women are wrestling to contain their excitement. Raising their false moustaches for a cigarette and mindful not to ignite their chest hair, they keen in their seats for a better view of the stage door. Enquiries as to who they are dressed as - Kevin Keegan seems a strong possibility - elicit a pitying response. \"We're Steve,\" says Mel Barlow after a short silence. She is an officer for the Cheshire police. \"Beaton,\" clarifies her friend Kate Davies, who has flown in from Majorca and will change her costume three times over the course of the evening. \"The Adonis,\" they say in unison. Backstage at the Embassy World Darts Championship, Steve \"the Adonis\" Beaton is warming up at the practice board. The 36-year-old from Coventry is only 20th in the world, but his resemblance to a 70s porn star - crinkle-cut mullet, heavy moustache, runaway chest hair - commands the sort of fanship that other darts players can only envy. Of the 32 players entered in this year's championship, only Andy \"The Viking\" Fordham has the right combination of swirly chin growth and thunderous belt-size to inspire this level of kitsch devotion (Mel and Kate are later to be seen in Viking helmets and wizardy beards). As the championship moves into its second week, so a small corner of Surrey succumbs to such excesses as are inspired by the immortal rejoinder, \"Let's ... play ... darts.\" The tenor of the darts world can be measured by a section of its governing body's website devoted to local clubs \"from around the world\", in which the world is represented by Harlow, Bolton and Bideford, north Devon. While other sports stars hustle for the Nike or the Adidas contract, premiere darts players eke out sponsorship on more modest slopes. John \"John Boy\" Walton, the top-10 player from Yorkshire, is supplied courtesy of Jim's Darts of Kirkby. Trina Gulliver, the women's world number one, is sponsored by Reeves Boatbuilders of Napton, Warwickshire and has appearances coming up at the Fox and Hounds, Daventry, and Ketton Sports Complex, Leicestershire. Martin \"Wolfie\" Adams, England team captain and a competition favourite, would like to thank the Towngate Inn, Lakeside, for its continuing support. The Lakeside country club can hold up to 1,000 people, the majority of whom, at Wednesday night's second round match, are arranged around long trestle tables groaning beneath plates of curry and pint glasses. The compere eases the crowd into a state of ecstasy with a joke that turns on the line, \"Sorry love, I thought you were a bloke\". While Beaton limbers up beneath the framed photos of former Lakeside acts - Gary Wilmot, Edwina Curry and Spit the Dog - the sound system pumps out hooks from Ricky Martin's Livin' La Vida Loca and Queen's Another One Bites the Dust. Beaton's opponent in this round is the number two seed, Raymond Barneveld, a 33-year-old Dutchman notable for his cleft chin and dynamic fans, who, on this occasion have travelled from the Hague dressed in \"Barney\" T-shirts and orange fright wigs. \"It's a very exciting game,\" says Andres Brugmans, 29, who comes from Barney's hometown and wears an alice band sprouting two silver orbs on springs. \"I prefer soccer, of course, but you go to a soccer match and you get your head kicked in.\" The only aggression to be found at Lakeside tonight is the camp, \"hoo-ya\" showmanship more familiar to the world of WWF wrestling. Unlike the grudging courtesies submitted to by most sports stars, the relationship between professional darts players is an extension of the pub banter they have marinated in since their first game. Roger Carter, the former world champion from Atlanta, Georgia, enjoyed a lively exchange with his British rival, Phil \"The Power\" Taylor this week, when Taylor logged onto the American's website, typed \"I AM THE BEST\" and logged off again. By 7pm, the Dutch TV crews have squeezed themselves into place below the stage and the crowd is poised to receive its heroes. \"Former semi-finalist of the Denmark Open,\" chimes the compere (Mel and Kate twitch to attention), \"Embassy World Champion, 1996 ... would you please welcome, Steve ... Beaton!\" Across the auditorium, hands emerge from packets of Golden Wonder crisps to beat the air. Beaton smoothes down his moustache and the game begins. While the match is undeniably exciting, the atmosphere of the event is generated away from the devoted fans at the front and in the rowdy mass of pleasure seekers at tables nearer the bar. When they got on the train at Neath, South Wales, this morning, Tim, Gavin, James, Gary and Chris opened their first cans of lager and drank to being 18. Tickets to the championship cost them \u00a34.50, the train ride \u00a340, the Welsh flag jester hats another \u00a310. \"Darts,\" says Gavin, straining to articulate his thoughts through the alcohol, \"is a national institution.\" He gives it a moment's foggy contemplation. \"Like Christmas.\" \"He's a twat, don't listen to him,\" says Tim. \"Darts isn't the Six Nations, granted, but the drinking is unbeatable.\" Rather surprisingly Tim is drinking Baileys, a girls' tipple I venture, before being nudged towards the pint of lager he is mixing it with it. They leave to be sick before the match is over. \"We're here for the mullets,\" says Andrew Macpherson, with heavy sarcasm. He and his friends - Ralph, Tim, Neil and Andrew - are down from Cambridge, deploying the defensive irony of students in late adolescence. \"Yeah,\" says Tim, \"we expected it to be full of sweaty men with big guts, and we haven't been disappointed. We're supporting Kevin Painter cos he's from Ipswich. Can you get Ray Stubbs to come out of the VIP lounge for us?\" Surprisingly in an audience as mixed as the Embassy's, the excesses of the young don't seem to infuriate the older and marginally more sober fans. There are no outlandish costumes on Bryan Huxted's table, but Pringle sweaters and muted match analysis. Huxted, a technical manager from Cheshire, is rooting for the flamboyant Barney. \"I like the characters,\" he says, indicating a group of youths waving inflatable hammers, \"but darts isn't just for the fanatic, it's for the ordinary person too. You get all walks of life here, not just the working classes - I don't mean anything by that. It's the tension, the atmosphere, the matches could go either way and any one of about 10 people could win it. Management has done a lot with this event. With the music and lights it's just like the wrestling.\" Huxted's great sadness is that after a fall out between organisers, the darts world has been split into two camps, with a breakaway Skol world championship held every year in Purfleet, Essex. \"There shouldn't be one in Purfleet,\" he sighs. His friend Steve isn't so sure. \"You'd get a lot of Essex girls there,\" he says wistfully, before being interrupted by a ground swell of noise so loud, it can only mean one thing. Up on stage, the Adonis is permitting the barest twitch of a smile to form under his moustache. The crowd, teased with the knowledge of what's coming, leap to their feet and wave banners they have prepared for the moment. The commentator, a thick-set man with army regulation hair, joggles on the balls of his feet and with fearsome projection, announces, \"One hundred and aaaaay-teeeeee.\" Over on the relatives' table, Nanette Beaton - who has spent much of the preceding half-hour clutching her stomach in nervous agony - leaps to her feet. Her husband, the Adonis, has indeed just hit a maximum score and unleashed a barrage of bluff entreaties to \"Come on Steve, lets have 'em,\" and \"Go on, lad, in one,\" and \"That's the Stevie, good man, come on lad, now's your time.\" Sweet-tempered Barney stands aside, smiling faintly, and within another quarter of an hour has won the match. The effect this loss has on the man described by the programme as darts' \"most enigmatic performer\" is hard to ascertain. Backstage in the moments after the match, Steve Beaton must pit all his wits against the gaggle of women, gold jewellery glinting, who fall noisily upon him. \"You did brilliant, I'm so proud of you,\" says Nanette, clutching a lime Bacardi Breezer, sequinned waistcoat winking in the bar lights. \"You should've had that game on a plate, Steve,\" offers another player's wife, in barbed consolation. \"I played well enough,\" says Beaton, expressionlessly. \"You have to hold your throw in your last set.

For dessert.</p> <p>\"Some people just start laughing when they read our menu,\" says Heston Blumenthal. \"They think it's a joke.\"</p> <p>Ah, but this menu is no joke: this menu is deadly serious. And 34-year-old Blumenthal is not the only one who thinks so. The Michelin inspectors have awarded Blumenthal's restaurant, the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, its first star. Marco Pierre White, a close friend and mentor, has called him \"an exceptional young man\", adding that he expects Blumenthal will soon win a second star. And the current Good Food Guide fetes him as chef of the year.</p> <p>Blumenthal is the Willy Wonka of modern British cooking. If his food sounds like the kind of food people politely like to call \"challenging\", then believe me, it's not, for the simple reason that you don't have to try hard to enjoy it. Blumenthal's are some of the cleanest, yet most intense, flavours you will ever taste. And the combinations of tastes are revelatory, blowing away all preconceptions about what one should eat when.</p> <p>In his tiny kitchen at the Fat Duck, I watch entranced as he churns one absurd-sounding ice cream after another (whole grain mustard; chocolate and thyme; bacon). Someone else is whizzing a frozen cauliflower puree through a machine that grinds it to a fine crystalline powder (\"to make it smoother\"). <br><br>Another is patiently monitoring electronic temperature prods stuck in venison fillets that are being very slowly pan-cooked and turned by hand every couple of minutes. On a shelf I notice a canister of liquid nitrogen that, I am told, is sprayed on foie gras to keep the outer surface cool so that it can cook evenly all the way through.</p> <p>At the helm of all this, in his spattered green trousers, strawberry blonde hair shorn to frame a genial face, Heston Blumenthal is calm. Despite the exotic name he is English, born in London and brought up near High Wycombe. Only when you speak to him does he display signs of the maverick genius he clearly is.</p> <p>\"Do you remember space dust?\" he asks me, a wicked glint in his eye. They don't sell it here any more but after laborious research Blumenthal has unearthed some in Spain. He bought a 15kg bag of it (the smallest amount available) and is now toying with the idea of putting it in ice cream so that, as they eat dessert, customers will suddenly experience a funny popping in the back of the mouth. \"But maybe that's a step too far,\" he says.</p> <p>Then he hands me a luscious-looking chocolate. I take it, raising my eyes in a questioning glance. \"Fermented pipe tobacco,\" he smirks. The chocolate itself is delicious (only the best ingredients, in this case Valrhona). The next flavour I experience is rich - prunes and vanillas. I say this but Blumenthal is still eyeing me expectantly. \"Wait,\" he promises. \"You get another flavour - a sort of hot kick.\" Nothing happens. Thirty slow seconds pass. And then, suddenly, it comes - a light, peppery punch on the tongue.</p> <p>I am delighted and Blumenthal is off, rattling out an explanation. The rate at which we register flavours varies according to the size of the food's molecules. The taste of small molecules bursts more quickly onto the tongue than that of large ones. This is why the chilli hotness took so long to come through. \"And in theory ...\" he says, \"in theory, if you took three different foods with different sized molecules and mixed them very gently together you could create an ice cream with three separate flavours.</p> <p>\"Anchovies, tomatoes and pineapple ... anything. And you'd taste them one at a time - one, two, three, with just a slight overlap.\"</p> <p>By now you will have realised that at the Fat Duck the kitchen is run almost like a laboratory. For all the firecracker creativity the role of science - physics, chemistry and psychology, too - is studied reverently.</p> <p>\"We don't believe in any of those 3,000-year-old housewives tales,\" one kitchen acolyte tells me proudly. Indeed, with the help of Bristol University physicist Peter Barham, who recently published a formula to determine how much gravy your roast dinner will soak up, Blumenthal has already debunked several myths. Heard the one about adding salting to the boiling water to fix the colour in green beans? \"Rubbish,\" says Blumenthal. Chlorophyll, the green pigment, is held in beans by magnesium. Magnesium is attracted to calcium, so if your water is hard and therefore calcium-heavy, out goes the magnesium and the chlorophyll follows.</p> <p>In Blumenthal's hands, though, plain old physics becomes a kind of alchemy that can transform base root vegetables into delicate sweetmeats and hulking sides of bacon into a soft, pale caramelly ice cream.</p> <p>And some of his techniques are breathtakingly simple. \"The inside temperature of meat is always fairly cool,\" he says. \"So if you want your meat to be cooked perfectly all the way through then you should cook it at this low temperature for a long period of time.\" The venison I saw being prepared in his kitchen is cooked according to this theory and is succulent and evenly coloured all the way through. And because of the low-impact cooking the protein chains in the meat do not contract and knit together. Abracadabra, perfectly cooked meat.</p> <p>He is always defying convention. Whole fish are difficult to cook perfectly because they are a different thickness from head to tail. And when you take them off the heat convection currents between the scales continues to cook them. \"I just wish we could cook the tail perfectly, take it to the customer and tell them to eat from the tail upwards. By the time the reached the head it would be perfect.\"</p> <p>Harold McGee's book On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen was an early influence on Blumenthal. And he has forged links with Firmenich, a Swiss company that creates flavours and scents and whose clients include Walker's crisps.</p> <p>\"They have extracted some 10,000 flavours,\" Blumenthal says, \"some distilled, some recreated. And they are constantly experimenting.\"</p> <p>So is he. One of his petit fours is a beetroot jelly - a sort of upmarket fruit pastille. \"It's funny when you watch people eat it,\" he says with Puckish glee. \"Tell them it's beetroot and they start to look nervous and don't know if they like it. But if you say it's blackcurrant they think it's delicious. In fact, beetroot, like blackcurrant, contains tartaric acid and that's what makes them taste so similar.\"</p> <p>He is fascinated with the psychology of eating, noting that a lot of what we taste is determined by our expectations. \"If I called my crab ice cream frozen crab bisque no one would bat an eyelid,\" he says.</p> <p>We pause for a moment and try to work out why some flavours are considered savoury and some are not but can't think of a single reason (apart from natural sweetness, though even that breaks down when you think about tart blackcurrants).</p> <p>Blumenthal believes that the way the palate interprets flavours is more strongly linked to the brain than people realise. The palate is trained from birth. One in eight people can't taste truffles properly, if at all; a bit like some people can't hear dog-whistles. But one of the flavour experts at Firmenich successfully trained his palate to find the taste of truffle by treating it to regular truffle hits over an 18-month period.</p> <p>Seasonal produce is so appealing because we link the taste back to a childhood memory of, say, picking brambles, and use that to create an environment around a taste, says Blumenthal.</p> <p>He is constantly thinking about the customer's experience, from the noise the restaurant door makes when it shuts to the taste of the palate-cleansing pre-starter on freshly cleaned teeth. And he wants people to trust him when they walk into his restaurant. If they don't his attitude is refreshingly down to earth: there may be no soft grilled chicken option on his menu but if someone feels very uncomfortable he's happy to rustle up something simple.</p> <p>It's hard to know what is more impressive: the vision or the relentless hard graft behind it. It has taken the Fat Duck kitchens 18 months to perfect the crab tuiles to a melt-in-the-mouth, brandy-snap like consistency. Each test involved reducing several gallons of crab stock to a few marmitey fluid ounces. And that was just the beginning.</p> <p>But Blumenthal never balks, just moves obsessively on to the next puzzle. In this case, his magic ingredient is maltidextrine, a carbon compound that looks and behaves like sugar but is not sweet. It is used commercially to thicken beef dumplings and gravies. \"I had an idea,\" announces Blumenthal grandly. \"Savoury candyfloss.\" <br><br>For his first attempt he unwittingly bought a fairground-sized drum that was several feet across.

Even after several years and the departure of original cast members, the triumvirate of Sunday-night dramas regularly attract almost 10 million viewers each. </p> <p>Nick Berry and Niamh Cusack may have left Aidensfield, Sarah Lancashire and Pam Ferris might have departed Skelthwaite and Dervla Kirwan and Stephen Tompkinson may have left BallyK (him in angst, her in a box) but the goings-on in those villages continue to exert a strange, almost hypnotic, fascination over the viewing public. </p> <p>\"At eight o'clock on a Sunday night, audiences have a particular need. When the week is in prospect and people are getting in gear, I'm not sure they want to be intellectually extended. However, I think there is an appetite for well-structured storytelling, strong characterisation and emotional engagement with those characters. These are essential elements for any drama but particularly those on a Sunday night.\" </p> <p>So says Jeremy Gwilt, and he should know. Gwilt has worked on the likes of Ballykissangel, Lovejoy, Bergerac and all three series of The House of Eliot. He's currently producer of BBC1's Monarch of the Glen. Gwilt maintains there's no special formula for Sunday night drama (rural setting, handsome lead, a serious story and a comic story running concurrently, for example) but acknowledges there are certain things which work particularly well. </p> <p>\"Getting away from an urban, gritty setting certainly helps,\" he admits. \"But there have to be good stories told too. It's no use having lots of beautiful scenery if your stories aren't up to it. You're not making a travelogue, after all.\" </p> <p>A fan of Where The Heart Is, Gwilt admires its storytelling and knack of immediately engaging its audience while being more entertaining than a Wednesday-night drama. </p> <p>\"If you flick into Where The Heart Is, within 10 seconds you're engaged emotionally. It's all about the problems people have relating to one another and the way those problems are handled. You may be telling stories differently than you would in a drama going out on a Wednesday night or a post-watershed slot - Sunday-night dramas need to be more about entertaining and less about social realism - but this need not limit the impact of the stories.\" </p> <p>Gwilt says for a Sunday-night drama to be successful, it must do two things: tell a self-contained three-act story which gives occasional viewers satisfaction, and, for regular viewers, develop characters and their relationships. </p> <p>Monarch of the Glen does both, but differently from its contemporaries. \"A show like Where The Heart Is is almost always driven by a story of the week and a guest character - say, a single mother who's dying of leukaemia and whose daughter's future is in doubt,\" Gwilt explains. </p> <p>\"By the end of the episode, her estranged husband will have been reconciled with his ex-wife and will have promised to care for his daughter. We know that the woman will die happy, knowing her daughter is being looked after. Meanwhile, the serial development of regular characters will continue apace.\" </p> <p>Monarch of the Glen, on the other hand, relies on its ensemble to create the story of the week. \"Our show has an underlying proposition - how this family is going to prevent itself from going bankrupt. We don't rely on guest characters for the story of the week. Instead, our characters generate a situation which creates a circumstance which has to be resolved.\" </p> <p>Unlike Heartbeat, which relies on a B-story involving the exploits of Greengrass, the show's comic relief, Gwilt says Monarch of the Glen is more comedic from the outset. \"Character-based comedy, I hasten to add,\" he says. </p> <p>Whereas dramas broadcast later on a Sunday night, such as Cold Feet or Clocking Off, can be viewed as treat drama for a younger audience - the last vestiges of the weekend's bounty before the week's duties kick in, the Sunday-night drama broadcast around eight o'clock serves a particular purpose. It is televisual Ovaltine, but that need not be a bad thing, especially if you're looking to be soothed. </p> <p>\"The labels that these dramas attract - safe, comforting, feel-good, unchallenging - I know where they come from but I don't think they're deserved,\" says Gwilt. \"It's to do with what Monarch of the Glen has in common with Where The Heart Is, Ballykissangel and Lovejoy. Ultimately, the dramas that are successful on a Sunday night at eight are the ones in which the characters have a positive view of human nature. Fundamentally, they are optimists. I don't think that's anything to be apologetic about.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Monarch of the Glen, Sunday, 8.10pm, BBC1.</p>",

Mr Mitterrand, nicknamed \"Papa m'a dit\" (Daddy told me), has admitted being paid \u00a31.3m by Brenco International, a company run by the accused arms dealer Pierre Falcone, but he insists that it was for legitimate consultancy work. Mr Courroye's expanding investigation, which has so far dragged in a best-selling novelist and a former leading adviser to the late president, now includes the former interior minister Charles Pasqua. His investigators have found that Mr Falcone paid \u00a3300,000 to Mr Pasqua's right-hand-man and senior Africa aide, Jean-Charles Marchiani. They suspect that the illicit arms deals may have been made under a Franco-Angolan agreement negotiated by Mr Pasqua and President Eduardo Dos Santos. French media have suggested the investigators also believe that some of Mr Falcone's money may have filtered its way, via Mr Marchiani, into the coffers of the RPF party founded by Mr Pasqua. Mr Pasqua, whose name has also cropped up on the margins of a separate corruption inquiry involving the French oil company Elf, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and says he has never met Mr Falcone.

In the Church Times, Ian Wells of Preston replied: \"As reader in my parish church, I have a stall with plenty of legroom, but when I am in the congregational seats in many other churches I find there is simply no room to kneel.\" In churches that had replaced pews with chairs, he said, \"any attempt to kneel results in your chair or the one in front moving over the bare stone with an ear-splitting screech. This is especially effective in Blackburn Cathedral. \"Not kneeling is not necessarily a sign of lack of reverence. It is often simple prudence ... [It] also lets you hold an order of service without the risk of using the back of the person in front of you as a prop.\"",

Along with a presentiment of disaster, this very unsettling event ushers in something surreal and hallucinatory: a sense that mad dogs and Englishmen of the criminal classes are going loopy in the midday sun - of a piece with Gary's nightmares and anxiety attacks played out in the featureless scrub. </p> <p>The role of Don Logan is perfectly suited to Ben Kingsley's gifts for control and stillness. There is something a little baroque and stylised about his approach - it is arguably a little actorly and unlike the behaviour of any real villain. But it is a very funny, intelligent performance nonetheless, beautifully scripted and acted, and Kingsley tops it off with a bravura show of pure sociopathic cunning when he is arrested on the plane for smoking, but gets away with it by claiming that he has been sexually harassed by one of the male stewards.

The public affirmation of his disability was made by President Bill Clinton's unveiled a bronze statue of his great predecessor on Wednesday at the entrance to the FDR Memorial in the centre of Washington. The 2.8 hectare (seven-acre) memorial site - a succession of statues and waterfalls - marks the achievements of the man who led America out of the Depression and through the second world war. Even before it was opened by Mr Clinton in May 1997 the memorial was criticised by disabled rights activists, who complained that the designers had connived in the deception which Roosevelt maintained throughout most of his presidency. He contracted polio at the age of 39 while on holiday on the Atlantic coast of Canada in 1921. He never walked unaided again, but until his death in 1945, shortly after he began his historic fourth term in the White House, he preferred to make public appearances in a car, so that he could remain seated, and to deliver speeches wearing leg braces. The main statue of Roosevelt in the memorial shows him seated alongside his dog, but draped in the cape wore to conceal the nature of his disability and the fact that he was sitting in a special chair. The protesters successfully lobbied the Roosevelt family and won the support of former presidents Ford and Carter for their campaign to have a new statue added to the site. \"This dedication represents a great victory for people with disabilities,\" said Alan Reich, president of the National Organisation on Disability. \"FDR's memorial finally will acknowledge his significant disability experience, which forged his leadership qualities - courage, determination and compassion - that successfully enabled him to lead the nation through the worst crises of the 20th century.\" Roosevelt is now unambiguously seated in a wheelchair in the first statue millions of visitors will see as they arrive at the memorial.

      "body": "<p>I wrote Requiem for a Dream while living in Los Angeles, and had been for l0 or 12 years, so I had no idea what was happening in the real world. But I wasnt writing about the real world, so I was in the right place to write about the images of the Great American Dream, and how its seeking and attainment will destroy you. </p> <p>There was also a physical part to the writing of Requiem. My physical condition colours everything I do though I am usually unaware of it. I was a merchant seaman during the second world war and was hospitalised with TB at the age of l8. I spent three years in bed and ended up having 10 ribs removed, a lung collapsed, a piece cut out of the other one, and had numerous complications, including getting hepatitis in transfusions. </p> <p>Perhaps six months before starting Requiem I was very sick with pneumonia. I didnt sleep for about five days or nights, but I think I periodically went into a short coma. One night my wife was awakened by two Spirits who had pushed the bedroom door open. One stood slightly in front and to the side of the other, and she had the distinct impression that they were male and female, and it was clear that they had intended to awaken her. They were about the height of a tall person, oval shaped, and shimmery with rainbow colours like soap bubbles in the sun, and were transparent. They indicated to her, in her mind, that I was dying, and told her if she didnt wake me up I would die, and she should get me to a hospital immediately. I was hard to wake up and was having severe problems breathing, I refused to go to a hospital. (I have spent four years in hospitals and dislike them intensely, to say the least.) </p> <p>My wife called a friend of ours who was a respiratory therapist and asked him to come over. He was a very mild man who never raised his voice, but he did after my wife explained the situation to him. He said, Hey, he weighs 80lbs soaking wet, what the fuck are you waiting for, take him to the hospital. </p> <p>Eventually I agreed to go to the hospital and I looked so bad the people in the Triage took one look at me and got me to an examination room and a doctor before accident victims. Before my wife finished the paper work, I was in a bed, which is truly miraculous. </p> <p>This is some of the background I brought to the book. I also brought a few memories of days gone by. While living on the lower east side I remember walking along Avenue C and seeing guys standing on the street corner, or outside a candy store, in the middle of winter with a wind chill factor of minus 20 degrees with nothing on but a thin windbreaker, their eyes pinned, sweating, eating a Snickers candy bar. I have often thought that the way to end the heroin problem is to take Snickers candy bars, and Chuckles, off the market and all the addicts would die of malnutrition. </p> <p>One of the huge problems I was facing was writing while living in LA. I had written two books while living out here, but this was the first one that would take me back to the streets of New York City. </p> <p>My initial problem, in writing my first book out here, was can I write in an artistic vacuum? I was accustomed to being in the midst of a great artistic community in New York, which was the artistic capital of the world. Los Angeles doesnt have any semblance of a community, outside of the ghettos, no less a community of artists, so I was really concerned when I sat down to start The Room. How do you write without any source of inspiration from the world you are living in? They say nothing is created in a vacuum, except, of course, politicians. So, I sat down and started writing at the end of l969, and in the middle of l970 the book was finished. </p> <p>I discovered something of great value in that experience. I discovered that in the six years it took me to write Last Exit to Brooklyn I truly did learn how to write. I also learned that the lack of outer stimuli and inspiration forced me to look within myself for those things and learned that though its true if you dont have it within yourself out here youre doomed, I discovered I do have it within me. </p> <p>So The Room, and The Demon that followed helped me to discover that I had what I needed, and, I believe, I always will in every area of life. However, I still didnt know about the music of speech that would be so necessary in Requiem. </p> <p>I write, in part, by ear. I hear, as well as feel and see, what I am writing. I have always been enamoured with the music of the speech in New York. That is totally lacking in LA. There is no distinction of speech out here except for the ex-New Yorkers. There is, of course, Black speech and Latino, but this town is so much more segregated than New York, especially when I was writing Requiem, more than 20 years ago. </p> <p>I had been living out here for about a dozen years when it came time to write Requiem and was afraid I had been away from that music too long to be able to get it on paper. But once I started the book the people came alive and I found I was able to \"hear\" them. So one of the results of all this was my discovering that I am more self-sufficient than I had believed. </p> <p>Requiem started as a joke ... I guess you would have to say a rather dark one. I wasnt working on anything at the time so I wrote a couple of outlines for films. I have no idea what they were. Anyway, I decided to write an outline for a dark humour film about a couple of guys who are strung out on heroin during a drug panic and decide to drive to Miami where all the drug dealers went for the Christmas Holidays and they get busted in Georgia, or some such place, and one guy ends up on a work gang and the white guy ends up losing an arm. It was called A Pound of Pure. </p> <p>I started the outline and was a couple of pages into it when I realised this just wasnt working as a movie outline, that it was a story. So I threw the outline away and started writing the story, but soon realised that it wasnt a story, but a book. With that realisation the idea of a \"joke\" disappeared. </p> <p>Writing Requiem was quite an experience. It only took me six weeks, including the re-writing. I have never written at such a pace. Its almost as if I was racing against death. Thats not how I felt, rather it was just the opposite ... I was feeling very much alive. </p> <p>At that point in my life Wednesday night was family library night. My wife and I, and our son and daughter, would go to the library, and our son, who was then about six, would have a pillow case filled with books and would drag it along the floor. Its an image that I hope will always be indelibly etched in my brain. I love it. </p> <p>One night my wife found herself walking down an aisle she had never been in before, and had no intention of going to, and her arm sort of reached out and her hand grabbed a book from the shelf. It was a book about Huna, which has been referred to as a Polynesian Psychological/Spiritual Religion. We subsequently bought the books available on the subject and studied them intently. </p> <p>At this point in my life I was a member of the Self Realisation Fellowship and was studying Raja Yoga. I thoroughly enjoyed these studies and diligently practiced. On Sundays we went to the SRF Temple in Hollywood as a family, our son and daughter going to the Sunday School. </p> <p>These days were idyllic. I had made some money writing a film for TV and we bought a nice home pretty much in the midst of the Borscht Belt of LA and I loved to watch the families walking to temple on Friday night, and Saturday. So all I had to do was write, I did not have to work at a job to support us. We didnt have any furniture other than beds and kitchen table, and were always talking about getting some when extra money came in. But every time that happened we bought a painting or a statue. We much preferred that to furniture. After all, we/re New Yorkers and we like to sit around the kitchen table and talk. On the surface it seemed like all our troubles were behind us. </p> <p>However, they are more than just Famous Last Words. As you can see, there were times of simple and exquisite joy, but there were also times of madness. Periodically I was a raving lunatic. There were a thousand demons in my mind and body and I could not exorcise them. It seemed like periodically the only relief I could get was screaming. It was a safety valve. The pressure would build up and I would feel as if I would burst and I would literally wrap my arms around my head, or bang it against the wall, or go for walks or meditate. Music, of course, would always soothe and calm me, but sooner or later I became a screaming lunatic. </p> <p> This problem was compounded by the awareness that my family was being subjected to living with a man who periodically had to lock himself in his office and try to knock the house down with his head. So I was tortured and tormented by the only answer I could find for relief from the demonic pressure within me. I love my family, and they love me, unconditionally, but my heart and soul were being ravaged. </p> <p>Oh, there is something else I should mention that was of importance. We had a garden behind the house and a lawn in front and a dozen rose bushes along one side. I love gardening, and working in a garden with a young child is beyond a delight. I remember how our son would lie on the ground and watch the worms, and whatever else was crawling around in the dirt. Gardening is something that can reanimate the wonder of life in a person, and when you are doing it with a young child its really exciting. </p> <p>I loved taking care of the rose bushes. It is very easy to care for roses out here. They ask very little of you and give you so much. In addition to the joy the roses gave me, neighbours would tell me how beautiful they are, and you could see the joy in their faces when they said it. </p> <p>All this is to say that there was so much joy in my life at the time, and the trouble I was experiencing did not have its source outside of me. It was truly an inside job. </p> <p>I wanted a strong relationship between Sara and Harry to emphasis the nature of the problem. Most addicts are people with families, hopes, dreams, the same as anyone else. Most addicts are not living on the streets, stealing for a fix. Most are middle class people with love in their lives who go to their doctor and pharmacist for drugs. It could be said that Sara's love was suffocating, oppressive at times, but it was also grounded in wanting the very best for her son. I ended up doing many things I am not proud of, but the responsibility for those actions certainly does not lie with my parents. They only wanted the best for me. Primarily they wanted me to go to school, get a good job, and be happy. They also inculcated, by word and example, a strong sense of morality. Yet I had to leave home at 15, having only finished the ninth grade. </p> <p>There is so much psycho-babble that says, \"Everything I do is somebody else's fault.\" I wanted to create people who were addicted, but were also just plain \"people\". Sara, Harry, Tyrone, Marion, do not stand out in a crowd, they are simply one of many who do the best they can to get through a day, trying to find a little happiness without hurting anyone. I believe this basic concept is a reflection of my life then and now. The difference today is I no longer have to destroy myself on a daily basis, but can do what I can to add something of value to Life and the World. </p> <p>The six weeks spent writing Requiem were fine. When I am writing I am totally focused on the people I am creating and all of my energy goes into that creating. The demons just dont seem to have a chance as long as I am working. Perhaps the Divine Energy that is within all of us gets channelled into that one area and the demons are powerless against it. However, they are just biding their time and playing possum, waiting for me to take a vacation. </p> <p>The truth is sooner or later I have to face my demons so I can discover how they can be rendered powerless over my life. This, I believe, is true for all of us whether we are avoiding them by writing or pursuing the American Dream. The problem is we are told, and taught, that there is no reason for us to feel bad, to be depressed. If these things occur in our lives we should take a pill and feel good again. Better living through chemistry is the motto of America. To put it as simply as possible, the American Dream, in all its manifestations, cuts my awareness off from the Divine Nature of my life, and all Life. I must find a way through the madness of my demons, and the American Dream to uncover that Divinity within me, and I certainly can not do that while pursuing the Dream or using the chemicals it prescribes. </p> <p>I have survived a lot in my life: success, failure, and boredom, more than once. I am 72 years old and am experiencing a commercial success once again. I have no idea what the ultimate outcome of all this will be, but I will survive it ... as a matter of fact I will prevail. </p> <p>\u0095 Hubert Selby Jr does not use apostrophes.

Then there's the shouting and the sirens from the street. My own noise is just as pervasive. It buries the rest and papers over my empty moments. </p> <p>There is never any real silence; I think it was John Cage who, when visiting a sound-proofed, anechoic chamber, heard two distinct sounds: the technician later told him that what he had heard were the sound of his blood going round and the electric hum of his own brain. </p> <p>The general noise level here is unexceptional - less, I guess, than in the Moscow apartment buildings where composer Alfred Schnittke, whose work is celebrated this weekend at the Barbican, wrote much of his music. His father-in-law would slumpin front of an ice-hockey game on TV in the same room; he worked next to a window above the street, with his adolescent son's rock music bulging through the room. Schnittke, apparently, never unplugged the telephone when he worked, even when, in the 1980s, he was always in demand. No wonder so much of what he wrote was full of interruptions. </p> <p>I imagine the harassed composer at work in the warrens of everyday Soviet life. So much music - scores for 66 films, eight symphonies, all those chamber pieces, choral works, solo piano compositions, an electronic work. Perhaps composers don't need silence, in the same way that chess masters don't need a board to run through their moves. It is all in the head. Artists, frequently, play music while they work: maybe it drowns out the the doubt. </p> <p>As a writer I find it hard to work to music. I need to hear the voice in my head, a voice I like to imagine is my own. It is not always the same voice, and a writer often needs the voices of others, whose cadences and tone shake you out of your own frightful monologue, or fill in when your own voice refuses to speak. Alfred Schnittke's replay of old forms (the concerto grosso, Gregorian chants) and of other voices (Beethoven \"mottos\", Mozart and Vivaldi licks, memories of Schoenberg and Shostakovich, tango fragments, the brass section that swerves unexpectedly into big-band mode for a few bars) go to demonstrate that for him the past wasn't all used up. </p> <p>Schnittke's phrase, \"the difference between the conceivable and the audible\", was his measure. There is a tension between what a composer can imagine and write, and what can be performed. He was at times happy to utilise what seemed like jazz improvisation - unscored tuning up as an integral part of a piece; or to ask performers to mime frenetic playing in performance while producing no sound at all - a \"cadenza visuale\", which, in recordings, is marked by the performer's exhausted sighs, sudden explosive \"Oh\"s and laboured breaths; or to orchestrate for an invisible piano (amplified, and hidden behind the stage). </p> <p>Schnittke's music is much more than accumulation, accretion, disruption and surprise. It may be filled with other voices and different styles, but he is never just a montage-mannerist; no more a ventriloquist than any other artist of our time. But inevitably no less of one, either. Doubts about the authenticity of a voice, are for him another level of play: what he called his \"polystylistic\" voice. </p> <p>You can't have Schnittke as background music. It demands too much attention. It isn't just the dissonant patches, the eardrum-flexing notes, the changing pace of it, the chase-music losing its way in the weeds, the alternating currents of anxiety and grace. It is simply too arresting. A passage of lush strings is systematically prised apart just when you are getting into it. Not simply because of all the switches, turnstiles and reverses the music goes through, but because Schnittke continually reconfigures our emotions, changing the pattern as well as the material, and our response to it. </p> <p>His music is not like Matisse's comfortable armchair for a tired businessman. Nor is it bracing in that muscular, angular, tough-love way you think must be good for you, but makes you wish it would stop. Schnittke's music is very carefully structured, paced, configured, for all its seismic faults. If his music is as much spatial as temporal - sculptural and filmic as much as it is atmospheric - then all those movie scores may have had their uses. </p> <p>His music is big, complex, erudite and multiformed, but you never lose the details amid it all - he is very good at details, at what I think of as glimpses, an eye flickering from the larger forms to something left accidentally on the floor. Listening, then, becomes an experience of transitions. Of phases, figures passing in front and behind one another, things in transit. </p> <p>Familiarity doesn't dull it, The familiar is a necessary part of his repertoire, the almost subliminal sense of deja vu that holds the shapes together. I don't think Schnittke cared whether what he did sounded \"modern\" or \"difficult\", high or low. He could be all these things, with enough space in hand to let things breathe, to keep them alive. </p> <p>Certain of Schnittke's spiritual preoccupations, such as his dabblings in the occult, in the I-Ching (like John Cage), in anthroposophy (though he said he could never trust a man with eyes like Rudolf Steiner's), culminated in his indecision as to whether to join the Catholic or the Russian Orthodox churches. Schnittke, half Jewish, his parents and grandparents atheists, a German Russian who spent much of his post-war childhood in Vienna, was a polystylistic man. He was led to the spiritual. His music, therefore, makes appeals to dark spaces, to mysteries, to enduring things, certainties. He was no reductivist, and more, I think, a synthetic than an analytical composer. </p> <p>He plays too, on our sense of perpetual expectation, our hunger for differences, for change and mutability. Where he leads is another matter. His unusual orchestrations (the piano, harpsichord and celesta opening to the Fourth Symphony, for example) keep us listening, and waiting, keep us wanting more. The mad plunges, the returns to a sober, almost sentimental lyricism, sounds creeping in like light under a door and the shadow of someone pacing about beyond: there is real suspense here. It has been said that Schnittke's music is both ambivalent and pessimistic. This is its unavoidable condition. I can throw adjectives and claims at it all day, but they just slide off the surface. He is seductive, awkward, unhinging. Schnittke's music knows it will be subsumed back into the world around it when it is done, back into what passes for silence. </p> <p> <strong>Notes from a life in music</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> 1934: </strong> Alfred Schnittke is born in Engels, Russia, to German parents. </p> <p><strong> 1946-8: </strong> Studies composition in Vienna - a formative experience of Austrian culture. </p> <p><strong> 1949-61 </strong> Studies at the October Revolution Music College, Moscow, and at the Moscow Conservatory. </p> <p><strong> 1958 </strong> His oratorio Nagasaki is condemned by the Russian Union of Composers.

This was a case of the US returning a favour owed from 1987, when Asia's strength helped to pull western financial markets out of the rut that followed the Black Monday crash. </p> <p>But this time, the two biggest engines of the world economy are at risk of going into reverse. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter forecast that US output will slow to 1.25% this year.

But a positive outcome is less certain than it was even three months ago. It is apparent that many Asian economies have refused to take the full course of medicines prescribed two years ago, making them vulnerable to a relapse.

This nightmare scenario appeared to edge a little closer to reality this week as Japanese government figures and some doom-laden private sector forecasts for the US economy indicated that a twin vortex may already have started forming on either side of the Pacific. According to the ministry of public management and home affairs, Japanese household spending slipped by 1.3% in November, crushing hopes that private consumption - which accounts for 60% of the country's output - could provide an engine for growth.

      "body": "<p>If you thought of the ideal elements for a band, Tompaulin would come pretty close. But you probably wouldn't imagine the chip on their shoulder beneath their winsome charm. </p> <p>They begin with singer Stacey McKenna waiting nervously for the guitars to be plugged in. She's a vision of well-studied 1960s style, from her Dusty Springfield eyes to her Mary Jane shoes. All eyes are on her, but she's not the only one looking for attention. As Jamie Holman strums his acoustic guitar, he is like Man at M&amp;S, lost in melancholy. </p> <p>When My Life on Buses finally begins, McKenna's sweet vocals are soft against the jaunty rhythm and end up battling against it. One hand cupped to her ear, she grimaces. Tompaulin soon settle into a brazen confidence, however, led by the light voice and strong opinions of Holman.

      "bodyText": "If you thought of the ideal elements for a band, Tompaulin would come pretty close. But you probably wouldn't imagine the chip on their shoulder beneath their winsome charm. They begin with singer Stacey McKenna waiting nervously for the guitars to be plugged in. She's a vision of well-studied 1960s style, from her Dusty Springfield eyes to her Mary Jane shoes. All eyes are on her, but she's not the only one looking for attention. As Jamie Holman strums his acoustic guitar, he is like Man at M&amp;S, lost in melancholy. When My Life on Buses finally begins, McKenna's sweet vocals are soft against the jaunty rhythm and end up battling against it. One hand cupped to her ear, she grimaces. Tompaulin soon settle into a brazen confidence, however, led by the light voice and strong opinions of Holman. Just as his songs reveal the mundane minutiae of life in a small town with both wistfulness and bitterness, his easy charm belies his bite. \"Everything's fucking yellow - not where I come from pal,\" he sneers in a swipe at contemporaries Coldplay. \"And we're not driftwood either.\" His devil-and-angel appeal makes Holman's songs stand apart from other loved-up guitar merchants filling the charts.

This time last year they brought us On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, which dealt with reincarnation. Now they offer a rare sighting of Hugh Martin's and Timothy Gray's 1964 musical version of No\u00ebl Coward's Blithe Spirit, which takes us into the esoteric world of ectoplasm. The show is about raising the dead, and yet this fossilised specimen comes only fitfully to life. </p> <p>A musical based on an existing play has to add a dimension missing in the original. But Coward's \"improbable farce\", dealing with a writer plagued by his dead wife's ghost and his living wife's jealousy, is complete in itself. The bland songs don't so much advance the action as impede it. In Coward's original, it is clear from the start that the hero's second wife, Ruth, ruefully accepts that her predecessor, Elvira, was more physically attractive. The musical kicks off with Ruth redundantly asking: \"Was she prettier than I?\" </p> <p>What the musical does do is open out Coward's play, so that we get to see the happy medium, Madame Arcati, surrounded by Bohemian acolytes in her coffee shop \"a few blocks below Sloane Square\". In the Broadway version this gave Beatrice Lillie a chance to display her legendary eccentricity. Since he lacks a precious Lillie, I wish the show's director, Raymond Wright, had taken advantage of recent scholarship. Apparently Coward based Madame Arcati on the lesbian novelist Radclyffe Hall, who often sought to contact the spirit of her dead lover. A monocled, besuited Arcati exploring the well of loneliness might be an interesting innovation, but here Gay Hamilton makes her merely a mildly raffish figure trailing diaphonous scarves. </p> <p>Only one number, Home Sweet Heaven, lifts the show above the amiably banal, and it's no surprise to learn that it bears Coward's lyrical imprint. Sung by Elvira, it envisions the empyrean as a historical melting-pot where \"we all sit round King Arthur's table, me and Freud and Cain and Abel\". For the most part, however, the songs never match the starched wit of Coward's dialogue. One is left spasmodically to enjoy Coward's faultless ear for camp outrage - \"A woman in Cynthia Cheviot's position would hardly wear false pearls\" - and perfectly decent performances by James Staddon as the haunted hero, Sarah Payne as a slightly too scrumptious Ruth and Kate Graham as a suitably ethereal Elvira. </p> <p>Since the Bridewell is into rare revivals, a second look at Sail Away, which Coward himself wrote, might yield more fruit than this valiant attempt to resurrect the dead. </p> <p>\u0095 Until February 3.

He seemed to be engaged in some very private argument with the choreography so that we never knew when his brooding intelligence would turn violently active or break into anarchic gusts of humour. </p> <p>As a choreographer, though, he had just begun to hit his stride, having fulfilled a handful of commissions and only recently formed his own small company. So when the Queen Elizabeth Hall hosted a retrospective evening of his work, it was not only to pay formal farewell to James, it was to let us assess what we had lost with his death. </p> <p>The dancers certainly gave his work the performance of its life. I had always found something sullen and clogged in Gaps Lapse and Relapse, which James made for Rambert Dance Company in 1998, but Wednesday's performance revealed not only how much better the piece looks on an informal stage but that, danced flat out, it contains more pent-up fury, frustration and joy than I had acknowledged. </p> <p>James's style was as logical as clockwork. He loved to set cogs and wheels of dance in motion so that the choreography coiled and jiggered tightly from one body to the next. In a work such as Minty, this structural intricacy looks almost neurotic as the dancers twitch frustratedly within the confines of each other's orbit. In Gaps, a huge volume of inventively shaped energy is built up within compact modules, and there are extraordinary moments when the whole thing threatens to fly apart with the sprung violence of a clock exploding. </p> <p>In Parts, James's intense structural world expands and contracts with more abstract calm. Tiny steps react against each other, like molecules viewed under a lens, then build into dance phrases that zigzag between dancers with magisterial force. In Cheese, James's control of his effects looks hazier, less theatrical; this was exaggerated by a live performance of the music that stole the stage from the dancers. </p> <p>Even though Cheese shows James in grungier mode, it doesn't diminish the fact that, choreographically, he was the real thing. The ability to structure a bunch of disparate human dancers into moments of pure rhythm, pure emotion and pure form is harder than it looks.

The attention to detail and intonation from players and singers alike was gratifying. </p> <p>Soprano Carolyn Sampson further confirmed her talent in Lamento della ninfa, her voice light, silvery and expressive. Richard Edgar-Wilson's tenor didn't quite match Agnew's for resonance, but they worked well together in duet, especially in Ogni amante. They were joined by the bass Antonio Abete for O mio bene, a ravishing piece cut at least in part from the same cloth as the final duet of Monteverdi's opera, L'incorazione di Poppea. </p> <p>The juxtaposition of the Monteverdi madrigals with instrumental pieces by his contemporaries Castello, Picchi and Marini served more than anything to highlight the fact that nobody else of that period could touch him for harmonic flair and breadth of imagination. However, they focus attention on to the eight players in Pinnock's ensemble. </p> <p>Pinnock himself was an inspiring rather than domineering presence. Seated at the harpsichord, he conducted only occasionally and for the most part the music seemed to flow out of a collective consciousness of which he was the focus.</p>",

The instrumentalists painted a spectrum of vivid colour, from the harsh energy of Walter Reiter's violin to the stillness of William Carter's theorbo. The attention to detail and intonation from players and singers alike was gratifying. Soprano Carolyn Sampson further confirmed her talent in Lamento della ninfa, her voice light, silvery and expressive. Richard Edgar-Wilson's tenor didn't quite match Agnew's for resonance, but they worked well together in duet, especially in Ogni amante. They were joined by the bass Antonio Abete for O mio bene, a ravishing piece cut at least in part from the same cloth as the final duet of Monteverdi's opera, L'incorazione di Poppea. The juxtaposition of the Monteverdi madrigals with instrumental pieces by his contemporaries Castello, Picchi and Marini served more than anything to highlight the fact that nobody else of that period could touch him for harmonic flair and breadth of imagination. However, they focus attention on to the eight players in Pinnock's ensemble. Pinnock himself was an inspiring rather than domineering presence. Seated at the harpsichord, he conducted only occasionally and for the most part the music seemed to flow out of a collective consciousness of which he was the focus.",
