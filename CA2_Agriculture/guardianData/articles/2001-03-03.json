      "trailText": "<p><strong>Roy Collins</strong> talks to Coventry's hope for salvation about games, goals and his dodgy knee.</p>",
      "byline": "Roy Collins",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>John Hartson knows he has caused much amusement in football circles in the past 12 months as a player with a most unusual passing problem. He is incapable, so it would seem, of passing a routine medical. </p> <p>Even Coventry City, who signed him from Wimbledon just over three weeks ago, could not give his right knee a bill of health clean enough to satisfy their insurers, which is how they came up with the ingenious plan to pay a \u00a315,000 instalment for every game he plays, rising to a maximum \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>But, if the rest of football has been doubled up in laughter, the disappointments of the past year have caused real pain for Hartson, most poignantly when his proposed transfer to Rangers fell through last September. In fairness he never hinted that he wanted to leave Wimbledon when they were relegated from the Premiership last season. </p> <p>He has been the victim of modern football's ruthless financial structure, in which the Premiership clubs commandeer a vastly unequal slice of the TV millions. He says: \"When Wimbledon went down, it became obvious the club's Norwegian owners wanted me off the wage bill. In the end they were panicking, thinking: 'He's failed three medicals, we're not going to get any money for him.' And Terry Burton, the manager was reluctant to play me because he knew I would probably be on my way. </p> <p>\"No disrespect to Tottenham but I wasn't too upset when they pulled out of a deal last April because I'd just had an operation and wasn't really ready for them. But I was devastated when Rangers decided not to go ahead. I'd pulled out of a Wales game to fly up there and there were hundreds of supporters to meet me. I said to my missus, bloody hell, I fancy this and I was so ready for a new culture, a new environment, that I agreed terms straight away.\" </p> <p>Hartson took out his frustration on some of the Nationwide First Division's whipping boys, scoring twice against both Sheffield Wednesday and Huddersfield on his next two appearances, which also said much for his professionalism. Earlier this season a move to Charlton was also mooted but the asking price of \u00a35m was so high as to exclude negotiation. </p> <p>To add to his frustration Hartson insists that the battles of his wounded knee have been greatly exaggerated. He says: \"There must be something that comes up on a scan which frightens the doctors but I don't think any footballer's knee would be a pretty sight. A heck of a fuss has been made about my knee but it's perfectly okay and I have more niggles with my ankles, thighs and hamstrings.\" </p> <p>He does not want to shout about that too loudly. But because of his previous disappointments he admits that, when he arrived for his medical at Coventry, he felt nervous. The compromise over money finally allowed the move to be completed and Hartson overlooked Coventry's precarious league position because of his respect for the manager Gordon Strachan. </p> <p>Hartson was robbed of a debut goal against his former club West Ham which was disallowed for a phantom foul but scuffed one in against Charlton last week which would have delighted Coventry, if only because such a messy effort suggested that the rub of the green might finally be going their way. </p> <p>He says: \"I'm sure Ian Rush got a few of those in his time. And I know I will score goals, I always have at all my clubs. I'm not one of those forwards who gets the ball in space and thinks, oh no, I'm not sure I'll put this away. If I get the chances, I'll score.\" </p> <p>Strachan said he signed Hartson as he wanted someone on his team sheet who frightens opponents. As everyone knows, Hartson managed to frighten even his team-mates with that infamous incident at West Ham involving Eyal Berkovic. </p> <p>He says: \"I probably frighten the gaffer because he's only 5ft 3in. But I take his words as a compliment.

      "bodyText": "John Hartson knows he has caused much amusement in football circles in the past 12 months as a player with a most unusual passing problem. He is incapable, so it would seem, of passing a routine medical. Even Coventry City, who signed him from Wimbledon just over three weeks ago, could not give his right knee a bill of health clean enough to satisfy their insurers, which is how they came up with the ingenious plan to pay a \u00a315,000 instalment for every game he plays, rising to a maximum \u00a3500,000. But, if the rest of football has been doubled up in laughter, the disappointments of the past year have caused real pain for Hartson, most poignantly when his proposed transfer to Rangers fell through last September. In fairness he never hinted that he wanted to leave Wimbledon when they were relegated from the Premiership last season. He has been the victim of modern football's ruthless financial structure, in which the Premiership clubs commandeer a vastly unequal slice of the TV millions. He says: \"When Wimbledon went down, it became obvious the club's Norwegian owners wanted me off the wage bill. In the end they were panicking, thinking: 'He's failed three medicals, we're not going to get any money for him.' And Terry Burton, the manager was reluctant to play me because he knew I would probably be on my way. \"No disrespect to Tottenham but I wasn't too upset when they pulled out of a deal last April because I'd just had an operation and wasn't really ready for them. But I was devastated when Rangers decided not to go ahead. I'd pulled out of a Wales game to fly up there and there were hundreds of supporters to meet me. I said to my missus, bloody hell, I fancy this and I was so ready for a new culture, a new environment, that I agreed terms straight away.\" Hartson took out his frustration on some of the Nationwide First Division's whipping boys, scoring twice against both Sheffield Wednesday and Huddersfield on his next two appearances, which also said much for his professionalism. Earlier this season a move to Charlton was also mooted but the asking price of \u00a35m was so high as to exclude negotiation. To add to his frustration Hartson insists that the battles of his wounded knee have been greatly exaggerated. He says: \"There must be something that comes up on a scan which frightens the doctors but I don't think any footballer's knee would be a pretty sight. A heck of a fuss has been made about my knee but it's perfectly okay and I have more niggles with my ankles, thighs and hamstrings.\" He does not want to shout about that too loudly. But because of his previous disappointments he admits that, when he arrived for his medical at Coventry, he felt nervous. The compromise over money finally allowed the move to be completed and Hartson overlooked Coventry's precarious league position because of his respect for the manager Gordon Strachan. Hartson was robbed of a debut goal against his former club West Ham which was disallowed for a phantom foul but scuffed one in against Charlton last week which would have delighted Coventry, if only because such a messy effort suggested that the rub of the green might finally be going their way. He says: \"I'm sure Ian Rush got a few of those in his time. And I know I will score goals, I always have at all my clubs. I'm not one of those forwards who gets the ball in space and thinks, oh no, I'm not sure I'll put this away. If I get the chances, I'll score.\" Strachan said he signed Hartson as he wanted someone on his team sheet who frightens opponents. As everyone knows, Hartson managed to frighten even his team-mates with that infamous incident at West Ham involving Eyal Berkovic. He says: \"I probably frighten the gaffer because he's only 5ft 3in. But I take his words as a compliment. When I see the names of Sol Campbell or Ugo Ehiogu on a team sheet, I say to myself, 'I'm going to have a game today, I am going to have a battle.'\" On his way back to London from training the other day, Hartson was approached by a Coventry fan in a service station who said he thought it was unfair that there was so much pressure on him. Hartson, though, believes the pay-as-he-plays deal removes all the pressure. It would have been far heavier, he says, had Rangers or Spurs made him a \u00a37m player.

On that basis Coventry have got a bargain. And after his experience of relegation last season Hartson might be able to advise his Coventry team-mates on potential pratfalls.

      "body": "<p>Gianluca Festa has had a traumatic week. Having tasted defeat under Terry Venables' stewardship for the first time last Saturday, the Middlesbrough defender pranged his flash sports car on the way to training. Now, with relegation fears shivering across frozen Teesside, he has the thankless task of informing his two young children that their summer holidays are not to be spent in the Sardinian sun but a stuffy classroom attempting to vault the unlikeliest of language barriers. </p> <p>\"They've been over here so long, the problem is that my children can read and write in English but not in Italian,\" he says, any adopted Boro burr lost beneath his thick Cagliari twang. As a rugged member of Boro's rearguard, he has worn his heart on his sleeve on 156 occasions for the Teessiders. Now, the 31-year-old former Roma and Internazionale centre-half betrays the nerves of a prolonged relegation scrap, worries heightened by that home defeat by Southampton. Charlton, in lofty eighth place and without a care in the world, visit the Riverside today. Festa, who experienced relegation in 1997, five months after arriving from the San Siro, will not tolerate a second failure. </p> <p>\"We simply must stay in the Premier League,\" he says. \"To play in the First Division is a nightmare. I have done that once and I don't know whether I could do it again. We must be positive and fight hard to stay up, although the threat is there if we don't pick up results, starting against Charlton.\" </p> <p>Next week's trip to Newcastle hardly promises rich pickings before Boro travel to Chelsea at the end of the month, briefly reuniting Festa with his mentor Claudio Ranieri. That union could have been permanently renewed. Having seen his form coincide with Boro's nose-dive to the foot of the table late last year, the Italian was dropped by Bryan Robson in favour of his \u00a38m recruit Ugo Ehiogu. Festa promptly handed in a transfer request. </p> <p>\"I said to the club if Robson did not pick me for the first team I would go away,\" he says. \"I have been very honest while I've been here, saying what I think, and that was a bad time.\" </p> <p>Ranieri, who worked with Festa during a three-year spell at Cagliari, was keen to recruit him as a replacement for Frank Leboeuf, but when the Frenchman's transfer to Monaco failed to materialise, so did the Italian's passage down to the King's Road. </p> <p>\"I was very close to signing for Chelsea,\" admits Festa. \"But Terry Venables wanted me to stay until the end of the season. It would have been difficult for him to find a replacement. The door is still open to go to Chelsea, but I really need to speak with Boro. Maybe I can stay here for two or three more years. I will decide what is to be done in the summer.\" </p> <p>His decision to come off the list last week came as something of a godsend to El Tel. Gary Pallister is recovering slowly from a back injury but is unlikely to feature until the Fat Lady is practising her arpeggios; Ehiogu may have scored his first England goal in midweek but he will spend the next seven weeks kicking his heals on the sidelines serving a four-match suspension after punching Wimbledon's Jason Euell. </p> <p> \"I felt I was important to the team even before Pallister was injured and Ehiogu suspended,\" he says, \"but that wasn't getting me in the side. But we have experienced players here. People like Alen Boksic and Christian Karembeu really care and want to play well for Middlesbrough. All our foreigners are all very good professionals. Nobody could doubt that. </p> <p>\"While I respect Robson - even if we disagreed on some things - and he is a very good man, things got a lot better for me when Terry Venables came here. He is very professional. I am nearly 32 years old but I still want to learn about football. Under him, I can. We have started from scratch and worked hard at every aspect of the game. He is like an Italian coach but you would expect that with his European experience.\" </p> <p>Robson spent this week on the continent himself attempting to prise the Spanish striker Dani away from Barcelona. Instead, the Teessiders are lining up Dean Windass who they hope to sign from Bradford for \u00a3;750,000 next week. The striker will have to wait to make his debut as he is suspensed for one game. </p> <p>\"I think it will be very difficult given we have so many players injured or suspended for the next few games,\" adds Festa. \"If we all stay together we can do well. We must show our strength and fight on the pitch if we really want to stay in the Premiership.\"</p>",

As a rugged member of Boro's rearguard, he has worn his heart on his sleeve on 156 occasions for the Teessiders. Now, the 31-year-old former Roma and Internazionale centre-half betrays the nerves of a prolonged relegation scrap, worries heightened by that home defeat by Southampton. Charlton, in lofty eighth place and without a care in the world, visit the Riverside today. Festa, who experienced relegation in 1997, five months after arriving from the San Siro, will not tolerate a second failure. \"We simply must stay in the Premier League,\" he says. \"To play in the First Division is a nightmare. I have done that once and I don't know whether I could do it again. We must be positive and fight hard to stay up, although the threat is there if we don't pick up results, starting against Charlton.\" Next week's trip to Newcastle hardly promises rich pickings before Boro travel to Chelsea at the end of the month, briefly reuniting Festa with his mentor Claudio Ranieri. That union could have been permanently renewed. Having seen his form coincide with Boro's nose-dive to the foot of the table late last year, the Italian was dropped by Bryan Robson in favour of his \u00a38m recruit Ugo Ehiogu. Festa promptly handed in a transfer request. \"I said to the club if Robson did not pick me for the first team I would go away,\" he says. \"I have been very honest while I've been here, saying what I think, and that was a bad time.\" Ranieri, who worked with Festa during a three-year spell at Cagliari, was keen to recruit him as a replacement for Frank Leboeuf, but when the Frenchman's transfer to Monaco failed to materialise, so did the Italian's passage down to the King's Road. \"I was very close to signing for Chelsea,\" admits Festa. \"But Terry Venables wanted me to stay until the end of the season. It would have been difficult for him to find a replacement. The door is still open to go to Chelsea, but I really need to speak with Boro. Maybe I can stay here for two or three more years. I will decide what is to be done in the summer.\" His decision to come off the list last week came as something of a godsend to El Tel. Gary Pallister is recovering slowly from a back injury but is unlikely to feature until the Fat Lady is practising her arpeggios; Ehiogu may have scored his first England goal in midweek but he will spend the next seven weeks kicking his heals on the sidelines serving a four-match suspension after punching Wimbledon's Jason Euell. \"I felt I was important to the team even before Pallister was injured and Ehiogu suspended,\" he says, \"but that wasn't getting me in the side. But we have experienced players here. People like Alen Boksic and Christian Karembeu really care and want to play well for Middlesbrough. All our foreigners are all very good professionals. Nobody could doubt that. \"While I respect Robson - even if we disagreed on some things - and he is a very good man, things got a lot better for me when Terry Venables came here. He is very professional. I am nearly 32 years old but I still want to learn about football. Under him, I can. We have started from scratch and worked hard at every aspect of the game. He is like an Italian coach but you would expect that with his European experience.\" Robson spent this week on the continent himself attempting to prise the Spanish striker Dani away from Barcelona. Instead, the Teessiders are lining up Dean Windass who they hope to sign from Bradford for \u00a3;750,000 next week. The striker will have to wait to make his debut as he is suspensed for one game. \"I think it will be very difficult given we have so many players injured or suspended for the next few games,\" adds Festa. \"If we all stay together we can do well. We must show our strength and fight on the pitch if we really want to stay in the Premiership.\"",

This week's snow has been cleared - but the East End Park club are keeping their fingers crossed that the weather will improve. \"It's poor at the minute,\" admitted Calderwood. \"It's very misty and very cold as well which is making things difficult.The snow has all cleared and the balloon's up on the pitch so I think it should be okay. \"We've got to hope that things improve and if it snows then that will flatten the balloon and then we're going to see a few problems. \"The danger is it's going to be very cold and it's very, very misty and if it was going ahead today it would have been hard to play.\"",

Before you ever try to make turns in powder, you should find a powder slope that is flat enough to allow you simply to go straight down. </p> <p>As you do so, practise <strong> bouncing up and down</strong> in a straight line, using mainly your ankles and knees (not the upper body). You'll get accustomed to how your skis rise to the surface and sink to the bottom of the soft snow as you bounce. It will become apparent that the timing of these movements has to be fairly slow - you can't rush your up and down movements in powder. In fact, this \"slow motion\" feeling is one of its attractions. </p> <p>You should also experiment with <strong> leaning from side to side</strong>, putting most of your weight first on one ski and then on the other - you'll probably fall over when you try this. You'll therefore very quickly understand that it's vital in deep snow to keep your weight evenly spread between both feet, and this applies whether turning or going straight. If one ski is too heavily weighted, it'll sink in deeply. The other, unweighted ski, will float upwards, snag on the surface, and flip you over. This is the most common mistake made by novice powder skiers. </p> <p>A common misconception is that \"you have to sit back in powder, to keep the tips at the surface\". But this will limit your range of knee and ankle movement, and will tire out your thigh muscles. Expert skiers just look like they're sitting back in powder, because of a phenomenon called <strong> tail sink</strong>. This simply means that the tails of the skis sink deeper into the snow than the tips. It's because the tails are thinner, and the bindings are always mounted behind the middle of the ski. So, even though skiers are standing perpendicular to their skis, it appears that they're \"sitting back\" in relation to the slope. When powder skiing, you should just try to stand normally over the middle of your foot, sometimes pushing down slightly with your heels to ensure enough \"tail sink\". </p> <p>To start <strong> turning</strong>, you need to time your bounces so that your skis are rising to the surface at the beginning of each turn, making it easier to pivot your feet to start the turn. And you should be sinking in to your deepest point as you finish each turn. </p> <p>Of course, all the other elements of short turns need to be in place, just as for on-piste short turns: solid pole-plants to set your rhythm, and you should be turning just your legs beneath you, while your upper body remains facing down the slope at all times. Many powder experts like to use a narrow stance - keeping your feet together can reduce the chances of your inside foot snagging in the snow. </p> <p>The modern trend towards wider skis has made powder skiing much easier. These new <strong> fat skis</strong> have allowed off-piste skiers to use a technique similar to on-piste skiing, keeping the feet wider apart, using less up-and-down motion, and carving big wide arcs. Like snowboards, fat skis have opened up remote areas of the mountain to those previously not skilled enough to venture there, and so <strong> avalanche safety education</strong> is now more important than ever. </p> <p>Before heading off-piste, check the current risk level of the snowpack (whether it is stable or unstable). Always take a local guide; he can at least avoid areas that have slid frequently in the past. Make sure everyone in the group has a shovel, probe, and radio beacon. Always descend or traverse steep slopes one at a time, so that only one of you will be buried if the worst occurs. </p> <p>But don't be deterred by these dire warnings - powder skiing is one of the most intense pleasures you will ever have.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Milly is getting used - sort of - to her hotel job in Australia, Sam has been having a go at being an Aussie surfer and Sue has been trying to avoid touts in Bali. Our trio, an 18-year-old gap student, a fed-up 28-year-old civil servant and a 51-year-old divorced mother of three, are now well into their six-month trips around the world on Bridge the World tickets. </strong></p> <p><strong> Milly</strong> in Sydney: \"That evening, I was serving at a wine-tasting conference, and the phrase thrown in at the deep end seems entirely appropriate here. Besides dropping a tray of wine down myself and some of the hotel furniture, nothing went too badly wrong, and I even got to finish early. At midnight. </p> <p>\"Another traveller, Amanda and I went across the road again for a drink. It was here that I met another of my occasional freaks. He had just arrived from LA, alone, and was keen to sit and buy us a drink, so we let him. Shortly after that Amanda looked down to see his hand in her bag, to which he commented: 'I hope you don't think I'm trying to steal anything!' We both did. We made excuses to go - he'd also said some other odd things, too, and people like that are best when you're a long way away from them.\" </p> <p><strong> Sam</strong> in Byron Bay: \"The breakers were huge and it was a real struggle to fight my way beyond them to the calmer sea. I bobbed up and down on the swell for a while before having a go at bodysurfing. I saw a biggish wave coming up behind me, swam hard and managed to catch it. I had a brief glorious sensation of being swept along. Then everything turned upside down as the wave broke and I was pulled under. I could only have been down for a short while but by the time I escaped, I was left flapping about in the shallows gasping for breath. </p> <p>\"Not one to give up that easily, I went out for another go. This time the force of the wave almost ripped my shorts off.\" </p> <p><strong> Sue</strong> in Bali: \"We found a deserted road that skirted the lake through a layer of solidified lava. Feeling free of sellers, we got out of the car to enjoy the views at leisure. Out of nowhere came a motorbike, complete with driver and collection of paintings. How do they do it? Radar, short-wave radios, acute sense of the smell of tourists?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Milly is getting used - sort of - to her hotel job in Australia, Sam has been having a go at being an Aussie surfer and Sue has been trying to avoid touts in Bali. Our trio, an 18-year-old gap student, a fed-up 28-year-old civil servant and a 51-year-old divorced mother of three, are now well into their six-month trips around the world on Bridge the World tickets. Milly in Sydney: \"That evening, I was serving at a wine-tasting conference, and the phrase thrown in at the deep end seems entirely appropriate here. Besides dropping a tray of wine down myself and some of the hotel furniture, nothing went too badly wrong, and I even got to finish early. At midnight. \"Another traveller, Amanda and I went across the road again for a drink. It was here that I met another of my occasional freaks. He had just arrived from LA, alone, and was keen to sit and buy us a drink, so we let him. Shortly after that Amanda looked down to see his hand in her bag, to which he commented: 'I hope you don't think I'm trying to steal anything!' We both did. We made excuses to go - he'd also said some other odd things, too, and people like that are best when you're a long way away from them.\" Sam in Byron Bay: \"The breakers were huge and it was a real struggle to fight my way beyond them to the calmer sea. I bobbed up and down on the swell for a while before having a go at bodysurfing. I saw a biggish wave coming up behind me, swam hard and managed to catch it. I had a brief glorious sensation of being swept along. Then everything turned upside down as the wave broke and I was pulled under. I could only have been down for a short while but by the time I escaped, I was left flapping about in the shallows gasping for breath. \"Not one to give up that easily, I went out for another go. This time the force of the wave almost ripped my shorts off.\" Sue in Bali: \"We found a deserted road that skirted the lake through a layer of solidified lava. Feeling free of sellers, we got out of the car to enjoy the views at leisure. Out of nowhere came a motorbike, complete with driver and collection of paintings. How do they do it? Radar, short-wave radios, acute sense of the smell of tourists?\"",

      "body": "<p>Driving down into Blaenau Ffestiniog in Snowdonia to walk the recently-opened Quarrymen's Paths is, for a flash in the mind, like seeing island Greece for the first time. Old women in headscarves and aprons sit on sunlit doorsteps gossiping as dark-eyed little girls skip to a Welsh rhyming song and a long line of cars stops as a couple of old sheep amble across the road in pursuit of a tourist dishing out crisps. </p> <p>Paradoxically, life for those old ladies' ancestors was harder when Blaenau was busier. In the early 19th century it was The Slate Capital. The beautiful, fine-grained, blue-grey slates, called Empresses, Small Duchesses, Broad Countesses and Wide Ladies, roofed much of the world. </p> <p>In the 1800s, more than 4,000 quarrymen blasted and then wrestled the slate out of the earth, where it had hidden for 400 million years since the Ordovician age. But since the 1960s, when it was cheaper to buy German, Spanish or even Chinese slates and mass-produced tiles, the number of working quarrymen has fallen to a few hundred. </p> <p>Unemployment is one of the highest in Britain, particularly since the ageing Magnox nuclear power station at Trawsfynydd went off line in 1991 to remain a blot on the landscape for 100 years. It is all very quiet in an area once deafened by dynamite blasting. There is an atmosphere of that heavy pathos felt in any place that has seen great energy enjoyed or squandered. </p> <p>Before I began the walk up to the Manod quarry, I stood in the town centre. Only a tiny red-and-green quarry locomotive, No 2207, and two wagons mounted on a slate plinth, hint at the history of a place where men worked for three shillings a day for the quarry owners - Lords and MPs who built mansions and even castles, on the fortunes. </p> <p>Blaenau Ffestiniog crouches below galleries, canyons and mountains of slate waste which drop down to the cottages' back yards. Blaenau is an oddity: an exclusion zone in the heart of the 840 square miles of Snowdonia National Park. It is so because it was classed an \"industrial development area\" when the park was created in 1952 to protect natural and wild places. Including it would have inhibited new industry, they said then. In the event, few came to stay. </p> <p>Ironically, it is this exclusivity that today makes it a unique place. It is not, by any measure, a bespoke \"tourist experience\", but to walk for a day on carpets of sphagnum moss, through lichen-spotted granite and in between slate blocks the size of a small house is sensational. On sunny days, the heat-waves bounce and shimmer over the slate mountains. Rainy days (and there are many of them) are probably even better. Then the photograph is a glistening monochrome, relieved by the liturgical purple of Rhododendron ponticum, the shallow-rooted weed that kills all competition and thrives in the grey slate waste. </p> <p>Gwynedd Council has established walking routes within the five valleys of the so-called Slate Valleys Initiative. I took one of the paths that were once used by the quarrymen going to and from work. It was not uncommon for men to walk 10, even 20 miles to start work at 6am, and the same distance home that evening. </p> <p>I went to the Manod Quarry with Steffan ab Owain, one of several erudite local historians and an authority on the quarries where he once worked. In 1968, when Steffan left to study and eventually take a degree in archaeology, he was a fitter's mate earning \u00a39 and 15 shillings a week for three weeks and \u00a311 and 10 shillings on the fourth \"big money\" week. </p> <p>The Manod is a cold and lonely place, 1,750ft above sea level. Its isolation caused it to be one of the most secret places in the second world war. The entire National Gallery Collection was hidden in its underground labyrinth in case Trafalgar Square was bombed, which, of course, it was in 1940. Londoners feared for their lives each night, and sheltered from the bombs wherever they could. But the Ministry of Works gave top priority to a nine-month building programme at Manod to ensure the paint ings would be safe beneath a 300ft thick slate ceiling in the highly unlikely event of Hitler deciding to bomb a lonely mountain in north Wales. </p> <p>Six vast underground chambers were installed for the treasures. Each had its own air-conditioning system, which ensured four changes of air an hour, and a constant atmosphere of 65F and 42% humidity. Five thousand tons of slate were removed from the moutain entrance increasing it from a 6ft square hole through which generations of miners had passed, to one 13ft by 10ft. This allowed masterpieces by Gainsborough, Hogarth, Constable, Turner, Monet, Degas and Rembrandt, as well as the remainder of the British, French and Dutch Schools, to be unloaded unobtrusively from lorries driven inside the mountain. The road surface under the railway bridge at Ffestiniog, was lowered two and a half feet so that the lorry carrying the vast Van Dyck canvas Charles I on Horseback and Piombo's Raising of Lazarus could edge underneath with inches to spare. </p> <p>The lowered bridge footings are still visible, but a locked barred gate closes the entrance to the Manod quarry. I peered through the bars into the darkness and was hit by an icy blast of air coming from inside the mountain where the six secret storage chambers remain. The paintings were kept under armed guard at Manod for more than six years. The air-conditioned facilities at the quarry were retained by the Government for much longer because of the possibility of another war, particularly during the Cuban missile crisis. </p> <p>The remoteness of the quarries meant that many of the men would have to leave their homes just after midnight on Sunday in order to start work at 6am on Monday. Some walked to work over trackless mountains, guided in the winter blackness only by markers of white stones. They stayed in the Barracks in the quarries for the rest of the week, only returning home at the weekend for clean clothes, food, warmth and Sunday chapel. The paths they took are all now recorded. </p> <p>The tumbling, dry-stone walls of the Barracks can be seen on most of the paths today. The lintels and window sills are marked with graffiti recording the \"Big Money\" pay days by sum, date and the day's weather. The Barracks were infamous in the industry: draughty, flea-ridden and damp. Men ate, cooked, and slept in double beds for warmth, each in as little as 200 cu ft - the equivalent of 30 people in a modern semi. For this they paid one shilling (5p) a month to the quarry owners. They were overcharged. At close to 2,000ft, the winters were cruel, but the men had to buy their own coal and water from enterprising peddlers. </p> <p>The average age expectancy among the quarrymen was 47 years, the slate makers 34, many dying from the lung disease silicosis. The rockmen who climbed down the sheer faces of cliffs attached to ropes and chains in order to place dynamite charges would have arms and legs torn away by a sudden fall of slate. The remains of the quarry hospital still exist today. </p> <p>But if the working conditions were horrific, the winter weather in the area I walked was worse. Winter lasted four months. Easterly winds blew so constantly on to one quarry, men called it the North Pole. When the snot froze in their noses the quarrymen would retreat to dress and cut slates in underground shelters called Caban Crwn. One of these circular dugouts with corbelled roofs of heavy slate slabs can still be seen on the Manod. </p> <p>At the top of the Manod Path an explosives magazine remains. It is an unremarkable, square structure except that it is built of brick and isolated from all other structures because new safety rules were enforced in the 1870s after a series of explosions caused by quarrymen living - and smoking their pipes - close to huge amounts of dynamite. </p> <p>The magazine is also the site of the Murder on Manod. Before dawn on a Monday morning in March 1898, quarrymen walking to work found the body of Mary Bruton, aged 33, lying in the snow next to the magazine. Police quickly arrested her lover, a hawker called Thomas Jones. He confessed to murdering Mary during a drink-inflamed quarrel. He said Mary had insisted on taking the wrong path over the mountains and they had lost their way. Jones was hanged at Caernarfon gaol that August. </p> <p><strong> Other attractions</strong> </p> <p>There are two local steam railways. The Ffestiniog Railway travels from Porthmadog to Blaenau Ffestiniog.

      "body": "<p>I am a Caribbean tenderfoot. I've been there a thousand times with Caribbean aristocracy like King Tubby, Prince Buster and Lord Short Shirt, but I've never dipped my toe in the perfect waters or been caressed by the constant breezes. Now I've tasted nature Caribbean style at her five-star best, all I can tell you is GO. Now. Jump on the next flight to Barbados and take it from there. </p> <p>I found St Vincent, off the track in the Windward Islands, with no major tourist resorts. Why? Black Sand. But the Caribbean means perfect white sand beaches, and the necklace of small islands, the Grenadines, that run down from St Vincent are bedecked with them. St Vincent's beaches themselves are black or grey or coffee-coloured. It's the volcano, La Soufri\u00e8re, Old Souffry, that's to blame, still ruling the island from 4,000ft with a sulphurous and cindery fist. She last blew in 1979. </p> <p>St Vincent looks like a children's fairytale island from the sea, hundreds of pointy, conical hills covered in green; a battalion of little volcanoes from a time when the earth was bubbling all over with them. For US$100-$120 any taxi in Kingstown will drive you up to the trailhead for Old Souffry, with refreshments and a trail guide to take you up to the crater. </p> <p>It was a wet day. Souffry was inside her mantle of cloud. The drive along the dramatic Windward coast was raw and wild, with the Atlantic surf lashing at apocalyptic black sand beaches. They'd call it a lovely day in Galway. Riverbeds, normally dry, were now full of people with their arms up to their elbows in the torrents. </p> <p>We stopped. People ran at us holding plastic bags. One pushed her gap-toothed smile and a polythene bag of black stuff through the taxi window. \"Nice. Chree chree.\" Close up, it was full of little wriggling things, like embryonic newts, some kind of Hell spawn. I backed off. Our taxi driver bought a $20 bag. </p> <p>Chree chree are tiny baby fish that appear after the rains. They are a delicacy and are cooked whole in chree-chree cake, favoured round Christmas. Delicate, sweet, savoury fishcakes, we had some later. </p> <p>Meantime, we drove up through banana plantations, dripping with sweaty rain and dangling thick with fruit, to the rainforest trailhead. It was a wonderful monochromatic walk up through the steamy tropical forest. The path is easy and well kept. Cracks like pistol shots ring out through the rain forest as huge bamboo canebrakes sway in the wind and bamboo bark splits explosively from the stem. Our guide was Erd, a local boy with a hip hop haircut. </p> <p>We crossed the first wide lava run halfway up where mists and rainforest open, a big party spot. Then, before leaving the treeline behind, comes The Garden, where the forest canopy opens out with bright volcanic flowers and butterflies. Out on the cindery top, Erd showed us Souffry grass that grows nowhere but here, is a surreal bright green and looks like a furry volcanic bonsai Christmas tree. Erd stuck a piece in his locks. </p> <p>Whether from the forbid den picking of the Souffry grass or out of sheer bloody mindedness, we were greeted with stinging horizontal rain, a deluge so violent I had two inches of water in my boots. </p> <p>We whisked up the sunnier leeward side to the Baleine Falls in the north in a motorboat. The whole island, every volcanic cone, is covered with a dense green blanket. Deep valleys and steep gullies packed with banana plantations and coconut groves slip down to the water's edge. Small fishing villages with no road access lie in bays along magical black and coffee-coloured shores. Dark beaches lined with coconut palms sparkle mysteriousl like black diamonds in the sunlight. By one of these obsidian strands Mrs Wangford learned how to snorkel. Watching underwater, I will take with me forever the image of her streaking down at 45 degrees through turquoise water to the coral stands with the princess parrot fish, dusky damsels, electric Blue Tangs and watchful moray eels. </p> <p>Baleine Falls are stunning. A short walk into a cut in the basalt cliffs take us into a moss- and fern-lined bowl with 60ft waterfalls cascading into a sapphire plunge pool of cool, sweet water. </p> <p>Inland, just north of Kingstown, is a valley of surreal beauty. With its rich volcanic soil, the whole island is green and fertile, but in the Mesopotamia Valley nature is exuberant, bursting out everywhere, valley floor to vertiginous walls. Over the glistening banana trees and rustling coconut groves tower abrupt green velvet cliff faces. A volcano falling into itself created the sudden and surprising depth of this valley. Looks like a tropical version of the cauldron subsidence in Glencoe. Even in the mist and rain, its magic isn't dampened. </p> <p>Toyota vans loaded down to their back axles with bananas creak into Kingstown. On Mondays the banana boat is in port. Suddenly the whole of the Banana Boat Song made sense and in a flash changed from pure cheese to a top work song. \"Day-oh, is a day-ay-ay-oh, daylight come and I wanna go home.\" See, they're packing the banana boat through the night. Look, there's the tallyman. \"Tally me banana, daylight come and...\" I was off. And Harry Belafonte, acceptable face of black culture to 1957 British suburbia, was vindicated at last. </p> <p>On a rock jutting out of the sea near Villa Beach is a large white cross. Below it a local landowner who owned much of this developed shoreline, is buried standing up, they say, to better see the sunset. His other eye, however, is still unblinkingly fixed on his old shoreline property. Two hundred yards offshore is Young Island, an exclusive and expensive resort that has uniquely white sand beaches unlike the rest of St Vincent. They put us in one of their beach huts with its back-to-nature no-telephone-radio-TV philosophy and its own outdoor shower, Jacuzzi and gazebo. Suited me, at night time watching the fireflies and listening to the astonishing tree frogs. These little critters, barely one-inch across, can belt out a good tune all night long. </p> <p>Over dinner on Young Island, the air was thick with phrases like \"offshore banking\". Wealthy people seemed to enjoy staying offshore. One night Sir James \"Son\" Mitchell came over and introduced himself. The only prime minister of St Vincent for 16 years, he had just stepped down to give way to a younger man of his choice. When I enquired after his recent resignation, he leaned forward and said reassuringly \"It's all right. I'm still first minister.\" Hearing we were going to Bequia, he brought me some brochures for his own hotel there, the Frangipani. A hands-on politician in a family-run country. Recently, the nice lady who runs Young Island married the master brewer who makes the ultra-strong Guinness in St Vincent. The brewer's name is, of course, Mr Porter. </p> <p>I heard it first stepping into the Paradise Inn. Instead of reggae, it was Patsy Cline wanting me to Pick Her Up on My Way Down. Turns out this is Cross Country Radio, the local St Vincent Country station. Thick West Indian accents introduce George Jones and Merle (H)'aggard. Like in Africa and all the Caribbean, Country is popular in the Grenadines. </p> <p>I shook out my breadfruit print Hawaiian shirt for a pilgrimage to Kingstown's Botanic Gardens, the oldest in the Caribbean. A photo-opportunity awaited by the first breadfruit tree, grown from the original brought by Captain Bligh from Tahiti in 1793. The gardens were beautiful but the breadfruit tree unremarkable. I still posed. The Cannonball Tree, however, had a forest of woody tendrils, like Medusa's serpentine locks, growing horizontally out of the trunk. Inside, cannonballs burst into the unlikeliest waxy pink flowers, explosions of colour burning out of the knotted mass of tendrils. Some wonderful trees scrape the sky here. </p> <p> <strong> Bequia</strong> </p> <p>The sailing in the Grenadines is the best in the world bar none, say the yachties. Reliable north-easterly winds and beautiful islands with great anchorages all help. We sailed gloriously over to the next island Bequia (Beck-way) with Johnny Olivierre. His is from a big Bequia family of seafarers and whalers. Bequia's whaling tradition goes way back and they still take one whale a year. Johnny's uncle was Athneal Olivierre, the last harpoonist to kill a whale singlehandedly with a handheld harpoon. A small whaling museum is run by cousin Harold. </p> <p>Bequia is a delight, rustic, hilly and green, laid-back, with colourful houses and Rasta shacks on the golden beaches. A dream island, </p> <p>Port Elizabeth has all you can need. I like Lower Bay, a friendly, down-home neighbourhood with beautiful beaches. Rastas do nice juice, Theresa's is jumping and you get a good fish dinner at Keegan's. A place to Lively Up Yourself. </p> <p>This island has wonderful beaches, dramatic surf on the Atlantic side, calm lagoons on the Caribbean, with fine snorkelling and diving. Harold Macmillan once rented a house on Bequia. He first thought \"You've never had it so good\" living there. He was right. I haven't. </p> <p><strong> Way to go</strong></p> <p>Hank Wangford flew with Virgin Atlantic (01293 747747) to Barbados and with Mustique Airways (001 784 458 4380, <a href=\"http://www.mustique.com\">www.mustique.com</a>) to St Vincent for \u00a3697 plus tax. </p> <p>Young Island (+784 458 4826, <a href=\"http://www.youngisland.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.youngisland.com</a>) beach hut with Jacuzzi costs US$530 per night. Paradise Inn (+784 457 4795) costs US$60 - $90 for a double room. Frangipani Hotel: (+784 458 3255) costs US$ 40 - $150.

      "body": "<p>From beautiful coastal walks, crumbling castles and two of Britain's 18 World Heritage sites to some of the best surfing, a wealth of outdoor activities and one or two slightly more unusual pursuits like bog snorkelling, Wales packs a lot in for such a small country. Here are some holiday suggestions. </p> <p><strong> Walks</strong></p> <p>As well as Offa's Dyke Path, there are nine more long-distance walks and by the time the weather picks up hopefully the foot and mouth restrictions will be over. The newly-established <strong>Taff Trai </strong> links Cardiff with Brecon, while the <strong>Pembrokeshire Coast Path</strong> takes the walker 186 miles along some of the most beautiful and varied coastline in Britain. <strong>Glyndwr's Way</strong> retraces the 128-mile route taken by Owain Glyndwr through the heart of Wales to gather his army against the English in the first years of the 15th century; and the <strong>Wye Valley Walk</strong> takes ramblers along 144 miles of water meadow and wooded scarp, which provided inspiration to Wordsworth and Turner. The <strong>Dyfi Valley Way</strong> is a fairly recent creation that marks 108 miles of rugged countryside between Bala Lake and Borth on the coast of Cardigan Bay. </p> <p>The other walks are the <strong>North Wales Path</strong>, the <strong>Cambrian Way</strong>, the <strong>Usk Valley Way</strong> and finally the 210-mile <strong>Severn Valley Way</strong>, one of the longest way-marked trails in the UK. There are plenty of youth hostels along these routes; call The Ramblers' Association on 01978 855148, or visit <a href=\"http://www.ramblers.org.uk\">www.ramblers.org.uk</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.totalwales.com\">www.totalwales.com</a> for more information. </p> <p><strong> Nature</strong> </p> <p>Nature lovers can get away from it all on <strong>Skokholm Island</strong>, 30 minutes by boat off the Pembrokeshire coast. The first bird observatory in the British Isles, Skokholm is a National Nature Reserve with no electricity or running water and accommodation for only 15 people. Birds on the island include Razorbill, Guillemot, Puffin and many more, and the surrounding seas are home to porpoise, dolphins and grey seal. Three-night or seven-night full-board breaks with the Wildlife Trust (01239 621212) cost \u00a3159 or \u00a3269. </p> <p>The brand new <strong>National Botanic Garden of Wales</strong> is a \u00a343.4 million garden dedicated to science, education and leisure, with a strong emphasis on the study and sustaining of endangered plants. The gardens centre on a vast Norman Foster-designed glasshouse with a Mediterranean climate; plantings inside reflect the bio-diversity in regions around the world that have the same weather conditions. Outside, in the Temperate Woods of the World section, a series of one-acre plots are dedicated to regions that share the Towy Valley's wet but mild climate, as well as an area dedicated to organic farming. Open 10am-4.30pm, Mon-Sun, \u00a36.50 adults/\u00a33 children/\u00a316 families. Middleton Hall, Llanarthne, Carmarthenshire (01558 667148). </p> <p><strong> Action</strong> </p> <p>The small spa town of <strong>Llanwrtyd Wells</strong> plays host to all manner of quirky events, including the Man versus Horse marathon on June 2, a 23-mile race in which runners, horses and three-man relay teams compete against each other. Sponsored by William Hill, if a single runner beats a horse this year he/she will pocket \u00a322,000. The World Bog Snorkelling Championships is on August 22, when competitors have to swim two lengths across a 50m bog with flippers and a snorkle. Otherwise, try your hand at the less strenuous Real Ale Wobble in conjunction with Mid-Wales Beer Festival in November - contestants cycle a 15-, 25- or 40-mile off-road course, with free beer at all the checkpoints. For more information, call 01591 610236. The tourist information centre, on 01591 610666, has details of accommodation. </p> <p><strong> Llangennith</strong>, on the Gower Peninsula, is one of Britain's mellowest surfing beaches with relatively consistent Atlantic rollers year round; no competition, no flashy labels, just a huge expanse of sand attracting everyone from beginners to experts. The Welsh Surfing Federation Surf School (01792 386426) operates from Llangennith and the local surf shop is run by Welsh surf legend Pete Jones. </p> <p><strong> Adventure</strong><br> </p> <p>Step back in time on a week-long break travelling 50 miles through the <strong>Brecon Beacons</strong> in an authentic four-berth Gypsy caravan. A quick lesson on harnessing and driving the horse in the small hamlet of Llangorse, and you're on your way, through Talgarth then on to Hay-on-Wye, where you follow the river upstream to Llanstephan with overnight stops in fields along the way.

Mid-week and weekend breaks are also available. </p> <p>Take to the water on a barge holiday sailing through the <strong>Monmouth and Brecon Canal</strong>, built in 1812 to transport iron ore from Blaenavon to Newport through the Brecon Beacons National Park. The canal is ideal for beginners: its six locks and 375-yard tunnel are easily navigable and the purpose-built narrowboats are handled by two people. Each boat is equipped with a library of books on the history of the canal, the park and places of interest in South Wales. Three-night breaks with Beacon Park Boats (01873 858 277) cost from \u00a3300. </p> <p><strong> Relaxation</strong> </p> <p>Snuggle down for the weekend, choosing from Manorbier Castle, a Norman castle complete with drawbridge and private gardens; St Anne's Head lighthouse near the village of Dale; The Cabin on Tenby harbour, featured in the Jude Law film Basil; a cottage with gas lamps on the cliffs at Strumble Head or a converted 18th-century chapel in Lower Town in Fishguard, where Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton filmed Under Milk Wood.

Best known as The Village in the 1960s cult television series, Portmeirion was the brainchild of eccentric architect Clough Williams-Ellis, whose idea was to build a perfect village that enhanced rather than blended in with its surroundings. Endangered buildings from all over Britain and abroad were pulled down, transported and rebuilt in every conceivable style - the village houses a Jacobean town hall, Siamese figures on Ionic columns, Neoclassical collonades from Bristol and a Pantheon, all set around a Mediterranean piazza. In the summer, more than 3,000 visitors a day come to ogle - so, go early spring and see the village at its surreal best. </p> <p>Accommodation is in the Victorian Hotel Portmeirion, or the self-catering cottages in the village, which sleep between two and eight. Prices for these start from \u00a3106pp half- board. The most atmospheric of the cottages get booked up well in advance, especially during The Prisoner weekend convention in September.

A once derelict slate quarry has become home to an almost entirely self-sufficient community generating 80% of its own power from the wind, sun and water. From the start, the idea was to showcase sustainable technology; houses were to demonstrate energy-saving ideas and to show how homes can be built with local materials and minimal skills. The centre offers a wide range of residential courses including Eco Renovation, Family Birdwatching, Yurt Structures and Feltmaking, Introduction to Renewable Energy Technologies, Working with Willow and The Art of Composting.

Seventeen people lived on the site in as authentic a manner as possible, carrying out daily tasks such as grinding corn for flour, carrying water and working iron. Open April 1- November, 10am-5pm, \u00a32.80/\u00a31.90/ \u00a37.50.

During the 19th century, the Blaenavon works grew to be one of the largest in Britain; the ironworks are now open to the public and visitors to the Big Pit get a fascinating insight into the experience of a miner's work and life as they are taken 300ft down into the dark pit where child workers were once paid two pence for a six-day week, with one penny taken from their wages to pay for the cost of candles.

It had everything - a swimming pool, nature reserve, horse-riding, and, of course, the beach at Swanage. It's a wonderful beach with acre after acre of gorgeous yellow sand and nearby caves you can visit on a gloomy day. You wouldn't see the kids from dawn till dusk - there was so much for them to do. I'd just read and sleep and read. One of my sons learnt to fish there - he caught his first sea bass there. The hotel cooked it up for us and we sat and ate like royalty.

      "body": "<p>In 1995, the Queen conferred upon St David's a status it had long considered itself to have anyway - that of being a city. In return for this, she was given her own seat in the cathedral and this community of little more than 2,000 people, perched atop one of the wildest peninsulas in Wales, could now justify its claim to be the smallest city in Britain. </p> <p>St David's is also the only city in Britain's only coastal National Park, as well as being the only city in Britain to have just one \"real\" pub, the Farmer's Arms. For visitors this is no bad thing, as it guarantees that you'll always be at the centre of the city's low-key scene, at least until the summer beach parties start after chucking out time - and St David's is a place for outdoor action rather than nightlife anyway. </p> <p>It's probably an inheritance of the community's deeply religious past that it has so few places to knock back a pint (the nearby village of Solva, for instance, has four pubs despite being half the size), for in terms of religion St David's has always fought well above its weight. St David, the patron saint of Wales, was born at nearby St Non's Bay in the 6th century. </p> <p>The beautiful 12th-century cathedral that bears his name, made of warm purple and gold-flecked stone, is tucked in a hollow beside the sparkling River Alun, almost out of sight. On the other bank is the Bishop's Palace, built around the turn of the 14th century and now a classic old ruin in which Shakespeare's plays are performed on summer evenings. </p> <p>But it's more often the impressive coastline of the windswept St David's Peninsula that attracts visitors - surfers, climbers, kayakers and hikers who come in ever-increasing numbers to get their kicks in one of Britain's finest outdoor playgrounds. </p> <p>The focal point for all the action is Whitesands Bay. The beach regularly receives rave reviews in travel guides, as does the surf. Don't be fooled though, for while the beach is undoubtedly as good as they get (although it ain't white), the quality of the waves is grossly over-rated - good for beginners, uninspiring for experienced surfers. In summer, the waves can also get crowded. </p> <p>The short stretch of the Pembrokeshire Coast Path from Whitesands to St David's Head is one of the most popular legs of the 299km National Trail, providing wonderful views out to the craggy islands and islets dotting the sparkling but treacherous offshore waters. Evocatively-named rocks and reefs, such as the Hats and Barrels and the Bishops and Clerks were, and to an extent still are, a serious threat to vessels passing through the swirling tidal races where the Irish Sea pours around St David's Head. </p> <p>Take a walk south from Whitesands to the low cliffs above Ramsey Sound and you can see, just a few feet beneath you, the waters coursing through the sound like a huge river in flood. You may also just make out the roar from the Bitches rapids across the water by Ramsey Island. Although now a playground for expert kayakers and jetboaters, the rapids are still not to be messed with - having tried to surf them once and only succeeding in being briefly sucked down into one of their many whirlpools, I know first hand that these rocks and their tidal flows live up to their name. </p> <p>It's not all death or glory along the coastline though. Visit out of season and you can enjoy an idyllic coastal walk, as you watch choughs, gulls and other coastal birds flinging themselves aloft in the sea breeze. Look down from the cliffs and you may well spot a grey seal staring back at you from the translucent green waters. </p> <p>If you want to avoid the crowds of Whitesands and Caerfai beach (just two-minutes' drive south of St David's and especially popular with young families), there are plenty of easily-discovered smaller bays and coves around the peninsula where you can swim, snorkel or sunbathe in relative seclusion. </p> <p>The city is best explored in the evening, when there are fewer people on the narrow footpaths and fewer cars on the narrow streets. Small though it is, there's easily enough to fill a pre-pint half hour, from an eclectic selection of art galleries to gift shops, surf shops and coffee shops. And if shopping fills you with the kind of dread mariners once had of the Bitches, take a stroll from Cross Square down through the 13th-century Tower Gate and into Cathedral Close, where you can see the cathedral at its best in the evening sunlight. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong></p> <p>There's a reasonable selection of accommodation available in the city, best booked in advance in summer. <strong> The Old Cross</strong>, Cross Square (01437 720387), is in the centre of the city and has en-suite rooms for \u00a335 per person. <strong> Y Gorlan</strong>, Nun St (01437 720837) is located on the road out to Whitesands, with ensuite rooms for \u00a322pp. <strong> Pen Albro B&amp;B </strong> (01437 721865) is a popular and friendly spot next to the Farmer Arms on Goat Street, with rooms from \u00a314.50pp. </p> <p>One of the best campsites is <strong> Caerfai Farm </strong> (01437 720548) above Caerfai Bay, a 15-minute walk from town, and there's also a campsite near Whitesands Bay (01437 720245). </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong></p> <p>There's not a great deal to choose from, the city being so small. <strong>Morgan's Brasserie</strong>, 20 Nun St (01437 720508) is good for locally-caught fish, while <strong>The Cartref</strong>, Cross Square (01437 720422), has reasonably-priced local dishes. <strong> The Farmers Arms</strong>, Goat St (01437 720328), does decent pub grub but until 8.30pm. </p> <p>One of the best restaurants in the area is <strong> The Old Pharmacy</strong> (01437 720005), in Solva, three miles east of St David's. </p> <p><strong> Things to do</strong></p> <p>Climb to the top of Carn Llidi, the 181m high crag above Whitesands, for great views.

His life, including his incestuous relationship with his half-sister, his denunciation by Lady Caroline Lamb as \"mad, bad and dangerous to know\", and the heroism of his fighting alongside the Greeks in their war of independence, transfixed contemporaries. He cultivated his heroic (or anti-heroic) image in his writing: \"Seek out - less often sought than found -/A soldier's grave, for thee the best;/Then look around, and choose thy ground/ And take thy rest\" he counselled himself, in lines written at Missolonghi three months before his death from fever. </p> <p><strong> Distinguishing features:</strong> This is the poet as man of action, far from the wilting melancholy of the other Romantics in the same room at the National Portrait Gallery.

Ronald Reagan built an eight-year presidency on producing the illusion of a warm glow across America. With Gordon Brown's mammoth piggy-bank ready for Budget tax-cuts (or tax \"refunds\" in the clever new Americanism), Tony Blair was planning to have the electorate feeling about as good as is possible without the door-to-door distribution of illegal substances.</p> <p>And yet suddenly Blair faces a feel-bad Britain.

Ronald Reagan built an eight-year presidency on producing the illusion of a warm glow across America.

In this parliament's round of selections, the party has encouraged constituencies to try to ensure there are at least two men and two women on every shortlist. The party general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, told the Labour women's conference in Glasgow a fortnight ago that she would be pressing for a change to the law after the election to allow parties to reinstate women-only shortlists, or other forms of positive discrimination. The party's women fared much better in the Welsh and Scottish assemblies where they got 50% representation largely by twinning seats. The Fawcett Society said experience in Europe showed that only positive discrimination ensured women got a fair share of seats. France has just passed a law making state support dependent on political parties running positive discrimination for selection. Whatever its own difficulties, Labour has also calculated that it will take the Conservatives at their current rate of progress selecting women candidates 100 years to reach the number that Labour has. Candidates selected by Labour include Matthew Syed, an Olympic competitor at table tennis. The youngest prospective candidate is a 23-year-old Oxford educated barrister, James Norman. He is standing in the solid Tory seat of Surrey Heath, represented by Nick Hawkins. John O'Farrell, the Guardian columnist and author of Things Can Only Get Better, is representing Labour in Maidenhead against the shadow education secretary, Theresa May. The shadow environment minister, Damien Green, is facing a challenge from a one-time City banker and Financial Times journalist, John Adams.",

      "body": "<p>Years ago, not long after I first arrived in Britain, I remember wandering into a bookshop and being startled to find a section devoted to walking guides. Where I came from we didn't walk much, but at least we could do it without instructions. Only gradually did I come to realise that in Britain there are two types of walking - the everyday sort with which I was familiar and a more earnest type involving sturdy boots, maps, rucksacks and, yes, walking guides. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, I had my first encounter with members of this latter group. Early on a cold, wet Sunday morning, just outside Hay-on-Wye, I passed dozens of people kitting up to take to the hills. Across the way dozens more could be seen vanishing into the mists clinging to a sheer eminence called Hay Bluff. Never having seen anything like this before - people venturing out in dire weather to clamber up steep hills in the belief that there could be some pleasure in it - I watched for some minutes, and concluded that they were suffering a sort of derangement. </p> <p>I was right, of course. Walkers are deranged. But with the passage of time I also learned that it was a derangement worth having. Rambling is wonderful. It's invigorating, it's absurdly healthy, it costs next to nothing and there is no better way to see and luxuriate in the subtle and infinite beauty of nature. </p> <p>So when I was asked if I would care to unfurl my lower limbs and see if they still possessed life enough to convey me through one of the most beguiling corners of Britain, I was all ears. When I further learned that my route was to be the ancient linear wonder that is Offa's Dyke - the very path on which I saw those people at Hay Bluff years before - I agreed with alacrity. Not until a moment later was I struck by the thought that these were the very hills that had for centuries thwarted Romans and Anglo-Saxons alike, and allowed the Welsh to maintain their separate identity. </p> <p>\"It's not too hard, is it?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Oh, no,\" said Roger Thomas, the amiable and persuasive editor of A View of Wales, before adding with a breezy and enigmatic air: \"Well, not for someone of your experience anyway.\" </p> <p>Thus it was that I was to be found, one unseasonably warm spring afternoon, puffing my way up a steep hill out of Chepstow, and giving thanks that I had not committed to doing the whole path at once. From end to end Offa's Dyke Path runs 177 miles, from the Severn Estuary at Chepstow to the Irish Sea at Prestatyn, roughly - sometimes literally - following the border between England and Wales. My assignment was to walk the first 80 miles to Knighton. The southern section is relatively easy compared with the wilder northern stretches - though \"relatively\" is a crucial word here, for there are some steep climbs and long hauls between villages. </p> <p>For all its venerable grandeur, surprisingly little is known about the origin or purpose of Offa's Dyke. Traditionally, it is ascribed to King Offa of Mercia, who in the late 8th century decreed that an earthen barrier be built along the border between Wales and his own realm next door. Because of its erratic nature - rising along some stretches to commanding heights of 20ft or more, but elsewhere standing as little more than a low hedgebank, and in yet others disappearing altogether - historians cannot agree on whether it served as a defensive barrier or merely boundary marker. In the 1960s, some enterprising souls decided to make it into a long-distance footpath. Llwybr Clawdd Offa, as it is known in Welsh, opened officially in July 1971. </p> <p>It may not be the longest or best-known footpath in the UK, but surely none can offer more varied or reliably comely scenery. An hour or so after setting off from Chepstow I entered a deep and arrestingly beautiful wood on the edge of limestone cliffs, with frequent views of the River Wye, sparkling and languid, some 200ft below. Here I caught my first glimpse of the dyke, a wandering hummock of earth three or four feet high, not terribly imposing just here but clearly ancient. Finally, at a lookout spot called Shorn Cliff Rock, I got the supreme payoff: a distant prospect of the ruins of Tintern Abbey basking in the mellow light of late afternoon. </p> <p>As I stood there, a fellow walker came along. We stood in silence for a few moments savouring the outlook. </p> <p>\"Do you walk this path much?\" I asked after a minute. </p> <p>\"Not much. I've come down from Hereford for a few days.\" </p> <p>\"I just wondered if it was always this quiet. I haven't seen anybody in two hours.\" </p> <p>He smiled. \"I haven't seen anybody since breakfast.\" </p> <p>We considered this for some moments. \"Nice, isn't it?\" I said. </p> <p>\"Mmmmm,\" he agreed. </p> <p>Thirty minutes later, courtesy of a side path through the woods to Tintern, I was checking into the welcoming confines of the Parva Farmhouse Hotel. A stroll through the village to view the abbey, a pint in an old stone pub, and a hearty dinner at the Parva completed a more or less perfect introduction to the path. </p> <p>Three things, if you ask me, make a perfect walk: good weather, good scenery and good company. I had the first two in unimprovable abundance the next day as I ambled the dozen miles to Monmouth, sometimes through sunny riverside meadows, sometimes climbing back into the hills. Frequently I could see and hear the A466, busy with Sunday trippers, but on my side of the river there wasn't a soul. It was odd - and in my experience unprecedented - to have so much bucolic splendour to myself. Not until mid-afternoon, when I reached a hilltop lookout called The Kymin, did I at last find other people - a dozen or so who had come up from Monmouth to enjoy the view. </p> <p>The Kymin is home to two of the National Trust's quainter and loftier holdings: an ornate memorial to British naval victories called The Temple and an eccentric white house dominated by a circular battlement. The house is not open to the public, but the views from its garden are sensational, with Monmouth holding the foreground far below and rolling farmland leading off to the distant Black Mountains. The knowledge that I had much of that expansive view to traverse the next day lent an air of solemnity, I must say, to my descent on stiffened legs to Monmouth. </p> <p>Distance between refuges is the greatest - indeed, the only - drawback of Offa's Dyke Path. From Monmouth to Pandy is 17 miles, with only a scattering of innless hamlets between. On the other hand the walking through the broad vales of the Monnow and Trothy rivers was mercifully gentle, with just a few wooded hills here and there for variety and challenge. There was much to see along the way, notably the pretty 13th-century Church of St Teilo at Llantilio Crossenny and the majestic, almost numinous ruins of White Castle, a classic moated fortress crowning a couple of hilltop acres. I had it, almost spookily, to myself. </p> <p>Solitude is all very well, but this was beginning to seem ridiculous. The Kymin apart, in two and a half days I had not seen a soul anywhere along the path. So I was very pleased an hour later as I approached St Cadoc's Church at Llangattock Lingoed to come across another walker - the very fellow, it turned out, I had seen earlier near Tintern. </p> <p>His name was Jon Pitts and he told me that he ran a small tour company specialising in slightly offbeat or unsung attractions. He was planning to offer walking tours of Offa's Dyke and to that end was reconnoitring the way. A likeable, easygoing fellow, he was not only knowledgeable about the path but appeared to know every good pub between Chepstow and Knighton, a fact that became evident when at length we reached Pandy and he steered me on a slight detour to the singularly agreeable Skirrid Inn for a restorative pint. This was clearly a fellow worth holding on to. We agreed to meet each day henceforth and walk together. I now had my missing element: good company. </p> <p>And I had even more to come. Roger Thomas, my master on this project, had offered to fetch me at Pandy and drive me the eight miles to Crickhowell, where he lives. It was cheating, I suppose, but he wanted me to experience the celebrated comforts of the Bear Hotel, and how glad I was that I did. </p> <p>Crickhowell was a lovely village, and the Bear a nearly perfect hotel - friendly, cosy, classy without being remotely pretentious, as popular with locals as with visitors. Twice it has been named Britain's Pub of the Year, and the honour seems well earned. </p> <p>The next morning, Roger drove me to the lonely but inexpressibly beautiful Vale of Ewyas and the ruins of 12th-century Llanthony Priory, whose stark and ancient grey walls stand on lawns like bowling greens. Here we met Jon, my new-found hiking pal, and photographer Sin Trenberth. The four of us set off up a steep path to the crest of Hatterrall Ridge, 1,000ft above, a long haul but eminently worth it. </p> <p>At the summit we were greeted with top-of-the-world views across Herefordshire to the east and the Brecon Beacons to the west. For most of its length along the ridge, the path marks the boundary between England and Wales. We walked for hours along sunny skyline until at last we reached Hay Bluff - the spot where I saw my first ramblers all those years ago. Yet again, we hadn't seen a soul. Offa's Dyke was beginning to feel like Britain's best-kept secret. </p> <p>The following day brought another dozen or so miles of bucolic but largely uneventful walking and an overnight stop at the very welcoming Offa's Dyke Lodge in Gladestry. Much too soon, this was all coming to an end, but there was at least the prospect of a grand finale with the last stretch to Knighton - \"the most enjoyable day's walk of the whole path\", according to the authors of my trusty guide-book, a big claim indeed after the glories of Hatterrall Ridge and the Wye Valley. </p> <p>Alas, the weather finally failed us. By mid-morning the rain was falling in sheets. Behind permanently fogged glasses, I could scarcely see my feet, much less the glories all around. Still, we stoically agreed, it's the bad days that make you appreciate the good ones. </p> <p>At Knighton, we had a look round the excellent and informative Offa's Dyke Visitor Centre, then stepped outside and gazed at the beckoning hills beyond. </p> <p>\"Fancy the northern half?\" Jon asked with a small grin. </p> <p>\"I'll meet you there this time next year,\" I replied. </p> <p>\"It's a date,\" he said. </p> <p>Our tone was jocular, but the thing is we both meant it. I know I did. </p> <p><strong> Way to go</strong></p> <p>Bill Bryson's \"bible\" on his walk was the Offa's Dyke Path South guidebook, part of the National Trail series published by Aurum Press, which covers every foot of the way, with detailed maps.

Not until a moment later was I struck by the thought that these were the very hills that had for centuries thwarted Romans and Anglo-Saxons alike, and allowed the Welsh to maintain their separate identity. \"It's not too hard, is it?\" I asked. \"Oh, no,\" said Roger Thomas, the amiable and persuasive editor of A View of Wales, before adding with a breezy and enigmatic air: \"Well, not for someone of your experience anyway.\" Thus it was that I was to be found, one unseasonably warm spring afternoon, puffing my way up a steep hill out of Chepstow, and giving thanks that I had not committed to doing the whole path at once. From end to end Offa's Dyke Path runs 177 miles, from the Severn Estuary at Chepstow to the Irish Sea at Prestatyn, roughly - sometimes literally - following the border between England and Wales. My assignment was to walk the first 80 miles to Knighton. The southern section is relatively easy compared with the wilder northern stretches - though \"relatively\" is a crucial word here, for there are some steep climbs and long hauls between villages. For all its venerable grandeur, surprisingly little is known about the origin or purpose of Offa's Dyke. Traditionally, it is ascribed to King Offa of Mercia, who in the late 8th century decreed that an earthen barrier be built along the border between Wales and his own realm next door. Because of its erratic nature - rising along some stretches to commanding heights of 20ft or more, but elsewhere standing as little more than a low hedgebank, and in yet others disappearing altogether - historians cannot agree on whether it served as a defensive barrier or merely boundary marker. In the 1960s, some enterprising souls decided to make it into a long-distance footpath. Llwybr Clawdd Offa, as it is known in Welsh, opened officially in July 1971. It may not be the longest or best-known footpath in the UK, but surely none can offer more varied or reliably comely scenery. An hour or so after setting off from Chepstow I entered a deep and arrestingly beautiful wood on the edge of limestone cliffs, with frequent views of the River Wye, sparkling and languid, some 200ft below. Here I caught my first glimpse of the dyke, a wandering hummock of earth three or four feet high, not terribly imposing just here but clearly ancient. Finally, at a lookout spot called Shorn Cliff Rock, I got the supreme payoff: a distant prospect of the ruins of Tintern Abbey basking in the mellow light of late afternoon. As I stood there, a fellow walker came along. We stood in silence for a few moments savouring the outlook. \"Do you walk this path much?\" I asked after a minute. \"Not much. I've come down from Hereford for a few days.\" \"I just wondered if it was always this quiet. I haven't seen anybody in two hours.\" He smiled. \"I haven't seen anybody since breakfast.\" We considered this for some moments. \"Nice, isn't it?\" I said. \"Mmmmm,\" he agreed. Thirty minutes later, courtesy of a side path through the woods to Tintern, I was checking into the welcoming confines of the Parva Farmhouse Hotel. A stroll through the village to view the abbey, a pint in an old stone pub, and a hearty dinner at the Parva completed a more or less perfect introduction to the path. Three things, if you ask me, make a perfect walk: good weather, good scenery and good company. I had the first two in unimprovable abundance the next day as I ambled the dozen miles to Monmouth, sometimes through sunny riverside meadows, sometimes climbing back into the hills. Frequently I could see and hear the A466, busy with Sunday trippers, but on my side of the river there wasn't a soul. It was odd - and in my experience unprecedented - to have so much bucolic splendour to myself. Not until mid-afternoon, when I reached a hilltop lookout called The Kymin, did I at last find other people - a dozen or so who had come up from Monmouth to enjoy the view. The Kymin is home to two of the National Trust's quainter and loftier holdings: an ornate memorial to British naval victories called The Temple and an eccentric white house dominated by a circular battlement. The house is not open to the public, but the views from its garden are sensational, with Monmouth holding the foreground far below and rolling farmland leading off to the distant Black Mountains. The knowledge that I had much of that expansive view to traverse the next day lent an air of solemnity, I must say, to my descent on stiffened legs to Monmouth. Distance between refuges is the greatest - indeed, the only - drawback of Offa's Dyke Path. From Monmouth to Pandy is 17 miles, with only a scattering of innless hamlets between. On the other hand the walking through the broad vales of the Monnow and Trothy rivers was mercifully gentle, with just a few wooded hills here and there for variety and challenge. There was much to see along the way, notably the pretty 13th-century Church of St Teilo at Llantilio Crossenny and the majestic, almost numinous ruins of White Castle, a classic moated fortress crowning a couple of hilltop acres. I had it, almost spookily, to myself. Solitude is all very well, but this was beginning to seem ridiculous. The Kymin apart, in two and a half days I had not seen a soul anywhere along the path. So I was very pleased an hour later as I approached St Cadoc's Church at Llangattock Lingoed to come across another walker - the very fellow, it turned out, I had seen earlier near Tintern. His name was Jon Pitts and he told me that he ran a small tour company specialising in slightly offbeat or unsung attractions. He was planning to offer walking tours of Offa's Dyke and to that end was reconnoitring the way. A likeable, easygoing fellow, he was not only knowledgeable about the path but appeared to know every good pub between Chepstow and Knighton, a fact that became evident when at length we reached Pandy and he steered me on a slight detour to the singularly agreeable Skirrid Inn for a restorative pint. This was clearly a fellow worth holding on to. We agreed to meet each day henceforth and walk together. I now had my missing element: good company. And I had even more to come. Roger Thomas, my master on this project, had offered to fetch me at Pandy and drive me the eight miles to Crickhowell, where he lives. It was cheating, I suppose, but he wanted me to experience the celebrated comforts of the Bear Hotel, and how glad I was that I did. Crickhowell was a lovely village, and the Bear a nearly perfect hotel - friendly, cosy, classy without being remotely pretentious, as popular with locals as with visitors. Twice it has been named Britain's Pub of the Year, and the honour seems well earned. The next morning, Roger drove me to the lonely but inexpressibly beautiful Vale of Ewyas and the ruins of 12th-century Llanthony Priory, whose stark and ancient grey walls stand on lawns like bowling greens. Here we met Jon, my new-found hiking pal, and photographer Sin Trenberth. The four of us set off up a steep path to the crest of Hatterrall Ridge, 1,000ft above, a long haul but eminently worth it. At the summit we were greeted with top-of-the-world views across Herefordshire to the east and the Brecon Beacons to the west. For most of its length along the ridge, the path marks the boundary between England and Wales. We walked for hours along sunny skyline until at last we reached Hay Bluff - the spot where I saw my first ramblers all those years ago. Yet again, we hadn't seen a soul. Offa's Dyke was beginning to feel like Britain's best-kept secret. The following day brought another dozen or so miles of bucolic but largely uneventful walking and an overnight stop at the very welcoming Offa's Dyke Lodge in Gladestry. Much too soon, this was all coming to an end, but there was at least the prospect of a grand finale with the last stretch to Knighton - \"the most enjoyable day's walk of the whole path\", according to the authors of my trusty guide-book, a big claim indeed after the glories of Hatterrall Ridge and the Wye Valley. Alas, the weather finally failed us. By mid-morning the rain was falling in sheets. Behind permanently fogged glasses, I could scarcely see my feet, much less the glories all around. Still, we stoically agreed, it's the bad days that make you appreciate the good ones. At Knighton, we had a look round the excellent and informative Offa's Dyke Visitor Centre, then stepped outside and gazed at the beckoning hills beyond. \"Fancy the northern half?\" Jon asked with a small grin. \"I'll meet you there this time next year,\" I replied. \"It's a date,\" he said. Our tone was jocular, but the thing is we both meant it. I know I did.

Instead, he seems to wake up most Sunday mornings with a bright red traffic cone or builder's hard hat perched drunkenly on his head. </p> <p>But far from taking offence, Cardiffians take Nye's designer headgear in their stride. The city's new self-confidence is grounded in one simple word: devolution. The new National Assembly may not have the same clout as its Scottish counterpart, but it has provided a focus and momentum for all kinds of distinctly Welsh noises in music and theatre, literature and visual art. </p> <p>Pop music has led the way, finally giving Wales its own independent soundtrack.

And let's face it, after seven pints of Brains SA, you won't really be in a position to tell the difference. </p> <p>Much of this energy comes from Cardiff's relative youth. While London and Edinburgh are knee-deep in history and heritage, Cardiff only made the capital city grade in 1955. There is a freedom and a freshness to its architecture, partic ularly in the revived dockland area known as Cardiff Bay. Most of the main sights are within a mile or so of the city centre, and can be easily reached by foot or by bus. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong></p> <p>Wherever you start in Cardiff, it's hard to miss the four lean white spires of the <strong> Millennium Stadium</strong>: the hulking 72,000 seater home of Welsh rugby. An architectural wonder, with its retractable roof and cantilevered walkways, the stadium is open most weeks for guided tours - giving visitors a chance to trot down the players' tunnel and sit in the Royal Box (tour details: 029-20 822228, <a href=\"http://www.cardiff-stadium.co.uk\">www.cardiff-stadium.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>Another over-the-top architectural experience is <strong> Cardiff Castle </strong> on St Mary Street.

Being a vaguely religious people, you'd imagine the Welsh would turn Nye's memorial into a national shrine. Instead, he seems to wake up most Sunday mornings with a bright red traffic cone or builder's hard hat perched drunkenly on his head. But far from taking offence, Cardiffians take Nye's designer headgear in their stride. The city's new self-confidence is grounded in one simple word: devolution. The new National Assembly may not have the same clout as its Scottish counterpart, but it has provided a focus and momentum for all kinds of distinctly Welsh noises in music and theatre, literature and visual art. Pop music has led the way, finally giving Wales its own independent soundtrack. As Catatonia's Cerys Matthews likes to remind us: \"Every day when I wake up/I thank the Lord I'm Welsh.\" Hang around the right Cardiff bars for a few days, and you're sure to meet a stray Stereophonic or Manic Street Preacher. Or at least you'll meet someone who claims to be a stray Stereophonic or Manic Street Preacher. And let's face it, after seven pints of Brains SA, you won't really be in a position to tell the difference. Much of this energy comes from Cardiff's relative youth. While London and Edinburgh are knee-deep in history and heritage, Cardiff only made the capital city grade in 1955. There is a freedom and a freshness to its architecture, partic ularly in the revived dockland area known as Cardiff Bay. Most of the main sights are within a mile or so of the city centre, and can be easily reached by foot or by bus. What to see Wherever you start in Cardiff, it's hard to miss the four lean white spires of the Millennium Stadium: the hulking 72,000 seater home of Welsh rugby. An architectural wonder, with its retractable roof and cantilevered walkways, the stadium is open most weeks for guided tours - giving visitors a chance to trot down the players' tunnel and sit in the Royal Box (tour details: 029-20 822228, www.cardiff-stadium.co.uk. Another over-the-top architectural experience is Cardiff Castle on St Mary Street. It used to be an ordinary castle until the coal-rich third Marquess of Bute hired the Victorian architect William Burges to turn the disparate historic remains into a pleasure palace, a monument of high camp and delicate design. The ornate rooms can only be seen as part of a guided tour (adults \u00a35, children \u00a33, families, \u00a314. For opening times, call 029-20 878100).

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/extracts/0,6761,140665,00.html\">Read an extract</a></p> <p>I've never been to Chiapas. I've never made the pilgrimage to the Lacandon jungle. I've never sat in the mud and the mist in La Realidad. I've never begged, pleaded or posed to get an audience with Subcomandante Marcos, the masked man, the faceless face of Mexico's Zapatista National Liberation Army. I know people who have. Lots of them. In 1994, the summer after the Zapatista rebellion, caravans to Chiapas were all the rage in north American activist circles: friends got together and raised money for secondhand vans, filled them with supplies, then drove south to San Cristobal de las Casas and left the vans behind. I didn't pay much attention at the time. Back then, Zapatista-mania looked suspiciously like just another cause for guilty lefties with a Latin American fetish: another Marxist rebel army, another macho leader, another chance to go south and buy colourful textiles. Hadn't we heard this story before? Hadn't it ended badly? Last week, there was another caravan in Chiapas. But this was different. First, it didn't end in San Cristobal de las Casas; it started there, and is now criss-crossing the Mexican countryside before the planned grand entrance into Mexico City on March 11. The caravan, nicknamed the \"Zapatour\" by the Mexican press, is being led by the council of 24 Zapatista commanders, in full uniform and masks (though no weapons), including Subcomandante Marcos himself. Because it is unheard of for the Zapatista command to travel outside Chiapas (and there are vigilantes threatening deadly duels with Marcos all along the way), the Zapatour needs tight security. The Red Cross turned down the job, so protection is being provided by several hundred anarchists from Italy who call themselves Ya Basta! (meaning \"Enough is enough!\"), after the defiant phrase used in the Zapatistas' declaration of war. Hundreds of students, small farmers and activists have joined the roadshow, and thousands greet them along the way. Unlike those early visitors to Chiapas, these travellers say they are there not because they are \"in solidarity\" with the Zapatistas, but because they are Zapatistas. Some even claim to be Subcomandante Marcos himself - they say we are all Marcos.</p> <p>Perhaps only a man who never takes off his mask, who hides his real name, could lead this caravan of renegades, rebels, loners and anarchists on this two-week trek. These are people who have learned to steer clear of charismatic leaders with one-size-fits-all ideologies. These aren't party loyalists; these are members of groups that pride themselves on their autonomy and lack of hierarchy. Marcos - with his black wool mask, two eyes and pipe - seems to be an anti-leader tailor-made for this suspicious, critical lot. Not only does he refuse to show his face, undercutting (and simultaneously augmenting) his own celebrity, but Marcos's story is of a man who came to his leadership, not through swaggering certainty, but by coming to terms with political uncertainty, by learning to follow.</p> <p>Though there is no confirmation of Marcos's real identity, the most repeated legend that surrounds him goes like this: an urban Marxist intellectual and activist, Marcos was wanted by the state and was no longer safe in the cities. He fled to the mountains of Chiapas in southeast Mexico filled with revolutionary rhetoric and certainty, there to convert the poor indigenous masses to the cause of armed proletarian revolution against the bourgeoisie. He said the workers of the world must unite, and the Mayans just stared at him. They said they weren't workers and, besides, land wasn't property but the heart of their community. Having failed as a Marxist missionary, Marcos immersed himself in Mayan culture. The more he learned, the less he knew. Out of this process, a new kind of army emerged, the EZLN, the Zapatista National Liberation Army, which was not controlled by an elite of guerrilla commanders but by the communities themselves, through clandestine councils and open assemblies. \"Our army,\" says Marcos, \"became scandalously Indian.\" That meant that he wasn't a commander barking orders, but a subcomandante, a conduit for the will of the councils. His first words said in the new persona were: \"Through me speaks the will of the Zapatista National Liberation Army.\" Further subjugating himself, Marcos says that he is not a leader to those who seek him out, but that his black mask is a mirror, reflecting each of their own struggles; that a Zapatista is anyone anywhere fighting injustice, that \"We are you\". He once said, \"Marcos is gay in San Francisco, black in South Africa, an Asian in Europe, a Chicano in San Ysidro, an anarchist in Spain, a Palestinian in Israel, a Mayan Indian in the streets of San Cristobal, a Jew in Germany, a Gypsy in Poland, a Mohawk in Quebec, a pacifist in Bosnia, a single woman on the Metro at 10pm, a peasant without land, a gang member in the slums, an unemployed worker, an unhappy student and, of course, a Zapatista in the mountains.\"</p> <p>\"This non-self,\" writes Juana Ponce de Leon who has collected and edited Marcos's writings in Our Word Is Our Weapon (see extracts on pages 14-16), \"makes it possible for Marcos to become the spokesperson for indigenous communities. He is transparent, and he is iconographic.\" Yet the paradox of Marcos and the Zapatistas is that, despite the masks, the non-selves, the mystery, their struggle is about the opposite of anonymity - it is about the right to be seen. When the Zapatistas took up arms and said Ya Basta! in 1994, it was a revolt against their invisibility. Like so many others left behind by globalisation, the Mayans of Chiapas had fallen off the economic map: \"Below in the cities,\" the EZLN command stated, \"we did not exist. Our lives were worth less than those of machines or animals. We were like stones, like weeds in the road. We were silenced. We were faceless.\" By arming and masking themselves, the Zapatistas explain, they weren't joining some Star Trek-like Borg universe of people without identities fighting in common cause: they were forcing the world to stop ignoring their plight, to see their long neglected faces. The Zapatistas are \"the voice that arms itself to be heard. The face that hides itself to be seen.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Marcos himself - the supposed non-self, the conduit, the mirror - writes in a tone so personal and poetic, so completely and unmistakably his own, that he is constantly undercutting and subverting the anonymity that comes from his mask and pseudonym. It is often said that the Zapatistas' best weapon was the internet, but their true secret weapon was their language. In Our Word Is Our Weapon, we read manifestos and war cries that are also poems, legends and riffs. A character emerges behind the mask, a personality. Marcos is a revolutionary who writes long meditative letters to Uruguayan poet Eduardo Galeano about the meaning of silence; who describes colonialism as a series of \"bad jokes badly told\", who quotes Lewis Carroll, Shakespeare and Borges. Who writes that resistance takes place \"any time any man or woman rebels to the point of tearing off the clothes resignation has woven for them and cynicism has dyed grey\". And who then sends whimsical mock telegrams to all of \"civil society\": \"THE GRAYS HOPE TO WIN. STOP. RAINBOW NEEDED URGENTLY.\"</p> <p>Marcos seems keenly aware of himself as an irresistible romantic hero. He's an Isabelle Allende character in reverse - not the poor peasant who becomes a Marxist rebel, but a Marxist intellectual who becomes a poor peasant. He plays with this character, flirts with it, saying that he can't reveal his real identity for fear of disappointing his female fans. Perhaps wary that this game was getting a little out of hand, Marcos chose the eve of Valentine's Day this year to break the bad news: he is married, and deeply in love, and her name is La Mar (\"the Sea\" - what else would it be?)</p> <p>This is a movement keenly aware of the power of words and symbols. Rumour has it that when the 24-strong Zapatista command arrive in Mexico City, they hope to ride downtown on horseback, like indigenous conquistadors. There will be a massive rally, and concerts, and they will ask to address the Congress. There, they will demand that legislators pass an Indigenous Bill of Rights, a law that came out of the Zapatistas' failed peace negotiations with president, Ernesto Zedillo, who was defeated in recent elections. Vincente Fox, his successor who famously bragged during the campaign that he could solve the Zapatista problem \"in 15 minutes\", has asked for a meeting with Marcos, but has so far been refused - not until the bill is passed, says Marcos, not until more army troops are withdrawn from Zapatista territory, not until all Zapatista political prisoners are freed. Marcos has been betrayed before, and accuses Fox of staging a \"simulation of peace\" before the peace negotiations have even restarted. What is clear in all this jostling for position is that something radical has changed in the balance of power in Mexico. The Zapatistas are calling the shots now - which is significant, because they have lost the habit of firing shots. What started as a small, armed insurrection has in the past seven years turned into what now looks more like a peaceful, and mass movement. It has helped topple the corrupt 71-year reign of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and has placed indigenous rights at the centre of the Mexican political agenda.</p> <p>Which is why Marcos gets angry when he is looked on as just another guy with a gun: \"What other guerrilla force has convened a national democratic movement, civic and peaceful, so that armed struggle becomes useless?\" he asks. \"What other guerrilla force asks its bases of support about what it should do before doing it? What other guerrilla force has struggled to achieve a democratic space and not take power? What other guerrilla force has relied more on words than on bullets?\"</p> <p>The Zapatistas chose January 1, 1994, the day the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) came into force, to \"declare war\" on the Mexican army, launching an insurrection and briefly taking control of the city of San Cristobal de las Casas and five Chiapas towns. They sent out a communiqu\u00e9 explaining that Nafta, which banned subsidies to indigenous farm co-operatives, would be a \"summary execution\" for four million indigenous Mexicans in Chiapas, the country's poorest province.</p> <p>Nearly 100 years had passed since the Mexican revolution promised to return indigenous land through agrarian reform; after all these broken promises, Nafta was simply the last straw. \"We are the product of 500 years of struggle . . . but today we say Ya Basta! Enough is enough.\" The rebels called themselves Zapatistas, taking their name from Emiliano Zapata, the slain hero of the 1910 revolution who, along with a rag-tag peasant army, fought for lands held by large landowners to be returned to indigenous and peasant farmers.</p> <p>In the seven years since, the Zapatistas have come to represent two forces at once: first, rebels struggling against grinding poverty and humiliation in the mountains of Chiapas and, on top of this, theorists of a new movement, another way to think about power, resistance and globalisation. This theory - Zapatismo - not only turns classic guerrilla tactics inside out, but much of leftwing politics on its head. </p> <p>I may never have made the pilgrimage to Chiapas, but I have watched the Zapatistas' ideas spread through activist circles, passed along second- and thirdhand: a phrase, a way to run a meeting, a metaphor that twists your brain around. Unlike classic revolutionaries, who preach through bullhorns and from pulpits, Marcos has spread the Zapatista word through riddles. Revolutionaries who don't want power. People who must hide their faces to be seen. A world with many worlds in it. </p> <p>A movement of one \"no\" and many \"yesses\".</p> <p>These phrases seem simple at first, but don't be fooled. They have a way of burrowing into the consciousness, cropping up in strange places, being repeated until they take on this quality of truth - but not absolute truth: a truth, as the Zapatistas might say, with many truths in it. In Canada, where I'm from, indigenous uprising is always symbolised by a blockade: a physical barrier to stop the golf course from being built on a native burial site, to block the construction of a hydroelectric dam or to keep an old growth forest from being logged. The Zapatista uprising was a new way to protect land and culture: rather than locking out the world, the Zapatistas flung open the doors and invited the world inside. Chiapas was transformed, despite its poverty, despite being under constant military siege, into a global gathering place for activists, intellectuals, and indigenous groups. </p> <p>From the first communiqu\u00e9, the Zapatistas invited the international community \"to watch over and regulate our battles\". The summer after the uprising, they hosted a National Democratic Convention in the jungle; 6,000 people attended, most from Mexico. In 1996, they hosted the first Encuentro (or meeting) For Humanity And Against Neo-Liberalism. Some 3,000 activists travelled to Chiapas to meet with others from around the world. </p> <p>Marcos himself is a one-man-web: he is a compulsive communicator, constantly reaching out, drawing connections between different issues and struggles. His communiqu\u00e9s are filled with lists of groups that he imagines are Zapatista allies, small shopkeepers, retired people and the disabled, as well as workers and campesinos. He writes to political prisoners Mumia Abu Jamal and Leonard Peltier. He is pen-pals with some of Latin America's best-known novelists. He writes letters addressed \"to the people of world\". </p> <p>When the uprising began, the government attempted to play down the incident as a \"local\" problem, an ethnic dispute easily contained. The strategic victory of the Zapatistas was to change the terms: to insist that what was going on in Chiapas could not be written off as a narrow \"ethnic\" struggle, and that it was universal. They did this by clearly naming their enemy not only as the Mexican state but as the set of economic policies known as \"neo-liberalism\". Marcos insisted that the poverty and desperation in Chiapas was simply a more advanced version of something happening all around the world. He pointed to the huge numbers of people who were being left behind by prosperity, whose land, and work, made that prosperity possible. \"The new distribution of the world excludes 'minorities',\" Marcos has said. \"The indigenous, youth, women, homosexuals, lesbians, people of colour, immigrants, workers, peasants; the majority who make up the world basements are presented, for power, as disposable. The distribution of the world excludes the majorities.\"</p> <p>The Zapatistas staged an open insurrection, one that anyone could join, as long as they thought of themselves as outsiders. By conservative estimates, there are now 45,000 Zapatista-related websites, based in 26 countries. Marcos's communiqu\u00e9s are available in at least 14 languages. And then there is the Zapatista cottage industry: black T-shirts with red five-pointed stars, white T-shirts with EZLN printed in black. There are baseball hats, black EZLN ski masks, Mayan-made dolls and trucks. There are posters, including one of Comandante Ramona, the much loved EZLN matriarch, as the Mona Lisa. </p> <p>It looked like fun, but it was also influential. Many who attended the first \"encuentros\" went on to play key roles in the protests against the World Trade Organisation in Seattle and the World Bank and IMF in Washington DC, arriving with a new taste for direct action, for collective decision-making and decentralised organising. When the insurrection began, the Mexican military was convinced it would be able to squash the Zapa- tistas' jungle uprising like a bug. It sent in heavy artillery, conducted air raids, mobilised thousands of soldiers. Only, instead of standing on a squashed bug, the government found itself surrounded by a swarm of international activists, buzzing around Chiapas. In a study commissioned by the US military from the Rand Corporation, the EZLN is studied as \"a new mode of conflict - 'netwar' - in which the protagonists depend on using network forms of organisation, doctrine, strategy and technology.\" This is dangerous, according to Rand, because what starts as \"a war of the flea\" can quickly turn into \"a war of the swarm\".</p> <p>The ring around the rebels has not protected the Zapatistas entirely. In December 1997, there was the brutal Acteal massacre in which 45 Zapatista supporters were killed, most of them women and children. And the situation in Chiapas is still desperate, with thousands displaced from their homes. But it is also true that the situation would probably have been much worse, potentially with far greater intervention from the US military, had it not been for this international swarm. The Rand Corporation study states that the global activist attention arrived \"during a period when the United States may have been tacitly interested in seeing a forceful crackdown on the rebels\".</p> <p>So it's worth asking: what are the ideas that proved so powerful that thousands have taken it upon themselves to disseminate them around the world? A few years ago, the idea of the rebels travelling to Mexico City to address the congress would have been impossible to imagine. The prospect of masked guerrillas (even masked guerrillas who have left their arms at home) entering a hall of political power signals one thing: revolution. But Zapatistas aren't interested in overthrowing the state or naming their leader, Marcos, as president. If anything, they want less state power over their lives. And, besides, Marcos says that as soon as peace has been negotiated he will take off his mask and disappear.</p> <p>What does it mean to be a revolutionary who is not trying to stage a revolution? This is one of the key Zapatista paradoxes. In one of his many communiqu\u00e9s, Marcos writes that \"it is not necessary to conquer the world. It is sufficient to make it new\". He adds: \"Us. Today.\" What sets the Zapatistas apart from your average Marxist guerrilla insurgents is that their goal is not to win control, but to seize and build autonomous spaces where \"democracy, liberty and justice\" can thrive.</p> <p>Although the Zapatistas have articulated certain key goals of their resistance (control over land, direct political representation, and the right to protect their language and culture), they insist they are not interested in \"the Revolution\", but rather in \"a revolution that makes revolution possible\". </p> <p>Marcos believes that what he has learned in Chiapas about non-hierarchical decision-making, decentralised organising and deep community democracy holds answers for the non-indigenous world as well - if only it were willing to listen. This is a kind of organising that doesn't compartmentalise the community into workers, warriors, farmers and students, but instead seeks to organise commu- nities as a whole, across sectors and across generations, creating \"social movements\". For the Zapatistas, these autonomous zones aren't about isolationism or dropping out, 60s-style. Quite the opposite: Marcos is convinced that these free spaces, born of reclaimed land, communal agriculture, resistance to privatisation, will eventually create counter-powers to the state simply by existing as alternatives.</p> <p>This is the essence of Zapatismo, and explains much of its appeal: a global call to revolution that tells you not to wait for the revolution, only to stand where you stand, to fight with your own weapon. It could be a video camera, words, ideas, \"hope\" - all of these, Marcos has written, \"are also weapons\". It's a revolution in miniature that says, \"Yes, you can try this at home.\" This organising model has spread throughout Latin America, and the world. You can see it in the anarchist squats of Italy (called \"social centres\") and in the Landless Peasants' Movement of Brazil, which seizes tracts of unused farmland and uses them for sustainable agriculture, markets and schools under the slogan \"Ocupar, Resistir, Producir\" (Occupy, Resist, Produce). These same ideas were forcefully expressed by the students of the National Autonomous University of Mexico during last year's long and militant occupation of their campus. Zapata once said the land belongs to those who work it, their banners blared, WE SAY THAT THE UNIVERSITY BELONGS TO THOSE WHO STUDY IN IT.</p> <p>Zapatismo, according to Marcos, is not a doctrine but \"an intuition\". And he is consciously trying to appeal to something that exists outside the intellect, something uncynical in us, that he found in himself in the mountains of Chiapas: wonder, a suspension of disbelief, myth and magic. So, instead of issuing manifestos, he tries to riff his way into this place, with long meditations, flights of fancy, dreaming out loud. This is, in a way, a kind of intellectual guerrilla warfare: Marcos won't meet his opponents head on, but instead surrounds them from all directions.</p> <p>A month ago, I got an email from Greg Ruggiero, the publisher of Marcos's collected writings. He wrote that when Marcos enters Mexico City next week, it will be \"the equivalent of Martin Luther King Jr's March on Washington\". I stared at the sentence for a long time. I have seen the clip of King's \"I have a dream\" speech maybe 10,000 times, though usually through adverts sellingmutual funds, cable news or computers and the like. Having grown up after history ended, it never occurred to me that I might see a capital-H history moment to match it. </p> <p>Next thing I knew, I was on the phone talking to airlines, cancelling engagements, making crazy excuses, mumbling about Zapatistas and Martin Luther King. Who cares that I dropped my introduction to Spanish course? Or that I've never been to Mexico City, let alone Chiapas? Marcos says I am a Zapatista and I am suddenly thinking, \"Yes, yes, I am. I have to be in Mexico City on March 11. It's like Martin Luther King Jr's March on Washington.\" Only now, as March 11 approaches, it occurs to me that it's not like that at all. History is being made in Mexico City this week, but it's a smaller, lower-case, humbler kind of history than you see in those news-clips. A history that says ,\"I can't make your history for you. But I can tell you that history is yours to make.\"</p> <p>It also occurs to me that Marcos isn't Martin Luther King; he is King's very modern progeny, born of a bittersweet marriage of vision and necessity. This masked man who calls himself Marcos is the descendant of King, Che Guevara, Malcom X, Emiliano Zapata and all the other heroes who preached from pulpits only to be shot down one by one, leaving bodies of followers wandering around blind and disoriented because they lost their heads. </p> <p>In their place, the world now has a new kind of hero, one who listens more than speaks, who preaches in riddles not in certainties, a leader who doesn't show his face, who says his mask is really a mirror. And in the Zapatistas, we have not one dream of a revolution, but a dreaming revolution. \"This is our dream,\" writes Marcos, \"the Zapatista paradox - one that takes away sleep. The only dream that is dreamed awake, sleepless. The history that is born and nurtured from below.\"</p> <p>\u00a9 Naomi Klein</p>",

      "bodyText": "Read an extract I've never been to Chiapas. I've never made the pilgrimage to the Lacandon jungle. I've never sat in the mud and the mist in La Realidad. I've never begged, pleaded or posed to get an audience with Subcomandante Marcos, the masked man, the faceless face of Mexico's Zapatista National Liberation Army. I know people who have. Lots of them. In 1994, the summer after the Zapatista rebellion, caravans to Chiapas were all the rage in north American activist circles: friends got together and raised money for secondhand vans, filled them with supplies, then drove south to San Cristobal de las Casas and left the vans behind. I didn't pay much attention at the time. Back then, Zapatista-mania looked suspiciously like just another cause for guilty lefties with a Latin American fetish: another Marxist rebel army, another macho leader, another chance to go south and buy colourful textiles. Hadn't we heard this story before? Hadn't it ended badly? Last week, there was another caravan in Chiapas. But this was different. First, it didn't end in San Cristobal de las Casas; it started there, and is now criss-crossing the Mexican countryside before the planned grand entrance into Mexico City on March 11. The caravan, nicknamed the \"Zapatour\" by the Mexican press, is being led by the council of 24 Zapatista commanders, in full uniform and masks (though no weapons), including Subcomandante Marcos himself. Because it is unheard of for the Zapatista command to travel outside Chiapas (and there are vigilantes threatening deadly duels with Marcos all along the way), the Zapatour needs tight security. The Red Cross turned down the job, so protection is being provided by several hundred anarchists from Italy who call themselves Ya Basta! (meaning \"Enough is enough!\"), after the defiant phrase used in the Zapatistas' declaration of war. Hundreds of students, small farmers and activists have joined the roadshow, and thousands greet them along the way. Unlike those early visitors to Chiapas, these travellers say they are there not because they are \"in solidarity\" with the Zapatistas, but because they are Zapatistas. Some even claim to be Subcomandante Marcos himself - they say we are all Marcos. Perhaps only a man who never takes off his mask, who hides his real name, could lead this caravan of renegades, rebels, loners and anarchists on this two-week trek. These are people who have learned to steer clear of charismatic leaders with one-size-fits-all ideologies. These aren't party loyalists; these are members of groups that pride themselves on their autonomy and lack of hierarchy. Marcos - with his black wool mask, two eyes and pipe - seems to be an anti-leader tailor-made for this suspicious, critical lot. Not only does he refuse to show his face, undercutting (and simultaneously augmenting) his own celebrity, but Marcos's story is of a man who came to his leadership, not through swaggering certainty, but by coming to terms with political uncertainty, by learning to follow. Though there is no confirmation of Marcos's real identity, the most repeated legend that surrounds him goes like this: an urban Marxist intellectual and activist, Marcos was wanted by the state and was no longer safe in the cities. He fled to the mountains of Chiapas in southeast Mexico filled with revolutionary rhetoric and certainty, there to convert the poor indigenous masses to the cause of armed proletarian revolution against the bourgeoisie. He said the workers of the world must unite, and the Mayans just stared at him. They said they weren't workers and, besides, land wasn't property but the heart of their community. Having failed as a Marxist missionary, Marcos immersed himself in Mayan culture. The more he learned, the less he knew. Out of this process, a new kind of army emerged, the EZLN, the Zapatista National Liberation Army, which was not controlled by an elite of guerrilla commanders but by the communities themselves, through clandestine councils and open assemblies. \"Our army,\" says Marcos, \"became scandalously Indian.\" That meant that he wasn't a commander barking orders, but a subcomandante, a conduit for the will of the councils. His first words said in the new persona were: \"Through me speaks the will of the Zapatista National Liberation Army.\" Further subjugating himself, Marcos says that he is not a leader to those who seek him out, but that his black mask is a mirror, reflecting each of their own struggles; that a Zapatista is anyone anywhere fighting injustice, that \"We are you\". He once said, \"Marcos is gay in San Francisco, black in South Africa, an Asian in Europe, a Chicano in San Ysidro, an anarchist in Spain, a Palestinian in Israel, a Mayan Indian in the streets of San Cristobal, a Jew in Germany, a Gypsy in Poland, a Mohawk in Quebec, a pacifist in Bosnia, a single woman on the Metro at 10pm, a peasant without land, a gang member in the slums, an unemployed worker, an unhappy student and, of course, a Zapatista in the mountains.\" \"This non-self,\" writes Juana Ponce de Leon who has collected and edited Marcos's writings in Our Word Is Our Weapon (see extracts on pages 14-16), \"makes it possible for Marcos to become the spokesperson for indigenous communities. He is transparent, and he is iconographic.\" Yet the paradox of Marcos and the Zapatistas is that, despite the masks, the non-selves, the mystery, their struggle is about the opposite of anonymity - it is about the right to be seen. When the Zapatistas took up arms and said Ya Basta! in 1994, it was a revolt against their invisibility.

Our lives were worth less than those of machines or animals. We were like stones, like weeds in the road. We were silenced. We were faceless.\" By arming and masking themselves, the Zapatistas explain, they weren't joining some Star Trek-like Borg universe of people without identities fighting in common cause: they were forcing the world to stop ignoring their plight, to see their long neglected faces. The Zapatistas are \"the voice that arms itself to be heard.

It is often said that the Zapatistas' best weapon was the internet, but their true secret weapon was their language. In Our Word Is Our Weapon, we read manifestos and war cries that are also poems, legends and riffs. A character emerges behind the mask, a personality. Marcos is a revolutionary who writes long meditative letters to Uruguayan poet Eduardo Galeano about the meaning of silence; who describes colonialism as a series of \"bad jokes badly told\", who quotes Lewis Carroll, Shakespeare and Borges. Who writes that resistance takes place \"any time any man or woman rebels to the point of tearing off the clothes resignation has woven for them and cynicism has dyed grey\". And who then sends whimsical mock telegrams to all of \"civil society\": \"THE GRAYS HOPE TO WIN. STOP. RAINBOW NEEDED URGENTLY.\" Marcos seems keenly aware of himself as an irresistible romantic hero. He's an Isabelle Allende character in reverse - not the poor peasant who becomes a Marxist rebel, but a Marxist intellectual who becomes a poor peasant. He plays with this character, flirts with it, saying that he can't reveal his real identity for fear of disappointing his female fans. Perhaps wary that this game was getting a little out of hand, Marcos chose the eve of Valentine's Day this year to break the bad news: he is married, and deeply in love, and her name is La Mar (\"the Sea\" - what else would it be?) This is a movement keenly aware of the power of words and symbols. Rumour has it that when the 24-strong Zapatista command arrive in Mexico City, they hope to ride downtown on horseback, like indigenous conquistadors.

What other guerrilla force has struggled to achieve a democratic space and not take power? What other guerrilla force has relied more on words than on bullets?\" The Zapatistas chose January 1, 1994, the day the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) came into force, to \"declare war\" on the Mexican army, launching an insurrection and briefly taking control of the city of San Cristobal de las Casas and five Chiapas towns. They sent out a communiqu\u00e9 explaining that Nafta, which banned subsidies to indigenous farm co-operatives, would be a \"summary execution\" for four million indigenous Mexicans in Chiapas, the country's poorest province. Nearly 100 years had passed since the Mexican revolution promised to return indigenous land through agrarian reform; after all these broken promises, Nafta was simply the last straw. \"We are the product of 500 years of struggle . . . but today we say Ya Basta! Enough is enough.\" The rebels called themselves Zapatistas, taking their name from Emiliano Zapata, the slain hero of the 1910 revolution who, along with a rag-tag peasant army, fought for lands held by large landowners to be returned to indigenous and peasant farmers.

The distribution of the world excludes the majorities.\" The Zapatistas staged an open insurrection, one that anyone could join, as long as they thought of themselves as outsiders. By conservative estimates, there are now 45,000 Zapatista-related websites, based in 26 countries. Marcos's communiqu\u00e9s are available in at least 14 languages. And then there is the Zapatista cottage industry: black T-shirts with red five-pointed stars, white T-shirts with EZLN printed in black. There are baseball hats, black EZLN ski masks, Mayan-made dolls and trucks. There are posters, including one of Comandante Ramona, the much loved EZLN matriarch, as the Mona Lisa. It looked like fun, but it was also influential. Many who attended the first \"encuentros\" went on to play key roles in the protests against the World Trade Organisation in Seattle and the World Bank and IMF in Washington DC, arriving with a new taste for direct action, for collective decision-making and decentralised organising. When the insurrection began, the Mexican military was convinced it would be able to squash the Zapa- tistas' jungle uprising like a bug. It sent in heavy artillery, conducted air raids, mobilised thousands of soldiers. Only, instead of standing on a squashed bug, the government found itself surrounded by a swarm of international activists, buzzing around Chiapas. In a study commissioned by the US military from the Rand Corporation, the EZLN is studied as \"a new mode of conflict - 'netwar' - in which the protagonists depend on using network forms of organisation, doctrine, strategy and technology.\" This is dangerous, according to Rand, because what starts as \"a war of the flea\" can quickly turn into \"a war of the swarm\". The ring around the rebels has not protected the Zapatistas entirely. In December 1997, there was the brutal Acteal massacre in which 45 Zapatista supporters were killed, most of them women and children. And the situation in Chiapas is still desperate, with thousands displaced from their homes. But it is also true that the situation would probably have been much worse, potentially with far greater intervention from the US military, had it not been for this international swarm. The Rand Corporation study states that the global activist attention arrived \"during a period when the United States may have been tacitly interested in seeing a forceful crackdown on the rebels\". So it's worth asking: what are the ideas that proved so powerful that thousands have taken it upon themselves to disseminate them around the world? A few years ago, the idea of the rebels travelling to Mexico City to address the congress would have been impossible to imagine. The prospect of masked guerrillas (even masked guerrillas who have left their arms at home) entering a hall of political power signals one thing: revolution. But Zapatistas aren't interested in overthrowing the state or naming their leader, Marcos, as president. If anything, they want less state power over their lives. And, besides, Marcos says that as soon as peace has been negotiated he will take off his mask and disappear. What does it mean to be a revolutionary who is not trying to stage a revolution? This is one of the key Zapatista paradoxes. In one of his many communiqu\u00e9s, Marcos writes that \"it is not necessary to conquer the world. It is sufficient to make it new\". He adds: \"Us. Today.\" What sets the Zapatistas apart from your average Marxist guerrilla insurgents is that their goal is not to win control, but to seize and build autonomous spaces where \"democracy, liberty and justice\" can thrive. Although the Zapatistas have articulated certain key goals of their resistance (control over land, direct political representation, and the right to protect their language and culture), they insist they are not interested in \"the Revolution\", but rather in \"a revolution that makes revolution possible\". Marcos believes that what he has learned in Chiapas about non-hierarchical decision-making, decentralised organising and deep community democracy holds answers for the non-indigenous world as well - if only it were willing to listen. This is a kind of organising that doesn't compartmentalise the community into workers, warriors, farmers and students, but instead seeks to organise commu- nities as a whole, across sectors and across generations, creating \"social movements\". For the Zapatistas, these autonomous zones aren't about isolationism or dropping out, 60s-style. Quite the opposite: Marcos is convinced that these free spaces, born of reclaimed land, communal agriculture, resistance to privatisation, will eventually create counter-powers to the state simply by existing as alternatives. This is the essence of Zapatismo, and explains much of its appeal: a global call to revolution that tells you not to wait for the revolution, only to stand where you stand, to fight with your own weapon. It could be a video camera, words, ideas, \"hope\" - all of these, Marcos has written, \"are also weapons\". It's a revolution in miniature that says, \"Yes, you can try this at home.\" This organising model has spread throughout Latin America, and the world. You can see it in the anarchist squats of Italy (called \"social centres\") and in the Landless Peasants' Movement of Brazil, which seizes tracts of unused farmland and uses them for sustainable agriculture, markets and schools under the slogan \"Ocupar, Resistir, Producir\" (Occupy, Resist, Produce). These same ideas were forcefully expressed by the students of the National Autonomous University of Mexico during last year's long and militant occupation of their campus. Zapata once said the land belongs to those who work it, their banners blared, WE SAY THAT THE UNIVERSITY BELONGS TO THOSE WHO STUDY IN IT. Zapatismo, according to Marcos, is not a doctrine but \"an intuition\". And he is consciously trying to appeal to something that exists outside the intellect, something uncynical in us, that he found in himself in the mountains of Chiapas: wonder, a suspension of disbelief, myth and magic. So, instead of issuing manifestos, he tries to riff his way into this place, with long meditations, flights of fancy, dreaming out loud. This is, in a way, a kind of intellectual guerrilla warfare: Marcos won't meet his opponents head on, but instead surrounds them from all directions. A month ago, I got an email from Greg Ruggiero, the publisher of Marcos's collected writings. He wrote that when Marcos enters Mexico City next week, it will be \"the equivalent of Martin Luther King Jr's March on Washington\". I stared at the sentence for a long time. I have seen the clip of King's \"I have a dream\" speech maybe 10,000 times, though usually through adverts sellingmutual funds, cable news or computers and the like. Having grown up after history ended, it never occurred to me that I might see a capital-H history moment to match it. Next thing I knew, I was on the phone talking to airlines, cancelling engagements, making crazy excuses, mumbling about Zapatistas and Martin Luther King. Who cares that I dropped my introduction to Spanish course? Or that I've never been to Mexico City, let alone Chiapas? Marcos says I am a Zapatista and I am suddenly thinking, \"Yes, yes, I am. I have to be in Mexico City on March 11. It's like Martin Luther King Jr's March on Washington.\" Only now, as March 11 approaches, it occurs to me that it's not like that at all. History is being made in Mexico City this week, but it's a smaller, lower-case, humbler kind of history than you see in those news-clips. A history that says ,\"I can't make your history for you. But I can tell you that history is yours to make.\" It also occurs to me that Marcos isn't Martin Luther King; he is King's very modern progeny, born of a bittersweet marriage of vision and necessity. This masked man who calls himself Marcos is the descendant of King, Che Guevara, Malcom X, Emiliano Zapata and all the other heroes who preached from pulpits only to be shot down one by one, leaving bodies of followers wandering around blind and disoriented because they lost their heads. In their place, the world now has a new kind of hero, one who listens more than speaks, who preaches in riddles not in certainties, a leader who doesn't show his face, who says his mask is really a mirror. And in the Zapatistas, we have not one dream of a revolution, but a dreaming revolution. \"This is our dream,\" writes Marcos, \"the Zapatista paradox - one that takes away sleep. The only dream that is dreamed awake, sleepless. The history that is born and nurtured from below.\" \u00a9 Naomi Klein",

One way anti-gay bigots seek to poison minds against homosexual men is to label them all child abusers. While this is clearly an offensive generalisation, gay men need to ask themselves if they are doing anything to fuel this argument.</p> <p>Recent allegations that Field Marshal Montgomery was a \"repressed homosexual\" and \"fell in love\" with boys not yet in their teens is likely to cause a stir among some gay men, who might feel that he has been branded a paedophile, when really Montgomery was just a \"lover of boys\". The word '\"paedophile\" is bandied around with impunity, but no word in our language is so dangerously misused. It means, literally, \"lover of children\". Child sex abusers seek solace in this term, and it is easy to see why it is to their advantage to embrace the label. If they were called by their real name - child sex abusers and child rapists - they might be seen as dangerous criminals and not \"ill\".</p> <p>On the other hand, \"paedophilia\", as in the News of the World campaign after the death of Sarah Payne, monsterises stranger sex abusers to the point that male family members who abuse children in the home are made invisible. \"Paedophile activity\" conjures up images of Sidney Cooke types, not the more common culprit: the jolly uncle or grandfather using his place in the nuclear family to hide his foul activities.</p> <p>The recent revelations that some of the heroes of the 1968 revolution in France were advocates and defenders of \"paedophilia\" is one example of how you can get it wrong. They saw sex between adults and children as part of the wider anti-authoritarian movement against the establishment. And it must be acknowledged that gay men have been some of the most vocal apologists for this gross activity. Let's look at the evidence.</p> <p>In the late 70s, when the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) reared its ugly head, it won support from some gay men and libertarians, who bought the line that these abusers were an \"oppressed sexual minority\" and invited them to join the \"rainbow coalition\" of transsexuals, adult nappy wearers and other \"sexual outlaws\". The hideous PIE publication, Paedophilia: The Radical Case, was favourably reviewed by Gay News and other gay publications.</p> <p>What is different today? In the late 90s, Peter Tatchell of Outrage!, now campaigning for lowering the age of consent for all to 14, reviewed a grotesque and shocking book, Dares to Speak: Historical &amp; Contemporary Perspectives On Boy-Love. Tatchell wrote: \"Abusive, exploitative relationships are indefensible but... [there are] many examples of societies where consenting intergenerational sex is considered normal, acceptable, beneficial and enjoyable by old and young alike.\"</p> <p>Many gay activists, like Tatchell, rightly claim that one tactic of homophobes is to point the finger at gay men for the abuse of children. This serves to demonise all gay men in the eyes of those such as Baroness Young and her cronies, and is deeply unfair to homosexuals who believe that sex with minors is abhorrent. (This is not about two 15-year-old boys having consensual sex; the reason we have an age of consent is to protect children from adult abusers.) It does, however, have another serious consequence. As a result of this offensive generalisation, many people now strive not to implicate gay men in sex abuse cases. Some liberal social workers and academics have contributed to the fact that many child protection agencies now refuse to acknowledge that any gay man could also be a child sex abuser. This is ridiculous. When I was a young, idealistic feminist, I used to come out with the nonsense picked up from gay male friends that 99% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by heterosexual men. The truth is that gay men are as likely to abuse as any.</p> <p>As Christian Wolmar points out in his fascinating study of institutional child abuse, Forgotten Children, the equal opportunities culture of some London boroughs in the 80s was such that, in order to promote the employment of \"minorities\", criminal convictions of gay men were often not checked in case it was seen as discriminatory. He quotes a 1995 report by Ian White about Islington council: \"We were told that managers believed they would not be supported if they triggered disciplinary investigations involving staff who may be... members of the gay community.\" This, of course, simply enabled child abusers to obtain jobs in children's homes and other places where they could gain access to vulnerable children. (Only 5% of child sex abusers are women.)</p> <p>If gay men are going to, on the one hand, campaign for sexual access to younger and younger boys, but bleat about public perceptions of them as a league of child abusers, is it any wonder that the whole thing is such a mess? If more gay men faced the fact that the eroticisation of sex with boys (or \"chickens\", as they are known on the scene) is a part of gay culture, then the ones who care could challenge it. The advocating by some gay activists of sex with children seems to be based on the rewriting of their own childhood sexual abuse as a \"positive initiation ceremony\" into the gay lifestyle. Rather than campaigning to lower the age of consent, it might silence anti-gay bigots if at least some gay men spoke out against these atrocities towards children.</p> <p>It is a myth that serves heterosexual men and homophobes very well that gay men are abusing children left, right and centre. We also know that men who sexually assault children do so because they are abusers, not because of the gender of their preferred adult relationships. But in the way that heterosexual men need to think about their sexualisation of girl children, such as joking about little girls \"flirting\" with them or teasing them about \"boyfriends\" almost from birth, gay men need to ask some serious questions about their culture and lifestyle. Is it really acceptable, for example, that Elton John defended his prancing around on stage with boy scouts as \"camp fun\"?</p> <p>If gay men are serious about distancing themselves from child sexual abuse, then it's up to them to make some real efforts to join forces against this gross violation. It is no use anyone moaning that it's \"not our problem\" or that it's the responsibility of society to address prejudicial assumptions. But we cannot escape the fact that, so far, more gay men have attempted to explain the \"erotic nature\" of inter- generational sex, or shown sympathy and understanding of \"boy lovers\", than have joined forces with those of us who wish to see an end to child sexual abuse.</p>",

The word '\"paedophile\" is bandied around with impunity, but no word in our language is so dangerously misused. It means, literally, \"lover of children\". Child sex abusers seek solace in this term, and it is easy to see why it is to their advantage to embrace the label. If they were called by their real name - child sex abusers and child rapists - they might be seen as dangerous criminals and not \"ill\". On the other hand, \"paedophilia\", as in the News of the World campaign after the death of Sarah Payne, monsterises stranger sex abusers to the point that male family members who abuse children in the home are made invisible. \"Paedophile activity\" conjures up images of Sidney Cooke types, not the more common culprit: the jolly uncle or grandfather using his place in the nuclear family to hide his foul activities. The recent revelations that some of the heroes of the 1968 revolution in France were advocates and defenders of \"paedophilia\" is one example of how you can get it wrong. They saw sex between adults and children as part of the wider anti-authoritarian movement against the establishment. And it must be acknowledged that gay men have been some of the most vocal apologists for this gross activity. Let's look at the evidence. In the late 70s, when the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) reared its ugly head, it won support from some gay men and libertarians, who bought the line that these abusers were an \"oppressed sexual minority\" and invited them to join the \"rainbow coalition\" of transsexuals, adult nappy wearers and other \"sexual outlaws\". The hideous PIE publication, Paedophilia: The Radical Case, was favourably reviewed by Gay News and other gay publications. What is different today? In the late 90s, Peter Tatchell of Outrage!, now campaigning for lowering the age of consent for all to 14, reviewed a grotesque and shocking book, Dares to Speak: Historical &amp; Contemporary Perspectives On Boy-Love. Tatchell wrote: \"Abusive, exploitative relationships are indefensible but... [there are] many examples of societies where consenting intergenerational sex is considered normal, acceptable, beneficial and enjoyable by old and young alike.\" Many gay activists, like Tatchell, rightly claim that one tactic of homophobes is to point the finger at gay men for the abuse of children. This serves to demonise all gay men in the eyes of those such as Baroness Young and her cronies, and is deeply unfair to homosexuals who believe that sex with minors is abhorrent. (This is not about two 15-year-old boys having consensual sex; the reason we have an age of consent is to protect children from adult abusers.) It does, however, have another serious consequence. As a result of this offensive generalisation, many people now strive not to implicate gay men in sex abuse cases. Some liberal social workers and academics have contributed to the fact that many child protection agencies now refuse to acknowledge that any gay man could also be a child sex abuser. This is ridiculous. When I was a young, idealistic feminist, I used to come out with the nonsense picked up from gay male friends that 99% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by heterosexual men. The truth is that gay men are as likely to abuse as any. As Christian Wolmar points out in his fascinating study of institutional child abuse, Forgotten Children, the equal opportunities culture of some London boroughs in the 80s was such that, in order to promote the employment of \"minorities\", criminal convictions of gay men were often not checked in case it was seen as discriminatory. He quotes a 1995 report by Ian White about Islington council: \"We were told that managers believed they would not be supported if they triggered disciplinary investigations involving staff who may be... members of the gay community.\" This, of course, simply enabled child abusers to obtain jobs in children's homes and other places where they could gain access to vulnerable children. (Only 5% of child sex abusers are women.) If gay men are going to, on the one hand, campaign for sexual access to younger and younger boys, but bleat about public perceptions of them as a league of child abusers, is it any wonder that the whole thing is such a mess? If more gay men faced the fact that the eroticisation of sex with boys (or \"chickens\", as they are known on the scene) is a part of gay culture, then the ones who care could challenge it. The advocating by some gay activists of sex with children seems to be based on the rewriting of their own childhood sexual abuse as a \"positive initiation ceremony\" into the gay lifestyle. Rather than campaigning to lower the age of consent, it might silence anti-gay bigots if at least some gay men spoke out against these atrocities towards children. It is a myth that serves heterosexual men and homophobes very well that gay men are abusing children left, right and centre. We also know that men who sexually assault children do so because they are abusers, not because of the gender of their preferred adult relationships. But in the way that heterosexual men need to think about their sexualisation of girl children, such as joking about little girls \"flirting\" with them or teasing them about \"boyfriends\" almost from birth, gay men need to ask some serious questions about their culture and lifestyle. Is it really acceptable, for example, that Elton John defended his prancing around on stage with boy scouts as \"camp fun\"? If gay men are serious about distancing themselves from child sexual abuse, then it's up to them to make some real efforts to join forces against this gross violation. It is no use anyone moaning that it's \"not our problem\" or that it's the responsibility of society to address prejudicial assumptions. But we cannot escape the fact that, so far, more gay men have attempted to explain the \"erotic nature\" of inter- generational sex, or shown sympathy and understanding of \"boy lovers\", than have joined forces with those of us who wish to see an end to child sexual abuse.",

In time it will offer electronic access to more than 17m computerised registers, title plans and deeds on the Land Register. </p> <p>Increasingly, Land Registry business is being conducted electronically. But until all parties involved in buying and selling homes operate electronically, the system will remain a cumbersome hybrid. </p> <p>Until recently, when solicitors wanted to discharge a mortgage they had to do so manually. Form DS1 would be sent to the Land Registry instructing them to remove the mortgage from the register. Now, lenders can dispatch the form to the Registry electronically, but the solicitor acting for the seller still needs paper proof that the mortgage has been discharged to show to the solicitor acting for the buyer, says Mr Byass. </p> <p>If the promised faster system seems too far off, some companies are offering a faster service within current constraints. Buyers and sellers can already obtain quotes for conveyancing and even instruct a solicitor online. </p> <p>Now organisations such as EasyMove are trying to speed things up using a combination of real live people and the internet. The company places consultants in estate agents' offices to liaise with buyer, seller, agent and solicitors. The consultants' job is to ensure the sale or purchase progresses smoothly. </p> <p>The service has been piloted in Legal and General estate agents' offices and EasyMove claims to have reduced the time taken to carry out conveyancing by two-thirds.

The cost of the service is from \u00a3375 plus VAT and the usual charges such as search fees associated with buying and selling.

However, there are some unanswered questions, says Mr Byass. It will be harder for buyers or sellers to buy time to sort out a problem if the progress of the sale or purchase is available for all to see via the internet. Controlling access to information over the web is one challenge that the e-conveyancers are wrestling with. </p> <p>For his part, Mr Byass is impatient for change and would like to go even further.

You asked if we could hum any of Nana Mouskouri's tunes (Goddess Of Love, February 24), and now I can't stop White Rose Of Athens running through my head. <br> <b> Paul Thompson</b> <br> Scone, Scotland</p> <p>As recent events have shown, it is unsustainable food production practices that lead to the destruction of thousands of domestic pigs (Alexander Chancellor, February 24). There's no need for any help from wild boars. <br> <b> John Hawk</b> <br> Hove, East Sussex</p> <p>Why does Alexander Chancellor wish to annoy environmentalists? Perhaps, despite his protestations to the contrary, he is a reactionary fogey. <br> <b> Martin Edwards</b> <br> Birmingham</p> <p>First it was cats, cats everywhere, devastating the cute birdies and bunnies, and stripping the countryside bare. Now it's wild boars, trampling bluebells, ending organic farming and scoffing all the grapes. Mr Chancellor, are you feeling quite well? <br> <b> Ms Manat Bleys</b> <br> London NW5</p> <p>Snoo Wilson should place more trust in Julie Burchill's knowledge of language (Dear Weekend, February 24). 'Truckle' is good West Country dialect for a small wooden basket or open box. Perhaps if he got out of London more, he'd know that our Bristol accent adds a dark 'l' (a sound approaching a W) to words that end in vowels, normally 'a' or 'o'. <br> <b> Martin Griffies</b> <br> Bristol</p> <p>Joanna Blythman was right to point out the hypocrisy in British reluctance to eat veal alongside a massive consumption of milk (Food, February 24). There is much cruelty involved in milk production, not to mention what the calves themselves suffer.</p> <p>Cows' milk was designed for baby cows: how many humans do you know who want to triple their weight in three months? In this day and age, there is no reason or need to drink cows' milk, and many studies have even shown it be to harmful - not surprising, when you consider that the average glass of milk contains 112,899,408 pus cells. <br> <b> Katherine Lubar</b> <br> London W2</p> <p>I have a mildly unusual first name.

Salim Haidrani London NW1 'After Pinochet, should Kissinger be next in the dock?' you ask on your cover. The answer, which has been pretty clear to a lot of us for some time, is obviously yes.

Perhaps, despite his protestations to the contrary, he is a reactionary fogey.

Now it's wild boars, trampling bluebells, ending organic farming and scoffing all the grapes. Mr Chancellor, are you feeling quite well? Ms Manat Bleys London NW5 Snoo Wilson should place more trust in Julie Burchill's knowledge of language (Dear Weekend, February 24). 'Truckle' is good West Country dialect for a small wooden basket or open box. Perhaps if he got out of London more, he'd know that our Bristol accent adds a dark 'l' (a sound approaching a W) to words that end in vowels, normally 'a' or 'o'. Martin Griffies Bristol Joanna Blythman was right to point out the hypocrisy in British reluctance to eat veal alongside a massive consumption of milk (Food, February 24). There is much cruelty involved in milk production, not to mention what the calves themselves suffer. Cows' milk was designed for baby cows: how many humans do you know who want to triple their weight in three months? In this day and age, there is no reason or need to drink cows' milk, and many studies have even shown it be to harmful - not surprising, when you consider that the average glass of milk contains 112,899,408 pus cells.

Young lovers vowed to die in each other's arms. Hundreds more chose not to wait for war and ended their own lives.</p> <p>That fretful fortnight in October 1962, when the US and the Soviet Union played a macabre game of nuclear chicken, with Washington threatening Armageddon if the Moscow did not withdraw the rockets sent to protect Fidel Castro's island revolution, was the closest the world came to the cold war endgame of \"mutually assured destruction\".</p> <p>The stand-off sealed the golden myth of the Kennedys as the young, handsome, idealists who called Nikita Khrushchev's bluff and saved the \"free\" world. \"We were eyeball to eyeball,\" as their defence secretary, Robert McNamara put it at the time, \"and the other fellow just blinked.\"</p> <p>What is less well-known is that the real hero of the hour was an obscure, working-class Boston Irish hard-chaw called Kenneth P O'Donnell.</p> <p>That at least is the impression you get from 13 Days, a widely praised but controversial Hollywood thriller which revisits Camelot's greatest triumph and recasts the Kennedys as the unsullied heroes they were before revelations of voracious womanising, interminable CIA plotting and Mafia links took the shine off.</p> <p>Not only has the film perplexed historians by elevating O'Donnell, hitherto seen as no more than a backroom White House fixer, to the status of key player- \"it's like making Rosencrantz or Guildenstern the lead in Hamlet\", one joked - but it has angered the American military by suggesting they tried to corral the Kennedys into all-out war.</p> <p>The furore has also raised awkward questions about the role O'Donnell's family played behind the scenes. His son Kevin, an internet tycoon, helped bankroll a buyout of Beacon Entertainment, which made the movie, and appears to have been the partial inspiration for promoting his father - played by Kevin Costner - to the role of the \"ordinary Joe\" hero audiences identify with.</p> <p>Nor has the symbolism of Costner, the star of Oliver Stone's incendiary JFK, playing Kennedy's closest aide been lost on the army of JFK conspiracy theorists who suspect a rogue military element had a hand in the president's assassination. For one of O'Donnell's few notable utterances after leaving the White House was to confirm their pet suspicion that Kennedy intended pulling US special advisors out of Vietnam as soon as he won the 1964 election.</p> <p>If that were not enough, 13 Days has reopened divisions over the Kennedys' place in history: whether they should be remembered as self-serving charlatans or flawed martyrs to the mission to make America a fairer and less racist place.</p> <p>Up till now O'Donnell, the \"gate keeper\" to the Oval Office, who controlled the president's diary, has been known, if at all, as the man who looked the other way as a procession of actresses led by Marilyn Monroe were smuggled into the West Wing. Even Angie Dickinson, who memorably described her own hurried congress with JFK as \"the greatest 30 seconds of my life\", could not recall his name when questioned by Seymour Hersh for his bestselling demolition job, The Dark Side Of Camelot.</p> <p>It was this notion of him as a procurer of women for Kennedy that has long rankled with O'Donnell's family, and prompted his daughter Helen to write A Common Good: The Friendship of Robert F Kennedy and Kenneth P O'Donnell.</p> <p>Roger Donaldson, the film's Australian director, readily admits some liberties were taken with O'Donnell, particularly in scenes where he gives pep talks to pilots about to overfly Cuba, but insists he played a much greater role in resolving the crisis than he has been credited with. He denies, however, that his family exercised any undue influence on the script. \"Kenny's son is a friend of our producer Armyan Bernstein, but he only got involved in Beacon long after work on the film had begun and he did not call the shots. The film is accurate to the spirit as well as to the letter of what went on. Kenny O'Donnell was not the sort of man to boast about what he did. Maybe because he let others tell that story he has been somewhat forgotten.</p> <p><b>One of their own</b><br></p> <p>\"He was a tough cookie, discreet, and regarded as family by the Kennedys. He was one of their own, one of the Boston Irish Mafia. Most of the script is taken verbatim from the Oval Office tapes and Kenny O'Donnell is always there in the background and he had the Kennedys' ear.\"</p> <p>O'Donnell had the Kennedys' trust. He managed Jack's senate and presidential campaigns and according to veteran White House correspondent Haynes Johnson \"was the perfect aide - tight-lipped, shrewd, tough, totally loyal and never hesitant to say exactly what he thought.\"</p> <p>\"You see Kenny?\" Jack Kennedy once told a campaign correspondent, pointing to O'Donnell asleep on a plane. \"If I woke him up and asked him to jump out of this plane for me, he'd do it.\"</p> <p>His relationship with Bobby, whom the president charged with finding a way out of the crisis, was closer still. The two were room and teammates at Harvard, where O'Donnell, as quarterback of the football team, once scored a winning touchdown playing with a broken leg.</p> <p>In his book, With Kennedy, Camelot's spindoctor-in-chief Pierre Salinger describes O'Donnell as having \"had the greatest responsibility, influence and accessibility to the president\". Donaldson said that having listened to the Oval Office tapes, and talked to McNamara and Kennedy's speechwriter Ted Sorenson, he was convinced O'Donnell was more than an appointments secretary.</p> <p>Others beg to differ. Chief among these is one of the film's own historical consultants, Graham Allison, professor of international affairs at Harvard and author of Essence Of Decision, a study of the crisis. \"There's no evidence that O'Donnell played any such role. This is an invention, encouraged a little by O' Donnell's recollections. Many people remember about historical events that they played a bigger role than they did. I give the film high marks in other areas, particularly in its depiction of the difficulty of the task faced by the president, but not where O'Donnell is concerned.\"</p> <p>However, the film's co-producer Peter Almond is adamant O'Donnell's role was much wider than his title suggested. \"O'Donnell's portfolio did not formally include foreign policy or national security affairs. But O'Donnell did have one of only two adjoining offices to the Oval Office, was a member of JFK's ExComm [Executive Committee of the National Security Council] and did attend meetings at the president's request.</p> <p>\"The thing is, no one knows everything that was said, or who said it,\" Almond said. \"While there is a taped record of a number of the ExComm meetings, there were also plenty of discussions in small groupings. We do know from memoir accounts, that Kennedy expressly asked O'Donnell to be at all the meetings where the president was in attendance and offer candid comments in private afterwards.\"</p> <p>The two men who know better than most what went on those informal gatherings, McNamara and Sorenson, will only say that were \"some historical inaccuracies are inevitable with a movie\". But as two of the chief keepers of the Camelot flame they pronounced themselves happy with film overall. McNamara, long saddled with much of the blame for Vietnam, must be particularly pleased at his portrayal as chief peacenik alongside the US ambassador to the UN, Adlai Stevenson.</p> <p>Kennedy biographer Richard Reeves's criticisms were much more specific. He said O'Donnell's only memorable recorded contribution to the discussions was his initial belief that Cuba meant nothing to the electorate. \"Kennedy walked through O'Donnell's office with the aerial photos from the U-2 spy planes under his arm and said, 'You still think that fuss about Cuba is unimportant?'</p> <p>\"'Absolutely,' said O'Donnell. 'The voters won't give a damn about Cuba.'</p> <p>\"Kennedy unrolled the photos and O'Donnell said, 'I don't believe it,' to which the president responded: 'You better believe it'.\"</p> <p><b>Honest film</b><br></p> <p>Reeves who also disputes whether O'Donnell was a member of ExComm, concedes that the film tries its best to be honest. \"If the film were not made, a lot of people would never think about what happened, how close we came, or see John F Kennedy as anything but the playboy of the western world. Compared with most of the junk being made these days, 13 Days is practically Thucydides.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, like Allison, he claims the depiction of the military as a Dr Strangelovian, rightwing clique, eager to manoeuvre the Kennedys into all-out war, does not quite tally with the facts. \"The chairman of the joint chief of staffs, Maxwell Taylor, was a Kennedy ally - Robert Kennedy named one of his sons Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy.\"</p> <p>Even so, some of the most melodramatic, Strangelove moments are true. The hawkish Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay, who later stood with the ultra-rightwinger George Wallace for the White House, did indeed say that the \"big red dog is digging in our backyard and we are perfectly right to shoot him\" and growled that the \"the Kennedys are going to destroy this country\".</p> <p>According to Almond, they also cut one scene straight from the White House tapes where the joint chiefs of staff exchange meaty profanities about the president when he walks out of the room. \"It was so over the top, as if to suggest we were making them look bad.\"</p> <p>Another priceless moment from the tapes, when LeMay pounded the table and bellowed, \"It's the greatest defeat in our history!...We should invade today!' after the deal was agreed with Moscow, was also excised for the same reason.</p> <p>Neither Khrushchev nor the Cubans get much of a look-in, which may be just as well for Fidel as it now appears he urged the Soviet Union to attack.</p> <p>Although the film has been well received, with some caveats, in the States, Donaldson said he was surprised that the most vehement attacks came from Britain. \"I hold no particular torch for the Kennedys myself. I had to go to New Zealand to avoid being called up for Vietnam. But it is very noticeable how we were accused of rewriting history in Britain before a single shot was in the can. There is no doubt the name Kennedy divides people, and there seems to be a real resonance here. Obviously, their father did not win many friends here during his ambassadorship leading up to the last war, and a lot of residual hostility against them is that they were seen as interlopers, being the first non-White Anglo Saxon Protestants in the White House.</p> <p>Costner, who co-produced the film and fought for several years through six directors to have it made, makes no bones about his admiration for Camelot and is convinced the film will claw back a little of the dirt the Kennedys have been caked in. \"If you didn't see Ali fight, you didn't know how great he was,\" he said. \"If you didn't see John Wayne in Red River or Liberty Valance, you didn't know how good he could be. And for me, this movie offers us the opportunity to drop some of our cynicism and see one of the moments when Jack and Bobby Kennedy became golden.\"</p> <p>\u0095 13 Days opens on March 16 in London and from March 23 nationwide</p>",

If that were not enough, 13 Days has reopened divisions over the Kennedys' place in history: whether they should be remembered as self-serving charlatans or flawed martyrs to the mission to make America a fairer and less racist place. Up till now O'Donnell, the \"gate keeper\" to the Oval Office, who controlled the president's diary, has been known, if at all, as the man who looked the other way as a procession of actresses led by Marilyn Monroe were smuggled into the West Wing. Even Angie Dickinson, who memorably described her own hurried congress with JFK as \"the greatest 30 seconds of my life\", could not recall his name when questioned by Seymour Hersh for his bestselling demolition job, The Dark Side Of Camelot. It was this notion of him as a procurer of women for Kennedy that has long rankled with O'Donnell's family, and prompted his daughter Helen to write A Common Good: The Friendship of Robert F Kennedy and Kenneth P O'Donnell. Roger Donaldson, the film's Australian director, readily admits some liberties were taken with O'Donnell, particularly in scenes where he gives pep talks to pilots about to overfly Cuba, but insists he played a much greater role in resolving the crisis than he has been credited with. He denies, however, that his family exercised any undue influence on the script. \"Kenny's son is a friend of our producer Armyan Bernstein, but he only got involved in Beacon long after work on the film had begun and he did not call the shots. The film is accurate to the spirit as well as to the letter of what went on. Kenny O'Donnell was not the sort of man to boast about what he did. Maybe because he let others tell that story he has been somewhat forgotten. One of their own \"He was a tough cookie, discreet, and regarded as family by the Kennedys. He was one of their own, one of the Boston Irish Mafia. Most of the script is taken verbatim from the Oval Office tapes and Kenny O'Donnell is always there in the background and he had the Kennedys' ear.\" O'Donnell had the Kennedys' trust. He managed Jack's senate and presidential campaigns and according to veteran White House correspondent Haynes Johnson \"was the perfect aide - tight-lipped, shrewd, tough, totally loyal and never hesitant to say exactly what he thought.\" \"You see Kenny?\" Jack Kennedy once told a campaign correspondent, pointing to O'Donnell asleep on a plane. \"If I woke him up and asked him to jump out of this plane for me, he'd do it.\" His relationship with Bobby, whom the president charged with finding a way out of the crisis, was closer still. The two were room and teammates at Harvard, where O'Donnell, as quarterback of the football team, once scored a winning touchdown playing with a broken leg. In his book, With Kennedy, Camelot's spindoctor-in-chief Pierre Salinger describes O'Donnell as having \"had the greatest responsibility, influence and accessibility to the president\". Donaldson said that having listened to the Oval Office tapes, and talked to McNamara and Kennedy's speechwriter Ted Sorenson, he was convinced O'Donnell was more than an appointments secretary. Others beg to differ. Chief among these is one of the film's own historical consultants, Graham Allison, professor of international affairs at Harvard and author of Essence Of Decision, a study of the crisis. \"There's no evidence that O'Donnell played any such role. This is an invention, encouraged a little by O' Donnell's recollections. Many people remember about historical events that they played a bigger role than they did. I give the film high marks in other areas, particularly in its depiction of the difficulty of the task faced by the president, but not where O'Donnell is concerned.\" However, the film's co-producer Peter Almond is adamant O'Donnell's role was much wider than his title suggested. \"O'Donnell's portfolio did not formally include foreign policy or national security affairs. But O'Donnell did have one of only two adjoining offices to the Oval Office, was a member of JFK's ExComm [Executive Committee of the National Security Council] and did attend meetings at the president's request. \"The thing is, no one knows everything that was said, or who said it,\" Almond said. \"While there is a taped record of a number of the ExComm meetings, there were also plenty of discussions in small groupings. We do know from memoir accounts, that Kennedy expressly asked O'Donnell to be at all the meetings where the president was in attendance and offer candid comments in private afterwards.\" The two men who know better than most what went on those informal gatherings, McNamara and Sorenson, will only say that were \"some historical inaccuracies are inevitable with a movie\". But as two of the chief keepers of the Camelot flame they pronounced themselves happy with film overall. McNamara, long saddled with much of the blame for Vietnam, must be particularly pleased at his portrayal as chief peacenik alongside the US ambassador to the UN, Adlai Stevenson. Kennedy biographer Richard Reeves's criticisms were much more specific. He said O'Donnell's only memorable recorded contribution to the discussions was his initial belief that Cuba meant nothing to the electorate. \"Kennedy walked through O'Donnell's office with the aerial photos from the U-2 spy planes under his arm and said, 'You still think that fuss about Cuba is unimportant?' \"'Absolutely,' said O'Donnell. 'The voters won't give a damn about Cuba.' \"Kennedy unrolled the photos and O'Donnell said, 'I don't believe it,' to which the president responded: 'You better believe it'.\" Honest film Reeves who also disputes whether O'Donnell was a member of ExComm, concedes that the film tries its best to be honest. \"If the film were not made, a lot of people would never think about what happened, how close we came, or see John F Kennedy as anything but the playboy of the western world. Compared with most of the junk being made these days, 13 Days is practically Thucydides.\" Nevertheless, like Allison, he claims the depiction of the military as a Dr Strangelovian, rightwing clique, eager to manoeuvre the Kennedys into all-out war, does not quite tally with the facts. \"The chairman of the joint chief of staffs, Maxwell Taylor, was a Kennedy ally - Robert Kennedy named one of his sons Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy.\" Even so, some of the most melodramatic, Strangelove moments are true. The hawkish Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay, who later stood with the ultra-rightwinger George Wallace for the White House, did indeed say that the \"big red dog is digging in our backyard and we are perfectly right to shoot him\" and growled that the \"the Kennedys are going to destroy this country\". According to Almond, they also cut one scene straight from the White House tapes where the joint chiefs of staff exchange meaty profanities about the president when he walks out of the room. \"It was so over the top, as if to suggest we were making them look bad.\" Another priceless moment from the tapes, when LeMay pounded the table and bellowed, \"It's the greatest defeat in our history!...We should invade today!' after the deal was agreed with Moscow, was also excised for the same reason. Neither Khrushchev nor the Cubans get much of a look-in, which may be just as well for Fidel as it now appears he urged the Soviet Union to attack. Although the film has been well received, with some caveats, in the States, Donaldson said he was surprised that the most vehement attacks came from Britain. \"I hold no particular torch for the Kennedys myself. I had to go to New Zealand to avoid being called up for Vietnam. But it is very noticeable how we were accused of rewriting history in Britain before a single shot was in the can. There is no doubt the name Kennedy divides people, and there seems to be a real resonance here. Obviously, their father did not win many friends here during his ambassadorship leading up to the last war, and a lot of residual hostility against them is that they were seen as interlopers, being the first non-White Anglo Saxon Protestants in the White House. Costner, who co-produced the film and fought for several years through six directors to have it made, makes no bones about his admiration for Camelot and is convinced the film will claw back a little of the dirt the Kennedys have been caked in. \"If you didn't see Ali fight, you didn't know how great he was,\" he said. \"If you didn't see John Wayne in Red River or Liberty Valance, you didn't know how good he could be. And for me, this movie offers us the opportunity to drop some of our cynicism and see one of the moments when Jack and Bobby Kennedy became golden.\" \u0095 13 Days opens on March 16 in London and from March 23 nationwide",

      "body": "<p>The journalist, writer and broadcaster John Diamond, who has died aged 47, did not battle his illness bravely. Nor was he courageous in the face of death. He developed cancer and, despite treatment, it killed him. </p> <p>As he wrote in his bestselling book, C: Because Cowards Get Cancer Too, first published in 1998: \"I despise the set of warlike metaphors that so many apply to cancer. My antipathy has nothing to do with pacifism, and everything to do with a hatred for the sort of morality which says that only those who fight hard against their cancer survive it, or deserve to survive it - the corollary being that those who lose the fight deserved to do so.\" </p> <p>It was the kind of clear-eyed opinion, acutely expressed, which John's enormous circle of friends and colleagues had come to expect of him. </p> <p>It was a horrible irony that the illness which eventually ended his life was also, professionally, the making of him. He was successful before, of course; he was well-known around media London as the master of the quickly delivered opinion piece, first person or otherwise, to a tight deadline. His career as a radio and television presenter was burgeoning, and he had earned enough money to indulge his fetish for electronic gadgetry, fine tailoring or overpowered motorbikes, on which he rarely went further than the corner shop. </p> <p>But the column he published in his regular slot in the Times, in April 1997, in which he announced that a lump on his neck had been diagnosed as a cancerous tumour, changed everything. </p> <p>As he continued to chart the course of his illness, through treatment to terminal diagnosis and beyond, there was a growing realisation among both readers and editors that his immense fac- ility for language, previously expended for the most part on the smallest of domestic issues, had disguised a writer of immense talent and skill. His column won him a prestigious What the Papers Say award, and his book was received with glowing reviews, both of which events gave him huge pleasure. </p> <p>John Diamond was born in Stoke Newington, north London, the son of a biochemist and a fashion designer, and one of three brothers. He remained close to his family, and was particularly proud of his secular Jewish upbringing, which informed almost all of his opinions. Though he travelled far from his childhood in east London - a serious shlep by taxi to Hammersmith - he liked people to know that he had started a long way outside the media world of which he became such a part. </p> <p>Though he would eventually receive an honorary doctorate from Middlesex University, he was not good at exams. A scholarship to the City of London school was withdrawn after he failed his O-levels, and he left at 16 to work as a solicitor's clerk. He managed, after passing a few exams in his spare time, to gain a place at teacher training college, and for four years taught drama and English at a girl's school in Hackney. </p> <p>After leaving teaching he broke into journalism by joining a company that published newsletters about the property business. His boss wrote a column about property for the Sunday Times, and, during a three-week holiday, asked John to take it over in his absence. There, displaying the kind of chutzpah for which he became rightly famous among his friends, he went about the paper announcing himself as the deputy property editor and offering pieces on almost anything other than property. Within a few weeks he was working regularly on the Sunday Times magazine. </p> <p>John's tastes were essentially as eclectic as those of the editors who commissioned him. A member of the Labour party from the age of 16, he did write a column on politics for the Daily Mirror, under the short-lived editorship of his friend Roy Greenslade, but, for the most part, his work was on the softer side; he wrote about everything and anything - from travel, cigars and cars, to the role of the fax machine in modern life and the importance of a good whisky in a man's life. </p> <p>He had the true hack's hunger for the byline, and he would no doubt have found it galling that his death would give a number of his friends and rivals the opportunity for one the day after. </p> <p>Until his illness literally stole his tongue, he was also a regular presenter on BBC radio, his talent for which was recognised by the judges in the Sony Radio Awards. A feverish interest in technology led to his presenting a series of Tomorrow's World, columns in computer magazines - for which he won awards - and, in the days before the rest of Fleet Street had properly mastered the machinery, a way of winning extra time if ever he was running close to a deadline. </p> <p>If the circumstances called for it, he would file a first paragraph by modem - and then just hit a few random keys on the keyboards. The frantic editor would call John on his mobile to be told that something must have gone wrong with the modem, that he was away from home but would be able to refile on his return, thus winning him the extra time he needed. </p> <p>If his copy sometimes arrived a little close to deadline, it was always worth waiting for. The decision to start writing about his cancer was, he later said, not a particularly calculated one. His brief at the Times had been to write about the minutiae of domestic life; he simply felt that it would have been dishonest if, in the week of his diagnosis, he had written about anything else. </p> <p>It came at a curious time in British journalism, when every paper seemed to have a columnist writing about their disease or personal trauma. In the Observer, Ruth Picardie was recording the progress of the breast cancer that would eventually kill her, and some critics argued that there was now an almost ghoulish appetite among editors for dispatches from the very edges of mortality. John's answer was the sheer quality of his prose. </p> <p>In recent years, he had begun to write an always witty column for the Jewish Chronicle and, after his diagnosis, had even joined a synagogue - though this, he told friends, was not because he had discovered God. He remained an atheist to the end, but, he said, he wanted his children, Cosima and Bruno, to know something of the Judaism into which they had been born. </p> <p>Until surgery on his tongue forced him to contribute to conversations through swiftly scribbled notes, John was regarded by many inside the worlds of journalism, politics and the arts in which he moved, as a fabulous wit and raconteur. It was no accident that the summer parties he threw with his second wife, the journalist and cookery writer Nigella Lawson, were attended, in turn, by the famous whom he so enjoyed collecting around him, and who, in return, so loved him. </p> <p>In the summer of 1999, there was another John and Nigella party, this time thrown for them by the architect Lord Rogers, and his wife, Ruthie. It was, we were told, to mark 10 years of their relationship, though, as John had only recently been informed that his condition was terminal, it was clear we were celebrating an extraordinary life as well as a marvellous marriage. </p> <p>A crowd of more than 200 people, including a number of New Labour cabinet ministers and half the authors on the Waterstone's bestseller lists, stood in the great vault of Lord Rogers's minimalist home as John, now essentially mute, made an extraordinary speech of thanks to everybody for their support by writing on to an overhead projector beamed up on to the wall. </p> <p>I saw him last just before Christmas. He had complained in print that friends who had been asked to write his obituaries were refusing to show them to him, as though they were some gift not to be opened until the big day. He had seen this one, written some time ago, but had made no comment at all. I asked him now what he thought of it, and he scribbled me a message on his pad. \"I just hope they're not paying you for it on publication,\" he wrote, with delicious optimism. I was able to reassure him that they weren't. </p> <p>We should, I suppose, be thankful that the gap between the commissioning of this article and its publication was so much longer than any of us had dared hope on the warm summer's night he gave his speech at Richard and Ruthie Rogers's house. </p> <p><strong>Roy Greenslade writes:</strong> I was standing at the Groucho club bar a month or so ago when I overheard a man whisper to his friend: \"There's John Diamond over there. What a remarkable guy, eh?\" The friend nodded, mumbling something indistinct about his bravery. Over the past couple of years, I heard those kinds of remark, sincerely said and sincerely meant, so often I lost count. </p> <p>Indeed, I found myself saying it too, in spite of John's strictures about his not being courageous. He had cancer, he would say, and he was trying to live his life as well as possible in difficult circumstances. </p> <p>He also did it in the most public way, telling his story in weekly instalments in a memorable Times column so poignant and so witty it was difficult not to end each one with a tear in one's eye. As the drama of his disease and treatment unfolded, so his exploration of his own condition became deeper and more intense. Yet he rarely allowed his humour to be infected by sentimentality, a quality he brought to his book, which was rightly pronounced by Melvyn Bragg as a classic. </p> <p>I know that many people found his candour uplifting. It wasn't that he offered hope in the face of a terminal disease, a foolish notion, but that his wit and his fortitude exemplified the triumph of the human spirit in adversity. He would not only have smiled at such pomposity, he would surely have debunked it. But the guy had style, and nothing illustrated that better than the way he dealt with his illness. </p> <p>From the first moment I met him, I was hooked. I was delighted when he agreed to write a column for the Daily Mirror, and just as happy to sacrifice my editorship on his behalf when I was ordered to fire him. We left together, and I was delighted when he soon began to prosper as a columnist. It took him a little time to find his true voice but when he did so, he had a confidence that never deserted him. </p> <p>I have rarely known anyone so prolific. A week or so ago, he left me in his kitchen to go upstairs \"for 10 minutes and finish a column\". When he returned after half an hour, I gently chided him for taking so long. With a Cheshire grin smile, he explained he'd written a second column as well. That made Nigella smile too. </p> <p>Theirs was a very special relationship, a unique combination of personalities in which, from the moment they met, they intuitively realised the best in each other. </p> <p>\u0095 John Diamond, writer, journalist and broadcaster, born May 10 1953; died March 2 2001</p>",

Sunlight was streaming in on the terracotta tiles, on the ochre, buff-brown, faded yellow, washed-out, burnt sienna walls and fittings, and on the crisp, white tablecloths, glinting glasses and heavy-duty French accents. And all the while, above the sleek sounds of the hi-fi system, you could just catch the distant murmur of traffic whizzing up and down Woodstock Road, Oxford. I knew it was Woodstock Road because I had spent some part of the morning going up and down it in search of La Gousse d'Ail. In fact, it was only on about the fourth sweep that I spotted the very tasteful sign on the site of what had formerly been the Lemon Tree. </p> <p>I was meeting my brother, the Heron, for a rare fraternal lunch, and presently he arrived, all flushed and puffing and lamenting the inadequacy of travel arrangements from the station. A glass of fine German wheat beer soon put paid to his ululation, and he settled down contentedly to work his way through the menu with the odd \"Cor, crikey\" and \"Hmmm\". </p> <p>La Gousse d'Ail is very new. It is the handiwork of Jonathan Wright and his wife, Jane - Jonathan used to be master chef at Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons, where, for several years, he was the chief interpreter of Raymond Blanc's culinary vision and in charge of a team of 30 or so chefs; now, he has a mere eight, but the restaurant is smaller, and it is his own, so he can play with the food how he likes. </p> <p>It is clear from the moment that you enter that this is no struggling prentice outfit. It is a restaurant with ambitions and very considerable sophistication. It may be too early to say that La Gousse D'Ail will achieve parity with the restaurant side of Le Manoir, but it seems to be aiming that way. The wine list is fat with good bottles, and a few well-priced ones, too, while the menu has a distinct upper-echelon, stars-and-garters feel to it. What else can you make of terrine of foie gras and confit duck on press\u00e9 riesling jelly and quince, or of roasted fillet of Cornish sea bass, \u00e9tuv\u00e9e of braised fennel and artichokes, bouillabaisse jus and chorizo sausage? </p> <p>The general style of the food is highly wrought and very complex. In fact, it seemed to me that half of what appeared on the plate didn't get a mention in the menu rubric, but then, I suppose, each dish would have needed a whole chapter to itself if they had. Take the warm salad of skate with oyster beignets, new potato salad and smoked herring cream with which I officially launched myself on lunch. That's enough to be getting on with, you might have thought, but the little quenelles of salt cod topped with substantial mounds of Sevruga caviar never got a mention. Neither did the extra shredded skate that had been moulded like a cannelloni. Neither did . . . well, there was a lot more going on in streaks and whirls and mounds and quenelles, and the trouble is you start thinking, oh my gosh, where shall I start? </p> <p>I began with the beignets of oysters, which were plump chappies within an exemplary light, crisp batter - better eat those quick, or they'll go soggy. Then it was on to what turned out to be the salt cod quenelles with caviar on top. Next, I dipped my finger into the various streaks and whirls of different sauces. Finally, I got to the skate. </p> <p>It was like eating a whole sequence of dishes on the same plate. Come to think of it, it was a whole sequence of dishes on the same plate. The question is, did they all coalesce into a great unified gastronomic experience? In this case, I'm not sure that they did, although the individual parts were terrific. </p> <p>This approach worked better with the Heron's marinated aubergines with roasted langoustine ravioli, verbena vinaigrette, langoustine oil and aged balsamic vinegar, a dish in which the variety of textures and flavours on display blended together in a beguiling polyphony, sweet and gently acid, firm and squidgy, fruity and herbal. </p> <p>After that, the Heron had ballotine of boned oxtail braised in Hermitage wine sauce with poached ox tongue and a parsnip mousseline, which represented an apotheosis of all his favourite parts of an ox. I, meanwhile, settled down to a civet of hare, of which I have no official description as it wasn't on the menu but it was mentioned in passing by the waiter as we gave our order. I switched to the civet from the roasted saddle of venison with caramelised endives, celeriac pur\u00e9e, sauce grande veneur and almond emulsion that I'd had my eye on. That almond emulsion, I thought, sounded a useful trick, but the notion of hare was irresistible - as, indeed, was the dish: beautifully hung, beautifully cooked, teasing out the gamey flavour. There were a mass of accoutrements on the plate alongside, and dozens more slashes and sauces. This was a magnificent, faultless dish, effortful though it was, each shred of flavour building in layers to a superbly structured mouthful. </p> <p>The Heron's view of the oxtail was almost as eulogistic. However, it caused him to wax nostalgic about our grandmother's monumental dishes of braised oxtail, recalling fondly how the chunks of meat fell away from the bone and how we would suck the bones and how all this was part of the oxtail experience - and, by the way, did oxtail, in itself, really warrant the lavish treatment it was getting here? Still, he didn't leave so much as a smear on his plate. </p> <p>We just about had room for pudding, he the hot fondant with bitter chocolate, pistachio ice cream and espresso sauce, I for an apricot and almond tart, both of which were as expertly conjured up as the courses that went before. </p> <p>I find myself in something of a quandary about La Gousse d'Ail. I like the place a lot. I like the notion of being transported to the sunshine of Provence from the suburbs of Oxford. I like the cheerful professionalism of the staff - they work almost as hard as the food. And I like the food a great deal. But I can't quite love it. It is difficult to do justice to so complicated constructions in a review, but each and every dish was so effortful, and seemed to make similar demands of the eater, that I couldn't help wishing that there were one or two elements fewer on the plate. All that whizz-bangery demanded attention, particularly as there tended to be quite a pause between courses. </p> <p>It all made for an exceedingly pleasant and leisurely fraternal lunch, though we had to pay the bill in something of a hurry when we suddenly realised that we had places to go and people to see before nightfall. The bill was a princely \u00a383.50 for the food, with a bit more for the wine. (I will not give details on consumption because we rather treated ourselves; not in quantity, which was modest, but in quality, which was magnificent. Oh, all right then, it was a bottle of Barolo Vigna Farina 1990, and I don't often come across one of those.) That \u00a383.50 is, in fact, pretty modest for cooking of such ambition and accomplishment. Even more generous are the fixed-price lunches - two courses for \u00a319.50, three for \u00a322.50.

It was full of the upright columns and fat globes of many species, but was backed by a great tree, Magnolia campbellii , in dramatic full bloom, even though it comes from rainforests in the Darjeeling area of India.

The aesthetics of the situation could not efface the sheer wrong-headedness of such a wildly inappropriate juxtaposition. </p> <p>And it has to be admitted that going against nature may be costly. It may entail installing irrigation, which will use up water resources. There are some wealthy landowners on the Cte d'Azur in the south of France, for instance, or maybe in Texas, who will insist on having an English lawn, although the climate is entirely against one, since the soft, bright green lawn grasses hate a hot, dry climate. So they are liberally irrigated, but this leads to the prevalence of fungal diseases. The poor gardener, who has to ensure the lawn remains a showpiece for his employer to entertain his envious friends on, has a nightmare task. </p> <p>Another disadvantage of lawn irrigation is that the water spray doesn't keep to the lawn but spreads to surrounding borders, and this precludes the use of such obviously suitable plants as agaves and aloes, because irrigation is anathema to them.

To be truthful, there was a moment in that summer of 1995 when many plants, even though carefully chosen, looked unhappy. But they very soon recovered when autumn arrived.

Margot Fonteyn learned to dance here, Auden and Isherwood inspected the nightlife and the Japanese forced the city to join the Empire of the Sun. Ultra-red Maoists declared a people's commune here and the Gang of Four made it their base.</p> <p>Shanghai has always been in the vanguard of change and since the death of Mao it has changed radically again. In Beijing next week, the National People's Congress will gather to discuss China's future: Shanghai already knows where it is going.</p> <p>Last week, in a room with dazzling lights hung in dense crystal, the mayor, Xu Kuangdi, flashed his own dazzling smile and announced the latest plan. Shanghai is to become \"East Asia's biggest semi-conductor production base\" within five years. But how did the city make this remarkable transition from semi-colonialism to semi-conductors, and can its momentum be maintained?</p> <p>Shanghai's main feature is the ability to do everything at the same time: new and old industry, commerce and services surge ahead at 2% above the national growth rate. Shanghai has more coffee bars than any other city in China, more high-rise buildings (more than 1,800), more supermarkets and department stores.</p> <p>\"This is the place to come back to,\" says one of the hundreds of young Chinese who have collected their Masters in Business Administration (MBAs) from the US or Britain, \"but I cannot recognise it.\"</p> <p>For the Guardian and for myself, it is also a place to come back to. Last month The Guardian set up its China office in Shanghai rather than Beijing, calculating that the country can best be watched from the \"dragon's head\" of the Yangtze. Shanghai may be among the most advanced, but just a few hours away by bus are the \"backward\" provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui, upstream along the dragon's body.</p> <p>The last resident Guardian correspondent filed from Shanghai in the late 1930s. H J Timperley was an Australian journalist and friend of Edgar Snow, author of the classic Red Star Over China. \"Tim\" wrote an equally powerful but less remembered book, What War Means, documenting the Nanjing massacre by the Japanese army in December 1937.</p> <p>My own experience of Shanghai began 30 years ago in April 1971, on a tour organised by the Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding. It was the midpoint of the cultural revolution and we were only the second group from Britain to visit.</p> <p>Even though the Red Guard struggles were over, Shanghai was still a tense place.

      "bodyText": "It was the Paris of the East, the commercial hub of the Orient and the place where Mao Zedong and comrades founded the Communist party. Margot Fonteyn learned to dance here, Auden and Isherwood inspected the nightlife and the Japanese forced the city to join the Empire of the Sun. Ultra-red Maoists declared a people's commune here and the Gang of Four made it their base. Shanghai has always been in the vanguard of change and since the death of Mao it has changed radically again. In Beijing next week, the National People's Congress will gather to discuss China's future: Shanghai already knows where it is going. Last week, in a room with dazzling lights hung in dense crystal, the mayor, Xu Kuangdi, flashed his own dazzling smile and announced the latest plan. Shanghai is to become \"East Asia's biggest semi-conductor production base\" within five years. But how did the city make this remarkable transition from semi-colonialism to semi-conductors, and can its momentum be maintained? Shanghai's main feature is the ability to do everything at the same time: new and old industry, commerce and services surge ahead at 2% above the national growth rate. Shanghai has more coffee bars than any other city in China, more high-rise buildings (more than 1,800), more supermarkets and department stores. \"This is the place to come back to,\" says one of the hundreds of young Chinese who have collected their Masters in Business Administration (MBAs) from the US or Britain, \"but I cannot recognise it.\" For the Guardian and for myself, it is also a place to come back to. Last month The Guardian set up its China office in Shanghai rather than Beijing, calculating that the country can best be watched from the \"dragon's head\" of the Yangtze. Shanghai may be among the most advanced, but just a few hours away by bus are the \"backward\" provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui, upstream along the dragon's body. The last resident Guardian correspondent filed from Shanghai in the late 1930s. H J Timperley was an Australian journalist and friend of Edgar Snow, author of the classic Red Star Over China. \"Tim\" wrote an equally powerful but less remembered book, What War Means, documenting the Nanjing massacre by the Japanese army in December 1937. My own experience of Shanghai began 30 years ago in April 1971, on a tour organised by the Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding. It was the midpoint of the cultural revolution and we were only the second group from Britain to visit. Even though the Red Guard struggles were over, Shanghai was still a tense place. Slogans hung up over shopfronts denounced \"the evil wind of capitalism.\" A mass shelter-building campaign was under way, in deference to Mao Zedong's instructions to \"prepare against war\". At a machine tool factory, the \"revolutionary\" atmosphere was intense. \"The workers don't smile,\" I noted at the time. \"[The managers] say nervously that they are asking the 'broad masses' to criticise them.\" Thirty years on, I ask a European diplomat where Shanghai is heading now. He gives Mr Xu a warm testimonial: \"You get a clear sense of a strong united leadership in Shanghai with a common sense of purpose.\" Shanghai, he adds, has the 38th most powerful computer in the world. Then, as so often with questions about Shanghai, caution sets in. \"The authorities are on a learning curve with entry to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). We have to dampen expectations; this is not the place for the first time exporter.\" The Guardian's new office is in a small estate of 1930s houses which would not be out of place in Weybridge, save for the fact that they are overlooked by high-rise blocks. The community that lived there was destroyed in the cultural revolution, when the capitalists and cadres (government officials) were exiled to the countryside and the houses were partitioned. There are still traces of room partitions and of cooking stoves on the verandah. Pedicarts collecting scrap ring their bells for custom. But more houses are being renovated as the property market picks up and there is talk of widening Huashan Road nearby - formerly Avenue Haig on the edge of the British Settlement. Today the Peace Hotel - formerly the famous Cathay hotel - is about to sell off a substantial share to the Mandarin hotel chain owned by the Jardine Group. That is Jardines of opium-trading fame, one of the biggest British companies in pre-communist Shanghai. The old ferry to Pudong, then a marshy waste but now the pride of Shanghai's future, is still running. Passengers pay 50 cents (4p) to board the rusty deck along with pedicarts carrying huge loads and migrant workers but the journey back may now be made by the sensational Bund Tourist Tunnel - tickets 20 yuan (\u00a31.70) - starting at the foot of the Oriental Pearl TV Tower.

      "bodyText": "Two former high-security prisoners, including one wrongly convicted of IRA offences, were yesterday awarded damages for injuries they received from prison officers during one of the most audacious and carefully planned escape attempts of the past 10 years. A third man who was also jailed for IRA terrorist offences had his claim dismissed. The men were in a party of six prisoners who briefly escaped from the special secure unit of the new \u00a358m Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire in 1994, wounding one prison officer with a gun. It was considered to be one of the most serious lapses of security since the spy George Blake escaped from Wormwood Scrubs in 1966. The men were all arrested within minutes and the three said they had been punched, kicked or beaten with batons by the prison officers as they were taken back to the segregation unit. The Home Office argued that all the injuries were escape-related. A report by Sir John Woodcock, the chief inspector of constabulary, concluded at the time that the breakout was \"a disaster waiting to happen\" and criticised poor management at every level of the prison service, including that of Home Office ministers. As well as the two guns used in the escape a kilogram of Semtex was found in the grounds. The incident led to a huge public row between the then home secretary, Michael Howard, and the then head of the prison service, Derek Lewis, about where responsibility lay. In a three-hour judgment in the high court yesterday Mr Justice Crane accepted the claims of Danny McNamee, 40, and Andrew Russell, 38, an armed robber, for assault and battery or misfeasance of public office. But he rejected the claim of Liam McCotter, 37, who has completed a 15-year sentence imposed in 1988 for conspiracy to cause explosions. Mr McNamee, whose conviction for playing a part in the 1982 Hyde Park bombing was quashed in December 1998 on new evidence, was awarded \u00a35,000. He had protested his innocence for 12 years and was released under the Good Friday agreement. Russell, who is still serving a 20-year sentence for robbery and hijacking a helicopter for a jailbreak at Gartree prison, was awarded \u00a32,500. The judge found that the use of handcuffs on McCotter was reasonable force. The awards included aggravated damages but the judge declined to award exemplary damages against the Home Office because, he said, the prisoners had exposed themselves to the risk of injury. He praised the \"outstanding courage\" of the prison officers who gave chase. But he went on: \"Their courage does not, of course, justify any unlawful use of force.

Staff involved in the recapture of the prisoners put their own lives at risk in ensuring the protection of the public.\" A police inquiry into the complaints did not lead to any prosecutions and the men's own trials were abandoned after media coverage revealed the alleged IRA connections. Mr Justice Crane addressed public criticism of the men's civil action, which was legally aided and is likely to cost the taxpayer more than \u00a3500,000. \"Some people may take the view that if a group of armed prisoners escape from a prison, they should not be entitled to complain about any violence to them in the course of their recapture.

      "body": "<p>When Steve Forbes, two-time presidential candidate and multibillionaire publisher of the eponymous magazine, arrived at the cosy Greenwich village restaurant, nobody gave him a second glance. </p> <p>Few people in the United States, where Forbes magazine is a business bible, would be able to pick out its tall, greying owner in an identity parade. Yet, in spite of spending at least $60m (\u00a340m) on his attempt to lead the free world, Forbes doesn't seem to mind. When asked what he likes best about his post-campaign lifestyle, he says: \"Being able to eat at little Italian restaurants like this one.\" </p> <p>A year after giving up his battle for the Republican presidential nomination, Malcolm Stevenson Forbes Jr appears happy to be running his magazine and agitating for his pet political causes. </p> <p>His stiff face, with eyes that rarely blink, breaks into a smile when we talk about the impact this week's cover story on Tony Blair has had. Forbes Global ran an article on \"Red Tape Tony\", which personified the prime minister as the biggest threat facing Britain's entrepreneurs and infuriated Downing Street. A huge fan of Margaret Thatcher, or Lady T as he calls her, Forbes believes that the Blair government is undoing some of her good work. \"The UK is sitting on its laurels and the world is moving on,\" he says. </p> <p>Once he starts talking about the burdens of bureaucracy or the need to encourage business, Forbes becomes voluble. Otherwise, he appears almost shy and speaks with a staccato voice. </p> <p>None of these attributes are common in the average politician - especially one who aspires to the top job in the US. Forbes's personal behaviour appeared odd on the campaign trail, where he needed to be encouraged to press some flesh before giving speeches. Reports suggest he was happier going straight to the podium to talk about a few of his favourite things, such as a flat tax rate. A Forbes staffer was once asked on live television: \"Is your candidate an alien?\" </p> <p>Six years after Forbes ran in his first presidential race and a year after he stepped down from the last one, people still wonder why he did it. Marshall Whitman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, says: \"It was always a mystery why Steve Forbes didn't run for a lower office before president. The whole notion is that you at least run for dogcatcher before you run for the most powerful position in the world. Probably he thought those other offices were below him.\" </p> <p><strong>Filling a void</strong><br> </p> <p>Forbes himself blames \"happenstance\" for his decision to run for president. In 1995, Jack Kemp decided to drop out of the race for the Republican nomination, leaving those on the economic right wing of the party without a standard bearer. \"I never intended to go into politics,\" says Forbes. \"But I saw a vacuum and decided that, instead of complaining about it, I should fill it.\" </p> <p>His first candidacy caused quite a stir as his low taxation, pro-business message struck a chord with Republican voters. Last year, he dropped out in early February after coming third to both George Bush and senator John McCain. </p> <p>Not that Forbes sees the campaign as a defeat. In fact, he takes credit for the president's plan to cut $1.3 trillion from the tax bill. \"They would not have had it if I hadn't been running,\" he says. Bush annoyed the right wing of his party early on in the campaign by using \"Democratic language\" such as: \"We cannot balance the budget on the backs of the poor.\" This changed once Forbes decided to run, he says: \"When they realised they had a contest, they showed up their party face.\" </p> <p>He also takes credit for the administration's more vigorously anti-abortion stance and its more conservative approach to social security. \"The message did better than the messenger,\" he says. </p> <p>During lunch, it is easy to see where his true passion lies. Whenever there is a slight lull in the conversation, he returns to the economy and the issue of taxation. </p> <p>When asked what the focus of his work is now, he says: \"I'll be trying to get the Bush tax cut - a good one - through .. We have a job of agitation and education.\" </p> <p>Critics say self-interest played a part in his support for a flat tax of 17%. The Centre for Public Integrity, a non-profit research group, has estimated that the Forbes family itself would save \"millions\" from such a rate. The figures are less than precise partly because Forbes has refused to make his tax returns public, which he has the right to do as a private citizen rather than a politician. </p> <p>What the Forbes and Bush tax plans share, according to the centre, is that both benefit the top 1% of American earners. According to the centre's research, president Bush's own annual tax bill would have been cut from $3.8m to just over $10,000 as a result of the flat tax plan. </p> <p>Supporters of Forbes reject any suggestion of self-interest. They point out that the amount he has spent on the campaign more than outweighs any tax dodge on his estimated $450m wealth. </p> <p>Some more psychologically inclined pundits believe that Forbes's decision to run represents a sort of one-upmanship against his father. Malcolm Forbes Sr, the son of the magazine's Scottish immigrant founder and father of Steve, did run for office - he tried and failed twice to become governor of his home state of New Jersey. </p> <p>Undeterred, Forbes Sr - the Richard Branson of his age - embarked on a round the world trip via bike and hot air balloon. He escorted Elizabeth Taylor and had a renowned collection of Faberg\u00e9 eggs, among other trinkets. For his 70th birthday, he flew hundreds of guests to Tangiers, where he entertained them with 600 belly dancers and Berber horsemen. </p> <p>His eldest son has said: \"My father once spent $5m on a birthday party for himself. Why can't I spend a few more running for president?\" </p> <p>Steve Forbes still holds well-attended parties on the family's yacht and in its desirable Fifth Avenue townhouse, but flamboyant he is not. His entrance into the restaurant for lunch is typical of his entrances everywhere. </p> <p>Yet friends such as Lawrence Kudlow, the supply-side economist at ING Barings, vouch for a wry sense of humour and a fine line in self-deprecation. After the Guardian first tracked him down in a Starbucks coffee shop, Forbes sent something to make the office \"chuckle\" - a scarf printed with \"Capitalist Tool\", the company motto. </p> <p>Contrary to some newspaper reports, he also speaks warmly of his family. He has five daughters aged between 13 and 27 and has been married to the same women for 31 years. He says he likes working with his four brothers in the family business as they \"can learn things through osmosis\". </p> <p>He denies that his campaign suffered from an emphasis on politics rather than personality. \"What people want to see is whether you have what it takes to do the job. Nixon would never win a personality contest and he won.\" </p> <p>He cites the Watergate president a few times during lunch. \"In the information age, as Nixon demonstrated over 30 years ago, you don't necessarily need to either hold an office to .. impact an issue.\" </p> <p>There has been some speculation that he might run for governor or even senator of New Jersey. Forbes, however, says he is unlikely to run for any other political office any time soon. \"You never say never but certainly for the foreseeable future there are no plans to run,\" he says. </p> <p>Political analysts who believe that Forbes simply wanted a national stage for his right-wing agenda also doubt he would run for another political office. </p> <p>Peter Eisner, managing director of the Centre for Public Integrity, says: \"Forbes belongs to a group of right-wing ideological zealots. He knew that he could never win [the presidency] but he was able to use the platform to advance his causes.\" </p> <p>One thing Forbes is clear about is his continuing involvement in the family firm. Asked what he will be doing in 10 years' time, he says: \"That's a scary thought. It goes so bloody quick. I'm sure I'll still be involved in the magazine.\" As an afterthought, he adds: \"I never would have predicted the past 10 years.\" </p> <p>He joined the magazine company at 22, after graduating from Princeton. His credits as a journalist included co-founding a business magazine at university and writing a report which graded his teachers while in the fifth grade. </p> <p>He took over the magazine empire in 1990. Yet he genuinely appears to enjoy the life of a publisher. \"When an issue comes out it feels like a new child - you get that rush,\" he says. </p> <p>Staff believe he maintains firm editorial control over the magazine, which is renowned for its heavy editing. Forbes denies any undue influence. </p> <p>Forbes appreciates the platform the magazine gives him, with its estimated readership of 900,000. He continued to write his fortnightly column on the campaign trial, where he trained his sights on everything from Alan Greenspan and the European Union (both bad) to company matters and the latest New York restaurant. \"I have a curiosity to poke into everything and anything,\" he says. </p> <p>He has poked into UK politics several times, last time when he criticised Michael Portillo's tax-cutting plans as too lily-livered. He still gets worked up about the issue now. He calls the Tory plan a \"measly, skimpy skinny tax cut phased in over 500 years. If you're going to do it, make it real, make it something people can get excited about.\" </p> <p>His enthusiasm for Lady T seems to know no bounds. He saw her before Christmas and said: \"She's in fine form, she'd be ready to take over tomorrow.\" He is less warm about William Hague, but calls him extremely bright. The Tory leader did himself no favours when he met Forbes two years ago. \"The only thing he wanted to talk about was the Bushes, which obviously didn't please me very much.\" </p> <p>Although Forbes was invited to the president's first economic forum in January, few analysts were surprised that he was passed over for a post in the administration. He is sanguine about the fact. \"He has so many people he has to take care of,\" he says. \"I don't think anything will pop up for at least two or three years anyway.\" He does not intend to \"lobby for anything\" in the interim. </p> <p>He spends a lot of time travelling to speak at conservative-minded conferences and attending Republican bashes. Tomorrow he will be in Norfolk, Virginia, attending the inauguration of an aircraft carrier devoted to Ronald Reagan. </p> <p>He insists on paying for lunch and seems perfectly happy as he leaves the restaurant. \"I shall be agitating from the outside,\" he says with a smile.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p>  A garden from a hundred packets of seeds</p>",
      "byline": "James Fenton",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Herbs and Aromatics </strong></p> <p> This series began with the proposition that it might be a good idea to look at the kind of garden that could be made, on any site from a balcony upwards, using only 100 packets of seed. I have so far avoided flowers which, although they could well be raised from seed, are much better acquired as plants. </p> <p>The point is not to make things harder. The point, to recap, is to look at the flower garden at the beginning of the season as if it were a vegetable garden and ask simply: what do I want to grow this year? Forget design for a moment. Design has become a terrible, stupid and expensive tyrant. The emphasis here is all on content. Such a flower garden should have the same beauty as an allotment. It says: this is what I felt like having this year. </p> <p>If I feel like making myself an omelette fines herbes , I need equal quantities of finely chopped parsley, tarragon, chives and chervil. But where do I get the chervil? It is the slenderest, most delicate and wilting of herbs and I really must grow it if I am to have it. So, for this reason alone, Chervil takes its place as no 51, Anthriscus cerefolium . Cow parsley's kid brother, it will make no great impact on the garden, but the garden is where you need to have it. </p> <p>Chives (no 28) have already appeared as on this list, as has Dill (no 44). For Tarragon I would purchase a plant. Parsley (no 52) Petroselinum crispum , is of great interest in the flower garden. By parsley, I mean the curly-leaved traditional variety. On the allotment, when it runs to seed, it may seem a nuisance, but when it seeds itself near the kitchen door it is both handy and handsome. That green is beautiful. That leaf is beautiful too. </p> <p>Another herb you have to grow from seed if you are to have it is Summer Savory (no 53) Satureja hortensis . There is one thing to do with it (apart from various supposed medicinal uses with which I have no patience), but that one thing is excellent: it is served chopped with young broad beans, dressed with olive oil or butter. It is an annual like chervil. Winter Savory, Satureja montana , its perennial cousin, is a nice thing, but not really a substitute. </p> <p>Sorrel (no 54), Rumex acetosa , you will sometimes see in the shops, but packaged in such mean quantities one wonders what the vendors can possibly have in mind. This is a leaf that, on the slightest contact with heat, dissolves into gunge. A handful, stewed in butter, reduces almost to nothing. This \"nothing\" fills an omelette, or gets added to a chicken stock for a sorrel soup. For those Jane Grigsonish moments of summer, this is what you need. Again, the only practical way is from seed. </p> <p>Lovage, Levisticum officinale , comes in at no 55 although you may prefer to buy a small plant. It will stay with you, putting on a good six feet of growth in a year, before dying back. Like many of my favourite garden plants, it is an umbellifer, and it stands happily at the back of the flower border. The leaves are chopped into a salad when young - later in the season they become too tough and strong-tasting. The flavour is like celery. The books say it goes in casseroles or stocks. Take my advice: it will easily overwhelm a stock. Used in a salad, it stands up very well to a strong dressing of anchovy, garlic, lemon and olive oil. One is told to cut the stems back to provide a fresh supply of young leaves. But I like to have one or two salads in early summer, and then enjoy the plant for its gigantism. </p> <p>What is Borage for? Borago officinalis (no 56) is for distributing small flowers of pure sky blue around the garden. Admittedly, these blue flowers can look pretty in a salad, and there is the whole business of Pimms. But does anybody really grow Borage in order to add a cucumber taste to Pimms, when a slice of cucumber would do the trick just as well? Borage is a really useful and friendly self-seeder, an incomparable addition to the garden's informal look. The white version may be thought to miss the point somewhat, but it too is welcome with us. </p> <p>The various forms of culinary Sage are normally grown from cuttings, as is Rosemary, although the latter has seeded itself in my paving, and grown well there along with different thymes. This reminds one that a plant such as common Lavender, although easily bought, can be raised in quantity from seed, and that if you wanted a hedge of, for instance, no 57, Lavandula spica (or angustifolia ), \"Hidcote Blue\", this would be one way of acquiring it. </p> <p>I take it that Basil is more of a plant for the house, the windowsill, than for a garden in Britain. Even there, one is lucky to achieve anything approaching the herb as it grows in a hot climate. When I bought a bunch of basil from a farmer's market in New York, I was stopped in the street, it was so spectacular: woody at the base, and pungent enough to leave its smell on your hands and clothes. Ocimum basilicum (no 58) is the name: one can but try and try again. Chiltern Seeds list almost 20 varieties. </p> <p>Two final umbellifers for their garden beauty: Sweet Fennel, Foeniculum vulgare , in its bronze form, is no 59, a plant to smell in the heat of a Mediterranean day. At no 60 is Sweet Cicely, Myrrhis odorata , known once as Cow Chervil, Sweet-Humlock, Sweets or British Myrrh - \"very good for old people that are dull and without courage; it rejoiceth and comforteth the heart and increaseth their lust and strength\". </p> <p>\u0095 All seeds mentioned may be obtained from Chiltern Seeds, Bortree Stile, Ulverstone, Cumbria LA12 7PB.

      "bodyText": "Herbs and Aromatics This series began with the proposition that it might be a good idea to look at the kind of garden that could be made, on any site from a balcony upwards, using only 100 packets of seed. I have so far avoided flowers which, although they could well be raised from seed, are much better acquired as plants. The point is not to make things harder. The point, to recap, is to look at the flower garden at the beginning of the season as if it were a vegetable garden and ask simply: what do I want to grow this year? Forget design for a moment. Design has become a terrible, stupid and expensive tyrant. The emphasis here is all on content. Such a flower garden should have the same beauty as an allotment. It says: this is what I felt like having this year. If I feel like making myself an omelette fines herbes , I need equal quantities of finely chopped parsley, tarragon, chives and chervil. But where do I get the chervil? It is the slenderest, most delicate and wilting of herbs and I really must grow it if I am to have it. So, for this reason alone, Chervil takes its place as no 51, Anthriscus cerefolium . Cow parsley's kid brother, it will make no great impact on the garden, but the garden is where you need to have it. Chives (no 28) have already appeared as on this list, as has Dill (no 44). For Tarragon I would purchase a plant. Parsley (no 52) Petroselinum crispum , is of great interest in the flower garden. By parsley, I mean the curly-leaved traditional variety. On the allotment, when it runs to seed, it may seem a nuisance, but when it seeds itself near the kitchen door it is both handy and handsome. That green is beautiful. That leaf is beautiful too. Another herb you have to grow from seed if you are to have it is Summer Savory (no 53) Satureja hortensis . There is one thing to do with it (apart from various supposed medicinal uses with which I have no patience), but that one thing is excellent: it is served chopped with young broad beans, dressed with olive oil or butter. It is an annual like chervil. Winter Savory, Satureja montana , its perennial cousin, is a nice thing, but not really a substitute. Sorrel (no 54), Rumex acetosa , you will sometimes see in the shops, but packaged in such mean quantities one wonders what the vendors can possibly have in mind. This is a leaf that, on the slightest contact with heat, dissolves into gunge. A handful, stewed in butter, reduces almost to nothing. This \"nothing\" fills an omelette, or gets added to a chicken stock for a sorrel soup. For those Jane Grigsonish moments of summer, this is what you need. Again, the only practical way is from seed. Lovage, Levisticum officinale , comes in at no 55 although you may prefer to buy a small plant. It will stay with you, putting on a good six feet of growth in a year, before dying back. Like many of my favourite garden plants, it is an umbellifer, and it stands happily at the back of the flower border. The leaves are chopped into a salad when young - later in the season they become too tough and strong-tasting. The flavour is like celery. The books say it goes in casseroles or stocks. Take my advice: it will easily overwhelm a stock. Used in a salad, it stands up very well to a strong dressing of anchovy, garlic, lemon and olive oil. One is told to cut the stems back to provide a fresh supply of young leaves. But I like to have one or two salads in early summer, and then enjoy the plant for its gigantism. What is Borage for? Borago officinalis (no 56) is for distributing small flowers of pure sky blue around the garden. Admittedly, these blue flowers can look pretty in a salad, and there is the whole business of Pimms. But does anybody really grow Borage in order to add a cucumber taste to Pimms, when a slice of cucumber would do the trick just as well? Borage is a really useful and friendly self-seeder, an incomparable addition to the garden's informal look. The white version may be thought to miss the point somewhat, but it too is welcome with us. The various forms of culinary Sage are normally grown from cuttings, as is Rosemary, although the latter has seeded itself in my paving, and grown well there along with different thymes. This reminds one that a plant such as common Lavender, although easily bought, can be raised in quantity from seed, and that if you wanted a hedge of, for instance, no 57, Lavandula spica (or angustifolia ), \"Hidcote Blue\", this would be one way of acquiring it. I take it that Basil is more of a plant for the house, the windowsill, than for a garden in Britain. Even there, one is lucky to achieve anything approaching the herb as it grows in a hot climate. When I bought a bunch of basil from a farmer's market in New York, I was stopped in the street, it was so spectacular: woody at the base, and pungent enough to leave its smell on your hands and clothes. Ocimum basilicum (no 58) is the name: one can but try and try again. Chiltern Seeds list almost 20 varieties. Two final umbellifers for their garden beauty: Sweet Fennel, Foeniculum vulgare , in its bronze form, is no 59, a plant to smell in the heat of a Mediterranean day. At no 60 is Sweet Cicely, Myrrhis odorata , known once as Cow Chervil, Sweet-Humlock, Sweets or British Myrrh - \"very good for old people that are dull and without courage; it rejoiceth and comforteth the heart and increaseth their lust and strength\". \u0095 All seeds mentioned may be obtained from Chiltern Seeds, Bortree Stile, Ulverstone, Cumbria LA12 7PB.

      "body": "<p>For British followers of European cinema, Kenneth Rive is a name etched on the subconscious. Though few would be able to put a face to it, they have probably seen it, followed by the word \"presents\", in front of innumerable foreign films since the late 1950s - predominantly French movies but also those of Ingmar Bergman, Luis Bunuel, Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa. As founder of Gala Film Distributors, Rive is one of the most influential figures in British cinema. Now in his 80s, Rive introduced many of these directors to British audiences and counted many of them as friends. Closest to Rive was Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, four of whose films he is re-issuing this week. </p> <p>A signed photo of a smiling Truffaut has pride of place amid the tarnished Baftas, framed awards and elegant stationery in Rive's decidedly low-tech office in Islington, and Rive speaks of the man and his films with a mixture of adoration and pride. \"Oh, he was a very dear friend,\" says Rive. \"My beginnings as a distributor were really picking up him and the rest of the nouvelle vague. I handled all his films except two. Even the ones I didn't like.\" </p> <p>Rive met Truffaut just after the shooting of his feature debut, The 400 Blows. \"I saw a rough cut and it made a deep impression on me. It was the sort of film you don't walk out on. At the end you waited for the credits and you sat there for another 10 minutes, and then you got up.\" Rive snapped up distribution rights to the film, which went on to win Truffaut the best director award at Cannes in 1959 and became a landmark film of its era. </p> <p>Truffaut was renowned for his contempt for \"impecunious middlemen\", but Rive was obviously spared this. He witnessed the director's more controversial activities, such as Truffaut's closing down of the Cannes film festival in 1968 (he was part of the protest that led to the setting up of directors fortnight at Cannes). But whatever confrontations they may have had are long forgotten. \"People tend to think he was dark in his personality but... how can I describe him? He always looked to me as if he was enjoying life. When I first met him, he was really struggling, he was always short of money. He invited me up to his apartment round the corner from the Champs Elys\u00e9es for a snack. It was a tiny little place, didn't even have a bathroom. But it had a terrace on top where he used to sit. You could look across and see the Eiffel Tower. I think it used to inspire him.\" </p> <p>Their friendship blossomed with their careers. Truffaut's next film, Shoot the Pianist, performed only moderately; but 1961's Jules et Jim was a great success, playing in London for more than a year. At the same time, an unprecedented number of European film-makers were coming on to the scene, and Gala took on most of them: Alain Resnais, Claude Lelouch, Claude Chabrol, Eric Rohmer and Marcel Pagnol. And, beyond France, Fellini's La Dolce Vita and 8 1/2, Vittorio De Sica's Two Women - which introduced Sophia Loren to this country - and the entire catalogue of Ingmar Bergman. </p> <p>Since many of these directors' films ran into trouble with British censors, Rive met a lot of them. \"I was very proud to have met Jean Cocteau when we were having trouble with a release of Les Enfants Terribles. I went to see him in Paris and when I got there I thought I had the wrong address. It was a dirty old staircase, there was a pram in the hall, and the smell of cats was overpowering. When I got to the top, there he was with Jean Marais, both of them with cats on their shoulders and cats running around everywhere. He had some skin infection he'd picked up from them. He was very persuasive but wildly eccentric. </p> <p>\"Bergman was always difficult too. He refused to make any cuts to his films. Tremendously talented guy, but always peculiar. He always said he'd come to the premiere of his films but he never did. At the last minute he'd always disappear. He had terrible trouble with his bowels, though - perhaps that's why. He was always being taken short somewhere.\" </p> <p>Rive's purchases seem prescient in hindsight, but, he confesses, it was less a matter of strategy than a combination of good timing and lack of choice. The son of a cameraman, he had grown up with cinema. As a child star in the 1920s, he appeared in high-profile German films such as William Dieterle's Behind the Altar, and Rasputin, starring Conrad Veidt. After the war, he became a projectionist at a \"fleapit\" in Tottenham Court Road, which he later bought. As an aspiring film exhibitor in the 1950s, there were few alternatives to such a move, he says, since the circuit for British and American films was a virtual duopoly between ABC and Rank Corporation. The only other option was the foreign market, which was also dominated by other distributors. \"So where could I start? I thought: 'Nobody's showing any Soviet films, and they must have a market somewhere.' So I popped along to their embassy and I spoke to an attach\u00e9 and he asked if I wanted to go to Russia. So off I went.\" Rive came back from Moscow with three films (including a Russian ballet film called Gala Festival, from which the company took its name), plus a five-year contract for the exclusive distribution of Russian films. </p> <p>This success enabled Rive to expand his cinema chain along with the distribution side, giving Gala the clout to bid for those other European classics. \"British cinema? It didn't exist. They made crap movies really. So did the Americans, apart from the big blockbusters, and that's why we survived so well in those days. People wanted to see something a bit more intelligent. There was some cachet to subtitled films. If you hadn't seen the last Truffaut, you hadn't lived. But America and Britain started to make some very good movies again, more art films, and that was it. People got fed up with subtitles.\" </p> <p>Gala has still had successes since the 1960s, such as Claude Berri's Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources, Truffaut's The Last Metro, Kieslowski's Short Films About Killing and Love, and Erick Zonca's The Dream Life of Angels. But the golden age is over. Today, multiplexes, a dwindling art-house circuit, higher overheads and shorter cinema runs have made life hard for distributors of foreign films. And when a popular foreign film does come along, the independents are often outgunned by American companies. \"If I'd had the money, I'd have snapped up Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,\" Rive says. \"But we're just not big enough. We were in negotiations, but in the end it was too expensive. Columbia was big enough to take it on, and voila! - today's top foreign film in the UK.\" </p> <p>Of course, with so many classics in Gala's back catalogue, Rive's future is by no means bleak. \"I'm a great believer in DVD,\" he says. \"There'll always be the first run in the big cities, but for the wider audience DVD and video are the only way they're going to get to see these films. But one way or another, people will always want to see them.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Truffaut tribute is at the Curzon Soho, London W1 (020-7734 2255), today and tomorrow.</p>",

      "body": "<p>How long had it been since I'd been out late on the Lower East Side? Back in the New Wave Bohemian days of the late 1970s and early 80s, the Lower East Side was the capital of mischief. The low life was still literary. I could be persuaded to go anywhere in search of an authentic urban experience. But then my friends grew up, and I moved far away, as Europe seemed to me at the time. Because I don' t drink and run wild any more, because I now live down a dirt track in the English countryside, a Manhattan roomful of the young and the smooth can be intimidating. </p> <p>But the reggae club the summer before last was known as a chill lounge. Rona let her hair hang over the beat. We were waiting for Billie. I was telling myself not to have a hard time waiting. I was looking forward to my session with that inner-child finder, marijuana. The reggae swelled around me. My head bobbed like a duck's when there's bread on the water. I saw what looked like a ballet dancer's leg. Billie, and a Billie who knew the score. Her opening drink would not take long. We were going to step outside. We couldn't smoke pot in this reggae club. Not even in a reggae club? That's how long it had been since I'd been out late on the Lower East Side. </p> <p>Street lamps threw a spotlight over pedestrians crossing Second Avenue. Killer taxis left unpleasant gusts. I leaned into the summer heat. Soon we three were alone in the dark of Sixth Street. Rona checked behind her. Then, like backup singers on the downbeat, Billie and I snapped glances over our right shoulders. Maybe some people wouldn't have bothered, but we were pros. We were veterans of the streets. Rona fired one up, and we passed it. We were chatting. I hogged it. We were drifting towards midnight. Billie handed it back to Rona. Three shapes in front of a doorway decided to heckle us: \"You're having a good time.\" They sounded like unappetising old kids. We moved to the curb. \"We know what you're doing.\" </p> <p>Rona pushed her hand against the air to let them know that the joke, whatever it was, had to stop. \"Smoke it.\" We shook our heads at their being so boisterous when they were maybe getting high themselves, and in a doorway, of all places. We should have looked ahead instead of behind. </p> <p>We saw the corner and we saw the big man in the white-guy plaid shorts cutting a pigeon-toed diagonal from across the street. Everything about him was aimed towards us. His bright white sneakers continued to rise and fall in our direction. A huge meat-packing arm was held out to us, and a big voice was coming at us, too. His other arm came out of his undershirt with a square of ID. We had to keep moving toward him, like something swirling down a drain. There now seemed to be enough light for a film crew's night shoot. How could we have missed the blue unmarked van parked on the other side of Sixth Street? </p> <p>\"Been smoking something?\" No answer. \"Put your hands flat on the trunk of this car.\" The women, my friends, were side by side at the back of the car. I was on the sidewalk and had to bend over. Other undercovers quickly appeared. \"We're going to empty your pockets.\" A woman had taken up position behind Rona and Billie. I felt a hand go into my pocket. My total financial assets held by a faded money clip hit the trunk of the car. \"Did you all just meet tonight?\" a new voice demanded. \"No.\" My own voice was thin and completely lacking in the authority of outrage. The money clip was followed by a pack of menthol cigarettes, a disposable lighter, a case containing reading glasses, a John Coltrane/Johnny Hartman CD - \"You listen to some good music,\" a head of hair said - and a mobile phone. \"Where's your beeper?\" He patted me down. \"You got a beeper?\" \"No,\" came the thin reply. </p> <p>The detectives murmured. They'd found the smallest stub of weed in a matchbox in Rona's pocket. The woman detective left. The detective with the hair asked the ladies to step over to the sidewalk. Where Plaid Shorts had, like me, the beginnings of his father's stomach, this one had pecs and biceps rolling out of a magenta tank top. He looked like a television actor in the role of maverick cop. The rest of him was in the suburban version of casual: crisp bluejeans and clean sneakers. </p> <p>\"So you guys just met tonight?\" Tank Top asked. It was my turn. He was going to compare answers. Plaid Shorts said he was going over to the van to check something. \"How do you know each other?\" Tank Top demanded. \"School.\" If he identified us as middle class, wouldn't he have to watch himself? Maybe I was trying to prick some white blue-collar resentment, anything to turn the tables a little. </p> <p> When he asked about my bleeper, I thought maybe he hoped he'd interrupted something good, criminally speaking, such as a black dude giving two white chicks a taste of the street herb they were about to buy or get ripped off for. But if he saw that we were OK, then the paperwork on the citation that they give out in these cases would speed up. One black guy with gray in his beard and one and a half white girls, not two, because by that time they must have figured out that Billie's honey skin and the Asian cast to her eyes and her Church of England accent were some weird Caribbean story. Yes, officer, I wanted to explain, the one with the henna highlights is a famous Jewish scientist, the daughter of the British Commonwealth is a banker, and I'm a black guy who needs two pairs of glasses and won't be on your computer lists, not even a credit rating. </p> <p>Billie and Rona had shown no emotion until Plaid Shorts brought the handcuffs. Then they gave out soft, pastel exclamations. Plaid Shorts led them, affronted and vulnerable, across the street to the side door of the van. I thought, Rona's daughter walks just like her. I felt my watch being removed. Tank Top put my arms behind me and pushed my hands high up my back. I felt the metal around my wrists. I thought of my parents and how they would hurl themselves into this if they found out. I felt and heard the handcuffs lock. </p> <p> <strong> I</strong> thought of my parents and their lawsuits. Back in the good old days, they'd sued our hometown police department to force it to desegregate, and when that worked they sued the fire department - things they did in their spare time, as good citizens, as blacks of their generation, members of the NAACP rank and file. Injustice had only to ring their doorbell and they were off to the poorhouse. And there was frivolous me, letting a white man put me in handcuffs for something other than protest. I remembered what my father had said to my tears at my sister's memorial, the year before: \"Keep it together.\" </p> <p>But I was in shock. \"I'm going to be sick.\" I was starting to list from side to side. \"Have you been drinking?\" \"No.\" I was going deaf. \"I'm going to pass out.\" Tank Top gripped me just below the right armpit and we started off. But my feet waited before they followed my legs. The world broke into silent, colourful particles. I got to the door and fell flat into the van. Rona's face floated. I began to hear her. I concentrated on finding her face in one place, something I could get up for and move toward, even if only on my knees. \"Don't hurt him,\" Rona and Billie called. \"I'm trying to help him,\" Tank Top countered. </p> <p>Keep it together, I chanted to myself. Not because I was a black man in handcuffs in front of two white guys; not because I was powerless, which made it all the more necessary at least to imitate the examples of dignity in confrontations with the police which I'd witnessed; and not because I was a grown man losing it in front of two women who, though in handcuffs, were trying to defend me. But because they were my friends. They were the ones with children at home. I crawled over to my friends in the seatless, windowless rear of the van, dripping sweat on them. </p> <p>Plaid Shorts yanked the van into the street. Because we couldn't grab, and there was nothing to grab on to, we rolled into Alice-down-the-rabbit-hole positions and rolled again when Plaid Shorts hit the gas. \"This is such bullshit,\" Billie said to the ceiling. \"This sucks,\" Plaid Shorts said, but he wasn't talking to us. He looked across at Tank Top. \"You got that right.\" \"A big one,\" Plaid Shorts added. \"Hate it,\" Tank Top said to his window. \"Total bullshit.\" Rona had dusted off her repertoire of apt facial expressions. This one said, \"Are these guys for real?\" \"Five years, man and I'm out,\" Plaid Shorts said. \"I just can't wait to do my band.\" He did a near wheelie around a corner. We shouldered back up into sitting positions pretty expertly after two corners. Tank Top took some gum from the dashboard and said he had to keep at this bullshit until he could pay off his wife. He told Plaid Shorts that instead of alimony he was offering his wife a once-in-a-lifetime, can't-refuse lump sum. \"It's like a buyout.\" </p> <p>The acid-driven power chords of Pink Floyd took over the van. Rona's expression said, \"These guys are too much.\" \"They're wild,\" Billie's eyes said back as she looked for the place behind her where the music was blaring from. Maybe the detectives were trying to tell us something. Not that they were nice guys who regrettably had to do their job but that they were better than the job they'd been reduced to doing, and that they too had aspirations. The Rolling Stones came on next, and Plaid Shorts sang along. The music was perhaps meant to say that they weren't uncool, redneck cops having a blast at the expense of the liberal, the black, and the in-between. </p> <p>I was too ashamed to be sympathetic. Being addressed as \"sir\" by Tank Top only after I had shown weakness and fear - that was humiliating. A cop could go off at any time. I'd thought of that and had been afraid, and there was no way to take it back. And for what had I lost my self-respect? For an offence the detectives thought beneath their training. What did you do last night? Oh I was picked up for a reefer and I fainted like a man. The van went up one street and down another. We couldn't see much, but most likely we were driving around and around as various undercover operations didn't work out. On one dark corner we waited so long in the van by ourselves that we almost slept. </p> <p>The van door slid open, and in the shaft of light Tank Top was helping a Hispanic woman, maybe in her 50s, climb aboard the bummer bus. \"Hey, officer,\" she said when we were under way. \"My hands are too hot.\" The detectives parked and helped Rona and Billie out. Tank Top said, \"I'm going to loosen these tight cuffs, like you asked.\" Then he turned off the lights, slammed the door, and left me with this woman who made unsavoury sounds in the dark. I thought she was trying to ditch her vials of crack and the detectives would then claim they were mine. I went over on my side, practising the I-was-asleep defence. They put Rona and Billie back in the van, turned on the lights, drove off, stopped again, and got out by themselves. As soon as the doors closed, the Hispanic woman, who had freed her hands, whipped out a big bag of heroin, snorted it on her knees, and deftly worked her hands back into the cuffs. Rona was laughing in disbelief. Quietly, the Hispanic woman zoned sidewise. The detectives, when they got back in, firmly looked straight ahead. </p> <p>The next time the van door opened, a Hispanic man, maybe also in his 50s, climbed in. A dark Rasta youth was pushed in after him. \"Ooh,\" the Hispanic guy said, and tried to shift himself. He nodded greetings of solidarity. What he'd been oohing about hit Rona's hygiene radar first. It made delicate Billie draw in her legs. The gleaming Rasta youth sprawled before us had matted dreadlocks that looked like what comes from the back of a furnace when its filter is changed. Maybe I should have thought harder about this being someone's son, but the stench was overpowering. Meanwhile, he kept up a stream of Babylon raas claat denunciations of the police. He shouted curses on the white man. I thought, Rasta, my brother in the Garvey, you are on your own. The detectives paid him no mind. They'd made their quota for the shift. </p> <p>We'd been smoking a joint right around the corner from the local precinct house, that's how hip we were. The detectives took us inside and the handcuffs came off. After three hours, it was a relief to see my fingers. Tank Top took me and the Rasta youth upstairs to a grotty corridor, and the strip search began. He made the Rasta youth wait in the shadows at the end. He ordered me to hand him my clothes item by item. I was to turn around, bend over, and drop my shorts. He said quickly that that was enough. I was to take off my socks and turn them inside out. \"Get dressed.\" He asked if I'd ever been arrested. No. He said he would try to tell me what was going to happen. I thought I understood. He motioned to the Rasta and sent me downstairs. He and the Rasta followed moments later. Tank Top had returned my property, except for the phone and the CD. Such stuff had to go to the lockup at Central, he explained. If that was the case, then the Rasta youth had a prayer shawl and a Torah for Central to deal with. Tank Top tried to talk when he took my fingerprints. \"So what kind of things do you write?\" After that, he had paperwork to finish. Now and then, he would dial a telephone number, mutter, hang up, and shrug. A clock kept vigil over a wall of \"Most wanted\" leaflets. </p> <p>When Plaid Shorts announced that we were moving around five o'clock in the morning, the Hispanic man asked how much money I had on me. I'd covered the money clip with my hand when Tank Top passed it to me, but clearly, I hadn't been quick enough. The Hispanic man said I couldn't bring in anything where we were going, because it would get taken off me. He informed Plaid Shorts, who agreed that I'd get robbed. Rona put my belongings, even my glasses, in her pocket. My property would be safer in the woman's section, the Hispanic man advised as we were put back into handcuffs and then linked to one another. I was made to lead our daisy chain of handcuffs through the precinct's main room. As Plaid Shorts increased the pace, two officers by the front door erupted into grunting song. \"Working on the chain gang, uh.\" </p> <p>We hopped out of the van into a street that was still dark. A semicircle of light waited for us to approach. This was the Tombs, that place I'd heard about, read about. Two more daisy chains of prisoners joined ours as Tank Top, having rung twice, banged on the metal grating over the entrance. It rolled up. Plaid Shorts and Tank Top surrendered us in a series of rapid clipboard signatures. When I realised that they intended to abandon us at this concrete threshold, I wanted to ask them when they planned to read us our rights. I'd begun to think of them as our undercovers. They were responsible for us. But they were gone, and we were across the line, and the metal grating was coming down. </p> <p> <strong> I</strong> followed a black female corrections officer's rump up some stairs. A black male corrections officer unhooked everybody. My eyes stayed on Rona and Billie when they were ordered to move to the other side of the corridor. The women went in one direction, the men in another. Green bars streamed along either side of me as I hurried both to keep up with the corrections officer who was now taking us down to the basement and to keep ahead of someone whose footsteps menaced my heel. </p> <p>The Rasta youth and I were directed into the last cell of the long jail. I insinuated myself on to the narrow metal bench that went from the bars of the cell to the rear wall, where it made a right angle toward the partition that hid the toilet. Nine mute, tired faces emphasised how cramped and stuffy the tiny cell was. One man was curled up asleep under the bench. </p> <p>I didn't want to look too intently at the other men in judicial storage, in case to do so meant something I could not handle the consequences of. I also didn't want to look away too quickly when my gaze happened to meet someone else's. However, no one was interested in hassling the new arrivals. Men were waking up, and their banter competed with the locker-room-type noise coming from the corrections officers' oblong station desk. A short white girl with thick glasses and a rolling lectern called my name. She said the interview was to determine who was eligible for bail, but the questions also separated the wheat from the chaff, socioeconomically speaking. Some guys probably had no job, no taxable weekly income, no address, no mother's address. She lost patience with the Rasta youth's decent background. \"Education? How far did you get in school?\" A community college degree. Her head was tilted up toward the spectacle of his hair. \"We'll say grade 15.\" </p> <p>Some time later, the Rasta youth and I were summoned again. But again we were going only a few yards. A black corrections officer shooed aside someone blocking the door of the new cell, which was large and, sneaked glances told me, held some huge dudes. Fresh apprehension was bringing my body to something like exocrine parity with the Rasta youth's. I didn't know what to expect, and so tried to prepare for the worst. We were shoulder to shoulder on a metal bench, like crows shuffling on a telephone wire. The move to this restless population had to be the final, dangerous descent, the reason I'd crammed my watch into my glasses case and handed everything off to Rona. </p> <p>A black youth with his hair in tight break braids called out to a new arrival, my Hispanic comrade. \"Come on in.\" The black youth's knuckles looked as big as Mike Tyson's. \"They took the murderers out early.\" He slapped five with a couple of his hulking neighbours and concerned himself with what he could see of his reflection in the metal bench between his thighs. He said something more. I didn't hear what it was, but it must have been wicked. </p> <p>A black corrections officer reversed himself and glared through the green bars. \"What?\" \"Nothing, Mo,\" the black youth said loudly, evenly. Only one of his neighbours giggled. \"Say what, chump?\" He was going for the keys at his hip. \"You say something?\" He was so agitated that he couldn't get his key in. He was as tall as a basketball power forward. Everything he said was a variation of \"You want to say something?\" The cell door flew open, and in a few steps the corrections officer was over the massive head of twinkling black braids. \"A real man would say something now.\" He waited for an answer. I could see him shaking. The black youth wasn't going to feed him any lines or provocation. The corrections officer pivoted towards the door. He had a baton on his belt, but no gun. He made a satisfied noise with his keys. </p> <p>It was not an impressive performance. I knew that. The corrections officer hadn't come up with any good lines. He just kept repeating himself. I could tell that all 24 of my cellmates were thinking how off the hook the corrections officer had been to raise up - the lingo was coming to me - on somebody like that. I was getting excited, feeling that I was on the verge of bonding with the other guys in our high and hip judgment against the corrections officer. He didn't meet our rigorous standards when it came to \"reading\" someone on the street manner. The black youth with the oiled, sparkling braids delivered our verdict: \"Definitely bugging behind something.\" </p> <p>The black corrections officer flung the metal door so hard it bounced against the cell bars and rode back some. Giant steps put him in a place that blocked my view of the black youth. Spit was dancing from his head, pinwheel fashion, as he roared, \"If I started to kick your black ass now, where would your black ass be next week?\" I couldn't remember when I had seen such sudden rage. It stopped all other activity in the basement. The tendons in his neck were ready to explode. I couldn't begin to think what his nostrils might be doing. Maybe our survival molecules were not the only ones to have been put on alert. Some of his colleagues had come by to monitor the situation. They turned back in a way that indicated they'd respect some code not to interfere. The cell was very still as the corrections officer made his exit. The street judgment was in the silence. Nobody wanted to look at him until he'd made his point. He had shown how dangerous was his longing to have a reason to lose control. </p> <p>The corrections officer's brown skin looked glazed, as though it had been fired in a kiln. He didn't seem to know how to finish his scene and stood wheezing by the bars. I almost thought he was going to mellow into the dispersal of balm-and-poultice phase of tough love. The mask of the shock-tactics practitioner would drop. He'd apologise, give advice, tell the young brothers how he was once on his way to being where they were. The black corrections officer said: \"Remember. I'll be going home at four o'clock. You'll still be here. You're in jail. I'm not.\" </p> <p> Maybe I should have taken into account the possibility that he had seen and had a lot of trouble doing his job. Maybe he and the black youth already had a story going and I'd missed what started it. But that didn't matter. Only what he'd said about four o'clock mattered. It wasn't even nine o'clock in the morning yet. My Hispanic comrade was looking at me. He took his eyes heavenward and clasped his hands. Then he shot me an inaudible laugh. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,445604,00.html \" target=\"_new\">Read part II of this story</a></p> <p> \u0095 Darryl Pinckney is the author of the novel High Cotton (Faber &amp; Faber) and is currently working on a book about modern African-American literature which will be published next year.

He told Plaid Shorts that instead of alimony he was offering his wife a once-in-a-lifetime, can't-refuse lump sum. \"It's like a buyout.\" The acid-driven power chords of Pink Floyd took over the van. Rona's expression said, \"These guys are too much.\" \"They're wild,\" Billie's eyes said back as she looked for the place behind her where the music was blaring from. Maybe the detectives were trying to tell us something. Not that they were nice guys who regrettably had to do their job but that they were better than the job they'd been reduced to doing, and that they too had aspirations. The Rolling Stones came on next, and Plaid Shorts sang along. The music was perhaps meant to say that they weren't uncool, redneck cops having a blast at the expense of the liberal, the black, and the in-between. I was too ashamed to be sympathetic. Being addressed as \"sir\" by Tank Top only after I had shown weakness and fear - that was humiliating. A cop could go off at any time. I'd thought of that and had been afraid, and there was no way to take it back. And for what had I lost my self-respect? For an offence the detectives thought beneath their training. What did you do last night? Oh I was picked up for a reefer and I fainted like a man. The van went up one street and down another. We couldn't see much, but most likely we were driving around and around as various undercover operations didn't work out. On one dark corner we waited so long in the van by ourselves that we almost slept. The van door slid open, and in the shaft of light Tank Top was helping a Hispanic woman, maybe in her 50s, climb aboard the bummer bus. \"Hey, officer,\" she said when we were under way. \"My hands are too hot.\" The detectives parked and helped Rona and Billie out. Tank Top said, \"I'm going to loosen these tight cuffs, like you asked.\" Then he turned off the lights, slammed the door, and left me with this woman who made unsavoury sounds in the dark. I thought she was trying to ditch her vials of crack and the detectives would then claim they were mine. I went over on my side, practising the I-was-asleep defence. They put Rona and Billie back in the van, turned on the lights, drove off, stopped again, and got out by themselves. As soon as the doors closed, the Hispanic woman, who had freed her hands, whipped out a big bag of heroin, snorted it on her knees, and deftly worked her hands back into the cuffs. Rona was laughing in disbelief. Quietly, the Hispanic woman zoned sidewise. The detectives, when they got back in, firmly looked straight ahead. The next time the van door opened, a Hispanic man, maybe also in his 50s, climbed in. A dark Rasta youth was pushed in after him. \"Ooh,\" the Hispanic guy said, and tried to shift himself. He nodded greetings of solidarity. What he'd been oohing about hit Rona's hygiene radar first. It made delicate Billie draw in her legs. The gleaming Rasta youth sprawled before us had matted dreadlocks that looked like what comes from the back of a furnace when its filter is changed. Maybe I should have thought harder about this being someone's son, but the stench was overpowering. Meanwhile, he kept up a stream of Babylon raas claat denunciations of the police. He shouted curses on the white man. I thought, Rasta, my brother in the Garvey, you are on your own. The detectives paid him no mind. They'd made their quota for the shift. We'd been smoking a joint right around the corner from the local precinct house, that's how hip we were. The detectives took us inside and the handcuffs came off. After three hours, it was a relief to see my fingers. Tank Top took me and the Rasta youth upstairs to a grotty corridor, and the strip search began. He made the Rasta youth wait in the shadows at the end. He ordered me to hand him my clothes item by item. I was to turn around, bend over, and drop my shorts. He said quickly that that was enough. I was to take off my socks and turn them inside out. \"Get dressed.\" He asked if I'd ever been arrested. No. He said he would try to tell me what was going to happen. I thought I understood. He motioned to the Rasta and sent me downstairs. He and the Rasta followed moments later. Tank Top had returned my property, except for the phone and the CD. Such stuff had to go to the lockup at Central, he explained. If that was the case, then the Rasta youth had a prayer shawl and a Torah for Central to deal with. Tank Top tried to talk when he took my fingerprints. \"So what kind of things do you write?\" After that, he had paperwork to finish. Now and then, he would dial a telephone number, mutter, hang up, and shrug. A clock kept vigil over a wall of \"Most wanted\" leaflets. When Plaid Shorts announced that we were moving around five o'clock in the morning, the Hispanic man asked how much money I had on me. I'd covered the money clip with my hand when Tank Top passed it to me, but clearly, I hadn't been quick enough. The Hispanic man said I couldn't bring in anything where we were going, because it would get taken off me. He informed Plaid Shorts, who agreed that I'd get robbed. Rona put my belongings, even my glasses, in her pocket. My property would be safer in the woman's section, the Hispanic man advised as we were put back into handcuffs and then linked to one another. I was made to lead our daisy chain of handcuffs through the precinct's main room. As Plaid Shorts increased the pace, two officers by the front door erupted into grunting song. \"Working on the chain gang, uh.\" We hopped out of the van into a street that was still dark. A semicircle of light waited for us to approach. This was the Tombs, that place I'd heard about, read about. Two more daisy chains of prisoners joined ours as Tank Top, having rung twice, banged on the metal grating over the entrance. It rolled up. Plaid Shorts and Tank Top surrendered us in a series of rapid clipboard signatures. When I realised that they intended to abandon us at this concrete threshold, I wanted to ask them when they planned to read us our rights. I'd begun to think of them as our undercovers. They were responsible for us. But they were gone, and we were across the line, and the metal grating was coming down. I followed a black female corrections officer's rump up some stairs. A black male corrections officer unhooked everybody. My eyes stayed on Rona and Billie when they were ordered to move to the other side of the corridor. The women went in one direction, the men in another. Green bars streamed along either side of me as I hurried both to keep up with the corrections officer who was now taking us down to the basement and to keep ahead of someone whose footsteps menaced my heel. The Rasta youth and I were directed into the last cell of the long jail. I insinuated myself on to the narrow metal bench that went from the bars of the cell to the rear wall, where it made a right angle toward the partition that hid the toilet. Nine mute, tired faces emphasised how cramped and stuffy the tiny cell was. One man was curled up asleep under the bench. I didn't want to look too intently at the other men in judicial storage, in case to do so meant something I could not handle the consequences of. I also didn't want to look away too quickly when my gaze happened to meet someone else's. However, no one was interested in hassling the new arrivals. Men were waking up, and their banter competed with the locker-room-type noise coming from the corrections officers' oblong station desk. A short white girl with thick glasses and a rolling lectern called my name. She said the interview was to determine who was eligible for bail, but the questions also separated the wheat from the chaff, socioeconomically speaking. Some guys probably had no job, no taxable weekly income, no address, no mother's address. She lost patience with the Rasta youth's decent background. \"Education? How far did you get in school?\" A community college degree. Her head was tilted up toward the spectacle of his hair. \"We'll say grade 15.\" Some time later, the Rasta youth and I were summoned again. But again we were going only a few yards. A black corrections officer shooed aside someone blocking the door of the new cell, which was large and, sneaked glances told me, held some huge dudes. Fresh apprehension was bringing my body to something like exocrine parity with the Rasta youth's. I didn't know what to expect, and so tried to prepare for the worst. We were shoulder to shoulder on a metal bench, like crows shuffling on a telephone wire. The move to this restless population had to be the final, dangerous descent, the reason I'd crammed my watch into my glasses case and handed everything off to Rona. A black youth with his hair in tight break braids called out to a new arrival, my Hispanic comrade. \"Come on in.\" The black youth's knuckles looked as big as Mike Tyson's. \"They took the murderers out early.\" He slapped five with a couple of his hulking neighbours and concerned himself with what he could see of his reflection in the metal bench between his thighs. He said something more. I didn't hear what it was, but it must have been wicked. A black corrections officer reversed himself and glared through the green bars. \"What?\" \"Nothing, Mo,\" the black youth said loudly, evenly. Only one of his neighbours giggled. \"Say what, chump?\" He was going for the keys at his hip. \"You say something?\" He was so agitated that he couldn't get his key in. He was as tall as a basketball power forward. Everything he said was a variation of \"You want to say something?\" The cell door flew open, and in a few steps the corrections officer was over the massive head of twinkling black braids. \"A real man would say something now.\" He waited for an answer. I could see him shaking. The black youth wasn't going to feed him any lines or provocation. The corrections officer pivoted towards the door. He had a baton on his belt, but no gun. He made a satisfied noise with his keys. It was not an impressive performance. I knew that. The corrections officer hadn't come up with any good lines. He just kept repeating himself. I could tell that all 24 of my cellmates were thinking how off the hook the corrections officer had been to raise up - the lingo was coming to me - on somebody like that. I was getting excited, feeling that I was on the verge of bonding with the other guys in our high and hip judgment against the corrections officer. He didn't meet our rigorous standards when it came to \"reading\" someone on the street manner. The black youth with the oiled, sparkling braids delivered our verdict: \"Definitely bugging behind something.\" The black corrections officer flung the metal door so hard it bounced against the cell bars and rode back some. Giant steps put him in a place that blocked my view of the black youth. Spit was dancing from his head, pinwheel fashion, as he roared, \"If I started to kick your black ass now, where would your black ass be next week?\" I couldn't remember when I had seen such sudden rage. It stopped all other activity in the basement. The tendons in his neck were ready to explode. I couldn't begin to think what his nostrils might be doing. Maybe our survival molecules were not the only ones to have been put on alert. Some of his colleagues had come by to monitor the situation. They turned back in a way that indicated they'd respect some code not to interfere. The cell was very still as the corrections officer made his exit. The street judgment was in the silence. Nobody wanted to look at him until he'd made his point. He had shown how dangerous was his longing to have a reason to lose control. The corrections officer's brown skin looked glazed, as though it had been fired in a kiln. He didn't seem to know how to finish his scene and stood wheezing by the bars. I almost thought he was going to mellow into the dispersal of balm-and-poultice phase of tough love. The mask of the shock-tactics practitioner would drop. He'd apologise, give advice, tell the young brothers how he was once on his way to being where they were. The black corrections officer said: \"Remember. I'll be going home at four o'clock. You'll still be here. You're in jail. I'm not.\" Maybe I should have taken into account the possibility that he had seen and had a lot of trouble doing his job. Maybe he and the black youth already had a story going and I'd missed what started it. But that didn't matter. Only what he'd said about four o'clock mattered. It wasn't even nine o'clock in the morning yet. My Hispanic comrade was looking at me. He took his eyes heavenward and clasped his hands. Then he shot me an inaudible laugh.

      "body": "<p>The first Oxford Book of Victorian Verse, published in 1922, contains several poems by the largely forgotten young poet, Amy Levy. The New Oxford Book of Victorian Verse, published in 1987, produces further - and different - poems by the same Levy, whose reputation, some 60 years on, was even more obscure. </p> <p> There are several reasons for Levy's descent into obscurity. First, her suicide at the age of 27 meant that she did not leave behind a vast literary output. Second, she was a Jewess, who wrote - at least in one of her novels, Reuben Sachs - about Jewish matters in such a way that much of the Anglo-Jewish establishment found mocking and cruel. Third, she was female, and with the well-known exceptions of the 19th-century greats, like the Bront\u00d4s, and George Eliot, many excellent women writers of the period passed from literary view. </p> <p> But the publication this month of a new edition of her controversial novel, Reuben Sachs, more than a century after her suicide in 1889, seems set to ensure a revival of her reputation. Well before her time, Levy was questioning ideas of identity, of belonging, the place of immigrants and immigrants' descendants, the insider and the outsider. Though influenced by Eliot, who appeared in Daniel Deronda to be sympathetic towards the British Jewish community, Levy was looking at Jews from the inside and seeing how they struggled for acceptance and yet lived a life apart. She gently mocked Daniel Deronda, suggesting a very different view of identity, belonging, and Britishness. </p> <p> In Reuben Sachs, a feminist plea and a satire on what Levy saw as the materialism of late Victorian Jews, a Christian convert to Judaism voices disappointment with what Jews as a people offer in middle-class London: \" 'Did he expect,' cried Esther, 'to see our boxes in the hall, ready packed and labelled Palestine?' </p> <p> \"'I have always been touched,' said Leo, 'at the immense good faith with which George Eliot carried out that elaborate misconception of hers.'\" Born into a comfortable middle-class Jewish family, Levy had a fairly conventional middle-class upbringing though, unusually, she was sent to a school that had serious academic pretensions. </p> <p>In 1879, she became the first Jewish student at Newnham College, Cambridge but left early. Some have argued that this was prompted by a severe depression that dogged her all her life. She went back to live with her family in Bloomsbury. Olive Schreiner, the South African feminist, met Levy and described her as the most interesting young woman she had met in her time in London. </p> <p>Levy's first collection of poems, Xantippe, in defence of Socrates' maligned wife, was published when she was 20 and she began a career as a literary essayist and journalist, daring in one essay to criticise the then new literary lion, Henry James, as a tad provincial. Her pieces for the Jewish Chronicle reflect a period of change and self-examination. Many thousands of poor Jews from eastern Europe were pouring into London at the time, fleeing pogroms and enforced military service. Levy and her kind were concerned to keep their rightful - if insecure - place in English society, a position likely to be threatened by the new arrivals. </p> <p> In a letter to her sister Katie, she seemed to regard anti-semitism as justified when she saw the German Jews of Dresden in a synagogue, which she described as \"a beastly place\". Today this attitude seems shocking. But the social position of middle-class Jews was fragile in 19th-century London, and that fragility is the key to Reuben Sachs. </p> <p>Levy mixed with young women who were either socialists or social workers: Clementina Black, Eleanor Marx, Beatrice Webb and others, who were working with the deprived in the east end of London. Levy was forced to face the seriously deprived Yiddish-speaking masses, feeling ambivalent about them, whilst her progressive friends were trying to help. </p> <p> She was also becoming increasingly involved with other women writers, many of them progressive both politically and personally. Some think that she had lesbian affairs with - or at least homoerotic tendencies towards - other women poets, particularly Vernon Lee. She became part of the Women Writers' Club, whose members became close confidantes and travel companions. Dorothy Bloomfield, Kit Anstruther-Thomson, Mary Robinson and others were part of her circle, and the nature of these relationships may have been romantic or simply the close friendships of intense young women of the period. </p> <p> In 1888, she wrote and published Reuben Sachs. It was praised by Oscar Wilde but caused a stir in the Jewish community. In it, the paterfamilias, old Solomon, sits with his skullcap on his head, while the younger characters in the novel have left orthodox Jewish practice. Their social lives are largely - but not wholly - among Jews. Meanwhile one family member is fascinated by the landed gentry, and, at Cambridge, spends his time socialising with those who are \"out of his class\". </p> <p> The novel's intent is satirical, but there is real affection here. There are undoubtedly mixed images of Jews throughout the novel, and some of the characteristics displayed are less than pleasant. But it throws light on how economic migrants often regard the next wave, and it begs all kinds of questions about material and social values - questions that have only changed slightly in the intervening century. Reuben Sachs is more than just a social curiosity. It succeeds because Levy never wastes a word and, though her material is of her own period, she speaks strongly to us - and with humour. </p> <p> That humour was short-lived. The year after the publication of Reuben Sachs, she committed suicide by inhaling carbon monoxide gas from the burning of charcoal. Olive Schreiner's letter to Edward Carpenter two days later quotes a note Levy had written her: \"She wrote me back a little note. 'Thankyou, it is very beautiful, but philosophy can't help me. I am too much shut in with the personal.' </p> <p>\"Was this depression? Was she hurt and humiliated by her critics, or by her friends? Or did she simply feel that the life she wanted for herself, free of social bonds and bounds, intellectually and emotionally fulfilling, was not going to be possible? It was a tragic early death and a waste of great talent. But, with this new edition of Reuben Sachs, her memory lives on. </p> <p>\u0095 Reuben Sachs by Amy Levy is available from Persephone Books, priced \u00a310, post free. Call 020 7253 5454 or e-mail: sales@persephonebooks.co.uk. Rabbi Julia Neuberger will chair a discussion on the work of Amy Levy at 8.30pm tomorrow at the Royal National Hotel in Bloomsbury, London, as part of Jewish Book Week, which runs until March 11.</p>",

That humour was short-lived. The year after the publication of Reuben Sachs, she committed suicide by inhaling carbon monoxide gas from the burning of charcoal. Olive Schreiner's letter to Edward Carpenter two days later quotes a note Levy had written her: \"She wrote me back a little note. 'Thankyou, it is very beautiful, but philosophy can't help me. I am too much shut in with the personal.' \"Was this depression? Was she hurt and humiliated by her critics, or by her friends? Or did she simply feel that the life she wanted for herself, free of social bonds and bounds, intellectually and emotionally fulfilling, was not going to be possible? It was a tragic early death and a waste of great talent. But, with this new edition of Reuben Sachs, her memory lives on. \u0095 Reuben Sachs by Amy Levy is available from Persephone Books, priced \u00a310, post free. Call 020 7253 5454 or e-mail: sales@persephonebooks.co.uk. Rabbi Julia Neuberger will chair a discussion on the work of Amy Levy at 8.30pm tomorrow at the Royal National Hotel in Bloomsbury, London, as part of Jewish Book Week, which runs until March 11.",

      "body": "<p> Although she didn't publish her first novel until she was 42, PD James had been writing about the world since childhood. The girl Phyllis discovered there were ways of making trivia meaningful. \"I commented on everything to myself,\" she says. \"For example, 'She got up in the morning, put on her slippers and went downstairs.' I commented on life as it continued. It was one long story, of which I was at the heart.\" </p> <p> As she got older, her reflex narrating found more eventful territory. As a 22-year-old Red Cross nurse during the second world war, she attended a lecture in which a plucky volunteer was fed solution through a tube in her nose. \"I thought, now if I were writing a detective story, that would be a very good way of killing someone.\" She had powers of dissociation, an inclination to study her own reaction to things. She knew from the start that she was a novelist.</p> <p> Phyllis Dorothy White (James is her maiden name) is 80 and about to publish her 17th book, Death In Holy Orders, the 12th to feature Commander Adam Dalgliesh. She lives in Holland Park and welcomes visitors with a gusty wrench of the door and a jubilant \"hello\". </p> <p>Her demeanour - wide features, plain dress, a quickness to exclamation - has long been used to diminish her authority as one of Britain's most popular crime writers. \"The sweet little lady who now wears Agatha Christie's crown\", is how one tabloid introduced her to readers after eight successful novels, and James is often referred to in terms similar to those adopted for the title of her 1972 bestseller, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman - someone who, by virtue of her appearance, is judged too mimsy for the butch world of her chosen profession. Two years ago, in a joint interview with Ruth Rendell, the writers were asked by a Daily Telegraph reporter, \"how two respectable, middle-class ladies\" could be involved in the \"sordid world of crime fiction?\" </p> <p>In her autobiography, Time To Be In Earnest, James refers to herself as \"an elderly grandmother who writes traditional English detective fiction\", although not, one senses, without a little irony. </p> <p> In fact, the \"sweet little lady\" of the cosseted middle classes had withstood two major encounters with mental illness, the first when her mother was hospitalised, the second when her husband, Connor, returned from the war irreversibly damaged. For 30 years, she had worked her way up the civil service. For 10 years, she was a senior administrator in the forensic science service at the Home Office and the police and criminal law departments, harvesting details for her books while consolidating a substantial career.</p> <p> Curiously, James identifies indolence as one of her chief short comings. She is very bad in the afternoons, she says and tasks that bore her, like letter-writing and paperwork, are only grudgingly and belatedly attended to. For the past 10 years she has been helped in these labours by her assistant, Joyce. But for 25 years she not only worked full-time, attended night school to qualify as a medical record-keeper and cared - albeit with the aid of her parents-in-law - for two daughters and an incapacitated husband, but also rose every morning at 6am and wrote for two hours before work, all of which she puts down to necessity. \"My most valuable trait is tenacity,\" she says, \"but what got me where I am now is courage.\"</p> <p> It is for this reason that friends defend James as a novelist first, and as a writer of detective fiction second, an odd distinction necessitated by the general sniffiness towards crime writing, and the peculiar contempt reserved for its female practitioners. \"She is like the Dickens or the Trollope of the genre,\" says Frances Fyfield, fellow crime writer. \"She is the weight, the ballast, and she has dragged detective fiction kicking and screaming into the 21st century.\"</p> <p> \"People can see detective fiction as an easy way into getting published,\" says Joan Smith, journalist and author. \"There are certain rules to be followed, a template, and that means much of it can be not very good. The fact is that PD James is a very good writer. Some detective fiction is OK to read on the plane, but doesn't give you anything to think about afterwards. She uses it to explore bigger themes.\" </p> <p> James's vehicle is Adam Dalgliesh, a chief inspector on his first outing in Cover Her Face (1962), now a commander at the Met aided by two detectives, Kate Miskin and Piers Tarrant, characters through whom James has tried to modernise her gentle depiction of the police force. </p> <p> Dalgliesh is a frustrated poet, a graduate capable of the sort of introspection that, for the last three books, has been offset by the more modish preoccupations of kate Miskin. For the purposes of balance, Miskin was brought up on a predominantly black council estate in south London after being abandoned by her mother. </p> <p> \"If I was starting now, I would almost certainly have a woman professional police officer [as the main character],\" says James, \"and that would be perfectly logical. But when I began, in the late 50s, it was a very different world. Women in the police force mostly dealt with issues concerning women and children. I don't think they were even in the detective force, so I had no choice about sex.\"</p> <p> In keeping with the tradition of English crime fiction, she could have made her protagonist an amateur sleuth rather than a professional officer. The books she most admired, those by Dorothy L Sayers, featured an amateur detective. But James was aiming for realism (one of her favourite compliments, she says, came from the head of a regional murder squad, who told her Dalgliesh was a \"good cop\") and she thought it would be better served by a professional officer. Borrowing the name Dalgliesh from her old English teacher, Miss Maisie Dalgliesh, she attached him to the Met, where she thought he would come across a wider range of investigations than a rural detective.</p> <p>\"I gave him the qualities I admire because I hoped he might be an enduring character and that being so, I must actually like him. I can't help thinking that logically he would have been a musician. There's something about him that reminds me of my more musical friends. But I don't know enough about music to make this credible, whereas I do understand the poetic imagination, so I thought, all right, I'll make him a poet.\" </p> <p> He wasn't to be distracted by a family, so she killed off his wife in childbirth and had Dalgliesh throw himself into work as a way of escaping the loneliness. \"Dalgliesh is probably the most intelligent officer in modern detective fiction,\" says Ruth Rendell, author of the Inspector Wexford novels and James's closest rival. \"He is the sort of person readers like to think the police might be like - sensitive and elegant, not elitist like Dorothy L Sayers's Peter Wimsey. He is the sort of person you wouldn't mind being interviewed by.\"</p> <p> None the less, accusations of elitism have occasionally arisen. During a radio interview five years ago, James attempted to explain how contrast is at the root of good crime writing by arguing that middle-class murderers make better characters, because the contrast between their ugly deeds and their urbane environment has a more dramatic effect. This was seized on, in some quarters of the crime-writing world, as covert advancement of the theory that the middle classes are more capable of making moral choices than the lower. </p> <p> One of the critical voices was Mark Timlin, creator of the fictional detective Nick Sharman, who, as a drug using, university drop out, is as far from Dalgliesh as the dimensions of the genre will allow. \"Phyllis is talking a lot of nonsense,\" he said in an interview at the time. He said that James's criminals were far removed from \"the reality on the streets of south London\" and rounded on the Crime Writers Association as \"snobbish and stuffy\" thanks largely to her and those like her.</p> <p> Rendell leaps immediately to James's defence. \"She writes about all sections of the community - you don't have to be upper class to feature in her books.\" And this is true, although James's original premise ensures that her novels tend to be set in colleges and hospitals - environments in which most of the characters are highly educated. \"But she writes intelligently about crime,\" says Fyfield. \"She was one of the first detective writers to put pain into crime fiction - compassion, real suffering.\" </p> <p> There is no emotional squeamishness in James's fiction. Death In Holy Orders is set in a theological college, and James doesn't flinch from dumping a body in the church or tackling, alongside the momentous occasion of Dalgliesh's first flirtation, mental illness, suicide and a gambit of ugly human emotions. Neither is she a prude. The novel includes sympathetic portrayals of an incestuous couple and, more controversially, a priest with a conviction for child abuse. </p> <p> \"For a detective story,\" she insists, \"the contrast between respectability and planned brutality is of the essence. I think contrast does intensify horror. If you have appalling and violent events happening in a civilised place, it's a great deal more horrific. I think it was WH Auden who said: 'The single body on the drawing-room floor is more horrific than the bullet-riddled body on Raymond Chandler's mean streets'. And Auden felt that very strongly - that you want a contrast between order and hierarchy and apparent goodness and the horror of the deed.\" </p> <p> There is a difference, says James, between the public's interest in real-life crimes and the popularity of the detective fiction genre. \"With the detective story there is horror - I think one needs to make the murder realistic. But I think the main attraction isn't the horror, it's the puzzle, the bringing of order out of disorder.\"</p> <p> She is intensely interested in and repelled by violence, and has confessed to a disproportionate fear of intruders. \"I don't agree with Ruth Rendell that motivation is more interesting than the act of murder. The physical act of killing a human being has an awesome and horrible fascination. All that flesh to dispose of, all that blood to be washed away, so many lies to be told.\" Which, for PD James, is where the story begins.</p> <p> Phyllis James encountered no physical violence during her childhood, but there was enough emotional disturbance to leave her with the impression that the world was an unreliable place. She was born in Oxford in 1920, the eldest of three children each born 18 months apart. Her father Sidney was an Inland Revenue official and remote from his children. Her mother Dorothy suffered from a mental illness that might be treatable at home today, but in the 30s confined her to hospital. </p> <p> James says: \"In one sense, I was very lucky - I've always felt at home in the world. But yes, I did feel that in some ways it was a frightening place and those two things don't seem very easy to reconcile. I was a child of a not very happy marriage and therefore I think it was a childhood of some apprehension, living in a sense with fear, that things might erupt, that things might go wrong.\" Her mother's illness, she says quietly, ensured that she grew up prematurely. </p> <p> The insecurity is apparent still in James's lingering fear of violence, and more obscurely in her dislike of the distorting effects of great pressure. She will not accept money in advance of writing, since the burden of having to earn it back - even at this advanced stage in her reputation - will, she says, interfere with getting the job done. \"Suppose I took a huge advance for the next two books?\" she has said. \"Will they be any good? Will the publishers like them? Will they wish they hadn't given me that huge amount?\" </p> <p> For years after becoming a published author she continued to work full-time for the Home Office and to insist that she was not a \"professional\" writer. Writing was never something she did under duress, but because she chose to.</p> <p> It was clear from the beginning, however, that writing was one of the few constants in her choppy existence. Her happiest childhood memories are of books. \"I read from a very early age. My mother used to buy us comics every week: the Rainbow and one called Tiger Tim. She read them to us when we were three or four. And then, one day, I suddenly discovered I could read it. I was probably helped by the pictures. But I remember that moment of thinking, I don't have to wait for her! I can read it myself!\" </p> <p> It was a moment paralleled 40 years later when she heard that her first novel had been accepted by Faber. \"It was certainly one of the great moments of my life,\" she says. \"I remember dancing for joy.\"</p> <p> Her education was short: she left school at 16, armed with a thorough knowledge of Shakespeare and the Bible, which for the purposes of becoming a writer she found quite adequate. She is scandalised that today's school curriculum pays such scant attention to the Bible. \"This is so much part of our history and our literature that one would suppose that the King James Bible would be a set book. One was brought up listening to some of the most wonderful English prose. The cadences stayed with me. It's amazing that we can so neglect it.\"</p> <p> In retrospect, James thinks that had the money had been available, she would have liked to go to university and become a barrister. As for the police force, she would have found the administration irksome, but reckons she has a talent for sniffing out the truth. \"I imagine, without being conceited, that I would have been a good detective for two reasons: people do tend to tell me things, quite astonishing things sometimes, often on quite short acquaintance. And I do seem to have an idea when people are lying.\"</p> <p> In the end, however, the career she took up fed as much into her writing as she would have got from anywhere (the nursing demonstration with the tube was used to dispatch a character in her fourth book, Shroud For A Nightingale). In 1949, James moved to London and joined the NHS, where she was responsible for the administration of psychiatric outpatients (details were used in a Mind To Murder, 1963). </p> <p> She stayed in the civil service for 30 years, accruing enough qualifications to enter the Home Office in 1968 and work first as an administrator for the forensic science service (Death Of An Expert Witness, 1977), and then in the criminal law department. \"I couldn't bear not to be a success at the job. I am ambitious. Inevitably, I qualified myself for promotion. Whether it's a matter of personal pride, if I'm doing it, I want to succeed at it.\" Knowing of her desire to write, her mother suggested she turn the experiences of her first job into \"a cheerful book about all these lovely people in hospital, where a nice nurse falls in love with a lovely doctor\". James suspects that her mother always knew that \"within the first chapter there'd be a dead body in the sluice room and the nice nurse would probably have done it\".</p> <p> Through her 20s and early 30s, James waited for a convenient moment to begin her writing career, but none came. Her life at home in London was not easy. Connor Bantry White was an Anglo-Irish doctor whom she had married at 21, after meeting him at the Festival Theatre in Cambridge. They had three happy years together before he went off to war with the Royal Army Medical Corps and returned with his mental health broken. Their two daughters, Clare and Jane, who went on to become a midwife and a teacher, were largely cared for by James's parents-in-law at their home in Ilford, Essex. Connor White was admitted to hospital for psychiatric treatment, where he adopted the name Ted and played eccentric games of football with the other patients. It was not unknown for the goalkeeper, distracted by voices in his head, to stand immobile while the ball shot past into the net.</p> <p> \"One suffers with the patient and for oneself,\" writes James of her husband's illness, in her autobiography. \"Another human being who was once a beloved companion can become not only a stranger, but occasionally a malevolent stranger.\" After years in and out of psychiatric hospitals, Connor died at home in 1964, aged 44. </p> <p> During this time, it occurred to James that a convenient moment to start her writing career would never present itself and that if she didn't hurry, she would wind up \"unfulfilled as a human being\". At 35, she began her early morning regime. Detective fiction was an obvious choice, since it reflected her own interests and, she thought, had a good chance of being published. \"It's a kind of instinct, really,\" she says. \"I read a lot of classical detective stories when I was a girl, it was my light reading. So to an extent it seemed to come about naturally. The novel is a way in which the writer's own enthusiasms, interests, compulsions, maybe even neuroses, are rearranged in a form that he or she hopes will be compelling and attractive to the reader.\"</p> <p> There were two principles on which James was immoveable: that the intricacy of a plot could never make up for poor writing (\"I find with my own reading, that it doesn't matter how exciting a book is: if it's badly written one just can't be bothered with it.\"); and that an author must always write with the reader in mind, and not the publisher or the book market. </p> <p> James talks about this with a sort of belligerent modesty. \"At the end of a book, I want to feel, well that's as good as I can do - not as good, perhaps, as other people can do - but it's as good as I can do. There are thousands of people who do like, for their recreational reading, a classical detective story, and I think they are entitled to have one which is also a good novel and well written. Those are the people I write for.. They don't want me to adapt to what I think is the popular market. They want a good novel, honestly written and I think they are jolly well entitled to it.\"</p> <p> \"Some modern detective fiction can be very didactic, used as a vehicle for a lecture,\" says Joan Smith. \"But James never does that to her readers. The story comes first.\" </p> <p> After experimenting with Phyllis James and Phyllis D James, PD James was chosen because she thought it would look enigmatic on a book spine. It didn't occur to her that she would be mistaken for a male author, and when someone pointed it out, she did not see it as a particular advantage. It is rare, she believes, for readers to reject a book because they dislike the sex of the author, especially in crime fiction. </p> <p> Before writing, she constructed a chart to keep track of who was doing what, where and with whom, planning and structure which took a whole year. After five years of early mornings, she sent an agent Cover Her Face, a detective story in which Adam Dalgliesh investigates the murder of Sally Jupp, a parlourmaid found dead in mysterious circumstances on the day after the church fete.</p> <p> James finds the book dated now, confined to the cosy, domestic setting of an English village in the shadow of its Elizabethan manor, that puts it very much in the Agatha Christie mould. In the 40 years since, her novels have had to keep pace with great advancements in modern policing. DNA testing has caused her some trouble, since it leaves no room for doubt and could solve a crime in the first chapter. In Death In Holy Orders it is introduced to the storyline only at the last minute, after more traditional policing has been exhausted. The book also contains references to the Macpherson report into racism and the latest policing methods. It is important to her to remain contemporary.</p> <p> Cover her Face was a critical success, but it was the Black Tower (1975), in which Adam Dalgliesh, grown disillusioned with the force, investigates the death of a friend at a care home in Dorset, which Kingsley Amis called \"almost Iris Murdoch with murder in it\". Financially, the breakthrough was Innocent Blood (1980), one of the few novels not to feature Dalgliesh, in which an adopted 18-year-old girl discovers the identity of her murderous true parents. The paperback rights went for \u00a3380,000, the film rights for \u00a3145,000, which was more than she had earned in 10 years at the Home Office. She retired happily.</p> <p> \"I started out as more of a cult writer. The one that broke through here was Shroud For A Nightingale. Then the huge international bestseller was Innocent Blood. At the beginning of the week I was relatively poor and at the end of the week I wasn't.\"</p> <p> Did they make an enormous fuss of her at the Home Office? James laughs. \"No dear, the Home Office doesn't make a fuss. Just occasionally people would come up at Christmas and say 'We want to give the Home Secretary one of your books, would you mind signing it?' Otherwise, no. I was Mrs White there, you see. They knew I was a writer, but there was a general feeling that you don't encourage people in hubris. It was very funny really.\"</p> <p>It was while writing the opening scenes of Devices And Desires, her 12th book, that James had the most powerful sense of her own duality, of being someone who both experienced things and stood aside and watched them, a self-consciousness that she believes might only be lost during extreme agony or the death of a loved one. It is the closest she comes to delineating the process of her writing: \"A girl is on a lonely road and begins to remember that there's a psychopathic serial murderer loose. And we know she's going to be killed, because the book opens with a reference to her as the fifth victim. </p> <p>It's a terrifying opening. Now when I was writing it, I was, of course, that girl. But with another part of my mind I was thinking, well, I wonder if I ought to have a moon, or whether that's going a bit far? What have we got on each side of the road? We must have lots of bushes so you can feel that people might be lurking. And I think I'll have a car coming past, because that will seem reassuring, but obviously it goes past at speed and there's no help there. \"You think, how do I increase the menace? You feel the emotion of the girl and at the same time wonder how best it can be conveyed.\" </p> <p> James does not know if there is another book in her. She always waits for an idea to possess her, usually inspired by a particular location. Her great regret is that she didn't start writing sooner, although if Death In Holy Orders turns out to be her last book, she won't complain. With the promise of a relationship between Dalgliesh and Emma Lavenham, a Cambridge academic, hanging in the air, however, she is pretty sure there is another one coming. \"I want it to be quite subtle; I don't want to have buttocks heaving everywhere. They are both private people.\" </p> <p> If another book doesn't arrive, she has plenty to occupy her. Afternoon indolence not withstanding, there is a briskness to PD James that shows itself in her enthusiasm for public duty: she has served as a governor of the BBC, a board member of the British Council and is president of the Society of Authors. In 1991 she was created a Tory life peer, Baroness James of Holland Park. The pick-your-ideas up, anti-dogma of old-style Conservatism has always appealed and she is a regular guest speaker at local party level. She has told her daughters that in the event of a debilitating illness, she doesn't want to linger but would prefer to be \"put out of my misery\". In April, she flies to Texas for a book tour. \"It has been a very busy life,\" she says, with a touch of defiance. \"But a busy life by compulsion.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance </strong> Phyllis Dorothy White, Baroness James of Holland Park </p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> August 3 1920, Oxford. <br> <strong> Education: </strong> Cambridge Girls High School. <br> <strong> Married: </strong> 1941 Connor Bantry White, died 1964 (two daughters Jane, Clare). <br> <strong> Career:</strong> Administrator, NHS 1949- 68; Principal, Home Office police dept 68-72; criminal policy dept 72-79. <br> <strong> Publications:</strong> Cover Her Face 62; A Mind To Murder 63; Unnatural Causes 67; Shroud For A Nightingale 71; The Maul And The Pear Tree (with TA Critchley) 71; An Unsuitable Job For A Woman 72; The Black Tower 75; Death Of An Expert Witness 77; Innocent Blood 80; The Skull Beneath The Skin 82; A Taste For Death 86; Devices And Desires 89; The Children Of Men 92; Original Sin 94; A Certain Justice 97; Time To Be In Earnest (autobiography) 99. <br> <strong> Honours:</strong> Life peer 1991. </p> <p>\u0095 Death In Holy Orders is published by Faber and Faber (\u00a317.99) on Monday March</p>",

      "bodyText": "Although she didn't publish her first novel until she was 42, PD James had been writing about the world since childhood. The girl Phyllis discovered there were ways of making trivia meaningful. \"I commented on everything to myself,\" she says. \"For example, 'She got up in the morning, put on her slippers and went downstairs.' I commented on life as it continued. It was one long story, of which I was at the heart.\" As she got older, her reflex narrating found more eventful territory. As a 22-year-old Red Cross nurse during the second world war, she attended a lecture in which a plucky volunteer was fed solution through a tube in her nose. \"I thought, now if I were writing a detective story, that would be a very good way of killing someone.\" She had powers of dissociation, an inclination to study her own reaction to things. She knew from the start that she was a novelist. Phyllis Dorothy White (James is her maiden name) is 80 and about to publish her 17th book, Death In Holy Orders, the 12th to feature Commander Adam Dalgliesh. She lives in Holland Park and welcomes visitors with a gusty wrench of the door and a jubilant \"hello\". Her demeanour - wide features, plain dress, a quickness to exclamation - has long been used to diminish her authority as one of Britain's most popular crime writers. \"The sweet little lady who now wears Agatha Christie's crown\", is how one tabloid introduced her to readers after eight successful novels, and James is often referred to in terms similar to those adopted for the title of her 1972 bestseller, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman - someone who, by virtue of her appearance, is judged too mimsy for the butch world of her chosen profession. Two years ago, in a joint interview with Ruth Rendell, the writers were asked by a Daily Telegraph reporter, \"how two respectable, middle-class ladies\" could be involved in the \"sordid world of crime fiction?\" In her autobiography, Time To Be In Earnest, James refers to herself as \"an elderly grandmother who writes traditional English detective fiction\", although not, one senses, without a little irony. In fact, the \"sweet little lady\" of the cosseted middle classes had withstood two major encounters with mental illness, the first when her mother was hospitalised, the second when her husband, Connor, returned from the war irreversibly damaged. For 30 years, she had worked her way up the civil service. For 10 years, she was a senior administrator in the forensic science service at the Home Office and the police and criminal law departments, harvesting details for her books while consolidating a substantial career. Curiously, James identifies indolence as one of her chief short comings. She is very bad in the afternoons, she says and tasks that bore her, like letter-writing and paperwork, are only grudgingly and belatedly attended to.

But for 25 years she not only worked full-time, attended night school to qualify as a medical record-keeper and cared - albeit with the aid of her parents-in-law - for two daughters and an incapacitated husband, but also rose every morning at 6am and wrote for two hours before work, all of which she puts down to necessity. \"My most valuable trait is tenacity,\" she says, \"but what got me where I am now is courage.\" It is for this reason that friends defend James as a novelist first, and as a writer of detective fiction second, an odd distinction necessitated by the general sniffiness towards crime writing, and the peculiar contempt reserved for its female practitioners. \"She is like the Dickens or the Trollope of the genre,\" says Frances Fyfield, fellow crime writer. \"She is the weight, the ballast, and she has dragged detective fiction kicking and screaming into the 21st century.\" \"People can see detective fiction as an easy way into getting published,\" says Joan Smith, journalist and author. \"There are certain rules to be followed, a template, and that means much of it can be not very good.

Her mother Dorothy suffered from a mental illness that might be treatable at home today, but in the 30s confined her to hospital. James says: \"In one sense, I was very lucky - I've always felt at home in the world. But yes, I did feel that in some ways it was a frightening place and those two things don't seem very easy to reconcile. I was a child of a not very happy marriage and therefore I think it was a childhood of some apprehension, living in a sense with fear, that things might erupt, that things might go wrong.\" Her mother's illness, she says quietly, ensured that she grew up prematurely. The insecurity is apparent still in James's lingering fear of violence, and more obscurely in her dislike of the distorting effects of great pressure. She will not accept money in advance of writing, since the burden of having to earn it back - even at this advanced stage in her reputation - will, she says, interfere with getting the job done. \"Suppose I took a huge advance for the next two books?\" she has said. \"Will they be any good? Will the publishers like them? Will they wish they hadn't given me that huge amount?\" For years after becoming a published author she continued to work full-time for the Home Office and to insist that she was not a \"professional\" writer. Writing was never something she did under duress, but because she chose to. It was clear from the beginning, however, that writing was one of the few constants in her choppy existence. Her happiest childhood memories are of books. \"I read from a very early age. My mother used to buy us comics every week: the Rainbow and one called Tiger Tim. She read them to us when we were three or four. And then, one day, I suddenly discovered I could read it. I was probably helped by the pictures. But I remember that moment of thinking, I don't have to wait for her! I can read it myself!\" It was a moment paralleled 40 years later when she heard that her first novel had been accepted by Faber. \"It was certainly one of the great moments of my life,\" she says. \"I remember dancing for joy.\" Her education was short: she left school at 16, armed with a thorough knowledge of Shakespeare and the Bible, which for the purposes of becoming a writer she found quite adequate. She is scandalised that today's school curriculum pays such scant attention to the Bible. \"This is so much part of our history and our literature that one would suppose that the King James Bible would be a set book. One was brought up listening to some of the most wonderful English prose. The cadences stayed with me. It's amazing that we can so neglect it.\" In retrospect, James thinks that had the money had been available, she would have liked to go to university and become a barrister. As for the police force, she would have found the administration irksome, but reckons she has a talent for sniffing out the truth. \"I imagine, without being conceited, that I would have been a good detective for two reasons: people do tend to tell me things, quite astonishing things sometimes, often on quite short acquaintance. And I do seem to have an idea when people are lying.\" In the end, however, the career she took up fed as much into her writing as she would have got from anywhere (the nursing demonstration with the tube was used to dispatch a character in her fourth book, Shroud For A Nightingale). In 1949, James moved to London and joined the NHS, where she was responsible for the administration of psychiatric outpatients (details were used in a Mind To Murder, 1963). She stayed in the civil service for 30 years, accruing enough qualifications to enter the Home Office in 1968 and work first as an administrator for the forensic science service (Death Of An Expert Witness, 1977), and then in the criminal law department. \"I couldn't bear not to be a success at the job. I am ambitious. Inevitably, I qualified myself for promotion. Whether it's a matter of personal pride, if I'm doing it, I want to succeed at it.\" Knowing of her desire to write, her mother suggested she turn the experiences of her first job into \"a cheerful book about all these lovely people in hospital, where a nice nurse falls in love with a lovely doctor\". James suspects that her mother always knew that \"within the first chapter there'd be a dead body in the sluice room and the nice nurse would probably have done it\". Through her 20s and early 30s, James waited for a convenient moment to begin her writing career, but none came. Her life at home in London was not easy. Connor Bantry White was an Anglo-Irish doctor whom she had married at 21, after meeting him at the Festival Theatre in Cambridge. They had three happy years together before he went off to war with the Royal Army Medical Corps and returned with his mental health broken. Their two daughters, Clare and Jane, who went on to become a midwife and a teacher, were largely cared for by James's parents-in-law at their home in Ilford, Essex. Connor White was admitted to hospital for psychiatric treatment, where he adopted the name Ted and played eccentric games of football with the other patients. It was not unknown for the goalkeeper, distracted by voices in his head, to stand immobile while the ball shot past into the net. \"One suffers with the patient and for oneself,\" writes James of her husband's illness, in her autobiography. \"Another human being who was once a beloved companion can become not only a stranger, but occasionally a malevolent stranger.\" After years in and out of psychiatric hospitals, Connor died at home in 1964, aged 44. During this time, it occurred to James that a convenient moment to start her writing career would never present itself and that if she didn't hurry, she would wind up \"unfulfilled as a human being\". At 35, she began her early morning regime. Detective fiction was an obvious choice, since it reflected her own interests and, she thought, had a good chance of being published. \"It's a kind of instinct, really,\" she says. \"I read a lot of classical detective stories when I was a girl, it was my light reading. So to an extent it seemed to come about naturally. The novel is a way in which the writer's own enthusiasms, interests, compulsions, maybe even neuroses, are rearranged in a form that he or she hopes will be compelling and attractive to the reader.\" There were two principles on which James was immoveable: that the intricacy of a plot could never make up for poor writing (\"I find with my own reading, that it doesn't matter how exciting a book is: if it's badly written one just can't be bothered with it.\"); and that an author must always write with the reader in mind, and not the publisher or the book market. James talks about this with a sort of belligerent modesty. \"At the end of a book, I want to feel, well that's as good as I can do - not as good, perhaps, as other people can do - but it's as good as I can do. There are thousands of people who do like, for their recreational reading, a classical detective story, and I think they are entitled to have one which is also a good novel and well written. Those are the people I write for.. They don't want me to adapt to what I think is the popular market. They want a good novel, honestly written and I think they are jolly well entitled to it.\" \"Some modern detective fiction can be very didactic, used as a vehicle for a lecture,\" says Joan Smith. \"But James never does that to her readers. The story comes first.\" After experimenting with Phyllis James and Phyllis D James, PD James was chosen because she thought it would look enigmatic on a book spine. It didn't occur to her that she would be mistaken for a male author, and when someone pointed it out, she did not see it as a particular advantage. It is rare, she believes, for readers to reject a book because they dislike the sex of the author, especially in crime fiction. Before writing, she constructed a chart to keep track of who was doing what, where and with whom, planning and structure which took a whole year. After five years of early mornings, she sent an agent Cover Her Face, a detective story in which Adam Dalgliesh investigates the murder of Sally Jupp, a parlourmaid found dead in mysterious circumstances on the day after the church fete. James finds the book dated now, confined to the cosy, domestic setting of an English village in the shadow of its Elizabethan manor, that puts it very much in the Agatha Christie mould. In the 40 years since, her novels have had to keep pace with great advancements in modern policing. DNA testing has caused her some trouble, since it leaves no room for doubt and could solve a crime in the first chapter. In Death In Holy Orders it is introduced to the storyline only at the last minute, after more traditional policing has been exhausted. The book also contains references to the Macpherson report into racism and the latest policing methods. It is important to her to remain contemporary. Cover her Face was a critical success, but it was the Black Tower (1975), in which Adam Dalgliesh, grown disillusioned with the force, investigates the death of a friend at a care home in Dorset, which Kingsley Amis called \"almost Iris Murdoch with murder in it\". Financially, the breakthrough was Innocent Blood (1980), one of the few novels not to feature Dalgliesh, in which an adopted 18-year-old girl discovers the identity of her murderous true parents. The paperback rights went for \u00a3380,000, the film rights for \u00a3145,000, which was more than she had earned in 10 years at the Home Office. She retired happily. \"I started out as more of a cult writer. The one that broke through here was Shroud For A Nightingale. Then the huge international bestseller was Innocent Blood. At the beginning of the week I was relatively poor and at the end of the week I wasn't.\" Did they make an enormous fuss of her at the Home Office? James laughs. \"No dear, the Home Office doesn't make a fuss. Just occasionally people would come up at Christmas and say 'We want to give the Home Secretary one of your books, would you mind signing it?' Otherwise, no. I was Mrs White there, you see. They knew I was a writer, but there was a general feeling that you don't encourage people in hubris. It was very funny really.\" It was while writing the opening scenes of Devices And Desires, her 12th book, that James had the most powerful sense of her own duality, of being someone who both experienced things and stood aside and watched them, a self-consciousness that she believes might only be lost during extreme agony or the death of a loved one. It is the closest she comes to delineating the process of her writing: \"A girl is on a lonely road and begins to remember that there's a psychopathic serial murderer loose. And we know she's going to be killed, because the book opens with a reference to her as the fifth victim. It's a terrifying opening. Now when I was writing it, I was, of course, that girl. But with another part of my mind I was thinking, well, I wonder if I ought to have a moon, or whether that's going a bit far? What have we got on each side of the road? We must have lots of bushes so you can feel that people might be lurking. And I think I'll have a car coming past, because that will seem reassuring, but obviously it goes past at speed and there's no help there. \"You think, how do I increase the menace? You feel the emotion of the girl and at the same time wonder how best it can be conveyed.\" James does not know if there is another book in her. She always waits for an idea to possess her, usually inspired by a particular location. Her great regret is that she didn't start writing sooner, although if Death In Holy Orders turns out to be her last book, she won't complain. With the promise of a relationship between Dalgliesh and Emma Lavenham, a Cambridge academic, hanging in the air, however, she is pretty sure there is another one coming. \"I want it to be quite subtle; I don't want to have buttocks heaving everywhere. They are both private people.\" If another book doesn't arrive, she has plenty to occupy her. Afternoon indolence not withstanding, there is a briskness to PD James that shows itself in her enthusiasm for public duty: she has served as a governor of the BBC, a board member of the British Council and is president of the Society of Authors. In 1991 she was created a Tory life peer, Baroness James of Holland Park. The pick-your-ideas up, anti-dogma of old-style Conservatism has always appealed and she is a regular guest speaker at local party level. She has told her daughters that in the event of a debilitating illness, she doesn't want to linger but would prefer to be \"put out of my misery\". In April, she flies to Texas for a book tour. \"It has been a very busy life,\" she says, with a touch of defiance. \"But a busy life by compulsion.\" Life at a glance Phyllis Dorothy White, Baroness James of Holland Park Born: August 3 1920, Oxford.

On the sofa opposite, a delegation of western cultural experts who had flown to Kabul to discuss the preservation of Afghanistan's few remaining antiquities. </p> <p>Over cups of green tea, Mutawakel smilingly assured the delegation that all was well. The Taliban, Afghanistan's fundamentalist rulers, had no intention of destroying what was left of the country's heritage, he said. This was at 5.30pm on Monday. Two hours later, however, Radio Sharia - the Taliban's official station - broadcast an announcement that would plunge Afghanistan into further isolation and provoke a major international outcry. Mullah Mohammed Omar, the Taliban's reclusive, one-eyed spiritual leader, had issued a new decree: that all Afghanistan's ancient statues should be destroyed. </p> <p>The decision was in line with Islamic law and had been taken following a gathering of the country's most senior religious leaders, he explained. \"We were just blown away,\" said Brigitte Neubacher of the Society for the Preservation of Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage (SPACH). \"This came immediately after our one-and-a-half hour meeting. Whether the timing was deliberate or not we don't know. I am totally horrified.\" </p> <p>By Thursday, Taliban fighters deep in the Hindu Kush mountains started putting Mullah Omar's edict into effect. They set about what was once Afghanistan's most famous tourist attraction - two enormous statues of Buddha, 38 and 55 metres high, carved into a cliff-face. Using tanks and rocket launchers they began to destroy the two works, which had survived since the second century AD. </p> <p>The magnificent colossi were built in the remote and beautiful Bamiyan Valley - seven hours' drive from Kabul - 1,000 years before the arrival of Islam in Afghanistan. They were built by the flourishing Buddhist Kushan dynasty, which had grown rich from its strategic position on the Silk Road between China and Rome. </p> <p>The statues were unique. They were visited by pilgrims from across Central Asia; tended by yellow-robed priests who lived in caves carved into the sandstone hillside; and decorated with exquisite frescoes. \"The buddhas are absolutely spectacular. I have never seen anything like them in my life,\" one awed visitor to Bamiyan told me. The statues even outlasted an attack by Genghis Khan in the 13th century. But they have finally met their match in the Taliban. </p> <p>In retrospect, the international community could have spotted the danger signals. Three weeks ago, Taliban officials allegedly broke into Kabul's bombed-out museum and destroyed around 50 objects of cultural significance, according to reports. </p> <p>There was not, it has to be said, much left to destroy. Rival Afghan mujaheddin factions looted most of the museum's best pieces when they fought for control of the city in 1992. But a few things were still on display when I visited last October: a couple of friezes, a limestone Islamic bowl and a rather fetching statue of King Kanishka, who ruled Afghanistan 1,800 years ago. </p> <p>One observer who recently managed to peer through the locked museum's windows spotted some white marks on King Kanishka's enormous royal feet, suggesting the already headless statue had been hit by a hammer. \"We don't know how great the damage is. We weren't allowed into the museum to verify the reports,\" one member of the SPACH delegation said. </p> <p>The Taliban's decision to destroy the few relics that managed to survive 20 years of war and Soviet occupation can only be explained by recent political events. In February, the UN imposed fresh sanctions on Afghanistan. The Taliban's office in New York was closed down by the United States, a country obsessed with capturing the Afghanistan-based Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden. Within the Taliban, a dialogue of sorts had been going on. Moderates, such as the Taliban's culture minister Abdul Rahman Hotaki, advocated a degree of co-operation with the west. But after the most recent wave of sanctions Mullah Omar appears to have concluded that a policy of engagement was entirely pointless. Instead, he has thumbed his nose at the international community. \"All we are breaking are stones,\" he shrugged. \"I don't care about anything but Islam.\" </p> <p>Since the Taliban swept into Kabul four years ago, imposing the world's most extreme brand of Islam, portrayal of the human image has been forbidden. Painters, for example, are now confined to depicting landscapes; Kabul's art gallery is hung with innocuous Victorian pastorals. In September 1998, a renegade Taliban commander blew off the head of the smaller Bamiyan buddha using dynamite. He also fired rockets at the large buddha's groin, damaging the luxurious folds of the statue's dress. </p> <p>But the Taliban then decided to take a more pragmatic view of Afghanistan's pre-Islamic past. In July 1999 Mullah Omar issued a decree that said the Bamiyan buddhas should be preserved. There were, he pointed out, no Buddhists left in Afghanistan to worship them. But he added: \"The government considers the Bamiyan statues as an example of a potential major source of income for Afghanistan from international visitors. The Taliban states that Bamiyan shall not be destroyed but protected.\" </p> <p>Then, over another cup of green tea four months ago, Hotaki assured me that the Taliban had no intention of damaging the statues. To suggest as much was \"foreign propaganda\", he said. Sadly, though, the rumours have proved all too true. </p> <p> The Bamiyan valley, with its serene mountain views and pastel colours, is also an unwelcome reminder to the Taliban of their own vulnerability. Opposition fighters from Afghanistan's Northern Alliance seized the valley last month and were dislodged only after a massive battle. The Taliban have now sealed the valley and have rejected all requests by foreign observers to visit. </p> <p>It is not just the buddhas that face annihilation: 20 tin trunks that may contain the Kabul museum's celebrated Bactrian treasures are currently stored in the vaults of the presidential palace and the Taliban's culture ministry. They have not been opened, so no one is sure what they contain. The only certainty is that after Monday's edict, they are likely to be lost to the world for ever. </p> <p>\"I consider myself a friend of Afghanistan. I have spent 15 years trying to help the country,\" one western cultural expert said this week. \"But it is becoming an island of madness.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Not long ago, when our Washington correspondent filed a report of moves in the United States to secure a posthumous pardon for Billy the Kid, we illustrated the story with a photograph of the famous outlaw. This is a ferrotype, or tintype, probably taken in 1880, the year he was captured by Sheriff Pat Garrett. </p> <p>The photograph, familiar to all students of the West, but less so to the rest of us, shows Billy the Kid, full-length, the butt of his Winchester resting on the ground and the tip of the barrel gripped lightly in his right hand. More to the point, he carries his single-action Colt on his left hip, the handle pointing backwards. </p> <p>To everyone involved in editing the page on which it appeared, everything seemed as it should be. Wasn't Billy, after all, a notorious left-hander - played as such by Paul Newman in Arthur Penn's 1958 film The Left-Handed Gun? </p> <p>Almost immediately after the Guardian report appeared, I received an email from a reader: \"Your reproduction of the famous photograph of Billy the Kid is reversed. You can see by the waistcoat buttons and the belt buckle. This is a common error which has continued to reinforce the myth that Billy the Kid was left-handed. He was not. He was right-handed and carried his gun on his right hip.\" The writer of the email was, it transpired, a former curator of the National Film and Television Archive of the British Film Institute, Clyde Jeavons. </p> <p>His points about the buckle and buttons were indeed borne out on closer examination. The prong on the belt buckle is pointing the wrong way, and the buttons run down the wrong side of his waistcoat. There is no doubt that what we are looking at is a reverse image. </p> <p>Was it simply another case of \"flipping the picture\"? After all, we have in the past presented readers of the Guardian with a photograph of an entirely left-handed orchestra and a flipped image of the Horsehead nebula. This case, however, did not prove so simple. </p> <p>My correspondent produced further argument. \"This particular reproduction error has occurred so often in books and other publications over the years that it has led to the myth that Billy the Kid was left-handed, for which there is no evidence. On the contrary, the evidence (from viewing his photo correctly) is that he was right-handed: he wears his pistol on his right hip with the butt pointing backwards in a conventional right-handed draw position.\" </p> <p>He cites the Pictorial History of the Wild West by James D Horan and Paul Sann, 1954, in which the authors caption the \"correctly printed\" picture: \"Billy the Kid. He was right-handed and carried his pistol on his right hip.\" </p> <p>Edward Buscombe, in The BFI Companion to the Western, 1988, now sadly out of print, while not commenting directly on the left hand/right hand issue, says this: \"There has probably been more tedious argument about the facts of Billy the Kid's life than about anything else in the West.\" Alongside he prints the photograph to show the gun on Billy's right hip (buttons and buckle all in order) - the reverse of the Guardian's presentation. </p> <p>A quick internet search produces vast quantities of information, including sites devoted to Billy the Kid which reproduce the image in question, usually showing it, as it appeared in the Guardian, with the pistol on the right of the picture - that is, on his left hip, if you regard it as you would a modern photograph. </p> <p>The answer, in fact, is in the technique used to obtain the image in the first place. The tintype or ferrotype, to quote Britannica.com, was \"a positive photograph produced by means of a nitrocellulose (collodion) solution applied to a thin enamelled black iron plate immediately prior to exposure\". It says they remained a kind of folk art for the rest of the 19th century. </p> <p> The best description I have found is in the online work, A History of Photography, compiled by Robert Leggat (<a href=\"http://www.rleggat.com/photohistory/\">www.rleggat.com/photohistory</a>. He makes the following essential point: \"The print would come out laterally reversed (as one sees oneself in a mirror); either people did not worry about this, or just possibly they did not discover it until after the photographer had disappeared!\" </p> <p>So the \"authentic\" tintype of Billy the Kid, if one is to be purist about this, should be shown as it appeared in the Guardian, but pointing out that the image is reversed. If we want to see Billy the Kid the right way round, we have to grit our teeth, break our own rule forbidding the flipping of pictures, and reverse it again. </p> <p>If you are still with me, the essential point in all this is that Billy the Kid was not, on the evidence of this image, left-handed. I find myself on the side of the right. </p> <p>\u0095 The Guardian carried the picture of Billy the Kid on February 3.

The photograph, familiar to all students of the West, but less so to the rest of us, shows Billy the Kid, full-length, the butt of his Winchester resting on the ground and the tip of the barrel gripped lightly in his right hand. More to the point, he carries his single-action Colt on his left hip, the handle pointing backwards. To everyone involved in editing the page on which it appeared, everything seemed as it should be. Wasn't Billy, after all, a notorious left-hander - played as such by Paul Newman in Arthur Penn's 1958 film The Left-Handed Gun? Almost immediately after the Guardian report appeared, I received an email from a reader: \"Your reproduction of the famous photograph of Billy the Kid is reversed. You can see by the waistcoat buttons and the belt buckle. This is a common error which has continued to reinforce the myth that Billy the Kid was left-handed. He was not. He was right-handed and carried his gun on his right hip.\" The writer of the email was, it transpired, a former curator of the National Film and Television Archive of the British Film Institute, Clyde Jeavons. His points about the buckle and buttons were indeed borne out on closer examination. The prong on the belt buckle is pointing the wrong way, and the buttons run down the wrong side of his waistcoat. There is no doubt that what we are looking at is a reverse image. Was it simply another case of \"flipping the picture\"? After all, we have in the past presented readers of the Guardian with a photograph of an entirely left-handed orchestra and a flipped image of the Horsehead nebula. This case, however, did not prove so simple. My correspondent produced further argument. \"This particular reproduction error has occurred so often in books and other publications over the years that it has led to the myth that Billy the Kid was left-handed, for which there is no evidence. On the contrary, the evidence (from viewing his photo correctly) is that he was right-handed: he wears his pistol on his right hip with the butt pointing backwards in a conventional right-handed draw position.\" He cites the Pictorial History of the Wild West by James D Horan and Paul Sann, 1954, in which the authors caption the \"correctly printed\" picture: \"Billy the Kid. He was right-handed and carried his pistol on his right hip.\" Edward Buscombe, in The BFI Companion to the Western, 1988, now sadly out of print, while not commenting directly on the left hand/right hand issue, says this: \"There has probably been more tedious argument about the facts of Billy the Kid's life than about anything else in the West.\" Alongside he prints the photograph to show the gun on Billy's right hip (buttons and buckle all in order) - the reverse of the Guardian's presentation. A quick internet search produces vast quantities of information, including sites devoted to Billy the Kid which reproduce the image in question, usually showing it, as it appeared in the Guardian, with the pistol on the right of the picture - that is, on his left hip, if you regard it as you would a modern photograph. The answer, in fact, is in the technique used to obtain the image in the first place. The tintype or ferrotype, to quote Britannica.com, was \"a positive photograph produced by means of a nitrocellulose (collodion) solution applied to a thin enamelled black iron plate immediately prior to exposure\". It says they remained a kind of folk art for the rest of the 19th century. The best description I have found is in the online work, A History of Photography, compiled by Robert Leggat (www.rleggat.com/photohistory. He makes the following essential point: \"The print would come out laterally reversed (as one sees oneself in a mirror); either people did not worry about this, or just possibly they did not discover it until after the photographer had disappeared!\" So the \"authentic\" tintype of Billy the Kid, if one is to be purist about this, should be shown as it appeared in the Guardian, but pointing out that the image is reversed. If we want to see Billy the Kid the right way round, we have to grit our teeth, break our own rule forbidding the flipping of pictures, and reverse it again. If you are still with me, the essential point in all this is that Billy the Kid was not, on the evidence of this image, left-handed. I find myself on the side of the right. \u0095 The Guardian carried the picture of Billy the Kid on February 3. Special thanks to Clyde Jeavons, who provided me with a good deal of the material for this column; and to Edward Buscombe.

      "body": "<p>Agi and Edward Hurst have a serious problem. It's an affliction that blights thousands of couples year in, year out, bringing with it discord and resentment where there should be sweetness and light. And, no, before you ask, it has nothing to do with sex.</p> <p>Agi explains all in a letter to the Kitchen Doctor: \"My husband and I would like to cook and eat together, but I don't eat meat. I do eat fish, seafood and all manner of vegetables.\" Not too much of a quandary there, you might think, but read on: \"My husband is very much a meat-eater, does not like fish, and will not touch seafood. Vegetarian dishes are usually met with a, 'Mmmm, the only thing missing is a steak'.\"</p> <p>See what I mean? That's not so much a job for the Kitchen Doctor, and more one for a miracle worker. And though both Hursts are management consultants, even their problem-solving expertise hasn't helped them find a solution.</p> <p>Rosie Sykes, however, loves a challenge, even one as seemingly insurmountable as this, which is how the KD crew find themselves one wet Thursday lunchtime unpacking the tools of their trade at Agi and Edward's flat in Surbiton, Surrey. Agi has to speak for both of them, as Ed is snowed under at work. \"We live completely independent lives as far as food is concerned,\" she says. \"I heat up ready meals, he makes pasta with tomato and meat sauce.\"</p> <p>Agi adds that her aversion to meat is not an ethical matter, or even one of flavour - she just can't stand the texture - so meat stocks and the like are not the complete no-nos Rosie had feared. Which is just as well, considering that her first act is to plonk a hunk of gammon in a pot, cover it with water, add herbs and veg, and bring it up to a boil.</p> <p>The ham will form the basis of the first dish on her latest mercy mission, a bean stew that, Rosie explains, \"is a bit like a baked bean thing - only they're not actually baked\". Before anyone can query her logic, she adds quickly that Ed can eat the beans with a slice or two of the ham, while Agi has them with a sort of Italian stir-fry of broccoli, anchovy and chilli. Agi, who, if truth be told, is not overly confident that Rosie can pull this one off, perks up no end.</p> <p>Her spirits rise even further when Rosie tells her, \"It's time to get your hands dirty and make a spinach and cheese tart - and, yes, I know there's no meat in it, but surely even Ed can do without once in a while.\"</p> <p>Agi concurs, and makes short work of converting a benchtop full of spinach, eggs and cheese into a gloriously golden gloop for the tart filling. \"Add some nutmeg,\" says Rosie after dipping her finger into the mix for a taste. \"It's always a good plan with the old spinach.\"</p> <p>The KD has brought ready-made pastry (Agi and Ed's other requirement was that they wanted food that didn't take an age to prepare), so the final stages are easy as, well, pie. \"Fine old job you did there,\" Rosie tells Agi, before turning her thoughts to an Asian-inspired soup.</p> <p>Agi is soon hard at work chopping and slicing, while Rosie makes the broth. Half an hour later, the soup is poured into a bowl, which is placed on a plate and surrounded with sliced chicken, tiger prawns and two dipping sauces. \"The idea is to share the old broth, and Ed eats his with chicken and you have tiger prawns.\"</p> <p>Agi, looking more impressed by the minute, nods happily and licks her lips, but before she can try it, Rosie comes over all concerned: \"I seem to be saying 'old' a lot, in a Jamie Oliver kind of way. I hope I'm not possessed.\" Agi suddenly seems unsure quite what she has let herself in for, as if Rosie is about to unleash a blizzard of \"pukka\"s and \"blinding\"s. Instead, an embarrassed KD buttons her lip while she prepares her rather grand take on mushrooms on toast, cheering up no end as a garlicky, buttery scent fills the kitchen. \"Pile it up,\" she exhorts Agi.</p> <p>\"As Jamie might say,\" quips Agi.</p> <p>\"Tssst,\" says Rosie, caught out again. \"Anyway, he'd say, 'Whack it on.' And enough of that cheek - you need to cook the tuna now.\"</p> <p>\"Ed's main problem with fish is the bones,\" explains Agi, suitably chastened. \"And he detests shellfish: if it's got tentacles or a shell, it's out.\"</p> <p>The tuna should not be a problem, then, says Rosie: \"The steaks are boneless, it's a really meaty fish and, to make it even more appealing to Ed, we're going to do them in a classic beef steak-style: au poivre.\" Agi, who by now is a slaveringconvert to the KD approach, fries the fish and makes the sauce as per Rosie's tuition and is soon tasting the fruits of her labours: \"That is delicious,\" she declares. \"It's definitely my favourite.\"</p> <p>Rosie's creations have hit the mark every time... but Agi is only one half of the problem: what of the absent Ed, who will be tasting the dishes after work? The answer came a day or so later. \"We were really sceptical,\" said Ed. \"We just couldn't see any common ground for you to work with. But I very much liked everything. I don't know how you did it.\"</p> <p>Perhaps he shouldn't have been so surprised - that's what a Kitchen Doctor is for, after all.</p> <p><b>Tuna steak au poivre</b></p> <p>A good compromise for Agi and Ed: a meaty, boneless piece of fish cooked in a classic steak way. Serves two.</p> <p><b> 2 decent-sized tuna steaks </b><br> <b>2 tbsp peppercorns (black or mixed) </b><br> <b>30g butter </b><br> <b>1 tbsp olive oil </b><br> <b>Salt </b><br> <b>1 shallot, finely chopped </b><br> <b>2 tbsp brandy </b><br> <b>60ml red wine </b><br> <b>150ml stock (chicken or beef) </b><br> <b>2 tbsp double cream (or cr\u00e8me frache)</b></p> <p>Crush the peppercorns. Sprinkle over the fish, press into the flesh and drizzle with half the olive oil. Cover and refrigerate for at least half an hour. Heat the rest of the oil and the butter in a pan, season the fish with a little salt and, when the butter starts foaming, cook the tuna until it turns opaque on the pan side - a couple of minutes, say - then turn over, add the shallot, and cook for two minutes more. Transfer the fish to a warm place, and make the sauce.</p> <p>Turn the heat to high, add the brandy, which should evaporate pretty instantly,then add the wine and reduce by two thirds. Add the stock, reduce by half, taste, season, add the cream and cook until the sauce is slightly thicker than milk. Pour over the tuna, and serve with the following potato dish.</p> <p><b>Crisp potatoes, olives and rocket</b></p> <p><b> 1 large waxy potato </b><br> <b>2 tbsp olive oil </b><br> <b>30g pitted black olives </b><br> <b>50-75g rocket </b><br> <b>4 basil leaves </b><br> <b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p>Cook the potato whole in salted water, drain, peel and cut into cubes. Just before you cook the fish, heat the oil in a pan, add the potato, cover, and leave to crisp up. Turn, and crisp up the other side. When you add the stock to the tuna's sauce, add the olives and rocket to the potatoes, stir until the leaves wilt, add the basil, season to taste and serve.</p> <p><b>Ham and beans</b></p> <p>A good, robust stew. I used tinned beans for speed, but for the best flavour use dried beans, soaked for eight hours. Ed gets his meat fix, and Agi has the full flavoured pulses with a dish of broccoli, anchovy, garlic and chilli. Serves four.</p> <p><b> 750g gammon </b><br> <b>1 carrot </b><br> <b>1 small onion </b><br> <b>Parsley stalks, or any other useful stock trimmings </b><br> <b>1 sprig fresh thyme </b><br> <b>1 bayleaf </b><br> <b>A few peppercorns </b><br> <b>400g tin kidney beans </b><br> <b>400g tin canellinni beans </b><br> <b>400g tinned tomatoes </b><br> <b>1 small green pepper, finely sliced </b><br> <b>2 shallots, finely sliced </b><br> <b>2 large cloves garlic, crushed </b><br> <b>1 tbsp molasses sugar </b><br> <b>2 tbsp olive oil </b><br> <b>10g parsley, roughly chopped</b></p> <p>First, cook the gammon - allow 55 minutes/kg, so you're looking at around 40 minutes here. In a big pan, cover the meat with water, add the carrot, onion, herbs and peppercorns, and bring to a boil. Skim to remove any foamy impurities, then simmer until done. Lift out the meat, pass the liquor through a sieve into a pot, measure out 150ml into another pot, and keep the rest for something else (the soup below, say).</p> <p>To the 150ml liquor, add the beans, tomatoes, pepper, shallots, garlic, sugar and oil, bring to the boil and simmer for half an hour. When it's time to eat, slice off a few pieces of ham per person, reheat this on top of the beans, keeping the pot covered. Lift out the meat, stir in the parsley and serve.</p> <p><b>Broccoli, anchovy, garlic and chilli</b></p> <p>Agi's alternative accompaniment to the beans: a classic combination that's quick, easy and very tasty. Serves four.</p> <p><b> 1 tbsp olive oil </b><br> <b>450g broccoli or romanesco, broken into very small florets </b><br> <b>small red chilli </b><br> <b>30g anchovy fillets, roughly chopped lemon</b></p> <p>Heat the oil in a pan, add the chilli and broccoli, toss them around, add a dash of water and cover for a couple of minutes, so the steam cooks the broccoli. Remove the lid, add the anchovies and stir. Add a squeeze of lemon, taste for seasoning and serve.</p> <p><b>The soup</b></p> <p>This Asian-style soup is based on a dish made by my best friend's mum. I love its simplicity, and that you can choose what bits you want to eat. Serves four.</p> <p><b> 2 chicken breasts (part-boned, skin-on organic, if you can afford them)</b><br> <b>250ml chicken stock (or the ham stock from the previous recipe) </b><br> <b>2 tbsp sherry (fino or amontillado) </b><br> <b>4 spring onions, finely sliced </b><br> <b>20g ginger, peeled and finely sliced </b><br> <b>100g beansprouts </b><br> <b>80g pak choi (or baby spinach) </b><br> <b>225g fat rice noodles </b><br> <b>100g baby corn </b><br> <b>100g tofu, cubed (I like smoked) </b><br> <b>16 tiger prawns, cooked and peeled </b></p> <p>For the dipping sauces</p> <p><b> 3 cloves garlic, very finely sliced </b><br> <b>4 shallots, finely sliced </b><br> <b>100ml sunflower oil </b><br> <b>tsp sesame oil </b><br> <b>Soy sauce </b><br> <b>1 small chilli, very finely chopped</b></p> <p>Place the chicken in a pan with the stock, sherry and 250ml water, bring to the boil, skim and simmer until the chicken is just cooked. Lift out the chicken, peel off the skin and cut the meat on a slight diagonal into thick slices. Cook the noodles as per the instructions on the packet, drain and refresh under cold water.</p> <p>Now make the dipping sauces. Heat the oils in a small pan, add the garlic and shallot, and fry until golden-brown. Tip into a little dish (a ramekin, say). Make the other dip by putting the chopped chilli and a pinch of the ginger sliced for the soup in another small dish, and cover with soy.</p> <p>Reheat the broth, throw in the remaining ginger, beansprouts, corn and tofu, and simmer until the corn is just cooked. Add the pak choi, spring onions and noodles, and heat through. Pour into a tureen or suitable bowl, place on a big plate, and surround with prawns, the chicken slices and some thinly sliced spring onions, each of which you dip into whichever sauce takes your fancy before eating with a mouthful of broth.</p> <p><b> Mushrooms on toast</b></p> <p>A great dish that works both as a side dish for a fillet steak, say, for the carnivores or, bulked out with leeks, cavolo nero and pinenuts, as a main for those who don't want meat. Serves four.</p> <p><b> 30g dried ceps, soaked in hot water for 30-45 minutes </b><br> <b>600g mixed mushrooms (such as oyster, shiitake, chestnut) </b><br> <b>1 loaf rustic white bread </b><br> <b>2 tbsp olive oil </b><br> <b>4 large cloves garlic, 3 crushed, the last reserved whole </b><br> <b>15g flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped </b><br> <b>80g butter, softened </b><br> <b>10g chives, snipped fine </b><br> <b>30g fresh Parmesan </b><br> <b>Salt and pepper</b></p> <p>Carefully wipe any dirt off the mushrooms; do not wash them. Slice the shiitakes and chestnuts, and shred the oysters into thick pieces. Mix the butter, crushed garlic, parsley and a dash of olive oil to a smooth paste, and season.</p> <p>Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan, add the fungi and cook down over a lowish heat. They will let out a lot of liquid.

      "bodyText": "Agi and Edward Hurst have a serious problem. It's an affliction that blights thousands of couples year in, year out, bringing with it discord and resentment where there should be sweetness and light. And, no, before you ask, it has nothing to do with sex. Agi explains all in a letter to the Kitchen Doctor: \"My husband and I would like to cook and eat together, but I don't eat meat. I do eat fish, seafood and all manner of vegetables.\" Not too much of a quandary there, you might think, but read on: \"My husband is very much a meat-eater, does not like fish, and will not touch seafood. Vegetarian dishes are usually met with a, 'Mmmm, the only thing missing is a steak'.\" See what I mean? That's not so much a job for the Kitchen Doctor, and more one for a miracle worker. And though both Hursts are management consultants, even their problem-solving expertise hasn't helped them find a solution. Rosie Sykes, however, loves a challenge, even one as seemingly insurmountable as this, which is how the KD crew find themselves one wet Thursday lunchtime unpacking the tools of their trade at Agi and Edward's flat in Surbiton, Surrey. Agi has to speak for both of them, as Ed is snowed under at work. \"We live completely independent lives as far as food is concerned,\" she says. \"I heat up ready meals, he makes pasta with tomato and meat sauce.\" Agi adds that her aversion to meat is not an ethical matter, or even one of flavour - she just can't stand the texture - so meat stocks and the like are not the complete no-nos Rosie had feared. Which is just as well, considering that her first act is to plonk a hunk of gammon in a pot, cover it with water, add herbs and veg, and bring it up to a boil. The ham will form the basis of the first dish on her latest mercy mission, a bean stew that, Rosie explains, \"is a bit like a baked bean thing - only they're not actually baked\". Before anyone can query her logic, she adds quickly that Ed can eat the beans with a slice or two of the ham, while Agi has them with a sort of Italian stir-fry of broccoli, anchovy and chilli. Agi, who, if truth be told, is not overly confident that Rosie can pull this one off, perks up no end. Her spirits rise even further when Rosie tells her, \"It's time to get your hands dirty and make a spinach and cheese tart - and, yes, I know there's no meat in it, but surely even Ed can do without once in a while.\" Agi concurs, and makes short work of converting a benchtop full of spinach, eggs and cheese into a gloriously golden gloop for the tart filling. \"Add some nutmeg,\" says Rosie after dipping her finger into the mix for a taste. \"It's always a good plan with the old spinach.\" The KD has brought ready-made pastry (Agi and Ed's other requirement was that they wanted food that didn't take an age to prepare), so the final stages are easy as, well, pie. \"Fine old job you did there,\" Rosie tells Agi, before turning her thoughts to an Asian-inspired soup. Agi is soon hard at work chopping and slicing, while Rosie makes the broth. Half an hour later, the soup is poured into a bowl, which is placed on a plate and surrounded with sliced chicken, tiger prawns and two dipping sauces. \"The idea is to share the old broth, and Ed eats his with chicken and you have tiger prawns.\" Agi, looking more impressed by the minute, nods happily and licks her lips, but before she can try it, Rosie comes over all concerned: \"I seem to be saying 'old' a lot, in a Jamie Oliver kind of way. I hope I'm not possessed.\" Agi suddenly seems unsure quite what she has let herself in for, as if Rosie is about to unleash a blizzard of \"pukka\"s and \"blinding\"s. Instead, an embarrassed KD buttons her lip while she prepares her rather grand take on mushrooms on toast, cheering up no end as a garlicky, buttery scent fills the kitchen. \"Pile it up,\" she exhorts Agi. \"As Jamie might say,\" quips Agi. \"Tssst,\" says Rosie, caught out again. \"Anyway, he'd say, 'Whack it on.' And enough of that cheek - you need to cook the tuna now.\" \"Ed's main problem with fish is the bones,\" explains Agi, suitably chastened. \"And he detests shellfish: if it's got tentacles or a shell, it's out.\" The tuna should not be a problem, then, says Rosie: \"The steaks are boneless, it's a really meaty fish and, to make it even more appealing to Ed, we're going to do them in a classic beef steak-style: au poivre.\" Agi, who by now is a slaveringconvert to the KD approach, fries the fish and makes the sauce as per Rosie's tuition and is soon tasting the fruits of her labours: \"That is delicious,\" she declares. \"It's definitely my favourite.\" Rosie's creations have hit the mark every time... but Agi is only one half of the problem: what of the absent Ed, who will be tasting the dishes after work? The answer came a day or so later. \"We were really sceptical,\" said Ed. \"We just couldn't see any common ground for you to work with. But I very much liked everything. I don't know how you did it.\" Perhaps he shouldn't have been so surprised - that's what a Kitchen Doctor is for, after all. Tuna steak au poivre A good compromise for Agi and Ed: a meaty, boneless piece of fish cooked in a classic steak way. Serves two. 2 decent-sized tuna steaks 2 tbsp peppercorns (black or mixed) 30g butter 1 tbsp olive oil Salt 1 shallot, finely chopped 2 tbsp brandy 60ml red wine 150ml stock (chicken or beef) 2 tbsp double cream (or cr\u00e8me frache) Crush the peppercorns. Sprinkle over the fish, press into the flesh and drizzle with half the olive oil. Cover and refrigerate for at least half an hour. Heat the rest of the oil and the butter in a pan, season the fish with a little salt and, when the butter starts foaming, cook the tuna until it turns opaque on the pan side - a couple of minutes, say - then turn over, add the shallot, and cook for two minutes more. Transfer the fish to a warm place, and make the sauce. Turn the heat to high, add the brandy, which should evaporate pretty instantly,then add the wine and reduce by two thirds. Add the stock, reduce by half, taste, season, add the cream and cook until the sauce is slightly thicker than milk. Pour over the tuna, and serve with the following potato dish. Crisp potatoes, olives and rocket 1 large waxy potato 2 tbsp olive oil 30g pitted black olives 50-75g rocket 4 basil leaves Salt and pepper Cook the potato whole in salted water, drain, peel and cut into cubes. Just before you cook the fish, heat the oil in a pan, add the potato, cover, and leave to crisp up. Turn, and crisp up the other side. When you add the stock to the tuna's sauce, add the olives and rocket to the potatoes, stir until the leaves wilt, add the basil, season to taste and serve. Ham and beans A good, robust stew. I used tinned beans for speed, but for the best flavour use dried beans, soaked for eight hours. Ed gets his meat fix, and Agi has the full flavoured pulses with a dish of broccoli, anchovy, garlic and chilli. Serves four. 750g gammon 1 carrot 1 small onion Parsley stalks, or any other useful stock trimmings 1 sprig fresh thyme 1 bayleaf A few peppercorns 400g tin kidney beans 400g tin canellinni beans 400g tinned tomatoes 1 small green pepper, finely sliced 2 shallots, finely sliced 2 large cloves garlic, crushed 1 tbsp molasses sugar 2 tbsp olive oil 10g parsley, roughly chopped First, cook the gammon - allow 55 minutes/kg, so you're looking at around 40 minutes here. In a big pan, cover the meat with water, add the carrot, onion, herbs and peppercorns, and bring to a boil. Skim to remove any foamy impurities, then simmer until done. Lift out the meat, pass the liquor through a sieve into a pot, measure out 150ml into another pot, and keep the rest for something else (the soup below, say). To the 150ml liquor, add the beans, tomatoes, pepper, shallots, garlic, sugar and oil, bring to the boil and simmer for half an hour. When it's time to eat, slice off a few pieces of ham per person, reheat this on top of the beans, keeping the pot covered. Lift out the meat, stir in the parsley and serve. Broccoli, anchovy, garlic and chilli Agi's alternative accompaniment to the beans: a classic combination that's quick, easy and very tasty. Serves four. 1 tbsp olive oil 450g broccoli or romanesco, broken into very small florets small red chilli 30g anchovy fillets, roughly chopped lemon Heat the oil in a pan, add the chilli and broccoli, toss them around, add a dash of water and cover for a couple of minutes, so the steam cooks the broccoli. Remove the lid, add the anchovies and stir. Add a squeeze of lemon, taste for seasoning and serve. The soup This Asian-style soup is based on a dish made by my best friend's mum. I love its simplicity, and that you can choose what bits you want to eat. Serves four. 2 chicken breasts (part-boned, skin-on organic, if you can afford them) 250ml chicken stock (or the ham stock from the previous recipe) 2 tbsp sherry (fino or amontillado) 4 spring onions, finely sliced 20g ginger, peeled and finely sliced 100g beansprouts 80g pak choi (or baby spinach) 225g fat rice noodles 100g baby corn 100g tofu, cubed (I like smoked) 16 tiger prawns, cooked and peeled For the dipping sauces 3 cloves garlic, very finely sliced 4 shallots, finely sliced 100ml sunflower oil tsp sesame oil Soy sauce 1 small chilli, very finely chopped Place the chicken in a pan with the stock, sherry and 250ml water, bring to the boil, skim and simmer until the chicken is just cooked. Lift out the chicken, peel off the skin and cut the meat on a slight diagonal into thick slices. Cook the noodles as per the instructions on the packet, drain and refresh under cold water. Now make the dipping sauces. Heat the oils in a small pan, add the garlic and shallot, and fry until golden-brown. Tip into a little dish (a ramekin, say). Make the other dip by putting the chopped chilli and a pinch of the ginger sliced for the soup in another small dish, and cover with soy. Reheat the broth, throw in the remaining ginger, beansprouts, corn and tofu, and simmer until the corn is just cooked. Add the pak choi, spring onions and noodles, and heat through. Pour into a tureen or suitable bowl, place on a big plate, and surround with prawns, the chicken slices and some thinly sliced spring onions, each of which you dip into whichever sauce takes your fancy before eating with a mouthful of broth. Mushrooms on toast A great dish that works both as a side dish for a fillet steak, say, for the carnivores or, bulked out with leeks, cavolo nero and pinenuts, as a main for those who don't want meat. Serves four. 30g dried ceps, soaked in hot water for 30-45 minutes 600g mixed mushrooms (such as oyster, shiitake, chestnut) 1 loaf rustic white bread 2 tbsp olive oil 4 large cloves garlic, 3 crushed, the last reserved whole 15g flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 80g butter, softened 10g chives, snipped fine 30g fresh Parmesan Salt and pepper Carefully wipe any dirt off the mushrooms; do not wash them. Slice the shiitakes and chestnuts, and shred the oysters into thick pieces. Mix the butter, crushed garlic, parsley and a dash of olive oil to a smooth paste, and season. Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan, add the fungi and cook down over a lowish heat. They will let out a lot of liquid. Add a generous tablespoon of the garlic butter mix (keep the rest in the fridge: it's a really handy thing to have about, as it gives a lift to all manner of dishes, from steamed fish and veg to grilled meat), turn up the heat a little, and cook until the mushrooms have reabsorbed all liquid in the pan. Meanwhile, toast one slice of bread per person, rub each with the reserved garlic, and keep warm until the mushrooms are ready. To serve, top the toasts with the mushrooms, and sprinkle with chives and roughly grated Parmesan. Spinach, courgette and cheese pie Strong-flavoured enough to make even Ed forget meat for a night. Serves four. 1 packet ready-rolled puff pastry 500g frozen spinach, defrosted 2 courgettes, sliced thinly 100g cheddar, roughly grated 100g soft goats' cheese, mashed 100g ricotta 80g Parmesan, roughly grated Nutmeg 6 eggs, beaten 55g fresh breadcrumbs lemon, zested 10g flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped 15g cold butter, grated Preheat the oven to 175C/350F/gas mark 4. Beat all the cheese, bar a tablespoon of Parmesan, with the eggs, a little grated nutmeg and spinach until smooth. Line a 30x10cm baking tin with the pastry, and roll down the edges. Fill with the cheese mix and lay the courgettes on top. Sprinkle with the butter, then the breadcrumbs, parsley, lemon zest and the reserved Parmesan. Cook on the top shelf until the pastry is golden and the filling set, about 35 minutes. Peas, potatoes and fennel A versatile dish to which you can add other seasonal treats such as broad beans, asparagus or artichoke hearts. Good with sausages, lamb chops or a nice piece of white fish. Serves four. 350g new potatoes, scrubbed 150g peas, fresh or frozen 1 head fennel, thinly sliced 1 lemon, juiced 60ml double cream 15g mint, leaves picked and chopped, stalks reserved Sea salt and black pepper Put the spuds and mint stalks in a pan of salted water, bring to the boil, then simmer until almost cooked. Add the peas and cook until tender. Drain off the water leaving 1cm in the pan, add the fennel and lemon juice, season, and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring often.

Repainting is made practically impossible by a unique custom, dating back to 1939, requiring every angler who lands a \"moonie\" (an 8lb sea trout) to draw or paint its likeness - consequently, shoals of monster fish leap across every wall. Modernisation is on its way, though; while Victorian cast-iron beds with horsehair mattresses presently come complete with \"chipped china chamber pot\", there are plans afoot to bring a convenience inside. Ironically, the modern-day green mantra Re-use, Repair and Recycle sums up the spirit of these homes exactly. And while we may feel we embrace this ethos in the newspapers and bottles we deposit in recycling bins, few of us are driven by necessity to adopt it wholeheartedly. Falling in love with the style of these homes is easy.

      "body": "<p>Amy Tan has always seen the world as a violent, dangerous place - with good reason. Her own life, and that of her mother and grandmother in pre-revolutionary China, has been dogged with astonishing drama, tragedy and violence. While that inheritance can be traced in her novels, what stands out more is the changing, often abrasive, interplay between generations, between Chinese mothers and their American daughters. </p> <p>She began writing late, and enjoyed immediate success. Her first novel, The Joy Luck Club, was published in 1989 when she was 37, remained on the New York Times bestseller list for 77 weeks, and, like all her books, has been translated into many languages, including Chinese. Set mainly in San Francisco's Chinatown, the largest in the western world and dating back to the Gold Rush, it interweaves the pasts and presents of four migrant women who gather to play mahjong under the impatient glances of their Coca-Cola-swilling daughters. Though Tan had precedents, notably Maxine Hong Kingston, she is credited with opening eyes to hidden lives - and doors to younger writers - not least in a city where a third of the population is east Asian. </p> <p>The Joy Luck Club, and the Hollywood spin-off directed by Wayne Wang four years later, cornered what Time magazine saw as burgeoning US interest in \"growing up ethnic\". Yet its broad appeal, and that of Tan's subsequent bestsellers, The Kitchen God's Wife (1991) and The Hundred Secret Senses (1996), owe as much to their humour about family neuroses that cross ethnic lines as detached curiosity. Like her friend and Bay area neighbour, Isabel Allende, Tan's popular fiction, with its historical backdrop spanning California and China, undercuts exoticism with irony, romance with anxiety, the supernatural with the sceptical. </p> <p>The Bonesetter's Daughter, Tan's new novel and her first in five years, was conceived in response to the diagnoses, within a few months of each other, of her mother Daisy with Alzheimer's and her friend and editor, Faith Sale, with cancer. \"I became consumed with both illnesses and both people,\" says Tan. \"I wanted to write about the loss of memory, and the memories you keep in the midst of losing somebody; what you try to keep but end up forgetting, and what you try to discover before the loss.\" But she found herself spinning out the novel for years beyond the deadline. \"It almost felt as though, as long as I kept writing the book, they'd both stay alive.\" </p> <p>Daisy Tan and Sale died within weeks of each other in late 1999. Tan then rewrote the book from scratch. The story of Ruth, a Chinese-American New Age ghostwriter finding her own voice while her Chinese-born mother, Lu-Ling, succumbs to Alzheimer's, it is Tan's most autobiographical to date. Reflecting changes wrought by the disease in Tan's relationship with her own mother, it brings a paradoxical sense of healing and closure in an oeuvre marked by burning attrition between mothers and daughters. </p> <p>Now 49, Tan shares her home in Presidio Heights, overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, with her husband of 27 years, Louis DeMattei, a tax attorney, and a pair of tiny Yorkshire terriers, Bubba and Lilliput. She is graceful and self-possessed, but it is clear she has a wilder side, too: she sings for charity in a rock band, The Rock Bottom Remainders, with other bestselling writers, including Stephen King, Carl Hiaasen and, until recently, Barbara Kingsolver. Touring once a year as a leather-clad dominatrix, belting out These Boots Are Made For Walking and Leader Of The Pack satisfies a need, she laughs, to be a teenager again. And there are other advantages: \"Nobody on the bus asks, 'Where do you get your ideas?' \" </p> <p>She enjoys the other trappings of success, too, including a cabin by Lake Tahoe and a New York apartment. Yet celebrity has added to her ever-present sense of danger, bringing stalkers and death threats - even a bizarre website titled \"AmyTanmustdie\". </p> <p>Tan was born in Oakland, California, in 1952. Her mother had left China in 1949, five days before the communists took Shanghai. In Tan's fiction, the Chinese mothers are infuriating, both in their eccentric beliefs and in their dress sense, but they are vindicated through their daughters' gradual understanding of their pasts. Tan discovered that her own grandmother had been raped as a young widow by a merchant who had forced her into concubinage; she killed herself by swallowing raw opium. Her daughter, Daisy - Amy's mother - was forced into a feudal marriage, but later ran away from her abusive husband, blaming him for the deaths of two of her five children. Leaving her husband without a divorce was a criminal act - let alone leaving him for another man, as she did. </p> <p>John Tan, her second husband, was an electrical engineer from Beijing - he fled the country for the US; Daisy was captured, raped and thrown into jail - her trial, says Tan, was covered in the Shanghai tabloids - before she, too, was able to escape to California and join him. Daisy left China expecting to send for her three daughters, but they were trapped once the \"bamboo curtain\" came down. It was 30 years before she saw them again, and for many years she never spoke of them to her new family. </p> <p>Safe in the US, both John and Daisy toiled at night school. \"From when I was seven,\" recalls Tan, \"my mother was a nurse, doing everything from changing bedpans to giving vaccinations, which is amazing to me; how she managed to cook incredible meals every night. Everything was fresh - which I hated. 'Why can't we have canned spinach?'\" Tan wags her head brattishly. \"'Fresh vegetables are what poor people eat.'\" </p> <p>Tan, who when she was young fantasised about plastic surgery to make her look less oriental, blamed her unhappiness as a child on being Chinese - \"It was the most convenient scapegoat\" - but now feels that the constant uprooting, between 10 cities around the San Francisco Bay area, was as much a cause of alienation. \"I'd lose a set of friends, and spend months before I'd find others. All children have their forms of unhappiness, and being different is an anxiety, especially as a teenager.\" The 50s and 60s were also an era of assimilation: \"Being different was less tolerated; you'd be teased with racial jokes. People found it disgusting if you ate fish with the head still attached to it. Teenagers can be very cruel.\" </p> <p>Brought up bilingual (in her dreams, she speaks fluent Mandarin), Tan was soon refusing to speak Chinese in public. She became an interpreter for her mother, of whose imperfect English she was ashamed. \"It's something I resented as a child,\" she recalls, \"though you can look at it with humour. I'd be on the telephone to banks as a young girl, pretending I was my mother. A lot of what I translated had to do with how terrible I was - writing letters to my mother's friends saying she was thinking of sending me to school in Taiwan to turn me into a better girl. I learnt to say what I thought people wanted to hear.\" </p> <p>When Tan was 14, her elder brother died of a brain tumour; within the year, her father was also dead, of the same cause. She now suspects that this coincidence (her mother also developed a benign brain tumour) was due to her father's business making electrical transformers. \"They were doughnut-shaped, with a very powerful electromagnetic force, which we all made and tested in the house.\" Yet her mother, who believed in ancestral spirits and malign imbalances, felt that the family was cursed. \"She had such a morbid feeling about everything; she became distressed at the smallest sign of illness. She'd take me to hospital if I complained of a headache. My way of dealing with that was not to tell her about anything that scared or hurt me.\" </p> <p>There were other traumas. An episode of child molestation in The Bonesetter's Daughter echoes something that happened to Amy Tan herself. \"My brother was dead, my father was in the hospital and had lost his mind; he almost didn't recognise me. I'd been a Daddy's girl - my father was brilliant, personable; he was the one I wanted to be like. To see him there, laughing because he was demented . . .\" she trails off. </p> <p>She was being counselled by a community elder because her mother thought she was out of control. \"The man said, 'Your father's in a lot of physical pain; he'd be in even more pain knowing what you're doing.' I'd been this hard-shelled, defiant teenager, not showing that anything mattered to me. But I broke down sobbing. I was hysterical with grief.\" Then the man changed tack: \"He started to tickle me, threw me on to the bed and moved to other parts of my body. It felt so wrong, but I thought, how can it be? This man is a respected member of the community.\" </p> <p>The man, whom Tan declines to name to this day (\"I'm so afraid he'll come back into my life\"), reappeared years later at one of her book signings. \"I was like a deer caught in headlights,\" she says. \"I could not speak.\" That muteness - a theme of her new book - returned after a college roommate was murdered while Tan was studying for a PhD at Berkeley. \"I had to identify the body and go in the room and see all the blood,\" she remembers with horror. \"It happened on my birthday, and every year for about 10 years, on my birthday I lost my voice.\" </p> <p> After her husband's death, Tan's mother sold the business and took Amy and her younger brother, John - who now works for a software company near his sister - to Europe. They drove through the Netherlands and Germany, before renting a furnished chalet in Montreux, Switzerland, overlooking Lake Geneva. But at her private school, Tan says, she was nearly raped by a school janitor. \"The teachers told me, next time, you should be more careful.\" They sacked the man. \"I lived in terror he would come after me and kill me.\" </p> <p>These events have bred a sense of danger that lurks everywhere. \"I live with thoughts of being killed every day,\" says Tan. \"I'm not so much afraid of death as of violence; and my mother's warnings are fulfilled - people die, terrible things can happen.\" </p> <p>Tan lists the things that have happened to her: \"I have been in three hotel break-ins, held up at gunpoint, made to lie down on the floor in a meat-locker, beaten up in a bar by a drunk, had a gang of people come after me with knives. I think, is this forewarning, or is that superstitious neurosis? Then I think, thank God I'm a writer: you can play with notions of fear and mortality.\" She adds: \"It's made me very strong; I'm resilient, I have survivor skills. Some of that is superficial - what I present to people outwardly - but what makes people resilient is the ability to find humour and irony in situations that would otherwise overpower you.\" </p> <p>By the time the family left Switzerland when Tan was 17, she was in open revolt. The year before, her mother had hired a private detective to follow her and her German boyfriend (\"An army deserter who had escaped from a mental hospital\"), and hestumbled on her friends who were dealing in hashish (\"I was unaware - it's not as though I was sticking needles in myself\"). All of them, except the 16-year-old Amy, were deported. </p> <p>Once back in California, Tan infuriated her mother further by abandoning pre-med school to study English and linguistics (she jokes that she was expected to be a neurosurgeon by profession and a concert pianist as a hobby). But there were moments of reconciliation. Amy's husband-to-be, a friend of her cousin, made a good impression: \"My cousin turned up with 10 friends, expecting dinner. My mother was angry - in the kitchen throwing pots and pans around and growling. Lou quietly ate a lot, and she remembers he appreciated her cooking.\" </p> <p>Lou's Italian-American parents initially disapproved - \"because I was Chinese, they thought I'd be a liability to him as a lawyer\". But Tan's mother had \"given up the notion that I'd marry a Chinese boy; in high school there were none. All the Chinese boys I knew were relatives or close family friends.\" Tan faintly regrets that lack of opportunity to date Chinese men (\"It's very comfortable when somebody has a similar sense of history\"), yet feels her husband has blended in. \"So much of family revolves around food, and Lou eats more things Chinese than I do - I'm much more squeamish.\" </p> <p>After a spell as a speech therapist for children with disabilities, Tan was a successful corporate writer, writing everything from computer manuals to romantic horoscopes. Yet she spent much of the 80s as a self- confessed workaholic, putting in a joyless 90-hour week. \"I couldn't find the threshold that would tell me to stop, to say now you've succeeded, you're happy, you've gotten enough approval. Whatever people are looking for in work or life, I wasn't finding, so I was smoking and working round the clock. Lou complained that I had no life and was stinking up the house.\" </p> <p>So she took up jazz piano and creative writing. But Tan had to rediscover her Chinese ancestry before she could find her subject. The change had begun in Europe. \"In Switzerland, being Chinese was an asset; boys thought I was exotic. Looking back, the new spin was possibly no better than being looked at as undesirable, but I saw my opinion of myself could turn simply because of people's biases. It was a valuable lesson in self-esteem.\" </p> <p>At college, she took classes in spoken Chinese and Asian history. \"You go through a more activist period of being angry that your history books never had any positive role model of Asians, just had them working the railroads, and that wasn't my background. But it's necessary to find a balance, being comfortable and knowledgeable about your own culture, and not feeling guilty that you're not really Chinese. It's an evolution of ethnic identity, but it's a lifetime's process.\" </p> <p>Tan was in her teens before she learned that her mother had been married before,and had the three elder daughters in China. The subject erupted when her father was in hospital. \"I'd done something that angered my mother,\" says Tan. \"She was hitting me, saying, 'Why did I have you? I have other daughters who are good; they speak Chinese.' I felt very threatened - that I could be replaced.\" She wasn't to meet her half- sisters for 20 years. </p> <p>In 1986, while on holiday in Hawaii, Tanreceived the news that her mother had had a heart attack. She rushed home, vowing to get to know her mother better, but it was a false alarm: \"She'd gotten into a row with a fishmonger.\" Tan followed through her promise, however, visiting China for the first time with her mother and her husband. She felt more American there, \"in that stupid, traveller sense\", but also \"suddenly Chinese, the minute I touched China\" - \"As if the membrane separating the two halves of my life has finally been shed,\" as she wrote. </p> <p>\"I felt connected to that history and landscape, and to everything that formed my family and their past,\" she says. \"And my mother was extremely proud to feel needed to explain the world to me now, when all those years I'd had to translate for her. I found that she got into as many arguments with shopkeepers as she did in America - it had nothing to do with language; it was personality.\" </p> <p>Tan at last met her three half-sisters - \"My uncle, an important communist official, appeared with a woman. I shook hands stiffly and only later realised that she was my sister. I'd anticipated the big American embrace, but we talked later.\" She began to look differently at the inheritance that she shared with these half-sisters who displayed common \"emotional traits\" - \"hand gestures; sense of humour; small nuances of expression; their sense of outrage if someone tried to humiliate them; speechlessness, then sudden rage; being depressed by certain things\". </p> <p>Yet there were cultural differences. \"I have a sense of entitlement they don't have - being an American.\" In fact, though Tan's eldest half-sister, Yuhang Wang, a retired civil servant, is still in Shanghai, the other two have since migrated to the US. Tina runs a takeaway in Wisconsin, June is a software engineer in the Bay area. The reunited family spends Chinese new years together. </p> <p>While Tan was in China, The Joy Luck Club, still only in embryonic form, was sold to a New York publisher for $50,000. Paperback rights were later auctioned for $1.2 million. Though Tan is now proud of the film she co-produced in 1993 with Oliver Stone and also co-wrote (\"It's an emotional sibling to the book; it was never intended to be a twin, a filmic clone\"), she had been apprehensive beforehand. </p> <p>\"I've had criticisms from people who think I should be creating sociological models. One mandate placed on writers from different ethnic backgrounds is to create 'superior' characters who speak articulate English. But simply because my mother could not speak good English, did that make her inferior? If I can create a character who speaks the way my mother spoke to me, but who has valuable things to say, and it seduces the reader into rooting for her, then I've done more than anything else to forward a sense of humanity, in making people not judge others for superficial reasons.\" </p> <p>Her mother's storytelling about her life in China fuels Tan's fiction, most directly The Kitchen God's Wife. \"One of the things my mother said to me after she read The Joy Luck Club was, 'The past can be changed; if you tell the world, the pattern can be changed.' It's not as though I'm going to change the way women are treated, but I can change how my grandmother will be remembered - not simply as a tragic victim and a forgotten woman, but as a woman who left a legacy of strength.\" </p> <p>Tan remains fascinated by the history that affected her family - from the Boxer uprisings of the 19th century to the Japanese invasion and civil war of the 20th. Her paternal grandfather was educated by missionaries and the influence endured: her father became a Baptist minister in California. </p> <p> Tan's first novel came out the year the Tiananmen Square students' uprising was crushed. She found herself under great pressure to denounce China: \"My family was in Beijing; if I denounced the government, I was putting them at risk. I thought, does my spouting my mouth off improve things or simply assert my rights as an American to say what I feel? People took that as my standing on the fence, but if I'm concerned about human rights I have to think harder about what I do that results in positive change.\" </p> <p>Despite her success, Tan suffers bouts of depression. \"It could be genetic or being around a mother who was suicidal,\" she says. \"When I was a little girl, she talked about killing herself, and there were times when she'd make an attempt in front of us. Mostly, it wasn't a quiet depression - she'd be hysterical and shouting; she'd open the car door on the freeway and try to jump out; turn all the furniture upside down in the house in rage, and brandish a knife. It's easy to pass that on to a child. And my grandmother was obviously depressed; it runs in three generations.\" </p> <p>She now controls it with anti-depressants. \"I don't think of myself as weak, but I have this in my psychological make-up, chinks in the emotional armour.\" She once tried therapy (\"The therapist fell asleep\"), but prefers informal chats with therapist friends. \"Part of my problem is self-esteem and a difficulty trusting strangers. People think I'm so open, but there's a lot I keep within myself. It's good to keep secrets if you're a writer and gradually unveil them.\" </p> <p>The Hundred Secret Senses, perhaps Tan's funniest book, is the story of the Chinese-American Olivia and her Chinese elder half-sister, Kwan, who remembers past lives. Tan spoke of it as a \"coming out\" about her beliefs in \"yin people\" (ghosts) as a source of her fiction - an admission she knew would expose her to ridicule. \"My father and brother dying makes me think a lot about what goes on after life; the possibility that consciousness goes on,\" she says. </p> <p>Her mother would set a ouija board before her and ask not only about their dead relatives but about the stock market. \"I've always been ambivalent,\" says Tan. \"I was raised with a sense that I could communicate with ghosts, and it did seem to come from something other than myself. I can still find rational ways to explain these things - as repressed memory or the Jungian collective unconscious. But I've gotten so much help in my writing that it's hard to pass these off - it's like being ungrateful; denying the existence of a force greater than oneself. You could say it's ghosts or the supernatural, but those terms are tainted as flaky notions. To me, it's not about physical bodies before birth or after death; it's a continuous consciousness and a form of love. It's benevolent, not frightening.\" </p> <p>While the New York Times saw it as a battle between Tan's \"rational, western side\", and her \"dreamier, eastern side\", her beliefs owe more, perhaps, to Californian New Ageism than to any eastern mysticism. It was as Tan was finishing The Hundred Secret Senses that she learned that Faith Sale, her editor and friend, was ill. \"I realised I'd never lived alone until I went to New York to be with my editor. I went from living at home to living with a roommate to being with Lou. New York was a frightening experience.\" </p> <p>Then her mother's Alzheimer's was diagnosed, and Tan became, as does Ruth in the new novel, \"a mother to the child her mother had become\". Tan remembers inviting her mother for Christmas in New York. \"I worried the whole time: how would she remember her flight number? It's like sending a five-year-old child across the country.\" </p> <p>She was aware of changes in her mother, who \"lost her English and her Mandarin, and could only speak Shanghainese, her first language\". But dementia was also a \"truth serum\": \"My mother no longer had any buffers on her emotions. In some sense, she'd always remained about nine years old emotionally, because that's when her mother killed herself; she needed to be the centre of attention and to feel wanted.\" </p> <p>On Tan's half-sister's birthday, her mother declared that she should get all the presents. \"It sounds child-like, but it's also how she was before, though she didn't say it so openly. Instead of being distressed, we'd joke about the things in ourselves that would show up if we had the same condition; what little bits of truth would leak out if we didn't censor ourselves.\" </p> <p>She adds: \"I found that I knew so much more about my mother emotionally than I had thought. People often say that, with Alzheimer's, the person is is no longer the person you knew, that they become a shell of themselves. I didn't find that. My mother retained a rich and happy emotional life. She wanted to be loved and needed, and I could use my knowledge of her emotional needs to communicate with her; that was enormously gratifying to me. I realised it wasn't that my mother had to read my books or know that I'd accomplished things to make her proud of me. It's the thing I miss most about having a mother; there is no one else in the world who worries about you so much; who sees the dangers and will annoy the hell out of you telling you what they are.\" </p> <p>The Bonesetter's Daughter mirrors Tan's practical battle with her mother's disease. After buying houses and trying to offer live-in help, Tan and her husband moved Daisy into an assisted-care residence through subterfuge. \"We told her it cost $750 a month - her social security - and she thought it was a bargain. In all the places she's lived, she was the happiest there. She felt safe. When she was dying those last three weeks, we all moved in, 18 or 20 of us, playing card games and mahjong, eating takeout food, taking turns to stay overnight.\" </p> <p>The novel was reshaped when Tan learned her mother's true maiden name - Li Bingzi - on the day her mother died. \"I was stunned; I'd spent all these years writing about her life, but I didn't know what name she was born with.\" She found a metaphor in Peking Man, the bones of which were excavated, lost and never refound. \"It's so much like how we learn about our own parents, our ancestors and origins. We discover pieces and then lose them, and so much remains a mystery.\" </p> <p>There was an unexpected emotional resolution to a rift of long before. When Tan was 16, \"my mother was so frustrated - and I really did do things that would have driven any parent crazy - she snapped and held a cleaver to my throat. I was so numb and angry, for 20 minutes I acted as though I didn't care if she sliced my throat. She was absolutely crazy; you could see it in her eyes. She said, 'I'll kill you and Didi [my little brother] then myself, and we'll go where Daddy and Peter are, and you won't be ruining your life.' She never talked later about what happened. But two years after she had Alzheimer's, she said in Chinese, in a rare moment of lucidity: 'Amy, I think I'm losing my mind, I can't remember so many things. But I did something terrible to you when you were a child, I don't remember what. I'm sorry.' It was such a wonderful thing. For every child, no matter how good their childhood, there's something back there that you wished your parents had said sorry for; for me, it was for that.\" </p> <p>Tan, who has also written two children's books, decided with her husband not to have children. She speculates about an early miscarriage: \"In my mind it was a girl; she'd be 21 now, and would be giving us such grief, though we're convinced our children would have been beautiful.\" More seriously, she feared passing on instability - \"I've never learned to feed myself at regular intervals, and I've operated for so long on impulse\" - and neurosis: \"I'd worry obsessively and see danger in so much.\" Yet she has no regrets. \"We never felt a strong compulsion to duplicate our genetic structure; what's in me that I'd have wanted to pass on is already in the books.\" </p> <p>The Bonesetter's Daughter, by Amy Tan, is published on March 12 by Flamingo, priced \u00a316.99.<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000533733,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p>Amy Tan will be in conversation with Maya Jaggi at the Purcell Room on the South Bank, London SE1, on Tuesday, April 17, at 7.30pm.

      "bodyText": "Amy Tan has always seen the world as a violent, dangerous place - with good reason. Her own life, and that of her mother and grandmother in pre-revolutionary China, has been dogged with astonishing drama, tragedy and violence. While that inheritance can be traced in her novels, what stands out more is the changing, often abrasive, interplay between generations, between Chinese mothers and their American daughters. She began writing late, and enjoyed immediate success. Her first novel, The Joy Luck Club, was published in 1989 when she was 37, remained on the New York Times bestseller list for 77 weeks, and, like all her books, has been translated into many languages, including Chinese. Set mainly in San Francisco's Chinatown, the largest in the western world and dating back to the Gold Rush, it interweaves the pasts and presents of four migrant women who gather to play mahjong under the impatient glances of their Coca-Cola-swilling daughters. Though Tan had precedents, notably Maxine Hong Kingston, she is credited with opening eyes to hidden lives - and doors to younger writers - not least in a city where a third of the population is east Asian. The Joy Luck Club, and the Hollywood spin-off directed by Wayne Wang four years later, cornered what Time magazine saw as burgeoning US interest in \"growing up ethnic\". Yet its broad appeal, and that of Tan's subsequent bestsellers, The Kitchen God's Wife (1991) and The Hundred Secret Senses (1996), owe as much to their humour about family neuroses that cross ethnic lines as detached curiosity. Like her friend and Bay area neighbour, Isabel Allende, Tan's popular fiction, with its historical backdrop spanning California and China, undercuts exoticism with irony, romance with anxiety, the supernatural with the sceptical. The Bonesetter's Daughter, Tan's new novel and her first in five years, was conceived in response to the diagnoses, within a few months of each other, of her mother Daisy with Alzheimer's and her friend and editor, Faith Sale, with cancer. \"I became consumed with both illnesses and both people,\" says Tan. \"I wanted to write about the loss of memory, and the memories you keep in the midst of losing somebody; what you try to keep but end up forgetting, and what you try to discover before the loss.\" But she found herself spinning out the novel for years beyond the deadline. \"It almost felt as though, as long as I kept writing the book, they'd both stay alive.\" Daisy Tan and Sale died within weeks of each other in late 1999. Tan then rewrote the book from scratch. The story of Ruth, a Chinese-American New Age ghostwriter finding her own voice while her Chinese-born mother, Lu-Ling, succumbs to Alzheimer's, it is Tan's most autobiographical to date. Reflecting changes wrought by the disease in Tan's relationship with her own mother, it brings a paradoxical sense of healing and closure in an oeuvre marked by burning attrition between mothers and daughters. Now 49, Tan shares her home in Presidio Heights, overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge, with her husband of 27 years, Louis DeMattei, a tax attorney, and a pair of tiny Yorkshire terriers, Bubba and Lilliput. She is graceful and self-possessed, but it is clear she has a wilder side, too: she sings for charity in a rock band, The Rock Bottom Remainders, with other bestselling writers, including Stephen King, Carl Hiaasen and, until recently, Barbara Kingsolver. Touring once a year as a leather-clad dominatrix, belting out These Boots Are Made For Walking and Leader Of The Pack satisfies a need, she laughs, to be a teenager again. And there are other advantages: \"Nobody on the bus asks, 'Where do you get your ideas?' \" She enjoys the other trappings of success, too, including a cabin by Lake Tahoe and a New York apartment. Yet celebrity has added to her ever-present sense of danger, bringing stalkers and death threats - even a bizarre website titled \"AmyTanmustdie\". Tan was born in Oakland, California, in 1952. Her mother had left China in 1949, five days before the communists took Shanghai. In Tan's fiction, the Chinese mothers are infuriating, both in their eccentric beliefs and in their dress sense, but they are vindicated through their daughters' gradual understanding of their pasts. Tan discovered that her own grandmother had been raped as a young widow by a merchant who had forced her into concubinage; she killed herself by swallowing raw opium. Her daughter, Daisy - Amy's mother - was forced into a feudal marriage, but later ran away from her abusive husband, blaming him for the deaths of two of her five children. Leaving her husband without a divorce was a criminal act - let alone leaving him for another man, as she did. John Tan, her second husband, was an electrical engineer from Beijing - he fled the country for the US; Daisy was captured, raped and thrown into jail - her trial, says Tan, was covered in the Shanghai tabloids - before she, too, was able to escape to California and join him. Daisy left China expecting to send for her three daughters, but they were trapped once the \"bamboo curtain\" came down. It was 30 years before she saw them again, and for many years she never spoke of them to her new family. Safe in the US, both John and Daisy toiled at night school. \"From when I was seven,\" recalls Tan, \"my mother was a nurse, doing everything from changing bedpans to giving vaccinations, which is amazing to me; how she managed to cook incredible meals every night. Everything was fresh - which I hated. 'Why can't we have canned spinach?'\" Tan wags her head brattishly. \"'Fresh vegetables are what poor people eat.'\" Tan, who when she was young fantasised about plastic surgery to make her look less oriental, blamed her unhappiness as a child on being Chinese - \"It was the most convenient scapegoat\" - but now feels that the constant uprooting, between 10 cities around the San Francisco Bay area, was as much a cause of alienation. \"I'd lose a set of friends, and spend months before I'd find others. All children have their forms of unhappiness, and being different is an anxiety, especially as a teenager.\" The 50s and 60s were also an era of assimilation: \"Being different was less tolerated; you'd be teased with racial jokes. People found it disgusting if you ate fish with the head still attached to it. Teenagers can be very cruel.\" Brought up bilingual (in her dreams, she speaks fluent Mandarin), Tan was soon refusing to speak Chinese in public. She became an interpreter for her mother, of whose imperfect English she was ashamed. \"It's something I resented as a child,\" she recalls, \"though you can look at it with humour. I'd be on the telephone to banks as a young girl, pretending I was my mother. A lot of what I translated had to do with how terrible I was - writing letters to my mother's friends saying she was thinking of sending me to school in Taiwan to turn me into a better girl. I learnt to say what I thought people wanted to hear.\" When Tan was 14, her elder brother died of a brain tumour; within the year, her father was also dead, of the same cause. She now suspects that this coincidence (her mother also developed a benign brain tumour) was due to her father's business making electrical transformers. \"They were doughnut-shaped, with a very powerful electromagnetic force, which we all made and tested in the house.\" Yet her mother, who believed in ancestral spirits and malign imbalances, felt that the family was cursed. \"She had such a morbid feeling about everything; she became distressed at the smallest sign of illness. She'd take me to hospital if I complained of a headache. My way of dealing with that was not to tell her about anything that scared or hurt me.\" There were other traumas. An episode of child molestation in The Bonesetter's Daughter echoes something that happened to Amy Tan herself. \"My brother was dead, my father was in the hospital and had lost his mind; he almost didn't recognise me. I'd been a Daddy's girl - my father was brilliant, personable; he was the one I wanted to be like. To see him there, laughing because he was demented . . .\" she trails off. She was being counselled by a community elder because her mother thought she was out of control. \"The man said, 'Your father's in a lot of physical pain; he'd be in even more pain knowing what you're doing.' I'd been this hard-shelled, defiant teenager, not showing that anything mattered to me. But I broke down sobbing. I was hysterical with grief.\" Then the man changed tack: \"He started to tickle me, threw me on to the bed and moved to other parts of my body. It felt so wrong, but I thought, how can it be? This man is a respected member of the community.\" The man, whom Tan declines to name to this day (\"I'm so afraid he'll come back into my life\"), reappeared years later at one of her book signings. \"I was like a deer caught in headlights,\" she says. \"I could not speak.\" That muteness - a theme of her new book - returned after a college roommate was murdered while Tan was studying for a PhD at Berkeley. \"I had to identify the body and go in the room and see all the blood,\" she remembers with horror. \"It happened on my birthday, and every year for about 10 years, on my birthday I lost my voice.\" After her husband's death, Tan's mother sold the business and took Amy and her younger brother, John - who now works for a software company near his sister - to Europe. They drove through the Netherlands and Germany, before renting a furnished chalet in Montreux, Switzerland, overlooking Lake Geneva. But at her private school, Tan says, she was nearly raped by a school janitor. \"The teachers told me, next time, you should be more careful.\" They sacked the man. \"I lived in terror he would come after me and kill me.\" These events have bred a sense of danger that lurks everywhere. \"I live with thoughts of being killed every day,\" says Tan. \"I'm not so much afraid of death as of violence; and my mother's warnings are fulfilled - people die, terrible things can happen.\" Tan lists the things that have happened to her: \"I have been in three hotel break-ins, held up at gunpoint, made to lie down on the floor in a meat-locker, beaten up in a bar by a drunk, had a gang of people come after me with knives. I think, is this forewarning, or is that superstitious neurosis? Then I think, thank God I'm a writer: you can play with notions of fear and mortality.\" She adds: \"It's made me very strong; I'm resilient, I have survivor skills. Some of that is superficial - what I present to people outwardly - but what makes people resilient is the ability to find humour and irony in situations that would otherwise overpower you.\" By the time the family left Switzerland when Tan was 17, she was in open revolt. The year before, her mother had hired a private detective to follow her and her German boyfriend (\"An army deserter who had escaped from a mental hospital\"), and hestumbled on her friends who were dealing in hashish (\"I was unaware - it's not as though I was sticking needles in myself\"). All of them, except the 16-year-old Amy, were deported. Once back in California, Tan infuriated her mother further by abandoning pre-med school to study English and linguistics (she jokes that she was expected to be a neurosurgeon by profession and a concert pianist as a hobby). But there were moments of reconciliation. Amy's husband-to-be, a friend of her cousin, made a good impression: \"My cousin turned up with 10 friends, expecting dinner. My mother was angry - in the kitchen throwing pots and pans around and growling. Lou quietly ate a lot, and she remembers he appreciated her cooking.\" Lou's Italian-American parents initially disapproved - \"because I was Chinese, they thought I'd be a liability to him as a lawyer\". But Tan's mother had \"given up the notion that I'd marry a Chinese boy; in high school there were none. All the Chinese boys I knew were relatives or close family friends.\" Tan faintly regrets that lack of opportunity to date Chinese men (\"It's very comfortable when somebody has a similar sense of history\"), yet feels her husband has blended in. \"So much of family revolves around food, and Lou eats more things Chinese than I do - I'm much more squeamish.\" After a spell as a speech therapist for children with disabilities, Tan was a successful corporate writer, writing everything from computer manuals to romantic horoscopes. Yet she spent much of the 80s as a self- confessed workaholic, putting in a joyless 90-hour week. \"I couldn't find the threshold that would tell me to stop, to say now you've succeeded, you're happy, you've gotten enough approval. Whatever people are looking for in work or life, I wasn't finding, so I was smoking and working round the clock. Lou complained that I had no life and was stinking up the house.\" So she took up jazz piano and creative writing. But Tan had to rediscover her Chinese ancestry before she could find her subject. The change had begun in Europe. \"In Switzerland, being Chinese was an asset; boys thought I was exotic. Looking back, the new spin was possibly no better than being looked at as undesirable, but I saw my opinion of myself could turn simply because of people's biases. It was a valuable lesson in self-esteem.\" At college, she took classes in spoken Chinese and Asian history. \"You go through a more activist period of being angry that your history books never had any positive role model of Asians, just had them working the railroads, and that wasn't my background. But it's necessary to find a balance, being comfortable and knowledgeable about your own culture, and not feeling guilty that you're not really Chinese. It's an evolution of ethnic identity, but it's a lifetime's process.\" Tan was in her teens before she learned that her mother had been married before,and had the three elder daughters in China. The subject erupted when her father was in hospital. \"I'd done something that angered my mother,\" says Tan. \"She was hitting me, saying, 'Why did I have you? I have other daughters who are good; they speak Chinese.' I felt very threatened - that I could be replaced.\" She wasn't to meet her half- sisters for 20 years. In 1986, while on holiday in Hawaii, Tanreceived the news that her mother had had a heart attack. She rushed home, vowing to get to know her mother better, but it was a false alarm: \"She'd gotten into a row with a fishmonger.\" Tan followed through her promise, however, visiting China for the first time with her mother and her husband. She felt more American there, \"in that stupid, traveller sense\", but also \"suddenly Chinese, the minute I touched China\" - \"As if the membrane separating the two halves of my life has finally been shed,\" as she wrote. \"I felt connected to that history and landscape, and to everything that formed my family and their past,\" she says. \"And my mother was extremely proud to feel needed to explain the world to me now, when all those years I'd had to translate for her. I found that she got into as many arguments with shopkeepers as she did in America - it had nothing to do with language; it was personality.\" Tan at last met her three half-sisters - \"My uncle, an important communist official, appeared with a woman. I shook hands stiffly and only later realised that she was my sister. I'd anticipated the big American embrace, but we talked later.\" She began to look differently at the inheritance that she shared with these half-sisters who displayed common \"emotional traits\" - \"hand gestures; sense of humour; small nuances of expression; their sense of outrage if someone tried to humiliate them; speechlessness, then sudden rage; being depressed by certain things\". Yet there were cultural differences. \"I have a sense of entitlement they don't have - being an American.\" In fact, though Tan's eldest half-sister, Yuhang Wang, a retired civil servant, is still in Shanghai, the other two have since migrated to the US. Tina runs a takeaway in Wisconsin, June is a software engineer in the Bay area. The reunited family spends Chinese new years together. While Tan was in China, The Joy Luck Club, still only in embryonic form, was sold to a New York publisher for $50,000. Paperback rights were later auctioned for $1.2 million. Though Tan is now proud of the film she co-produced in 1993 with Oliver Stone and also co-wrote (\"It's an emotional sibling to the book; it was never intended to be a twin, a filmic clone\"), she had been apprehensive beforehand. \"I've had criticisms from people who think I should be creating sociological models. One mandate placed on writers from different ethnic backgrounds is to create 'superior' characters who speak articulate English. But simply because my mother could not speak good English, did that make her inferior? If I can create a character who speaks the way my mother spoke to me, but who has valuable things to say, and it seduces the reader into rooting for her, then I've done more than anything else to forward a sense of humanity, in making people not judge others for superficial reasons.\" Her mother's storytelling about her life in China fuels Tan's fiction, most directly The Kitchen God's Wife. \"One of the things my mother said to me after she read The Joy Luck Club was, 'The past can be changed; if you tell the world, the pattern can be changed.' It's not as though I'm going to change the way women are treated, but I can change how my grandmother will be remembered - not simply as a tragic victim and a forgotten woman, but as a woman who left a legacy of strength.\" Tan remains fascinated by the history that affected her family - from the Boxer uprisings of the 19th century to the Japanese invasion and civil war of the 20th. Her paternal grandfather was educated by missionaries and the influence endured: her father became a Baptist minister in California. Tan's first novel came out the year the Tiananmen Square students' uprising was crushed. She found herself under great pressure to denounce China: \"My family was in Beijing; if I denounced the government, I was putting them at risk. I thought, does my spouting my mouth off improve things or simply assert my rights as an American to say what I feel? People took that as my standing on the fence, but if I'm concerned about human rights I have to think harder about what I do that results in positive change.\" Despite her success, Tan suffers bouts of depression. \"It could be genetic or being around a mother who was suicidal,\" she says. \"When I was a little girl, she talked about killing herself, and there were times when she'd make an attempt in front of us. Mostly, it wasn't a quiet depression - she'd be hysterical and shouting; she'd open the car door on the freeway and try to jump out; turn all the furniture upside down in the house in rage, and brandish a knife. It's easy to pass that on to a child. And my grandmother was obviously depressed; it runs in three generations.\" She now controls it with anti-depressants. \"I don't think of myself as weak, but I have this in my psychological make-up, chinks in the emotional armour.\" She once tried therapy (\"The therapist fell asleep\"), but prefers informal chats with therapist friends. \"Part of my problem is self-esteem and a difficulty trusting strangers. People think I'm so open, but there's a lot I keep within myself. It's good to keep secrets if you're a writer and gradually unveil them.\" The Hundred Secret Senses, perhaps Tan's funniest book, is the story of the Chinese-American Olivia and her Chinese elder half-sister, Kwan, who remembers past lives. Tan spoke of it as a \"coming out\" about her beliefs in \"yin people\" (ghosts) as a source of her fiction - an admission she knew would expose her to ridicule. \"My father and brother dying makes me think a lot about what goes on after life; the possibility that consciousness goes on,\" she says. Her mother would set a ouija board before her and ask not only about their dead relatives but about the stock market. \"I've always been ambivalent,\" says Tan. \"I was raised with a sense that I could communicate with ghosts, and it did seem to come from something other than myself. I can still find rational ways to explain these things - as repressed memory or the Jungian collective unconscious. But I've gotten so much help in my writing that it's hard to pass these off - it's like being ungrateful; denying the existence of a force greater than oneself. You could say it's ghosts or the supernatural, but those terms are tainted as flaky notions. To me, it's not about physical bodies before birth or after death; it's a continuous consciousness and a form of love. It's benevolent, not frightening.\" While the New York Times saw it as a battle between Tan's \"rational, western side\", and her \"dreamier, eastern side\", her beliefs owe more, perhaps, to Californian New Ageism than to any eastern mysticism. It was as Tan was finishing The Hundred Secret Senses that she learned that Faith Sale, her editor and friend, was ill. \"I realised I'd never lived alone until I went to New York to be with my editor. I went from living at home to living with a roommate to being with Lou. New York was a frightening experience.\" Then her mother's Alzheimer's was diagnosed, and Tan became, as does Ruth in the new novel, \"a mother to the child her mother had become\". Tan remembers inviting her mother for Christmas in New York. \"I worried the whole time: how would she remember her flight number? It's like sending a five-year-old child across the country.\" She was aware of changes in her mother, who \"lost her English and her Mandarin, and could only speak Shanghainese, her first language\". But dementia was also a \"truth serum\": \"My mother no longer had any buffers on her emotions. In some sense, she'd always remained about nine years old emotionally, because that's when her mother killed herself; she needed to be the centre of attention and to feel wanted.\" On Tan's half-sister's birthday, her mother declared that she should get all the presents. \"It sounds child-like, but it's also how she was before, though she didn't say it so openly. Instead of being distressed, we'd joke about the things in ourselves that would show up if we had the same condition; what little bits of truth would leak out if we didn't censor ourselves.\" She adds: \"I found that I knew so much more about my mother emotionally than I had thought. People often say that, with Alzheimer's, the person is is no longer the person you knew, that they become a shell of themselves. I didn't find that. My mother retained a rich and happy emotional life. She wanted to be loved and needed, and I could use my knowledge of her emotional needs to communicate with her; that was enormously gratifying to me. I realised it wasn't that my mother had to read my books or know that I'd accomplished things to make her proud of me. It's the thing I miss most about having a mother; there is no one else in the world who worries about you so much; who sees the dangers and will annoy the hell out of you telling you what they are.\" The Bonesetter's Daughter mirrors Tan's practical battle with her mother's disease. After buying houses and trying to offer live-in help, Tan and her husband moved Daisy into an assisted-care residence through subterfuge. \"We told her it cost $750 a month - her social security - and she thought it was a bargain. In all the places she's lived, she was the happiest there. She felt safe. When she was dying those last three weeks, we all moved in, 18 or 20 of us, playing card games and mahjong, eating takeout food, taking turns to stay overnight.\" The novel was reshaped when Tan learned her mother's true maiden name - Li Bingzi - on the day her mother died. \"I was stunned; I'd spent all these years writing about her life, but I didn't know what name she was born with.\" She found a metaphor in Peking Man, the bones of which were excavated, lost and never refound. \"It's so much like how we learn about our own parents, our ancestors and origins. We discover pieces and then lose them, and so much remains a mystery.\" There was an unexpected emotional resolution to a rift of long before. When Tan was 16, \"my mother was so frustrated - and I really did do things that would have driven any parent crazy - she snapped and held a cleaver to my throat. I was so numb and angry, for 20 minutes I acted as though I didn't care if she sliced my throat. She was absolutely crazy; you could see it in her eyes. She said, 'I'll kill you and Didi [my little brother] then myself, and we'll go where Daddy and Peter are, and you won't be ruining your life.' She never talked later about what happened. But two years after she had Alzheimer's, she said in Chinese, in a rare moment of lucidity: 'Amy, I think I'm losing my mind, I can't remember so many things. But I did something terrible to you when you were a child, I don't remember what. I'm sorry.' It was such a wonderful thing. For every child, no matter how good their childhood, there's something back there that you wished your parents had said sorry for; for me, it was for that.\" Tan, who has also written two children's books, decided with her husband not to have children. She speculates about an early miscarriage: \"In my mind it was a girl; she'd be 21 now, and would be giving us such grief, though we're convinced our children would have been beautiful.\" More seriously, she feared passing on instability - \"I've never learned to feed myself at regular intervals, and I've operated for so long on impulse\" - and neurosis: \"I'd worry obsessively and see danger in so much.\" Yet she has no regrets. \"We never felt a strong compulsion to duplicate our genetic structure; what's in me that I'd have wanted to pass on is already in the books.\" The Bonesetter's Daughter, by Amy Tan, is published on March 12 by Flamingo, priced \u00a316.99.

But homeopaths had already preached a less martial version of that same message several months earlier. In the autumn, long before Tony Blair warned of the tough winter ahead for the NHS, the British Homeopathic Association launched a public awareness campaign under the slogan Homeopathy, Not Hibernation. It suggested weak dilutions of aconite (a toxic flower), allium cepa (an onion), pulsatilla (a type of anemone), bryonia (a climbing plant) and gelsemium (yellow jasmine) as safe, effective remedies for colds and flu. At the same time, high-street homeopaths began advertising cut-price consultations and remedy kits.</p> <p>Whatever its scientific basis, it was an ingenious spin, and the perfect time to strike at the heart of orthodox medicine.

Everyone knows there is no cure for a virus, so why queue for hours at the local surgery only to be told to drink lots of fluids and rest? Instead, people self-medicated, not just with the traditional over-the-counter flu medicines, but also with echinacea (a herbal tonic), ginseng, gingko, zinc supplements, garlic, vitamin C and an arsenal of homeopathic pills.</p> <p>Though lacking the financial clout of a GlaxoSmithKline, say, the pro-homeopathy lobby is getting its message across. One in five people in Britain has visited a homeopath at one time or another, and sales of homeopathic remedies in pharmacies and health-food shops are increasing by 20% each year - boosted, no doubt, by their availability in fashionable Clikpak dispensers at branches of Holland &amp; Barrett and Boots. As awareness of the therapy grows, increasing numbers of patients are being referred to homeopaths by their GPs. At the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital (one of five such centres dotted around the country), referrals increased by 31% in a single year - and 70% of those were initiated by the patients themselves. In other words, people are demanding to be seen at a homeopathic hospital, rather than at a conventional one.</p> <p>If they live in Glasgow, it's easy to see why. The new Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, officially opened by Prince Charles last October, is the jewel in homeopathy's crown. With its softly sculpted furniture, hardwood floors, yucca plants, glass, light and air, it is a feng-shui shrine to healing that has the ambience of an ad agency or an airport VIP lounge, rather than a refuge for the seriously ill. In reception, copies of House Beautiful are scattered on a wicker table; in the common room, a pyramid-shaped scented candle burns in an alcove. Then there is the gym, with its exercise bikes and slatted wood blinds, and the landscaped garden with planting colour that strengthens from north to south. When complete, it will also feature a pool, a herb garden and works of art.</p> <p>In fact, the hospital is a work of art - designed by the architects Maclachlan Monaghan in response to a competition in 1995, and interior-designed by the artist Jane Kelly using subtle greys, greens and pinks to create an atmosphere of harmony. Wherever possible, the materials are natural and the lines organic rather than angular, right down to the door handles and bins. It's inspiring, especially for an NHS hospital. Though built with \u00a32m of private money raised from jam sales and charity galas since the 30s, the Glasgow unit joins four others - in Bristol, Liverpool, London and Tunbridge Wells - dispensing free homeopathy as directed by the health service in 1948. Though most are for outpatients, Glasgow has 15 in-patient beds, all with views of the grounds. Studies have shown that being near a window makes patients less prone to infection.</p> <p>As I tour the hospital with a doctor after the royal unveiling, I quickly learn that, despite its urbane ambience, Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital is doing far more than dispensing remedies to middle-class hypochondriacs on the way from the Pilates studio to the patchouli-scented reflexology suite. Forget colds, flu and minor skin eruptions. In the wards here, you will meet anorexics, asthmatics, stroke victims, cancer sufferers and people recovering from major surgery - patients in need of serious medical care rather than a quick chat about their bowels and a pellet or two of dogwort.</p> <p>The homeopaths, too, are far from lightweight. They are neurologists, rheumatologists, migraine specialists, psychiatrists, medically-qualified doctors with years of training and jumbled-up alphabets after their names. What they share is a passionate belief26 in a system of medicine most orthodox doctors deride, based on the absurd, Harry-Potterish notion that natural substances - such as camomile flowers, toadstools, calcium and gold - can somehow prompt the body to heal itself, even when diluted so many million times that not a single molecule remains. It is as if the water or alcohol used as a solvent \"remembers\" the original ingredient in some way. The theory is that like cures like, so that somebody suffering from palpitations, for example, will be given a small amount of a drug that, in healthy persons and in larger quantities, causes palpitations.</p> <p>Where homeopathy gets even weirder is that many of these natural substances are toxic. Belladonna (from the plant deadly nightshade) is often recommended as a first-aid remedy for children to combat colds, flu, sore throats and fever. In other words, winter ailments. Apis mel (from crushed bees) is used to treat inflammatory arthritis, urinary infections and hives. Arsenicum album (from arsenic, a favourite of serial poisoners) alleviates anxiety, asthma, heartburn, a stinging throat and diarrhoea - the very symptoms it causes. Like all the herbs, animal parts and minerals in the homeopath's bible, the Materia Medica, these ones have been systematically tested on humans - both healthy and sick - ever since the German physician Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann first published his seminal work, Law Of Similars, in 1796. By observing and recording patients' reactions, a process known as \"proving\", homeopaths have built up a considerable body of knowledge over the past 200 years.</p> <p>It has to be said, however, that the Materia Medica makes for an entertaining read. As well as listing physical reactions, it records effects on the mind. A patient who swallows a particular kind of fungus fancies he is a giant mushroom, for example, while other substances can trigger an irrational fear of anything from black dogs to a howling wind. The entry under arsenic metallicum reads: \"The patient is annoyed by visions which cause her to cry.\" People ingesting it also experience a \"sensation of fullness in the head, as if the head were too large\", as well as \"left-sided headache up to the eyes and into the ear, aggravated when stooping and when lying down\". If a patient referred to Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital displays any of these signs, he or she might well be prescribed arsenic metallicum.</p> <p>It may seem extraordinary, but qualified doctors believe this, too - and, far from dwelling in bourgeois suburbs or ivory towers, they are working at the gritty coalface of primary care. On the other side of Glasgow, a 20-minute train ride from the champagne and canap\u00e9s of the new hospital's royal opening, Dr Robert Jamieson dispenses homeopathy at Bridgeton Health Centre, in the heart of Glasgow G40, Scotland's poorest postal26 district, where men are twice as likely to die prematurely as other men in Scotland, and three and a half times more likely than an English male.</p> <p>According to Jamieson, a combination of smoking, unemployment, poor housing, grinding poverty and bad habits have given the district its high rate of chronic disease and mental morbidity - by which Jamieson means psychiatric illness. What does his Materia Medica say about treating paranoid, homeless alcoholics?</p> <p>In fact, it's not such an impertinent question. Before flying to Glasgow, I spoke to Dr Anne Pettigrew, a GP in Greenock, at the mouth of the Clyde, about Andy, a 52-year-old down-and-out whom she treated for depression, paranoid delusions and alcoholism. He refused to take conventional drugs, which made him feel \"dulled and not myself\", so was given anacardium (from an oriental nut). After a few weeks, he had found himself a flat and learned to play the guitar, though he has since relapsed and taken to the bottle. Jim, 26, a young offender with insomnia, paranoia and a history of lashing out, was given stramonium, from the thorn apple. After the first dose, he slept solidly for 12 hours and is showing signs of becoming more settled.</p> <p>\"What homeopathy can't treat,\" says Jamieson, \"is structural, social problems such as unemployment, housing and poor education. Apart from those, I'll try anything.\" One of his most surprising cases was a woman in her mid-30s with a crippling fear of breast cancer. Though there was no history of the illness in her family, the terror of dying from it dominated her life for years. \"At least once a month,\" says Jamieson, \"she would come here to have her breasts checked - in addition to the many hours she spent looking for lumps herself. She would ask her husband to examine her breasts, and even female colleagues at work.\"</p> <p>Though homeopaths are renowned for their detailed consultations - which can last 50 minutes and cover everything from stool colour and discharges to childhood illnesses, sleep habits and sexual desire - Jamieson says he spent no longer with this patient than he does in a standard NHS consultation: five minutes. Listening, observing and remembering his Materia Medica, he prescribed the hallucinogenic toadstool agaricus. After a few days, the patient said she felt \"more carefree\" and realised she was \"being silly\" about her fear of cancer. According to Jamieson, \"She came to see me earlier today and reported a tremendous improvement in her quality of life. She has stopped worrying about her breasts in an incapacitating way. Her family and friends say she is more relaxed. She is sleeping better and has her sense of humour back.\"</p> <p>When I ask what suggested agaricus to him, Jamieson shows me a copy of a modernised, American version of the 19th-century Materia Medica by the eminent homeopath Roger Morrison. Under the heading \"Agaricus\", and the subheading \"Mentals\", it reads: \"Extreme fear of cancer. Anxiety about health; insignificant health problems are exaggerated, causing great fear and despair. Poetic at night. Dependency and frequent calls to the physician.\" Out of curiosity, I look up stramonium - the remedy used by Dr Pettigrew to treat Jim, the aggressive, paranoid depressive. \"Rapid changes from joy to sadness,\" the entry reads. \"Violent and lewd. Delusions about identity. Religious mania.\"</p> <p>The \"picture\" I am getting, to use a homeopathic term, is that homeopathy seems to work with a particular category of patient: those described in the past as \"somatisers\" - that is, people who won't accept that their physical symptoms are part of a broader mental disturbance. Visiting the doctor time and time again, they are investigated with x-rays, ultrasound scans and clinical tests that can find no pathological reason for their illness. They end up visiting a homeopath, which is why they are sometimes referred to as TEETH patients - Tried Everything Else, Try Homeopathy. Often, they get better, but sceptics say this is due to the placebo effect (where patients improve, even when prescribed a dummy pill) or the attention lavished by homeopaths, with their hour-long, touchy-feely consultations.</p> <p>Though supporters of homeopathy point to 200 clinical trials that have demonstrated its effectiveness - notably as a treatment for nasal allergies, as reported in the British Medical Journal last August - most doctors remain sceptical about its ability to treat physical illness in a way that is measurable in the laboratory. Delusions, phobias and inexplicable toothache are one thing, but what about cancer, arthritis, brain damage, infant colic and heart disease? How can an infinitesimal dilution of agaricus, or anacardium, or arsenic, treat serious medical conditions such as those?</p> <p>\"In fact, there are many cases of physical pathology being changed by a homeopathic remedy,\" claims Dr Bob Leckridge, one of the most respected homeopaths in Britain. \"With things like inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis, homeopathy has an effect which can be demonstrated by laboratory tests.\" Like all the doctors I spoke to, Leckridge is no cranky academic divorced from the realities of primary care. He worked as a GP for 15 years before becoming a clinician at Glasgow's old homeopathic hospital - the grand, slate-grey Victorian predecessor of Maclachlan Monaghan's hi-tech temple of healing. Now, he works full-time at the new building, as well as being president of the Faculty of Homeopathy, the discipline's academic and research body based in central London.</p> <p>One of Leckridge's former jobs was to run a clinic at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow's equivalent of Great Ormond Street. \"There was one little girl,\" he recalls, \"who was five when I saw her. She'd been perfectly healthy at birth, but at 15 months she suffered from meningococcal meningitis with septicaemia. It was a devastating illness for her. She lost all the toes and fingers on the right side of her body to gangrene, suffered extensive brain damage, which left her blind, and spent a year in hospital. From that time, she needed a lot of care.\"</p> <p>Two particular problems were making life utterly miserable for the girl and her mother. First, she whined and cried constantly, demanding to be rocked and held all night; second, her bowels had ceased to function without the use of laxatives. Though surgery, sedatives, physiotherapy and daily suppositories had made her life bearable, her mother was exhausted. After three years, the paediatricians finally referred her to Leckridge.</p> <p>\"It was obvious to me,\" he says, \"that she needed the remedy chamomilla. Mum was constantly walking her around the room, holding her and rocking her. If she stopped, the girl would start crying pitifully again - and those are all striking symptoms for chamomilla. Within a day or two, her bowels started moving naturally for the first time since she'd had meningitis.\" A few weeks later, Leckridge received a letter from the girl's paediatrician, saying she was sleeping properly, was less irritable and had stopped crying. \"Two years on,\" he says, \"she is smiling, singing and giggling, and the physiotherapists and other professionals are able to interact with her. They want to know exactly what I've given her.\"</p> <p>What I want to know is precisely how the remedy worked. Even if we ignore the slightly troubling fact that there is no chamomilla in the chamomilla, how can an essence of a plant reverse the real, concrete effects of brain damage? Leckridge would be the first to admit that there has been no physical change in his patient's brain, yet her bowel function has returned to normal as if the damaged neural network has somehow been repaired. Then again, maybe the little girl's bowel problem was the result of her irritability and low spirits, rather than the other way around - that is, what Leckridge was treating was an emotional disturbance rather than an organic one.</p> <p>\"To me,\" he says, \"whether a disease is organic, or functional, or psychiatric, or physical doesn't matter. Chamomilla is used to treat infant colic, so it is associated with bowel disease - but that's not the point.\" What he was doing at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, he says, was treating \"the inner wound, the inner lesion, the inner heart\" - in other words, whatever trauma makes a child behave in a certain way. One girl with microcephaly - a brain disorder - constantly bit herself until treated homeopathically. She became calmer and stopped her aggressive, animal-like gnawing. Another child, with a chromosomal abnormality called Williams Syndrome, was acutely sensitive to noise. She couldn't bear the sound of a vacuum cleaner, which made her run around the house screaming with her hands covering her ears. After taking chamomilla (suggested in the Materia Medica as a treatment for \"fear of the wind\"), she is unfazed by Hoovers and even by thunderstorms.</p> <p>Perhaps the most remarkable of Leckridge's cases is a 10-year-old girl diagnosed with a \"depressive disorder\" because she refused to walk, eat or drink. Over a nine-month period, she had developed what seemed like a chronic fatigue syndrome, with debilitating tiredness and pains in her stomach and legs. Repeated investigation found nothing wrong with her, so she was admitted to a psychiatric unit. \"When she came to see me,\" says Leckridge, \"she was in a wheelchair and had a tube up her nose to give her sustenance, but she hadn't drunk a drop of water in four months. She wasn't going to live very long.\"</p> <p>Listening to the girl's mother, Leckridge learned that three things had happened around Easter of the previous year. First, the girl had fallen from a tree and been concussed. Second, her grandmother had suffered a stroke in her presence and she'd phoned for an ambulance because there was no one else at home. (She was nine at the time.) Finally, her cat had died. \"All three could have been traumatic,\" says Leckridge, \"but there was something about the way the girl behaved in the room, and in how the story was told, that suggested to me the remedy arnica. It's for people who don't like to admit they're sick. They don't want to reveal that, because the real horror for them is not being healthy.\"</p> <p>A day or two after taking the remedy, the girl ripped the tube from her nose and drank a litre of fluid. After a month of taking soft food and soup and drinking normally, she walked into the children's clinic - out of her wheelchair - and was discharged from the psychiatric unit.</p> <p>All this sets me thinking about the potential of homeopathy as a psychiatric tool. If a single dose of arnica can stabilise a 10-year-old traumatised by her cat dying (or even, if we see it that way, a child with a stubborn temperament), why not a teenager damaged by divorce, or a truant, or an arsonist, or a delinquent who disagrees with everything his parents say? Instead of the Short Sharp Shock, what about the Long Blunt Shock? If homeopathy can calm a girl with brain damage, can it be used to change her personality?</p> <p>\"I don't think it can,\" says Leckridge, \"but it changes the way she copes with the world, her strategies for survival. Why does a child behave aggressively, or in an attention-seeking manner? I saw a boy of 14 with attention deficit disorder, and he had been born six weeks prematurely and kept on a ventilator for weeks. If that's the way you enter life, you live with a deep unconscious knowledge that you could die at any moment. You can respond to that in two ways. You can be scared and frightened of many things, or you can react with aggression and impulsiveness, things that cause chaos around you - because those behaviours say, 'I exist, I matter, I make things happen', which is the opposite of your initial experience of life. If a remedy can deal with that primary experience, the child doesn't have to use those behaviour patterns any more.\"</p> <p>Aggression, arson, truancy, aggressive attention deficit disorder... We have come a long way from Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital with its feng-shui gardens, aromatherapy candles and blond wood furniture - and even further from the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, a stately Victorian building on Great Ormond Street, overlooking the leafy haven of Queen Square.</p> <p>Unlike its Scottish counterpart, it has been here for 150 years, recalling an era when homeopathy wasn't just the preserve of new age hippies, but a second string to the allopathic bow. Here, I am shown an operating theatre where post-operative patients were healed homeopathically up until the 60s. Its wards were once full, but all it offers now is an outpatients' clinic, a homeopathic pharmacy and a handful of treatment rooms. All kinds of complementary therapies are available here, and itsenzyme potentiated desensitisation clinic - the homeopathic equivalent of immunisation - has had marked success in treating asthma, food allergies, allergic rhinitis, irritable bowel syndrome, migraine and inflammatory arthritis.</p> <p>Compared with Glasgow, though, it is a poky, underfunded backwater. Why does homeopathy seem so much more dynamic north of the border? \"There is a kind of axis with the academic and research work being done in the south and the hands-on, practical stuff in Scotland,\" says Dr Kim Jobst, a former NHS homeopath at the Glasgow hospital who now treats patients privately. Bridgeton Health Centre's Dr Jamieson disagrees: \"The first bit isn't true,\" he says, \"because there's plenty of good research being done in Scotland, too. I agree with the second part, though. Around 25% of GPs in Scotland have had a year's postgraduate training in homeopathy. It's just a personal interest, but it's also a cultural thing. The Scots are practitioners, the Scots are pragmatic, the Scots give value for money to all - and we don't really care what other people think.\"</p> <p><b> Spring is on the way, but those cold and flu viruses are still out there. And there is now a whole host of homeopathic alternatives to traditional bug-battling remedies:</b></p> <p><b>Aconite</b> From the toxic flower wolfsbane - best prescribed early on, especially when a cold starts suddenly. Take four remedies of 6C strength, one hour apart.</p> <p><b> Allium cepa </b> Onion - suitable for colds where the eyes and nose are streaming, especially if the nose is sensitive or itchy. Take one dose of 6C strength every four hours. Continue for 24-48 hours.</p> <p><b> Belladonna</b> The deadly nightshade plant - often prescribed for children with flu, especially if they have a sore throat and fever. Take a single dose of 6C strength.</p> <p><b> Bryonia </b> Wild hops - for dry, irritating coughs, especially in children - ideally taken in linctus form (rather than pills). Take one spoonful every four hours.</p> <p><b> Gelsemium </b> Yellow jasmine - for shivery, heavy sensations of the body, combined with fatigue and headache. Doses as for Allium cepa.</p> <p><b> Ipecacuanha</b> The root of the South American shrub ipecac - suitable for fits and spasms of coughing. Take one dose every four hours until symptoms subside.</p> <p><b> Pulsatilla</b> From the wind flower, a type of wood anemone - best for catarrhal colds, where the nose is blocked at night and flowing in the morning, with thick green or yellow mucus. Take one remedy of 6C strength every four hours.</p> <p><b> Stannum metallicum</b> Tin - for loose, rattly coughs. Doses as for pulsatilla.</p> <p><b> Remedies used to treat psychiatric and emotional disorders:</b></p> <p><b>Agaricus</b> The bug agaric remedy used by Dr Robert Jamieson, a Glasgow GP, to treat a woman with a terror of breast cancer.</p> <p><b> Anacardium </b> From an oriental nut - used by Dr Anne Pettigrew, a Greenock GP, to treat a down-and-out with depression, paranoid delusions and alcohol addiction.</p> <p><b> Arnica </b> The mountain flower, leopard's-bane, is usually prescribed for bumps and bruises - but paediatrician Dr Bob Leckridge used it to treat a 10-year-old girl with a severe depressive disorder, who refused to walk, eat or drink. 'It's specifically for people who don't like to admit they're sick,' says Leckridge. The girl recovered.</p> <p><b> Chamomilla</b> The camomile flower is usually given to infants with teething pain and colic. Leckridge used it to treat a five-year-old girl with severe brain damage caused by meningitis, whose bowels wouldn't function. He also prescribed it to a girl with Williams Syndrome who had an acute sensitivity to noise. In the 19th century work Materia Medica, it is recommended for people with a 'fear of the wind'.</p> <p><b> Stramonium </b> Thorn apple - used by Dr Pettigrew to treat a man with insomnia, violent mood swings, anxiety attacks and paranoia.</p> <p>\u0095 Homeopathic remedies, like most conventional medication, should be taken only after consultation with a qualified practitioner.

What they share is a passionate belief26 in a system of medicine most orthodox doctors deride, based on the absurd, Harry-Potterish notion that natural substances - such as camomile flowers, toadstools, calcium and gold - can somehow prompt the body to heal itself, even when diluted so many million times that not a single molecule remains. It is as if the water or alcohol used as a solvent \"remembers\" the original ingredient in some way. The theory is that like cures like, so that somebody suffering from palpitations, for example, will be given a small amount of a drug that, in healthy persons and in larger quantities, causes palpitations. Where homeopathy gets even weirder is that many of these natural substances are toxic. Belladonna (from the plant deadly nightshade) is often recommended as a first-aid remedy for children to combat colds, flu, sore throats and fever. In other words, winter ailments. Apis mel (from crushed bees) is used to treat inflammatory arthritis, urinary infections and hives. Arsenicum album (from arsenic, a favourite of serial poisoners) alleviates anxiety, asthma, heartburn, a stinging throat and diarrhoea - the very symptoms it causes. Like all the herbs, animal parts and minerals in the homeopath's bible, the Materia Medica, these ones have been systematically tested on humans - both healthy and sick - ever since the German physician Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann first published his seminal work, Law Of Similars, in 1796. By observing and recording patients' reactions, a process known as \"proving\", homeopaths have built up a considerable body of knowledge over the past 200 years. It has to be said, however, that the Materia Medica makes for an entertaining read. As well as listing physical reactions, it records effects on the mind. A patient who swallows a particular kind of fungus fancies he is a giant mushroom, for example, while other substances can trigger an irrational fear of anything from black dogs to a howling wind. The entry under arsenic metallicum reads: \"The patient is annoyed by visions which cause her to cry.\" People ingesting it also experience a \"sensation of fullness in the head, as if the head were too large\", as well as \"left-sided headache up to the eyes and into the ear, aggravated when stooping and when lying down\". If a patient referred to Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital displays any of these signs, he or she might well be prescribed arsenic metallicum. It may seem extraordinary, but qualified doctors believe this, too - and, far from dwelling in bourgeois suburbs or ivory towers, they are working at the gritty coalface of primary care. On the other side of Glasgow, a 20-minute train ride from the champagne and canap\u00e9s of the new hospital's royal opening, Dr Robert Jamieson dispenses homeopathy at Bridgeton Health Centre, in the heart of Glasgow G40, Scotland's poorest postal26 district, where men are twice as likely to die prematurely as other men in Scotland, and three and a half times more likely than an English male. According to Jamieson, a combination of smoking, unemployment, poor housing, grinding poverty and bad habits have given the district its high rate of chronic disease and mental morbidity - by which Jamieson means psychiatric illness. What does his Materia Medica say about treating paranoid, homeless alcoholics? In fact, it's not such an impertinent question. Before flying to Glasgow, I spoke to Dr Anne Pettigrew, a GP in Greenock, at the mouth of the Clyde, about Andy, a 52-year-old down-and-out whom she treated for depression, paranoid delusions and alcoholism. He refused to take conventional drugs, which made him feel \"dulled and not myself\", so was given anacardium (from an oriental nut). After a few weeks, he had found himself a flat and learned to play the guitar, though he has since relapsed and taken to the bottle. Jim, 26, a young offender with insomnia, paranoia and a history of lashing out, was given stramonium, from the thorn apple. After the first dose, he slept solidly for 12 hours and is showing signs of becoming more settled. \"What homeopathy can't treat,\" says Jamieson, \"is structural, social problems such as unemployment, housing and poor education. Apart from those, I'll try anything.\" One of his most surprising cases was a woman in her mid-30s with a crippling fear of breast cancer. Though there was no history of the illness in her family, the terror of dying from it dominated her life for years. \"At least once a month,\" says Jamieson, \"she would come here to have her breasts checked - in addition to the many hours she spent looking for lumps herself. She would ask her husband to examine her breasts, and even female colleagues at work.\" Though homeopaths are renowned for their detailed consultations - which can last 50 minutes and cover everything from stool colour and discharges to childhood illnesses, sleep habits and sexual desire - Jamieson says he spent no longer with this patient than he does in a standard NHS consultation: five minutes. Listening, observing and remembering his Materia Medica, he prescribed the hallucinogenic toadstool agaricus. After a few days, the patient said she felt \"more carefree\" and realised she was \"being silly\" about her fear of cancer. According to Jamieson, \"She came to see me earlier today and reported a tremendous improvement in her quality of life. She has stopped worrying about her breasts in an incapacitating way. Her family and friends say she is more relaxed. She is sleeping better and has her sense of humour back.\" When I ask what suggested agaricus to him, Jamieson shows me a copy of a modernised, American version of the 19th-century Materia Medica by the eminent homeopath Roger Morrison. Under the heading \"Agaricus\", and the subheading \"Mentals\", it reads: \"Extreme fear of cancer. Anxiety about health; insignificant health problems are exaggerated, causing great fear and despair. Poetic at night. Dependency and frequent calls to the physician.\" Out of curiosity, I look up stramonium - the remedy used by Dr Pettigrew to treat Jim, the aggressive, paranoid depressive. \"Rapid changes from joy to sadness,\" the entry reads. \"Violent and lewd. Delusions about identity. Religious mania.\" The \"picture\" I am getting, to use a homeopathic term, is that homeopathy seems to work with a particular category of patient: those described in the past as \"somatisers\" - that is, people who won't accept that their physical symptoms are part of a broader mental disturbance. Visiting the doctor time and time again, they are investigated with x-rays, ultrasound scans and clinical tests that can find no pathological reason for their illness. They end up visiting a homeopath, which is why they are sometimes referred to as TEETH patients - Tried Everything Else, Try Homeopathy. Often, they get better, but sceptics say this is due to the placebo effect (where patients improve, even when prescribed a dummy pill) or the attention lavished by homeopaths, with their hour-long, touchy-feely consultations. Though supporters of homeopathy point to 200 clinical trials that have demonstrated its effectiveness - notably as a treatment for nasal allergies, as reported in the British Medical Journal last August - most doctors remain sceptical about its ability to treat physical illness in a way that is measurable in the laboratory. Delusions, phobias and inexplicable toothache are one thing, but what about cancer, arthritis, brain damage, infant colic and heart disease? How can an infinitesimal dilution of agaricus, or anacardium, or arsenic, treat serious medical conditions such as those? \"In fact, there are many cases of physical pathology being changed by a homeopathic remedy,\" claims Dr Bob Leckridge, one of the most respected homeopaths in Britain. \"With things like inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis, homeopathy has an effect which can be demonstrated by laboratory tests.\" Like all the doctors I spoke to, Leckridge is no cranky academic divorced from the realities of primary care. He worked as a GP for 15 years before becoming a clinician at Glasgow's old homeopathic hospital - the grand, slate-grey Victorian predecessor of Maclachlan Monaghan's hi-tech temple of healing. Now, he works full-time at the new building, as well as being president of the Faculty of Homeopathy, the discipline's academic and research body based in central London. One of Leckridge's former jobs was to run a clinic at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow's equivalent of Great Ormond Street. \"There was one little girl,\" he recalls, \"who was five when I saw her. She'd been perfectly healthy at birth, but at 15 months she suffered from meningococcal meningitis with septicaemia. It was a devastating illness for her. She lost all the toes and fingers on the right side of her body to gangrene, suffered extensive brain damage, which left her blind, and spent a year in hospital. From that time, she needed a lot of care.\" Two particular problems were making life utterly miserable for the girl and her mother. First, she whined and cried constantly, demanding to be rocked and held all night; second, her bowels had ceased to function without the use of laxatives. Though surgery, sedatives, physiotherapy and daily suppositories had made her life bearable, her mother was exhausted. After three years, the paediatricians finally referred her to Leckridge. \"It was obvious to me,\" he says, \"that she needed the remedy chamomilla. Mum was constantly walking her around the room, holding her and rocking her. If she stopped, the girl would start crying pitifully again - and those are all striking symptoms for chamomilla. Within a day or two, her bowels started moving naturally for the first time since she'd had meningitis.\" A few weeks later, Leckridge received a letter from the girl's paediatrician, saying she was sleeping properly, was less irritable and had stopped crying. \"Two years on,\" he says, \"she is smiling, singing and giggling, and the physiotherapists and other professionals are able to interact with her. They want to know exactly what I've given her.\" What I want to know is precisely how the remedy worked. Even if we ignore the slightly troubling fact that there is no chamomilla in the chamomilla, how can an essence of a plant reverse the real, concrete effects of brain damage? Leckridge would be the first to admit that there has been no physical change in his patient's brain, yet her bowel function has returned to normal as if the damaged neural network has somehow been repaired. Then again, maybe the little girl's bowel problem was the result of her irritability and low spirits, rather than the other way around - that is, what Leckridge was treating was an emotional disturbance rather than an organic one. \"To me,\" he says, \"whether a disease is organic, or functional, or psychiatric, or physical doesn't matter. Chamomilla is used to treat infant colic, so it is associated with bowel disease - but that's not the point.\" What he was doing at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, he says, was treating \"the inner wound, the inner lesion, the inner heart\" - in other words, whatever trauma makes a child behave in a certain way. One girl with microcephaly - a brain disorder - constantly bit herself until treated homeopathically. She became calmer and stopped her aggressive, animal-like gnawing. Another child, with a chromosomal abnormality called Williams Syndrome, was acutely sensitive to noise. She couldn't bear the sound of a vacuum cleaner, which made her run around the house screaming with her hands covering her ears. After taking chamomilla (suggested in the Materia Medica as a treatment for \"fear of the wind\"), she is unfazed by Hoovers and even by thunderstorms. Perhaps the most remarkable of Leckridge's cases is a 10-year-old girl diagnosed with a \"depressive disorder\" because she refused to walk, eat or drink. Over a nine-month period, she had developed what seemed like a chronic fatigue syndrome, with debilitating tiredness and pains in her stomach and legs. Repeated investigation found nothing wrong with her, so she was admitted to a psychiatric unit. \"When she came to see me,\" says Leckridge, \"she was in a wheelchair and had a tube up her nose to give her sustenance, but she hadn't drunk a drop of water in four months. She wasn't going to live very long.\" Listening to the girl's mother, Leckridge learned that three things had happened around Easter of the previous year. First, the girl had fallen from a tree and been concussed. Second, her grandmother had suffered a stroke in her presence and she'd phoned for an ambulance because there was no one else at home. (She was nine at the time.) Finally, her cat had died. \"All three could have been traumatic,\" says Leckridge, \"but there was something about the way the girl behaved in the room, and in how the story was told, that suggested to me the remedy arnica. It's for people who don't like to admit they're sick. They don't want to reveal that, because the real horror for them is not being healthy.\" A day or two after taking the remedy, the girl ripped the tube from her nose and drank a litre of fluid. After a month of taking soft food and soup and drinking normally, she walked into the children's clinic - out of her wheelchair - and was discharged from the psychiatric unit. All this sets me thinking about the potential of homeopathy as a psychiatric tool. If a single dose of arnica can stabilise a 10-year-old traumatised by her cat dying (or even, if we see it that way, a child with a stubborn temperament), why not a teenager damaged by divorce, or a truant, or an arsonist, or a delinquent who disagrees with everything his parents say? Instead of the Short Sharp Shock, what about the Long Blunt Shock? If homeopathy can calm a girl with brain damage, can it be used to change her personality? \"I don't think it can,\" says Leckridge, \"but it changes the way she copes with the world, her strategies for survival. Why does a child behave aggressively, or in an attention-seeking manner? I saw a boy of 14 with attention deficit disorder, and he had been born six weeks prematurely and kept on a ventilator for weeks. If that's the way you enter life, you live with a deep unconscious knowledge that you could die at any moment. You can respond to that in two ways. You can be scared and frightened of many things, or you can react with aggression and impulsiveness, things that cause chaos around you - because those behaviours say, 'I exist, I matter, I make things happen', which is the opposite of your initial experience of life. If a remedy can deal with that primary experience, the child doesn't have to use those behaviour patterns any more.\" Aggression, arson, truancy, aggressive attention deficit disorder... We have come a long way from Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital with its feng-shui gardens, aromatherapy candles and blond wood furniture - and even further from the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, a stately Victorian building on Great Ormond Street, overlooking the leafy haven of Queen Square. Unlike its Scottish counterpart, it has been here for 150 years, recalling an era when homeopathy wasn't just the preserve of new age hippies, but a second string to the allopathic bow. Here, I am shown an operating theatre where post-operative patients were healed homeopathically up until the 60s. Its wards were once full, but all it offers now is an outpatients' clinic, a homeopathic pharmacy and a handful of treatment rooms. All kinds of complementary therapies are available here, and itsenzyme potentiated desensitisation clinic - the homeopathic equivalent of immunisation - has had marked success in treating asthma, food allergies, allergic rhinitis, irritable bowel syndrome, migraine and inflammatory arthritis. Compared with Glasgow, though, it is a poky, underfunded backwater. Why does homeopathy seem so much more dynamic north of the border? \"There is a kind of axis with the academic and research work being done in the south and the hands-on, practical stuff in Scotland,\" says Dr Kim Jobst, a former NHS homeopath at the Glasgow hospital who now treats patients privately. Bridgeton Health Centre's Dr Jamieson disagrees: \"The first bit isn't true,\" he says, \"because there's plenty of good research being done in Scotland, too. I agree with the second part, though. Around 25% of GPs in Scotland have had a year's postgraduate training in homeopathy. It's just a personal interest, but it's also a cultural thing. The Scots are practitioners, the Scots are pragmatic, the Scots give value for money to all - and we don't really care what other people think.\" Spring is on the way, but those cold and flu viruses are still out there. And there is now a whole host of homeopathic alternatives to traditional bug-battling remedies: Aconite From the toxic flower wolfsbane - best prescribed early on, especially when a cold starts suddenly. Take four remedies of 6C strength, one hour apart. Allium cepa Onion - suitable for colds where the eyes and nose are streaming, especially if the nose is sensitive or itchy. Take one dose of 6C strength every four hours. Continue for 24-48 hours. Belladonna The deadly nightshade plant - often prescribed for children with flu, especially if they have a sore throat and fever. Take a single dose of 6C strength. Bryonia Wild hops - for dry, irritating coughs, especially in children - ideally taken in linctus form (rather than pills). Take one spoonful every four hours. Gelsemium Yellow jasmine - for shivery, heavy sensations of the body, combined with fatigue and headache. Doses as for Allium cepa. Ipecacuanha The root of the South American shrub ipecac - suitable for fits and spasms of coughing. Take one dose every four hours until symptoms subside. Pulsatilla From the wind flower, a type of wood anemone - best for catarrhal colds, where the nose is blocked at night and flowing in the morning, with thick green or yellow mucus. Take one remedy of 6C strength every four hours. Stannum metallicum Tin - for loose, rattly coughs. Doses as for pulsatilla. Remedies used to treat psychiatric and emotional disorders: Agaricus The bug agaric remedy used by Dr Robert Jamieson, a Glasgow GP, to treat a woman with a terror of breast cancer. Anacardium From an oriental nut - used by Dr Anne Pettigrew, a Greenock GP, to treat a down-and-out with depression, paranoid delusions and alcohol addiction. Arnica The mountain flower, leopard's-bane, is usually prescribed for bumps and bruises - but paediatrician Dr Bob Leckridge used it to treat a 10-year-old girl with a severe depressive disorder, who refused to walk, eat or drink. 'It's specifically for people who don't like to admit they're sick,' says Leckridge. The girl recovered. Chamomilla The camomile flower is usually given to infants with teething pain and colic. Leckridge used it to treat a five-year-old girl with severe brain damage caused by meningitis, whose bowels wouldn't function. He also prescribed it to a girl with Williams Syndrome who had an acute sensitivity to noise. In the 19th century work Materia Medica, it is recommended for people with a 'fear of the wind'. Stramonium Thorn apple - used by Dr Pettigrew to treat a man with insomnia, violent mood swings, anxiety attacks and paranoia. \u0095 Homeopathic remedies, like most conventional medication, should be taken only after consultation with a qualified practitioner. If symptoms persist, consult your GP or homeopath.",

      "body": "<p>The world's first online fraud museum, offering the latest artefacts of hi-tech criminal culture, has been launched by a group of US internet security experts, to the alarm of police and banking organisations. </p> <p>For a signing-on fee of $99 (\u00a369), the guide, described by one visitor as eye-popping, explains in painstaking detail how credit card numbers can be stolen over the internet or by telephone and then used to order products online. </p> <p>Alongside examples of real e-mail scams used to fool trusting web users into parting with their gold card numbers, bank account details and internet passwords, the Ad Cops exhibit includes an insider's explanation of what the combinations on different card types mean, and how to establish the credit limits and validity of the cards once the numbers have been obtained. </p> <p>The information is detailed, right down to the ideal modem speed for masquerading as a trader to pilfer credit information. </p> <p>Daniel Clements, president of Ad Cops, insisted that the museum was a legitimate resource, which was designed to keep online retailers and banks up to speed on the latest scams. </p> <p>\"Adcops' primary focus is to restore, regain, or establish profitability for the merchant. He is the one paying the bill for all net fraud.\" </p> <p>The registration fee would act as sufficient deterrent against the would-be fraudster looking for a few lessons, he added. But British police and internet security experts yesterday criticised the site as irresponsible. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the national criminal intelligence service said: \"More and more criminals are moving into counterfeit credit cards because they believe it is easy to make large amounts of money. Any information which highlights the ease of this crime could encourage people to get involved.\" </p> <p>Matthew Whitaker, of the Credit Card Research Group, which is funded by the major UK card issuers, said: \"This information certainly seems dangerous. </p> <p>\"Consumers are protected from fraud but this is still thieving and people have to pay for it further down the line in the form of higher card rates or charges.\" </p> <p>Internet card fraud remains less of a problem in Britain than in the US, where the boom in online shopping has provided a fertile ground for criminals. </p> <p>But even in this country, electronic fraud is on the rise; as a proportion of online retail transactions, it is more prevalent than conventional fraud is on the high street, according to industry figures. </p> <p>Visa, for example, says that 47% of all complaints and disputes it receives over payment across the EU are internet-related - a statistic made more startling by the fact that only 1% of its European transactions are online.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The world's first online fraud museum, offering the latest artefacts of hi-tech criminal culture, has been launched by a group of US internet security experts, to the alarm of police and banking organisations. For a signing-on fee of $99 (\u00a369), the guide, described by one visitor as eye-popping, explains in painstaking detail how credit card numbers can be stolen over the internet or by telephone and then used to order products online. Alongside examples of real e-mail scams used to fool trusting web users into parting with their gold card numbers, bank account details and internet passwords, the Ad Cops exhibit includes an insider's explanation of what the combinations on different card types mean, and how to establish the credit limits and validity of the cards once the numbers have been obtained. The information is detailed, right down to the ideal modem speed for masquerading as a trader to pilfer credit information. Daniel Clements, president of Ad Cops, insisted that the museum was a legitimate resource, which was designed to keep online retailers and banks up to speed on the latest scams. \"Adcops' primary focus is to restore, regain, or establish profitability for the merchant. He is the one paying the bill for all net fraud.\" The registration fee would act as sufficient deterrent against the would-be fraudster looking for a few lessons, he added. But British police and internet security experts yesterday criticised the site as irresponsible. A spokeswoman for the national criminal intelligence service said: \"More and more criminals are moving into counterfeit credit cards because they believe it is easy to make large amounts of money. Any information which highlights the ease of this crime could encourage people to get involved.\" Matthew Whitaker, of the Credit Card Research Group, which is funded by the major UK card issuers, said: \"This information certainly seems dangerous. \"Consumers are protected from fraud but this is still thieving and people have to pay for it further down the line in the form of higher card rates or charges.\" Internet card fraud remains less of a problem in Britain than in the US, where the boom in online shopping has provided a fertile ground for criminals. But even in this country, electronic fraud is on the rise; as a proportion of online retail transactions, it is more prevalent than conventional fraud is on the high street, according to industry figures. Visa, for example, says that 47% of all complaints and disputes it receives over payment across the EU are internet-related - a statistic made more startling by the fact that only 1% of its European transactions are online.",

      "bodyText": "The government has unveiled plans to pump millions of pounds into scientific research in the north-west of England yesterday in an attempt to stave off criticism that it was contributing to a north-south technological divide. Less than 12 months after the government caused fury among heartland backbench Labour MPs when it announced it would move a synchrotron science project to Oxfordshire rather than the north-west, there was finally some good news for Daresbury laboratory when the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, announced \u00a3150m of funding for the creation of a north-west science council and two new projects at Daresbury in Cheshire. The announcement may go some way to mollifying Labour backbenchers who were furious over the government's lack of attention to a northern scientific base demanding investment. Two projects will be set up including a fourth generation light source for accelerator physics and a proton cyclotron, which has potential medical, scientific and industrial benefits. A \u00a324m biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility will also be set up with \u00a33m from the government and funding from Europe and the regional development agency. A public/private partnership was also established to act as a bridge between Daresbury and industry to exploit its scientific expertise for the benefit of the region. Announcing the funding, Mr Byers said: 'The north west science and Daresbury development group are to be congratulated in bringing together all the key players in the north-west and for their report which clearly demonstrates the importance of integrating science with the region's economy in the long term.\" The headline figure of \u00a3150m for a lavish new science facility at Daresbury should be music to the ears of the centre's 500 staff, who faced being scattered to the winds last year after hearing that the government and the Wellcome Trust were shifting investment in their field to the south of England. The decision to replace Daresbury's centrepiece, a massive doughnut-shaped physics instrument called a synchrotron, with a more modern version in Oxfordshire dented the credibility of Mr Byers in the north-west. He had earlier given local unions the impression that the new synchrotron would go to Daresbury. Daresbury management is convinced that Mr Byers genuinely wants to preserve the Cheshire site as a world-class centre of excellence in physics. However, there is no guarantee that the minister will be able to find the \u00a3150m to build the new Centre for Accelerator Science and Imaging and Medicine (Casim), even if a review body of scientists decides later this month that the project is scientifically worthwhile. Mr Byers is believed to have given Daresbury private assurance that they will get Casim. \"I don't know the ins and outs of where the money is going to come from,\" said one source at Daresbury yesterday. \"That's something that, for now, I am happy to take at face value.\" Mr Byers' statement yesterday only committed the government to feasibility studies into the two components of Casim, an advanced laser and another physics device called a proton cyclotron. Tony Buckley, the chief spokesman for Daresbury, said: \"Having had the minister here, we are more confident. \"I think there is a difference between what was said by the minister on his visit and what was in his press statement. The words we heard from Stephen Byers leave us feeling very confident for the future of the Daresbury laboratory. Derek Twigg, the Labour MP for Halton, who was chairman of the consortium of north-west MPs who lobbied for the synchrotron to be moved to Daresbury, said he was delighted by the news. \"We had told the prime minister that we did not agree with the decision and we were not prepared to walk away from it,\" he said. \"I think this shows that the north-west, by pulling together, is able to deliver.\"",

      "body": "<p>The Indonesian government official accused of coordinating the massacre of 118 refugees trying to flee marauding gangs of indigenous Dayaks in Borneo has vehemently denied the charge, despite claims by witnesses that he appeared to be directing the brutal slaughter.</p> <p>Muhammed Yasin, the chief of Kuala Kuayan, a village deep in the jungle of Central Kalimantan, admitted to the Guardian that he had travelled with some of the 60-strong gang who killed the migrants from the island of Madura in the town of Parenggean.</p> <p>Mr Yasin insisted, however, that not only had he nothing to do with the executioners, he was in fact their hostage.</p> <p>When the gang arrived in Parenggean they hijacked a convoy of trucks that was evacuating about 400 Madurese, chased off its six police officers, and took 118 refugees to a school playing field and butchered them with machetes and spears.</p> <p>It was the worst incident in a two-week orgy of ethnic violence that has officially left more than 500 people dead, and possibly twice this, all but a handful of whom were descendants of or migrants from the island or Madura.</p> <p>The tens of thousands of Madurese who survived have fled the province, many with vicious wounds, and with only the clothes that they were wearing.</p> <p>\"It's a complete lie to suggest that I had anything to do with the slaughter in Parenggean,\" Mr Yasin said. \"The people spreading these rumours are provocateurs.\" He said he left Kuala Kuayan before the gang, but that they overtook him and his wife while on the road.</p> <p>\"They bullied and threatened me to go along with them,\" he said. \"They killed people on the road and I feared they were going to harm us. So when we got to Parenggean I sought protection from the officials there.\"</p> <p>His version of events is at odds with the reports of witnesses in both Kuala Kuayan and Parenggean.</p> <p>A neighbourhood chief in Kuala Kuayan, for instance, believes that Mr Yasin organised it all.</p> <p>\"[Yasin] said he got a phone call from Parenggean [on the Sunday morning] telling him that the Dayaks there needed help to 'sort out' the Madurese,\" Armili Madras said. \"So six vehicles left under the command of Mr Yasin.\"</p> <p>The next thing Mr Madras knew was when one of the drivers came back many hours later with three human heads in his car, saying they were from the massacre in Parenggean.

      "bodyText": "The Indonesian government official accused of coordinating the massacre of 118 refugees trying to flee marauding gangs of indigenous Dayaks in Borneo has vehemently denied the charge, despite claims by witnesses that he appeared to be directing the brutal slaughter. Muhammed Yasin, the chief of Kuala Kuayan, a village deep in the jungle of Central Kalimantan, admitted to the Guardian that he had travelled with some of the 60-strong gang who killed the migrants from the island of Madura in the town of Parenggean. Mr Yasin insisted, however, that not only had he nothing to do with the executioners, he was in fact their hostage. When the gang arrived in Parenggean they hijacked a convoy of trucks that was evacuating about 400 Madurese, chased off its six police officers, and took 118 refugees to a school playing field and butchered them with machetes and spears. It was the worst incident in a two-week orgy of ethnic violence that has officially left more than 500 people dead, and possibly twice this, all but a handful of whom were descendants of or migrants from the island or Madura. The tens of thousands of Madurese who survived have fled the province, many with vicious wounds, and with only the clothes that they were wearing. \"It's a complete lie to suggest that I had anything to do with the slaughter in Parenggean,\" Mr Yasin said. \"The people spreading these rumours are provocateurs.\" He said he left Kuala Kuayan before the gang, but that they overtook him and his wife while on the road. \"They bullied and threatened me to go along with them,\" he said. \"They killed people on the road and I feared they were going to harm us. So when we got to Parenggean I sought protection from the officials there.\" His version of events is at odds with the reports of witnesses in both Kuala Kuayan and Parenggean. A neighbourhood chief in Kuala Kuayan, for instance, believes that Mr Yasin organised it all. \"[Yasin] said he got a phone call from Parenggean [on the Sunday morning] telling him that the Dayaks there needed help to 'sort out' the Madurese,\" Armili Madras said. \"So six vehicles left under the command of Mr Yasin.\" The next thing Mr Madras knew was when one of the drivers came back many hours later with three human heads in his car, saying they were from the massacre in Parenggean. That driver has gone into hiding, as have all the other people from Kuala Kuayan allegedly involved in the killing. Mr Madras said he finds the phone call theory hard to believe, claiming that Mr Yasin does not have a telephone at his home and that the Dayaks in Parenggean had agreed that morning to give the authorities five days to evacuate the Madurese. \"What's more, the village police chief here said his counterpart in Parenggean said no one called Kuala Kuayan for Mr Yasin that morning.\" He alleged that at the time there was only one working telephone in Parenggean. Udin, a local government official in Parenggean who witnessed the arrival of the gang and the execution, said he saw Mr Yasin play a prominent role. \"I never saw him actually kill anyone but he seemed to be directing events at the start,\" he said. \"He brought the people and he was ordering them around.\" Mr Udin's boss, sub-district chief Rukmana Priyatna, said that after Mr Yasin had directed the heavily armed Dayaks as to what to do he went off and prepared their food, as if not wanting to be seen to be playing too prominent a role. \"He never asked me for protection at any time,\" Mr Priyatna said. Mr Yasin's friends and neighbours in Kuala Kuayan were eager to rush to his defence, however. \"He was here with us in Kuala Kuayan,\" said one man who asked not to be named. \"He wouldn't have done anything like that,\" Manarung, one of Mr Yasin's work colleagues, said. \"He even helped organise the evacuation of refugees from this sub-district.\" In the interview, Mr Yasin appeared to be a man of mixed emotions. With one breath he went out of his way to extol his love of all Indonesia's hundreds of ethnic groups: \"We are all one nation in one country under one flag. People should have the right to live anywhere.\" Yet his next words claimed the Madurese would never again be welcome in Kuala Kuayan: \"We can't have them back,\" he said. \"They just cause too many problems. Over land disputes, by carrying weapons, and [by] never apologising or admitting their mistakes.\" Another villager, Armin Effendi, said: \"He should at least be investigated.\" The Indonesian police, however, have shown no signs of even beginning to investigate or search for the perpetrators of the massacre, let alone the hundreds of other killings. \"We haven't received any orders to do anything,\" Sergeant Abdul Rahman said in Parenggean. \"And, as far as I'm aware, no special team has been set up to probe the massacre.\" In Parenggean, meanwhile, the school football pitch remains littered with blood-stained shoes, ripped belts, scrawled verses from the Koran written in a child's exercise book and soiled family photos.",

      "bodyText": "The Bush administration plans to unveil the outlines of its new US policy towards Iraq within the next two weeks, setting the groundwork for tighter, but more focused, UN-backed \"smart\" sanctions against Saddam Hussein's regime. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, will set out the key themes of American policy in a public statement before the Arab summit in Amman at the end of March. Mr Powell wants to build on a notably conciliatory tour of the region last week by ensuring that the Amman summit focuses on how to contain Iraq and does not become a rallying point against last month's US-British bombing. The new US administration is signalling that Iraq - not Palestine - is at the centre of its Middle East policy, and that a fresh drive to isolate President Saddam's regime without hurting the Iraqi population is its most immediate goal. \"It's a thing that could go wrong early in the administration, so the Americans want to put it right as soon as possible,\" a British diplomatic source said yesterday. It is thought, however, that it will be difficult to persuade Iraq's neighbours to monitor their common borders with the recalcitrant country more closely. Washington's efforts to do so will focus on Jordan, Syria and Turkey, all of which have been used to circumvent international monitoring of Iraqi imports and exports. \"You have to be confident that they are real controls not paper controls, and it is complicated when you are seeking to control a select list of items not everything,\" a senior official said yesterday. During Mr Powell's trip to the Middle East he was said to have secured promises from Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, that the revenue from Iraqi oil exports routed through Syria would now be placed under UN supervision. Syria, however, is only likely to take such action if Jordan and Turkey can also be persuaded to do so. The new approach towards sanctions against Iraq unites the Bush administration's hawks and doves. The Pentagon chief, Donald Rumsfeld, and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, are longtime supporters of active US efforts to promote the overthrow of President Saddam by military and other aid to the Iraqi opposition. Mr Powell leads the wing of the administration which is more sceptical. Israeli officials say they are pleased with efforts to re-unite the Arab coalition against Iraq because it shifts the focus away from the Palestinian issue, taking some of the pressure off the hardline prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon. \"The Bush administration sees there is a real need to address broader strategic problems as well as the Palestinian issue,\" said Dore Gold, a former Israeli ambassador to the UN who is advising Mr Sharon on foreign policy. Washington wants to disengage itself from the role of peacemaker between Israel and the Palestinians. Days after taking office, a state department spokesman said that the understanding reached between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in Egypt in January were no longer on the table, supporting Mr Sharon's stand that he will not resume negotiations where the outgoing prime minister, Ehud Barak, left off.

The compromise deal came as a diplomatic row threatened to erupt in Europe over Mr Mugabe's planned meeting with a European Union commissioner in Brussels, with the Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt on Monday and with President Jacques Chirac in Paris on Tuesday. In Zimbabwe, sceptics question the value of the signed agreement between Anthony Gubbay, the 68-year-old chief justice, and the justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa. The deal was signed several hours after Mr Gubbay received a visit from one of the most notorious leaders of the \"war veterans\", Joseph Chinotimba, who openly threatened him with violence. \"I talked to him personally and I told him to vacate the office today. No one is above the law,\" Mr Chinotimba said afterwards. \"We ought to teach him how cases are finalised here. We will declare war.\" Earlier this week, Mr Gubbay withdrew an agreement to take early retirement in July after the justice minister announced that he intended to appoint a government supporter as the new chief justice. Mr Mugabe is keen for Mr Gubbay's chosen successor, Godfrey Chikausikyu, to set up a tribunal to hear accusations of misconduct against judges who ruled that the government's seizures of white-owned farms is illegal. The first targets are expected to be the other four supreme court judges and several high court judges who are likely to rule against the government if, as expected, it tries to raise legal barriers against the opposition in the looming presidential election. Under yesterday's agreement, Mr Gubbay will retire in July and go on immediate leave. An interim chief justice - Mr Chikausikyu, it is presumed - will be appointed but Mr Gubbay will be able, technically, to block any purge of other judges until July. In Brussels yesterday, the European commission was forced to defend a controversial decision taken unilaterally by Poul Nielson, the EU's development and humanitarian aid commissioner, to have lunch with Mr Mugabe on Monday. The lunch has already been condemned by the Zimbabwean opposition, but Brussels signalled that it would not back down. Gunnar Wiegand, a commission spokesman, said that there were no sanctions in force against Zimbabwe to prevent a meeting. \"We will soon start a critical dialogue with Harare and it is very normal under those circumstances that Nielson [the EU's development and humanitarian aid commissioner] would meet the president.\" Bizarrely, the commission's weekly calendar, which always records any meetings with heads of state, omitted to mention the lunch.

Use of church buildings for purposes unconnected with religion would violate church law and could jeopardise the fiscal exemptions and other privileges granted to churches by the Italian state, Mgr Antonelli's directive said. \"Any permanent use, even partial, of a religious building for reasons unrelated to its principal purpose would not only violate canon law but could also jeopardise its special civic status,\" he warned. The bishop also pointed out that it would be imprudent to compromise the unique meaning and visibility of Christian symbols in an increasingly multicultural society.

      "bodyText": "Agrippa Mukando was walking near Robert Mugabe's official residence on Monday when soldiers guarding the grounds leapt on the 63-year-old gardener and accused him of being an opposition supporter. They beat him as they beat several others that day. In many African countries the all-too-common victims of assaults by soldiers consider themselves lucky to escape with their lives. They would laugh off any suggestion that they go to the police; that would just invite more trouble. But in a telling act of faith in what remains of the rule of law in Zimbabwe, Mr Mukando headed for Harare central police station and laid charges. Other victims did the same. The complaints are not likely to come to anything; the police are now too deeply compromised by their failure to stop the violence unleashed by Mr Mugabe's \"war veterans\" and other thugs. In much of Africa, the rule of law long ago ceased to be more than a meaningless phrase. Due process was sacrificed to the arbitrary decisions of the powerful. Zimbabwe stands on the edge of that abyss. As Mr Mukando demonstrated, some Zimbabweans still have faith in the judicial process, although the courts are more trusted than the police, but it is being eroded by the week. The Harare township of Chitungwiza is living in terror of armed thugs unleashed by the government. Sometimes it is the army on the rampage, sometimes it is men too young to have fought Ian Smith's regime but who still call themselves veterans. Their tactics are not always the same but their intent is. The gangs burst into bars and night clubs, forcing revellers to lie on the floor. Anyone giving a hint of supporting the opposition is singled out for a severe beating. The rest are forced to sing songs in praise of Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF, and the liberation war. Charity Gwanzura did not even have to leave her home to become a target. \"I was sitting in my house and I looked up and there was a soldier standing there,\" she said. \"I didn't understand at first. I thought maybe he was looking for someone or wanted some water. I was about to speak when he smashed his foot down on my table. I couldn't run because he was between me and the door, and then he started hitting me. He never said a word.\" It did not take long for the soldier to get bored with beating Mrs Gwanzura. All along the street, doors were kicked in and furniture smashed. When the sound of breaking wood stopped, the screams began. Men were hauled into the streets and forced to pledge support to Robert Mugabe and to sing songs praising him. Then the army left as fast as it arrived. The army and war veterans are intent on breaking the opposition's spirit. It is working to some extent. Many are disillusioned at the opposition's apparent powerlessness and inactivity. Its MPs make a lot of noise in parliament, Chitungwiza's residents say, but that does not stop the terror. Mrs Gwanzura says the attacks are also having another effect. \"I'll tell you what has changed.

Any court judgments which \"might result in moving away from Zimbabwe, back to Rhodesia, cannot be considered the rule of law\", he said. He means court rulings that have declared the land seizure programme illegal. Questioned about the use of repressive colonial-era security laws to detain opponents, the defence minister, Moven Mahachi, said that if the internal security act was used to convict innocent blacks under Ian Smith then there was no reason why the present government cannot do the same. And for all the independence of many judges, the courts are increasingly used not only as political weapons but to settle scores. Last week a bus driver was jailed for three years after being convicted of attempting to murder Mr Chinotimba. The inappropriately named Luckmore Chakanyuka was set upon by war veterans at a roadblock after an argument about driving standards. In his terror, Mr Chakanyuka jerked his bus forward.

There were queues at the bottom of every lift, and a very long queue for sandwiches at lunchtime. In the evenings we queued for happy hour at the hotel bar, then for the dinner buffet. Dastardly continentals would try to queue jump.

It's brightly lit, the decor is trendy and minimalist, and the stock is laid out in attractive displays, so you might be looking at a pyramid of Ferrero Rocher chocolates rather than blow-up nurse dolls with realistic mouth action.

      "body": "<p>Japan's ruling party scrambled to stave off a meltdown of confidence in the world's second-largest economy yesterday as growing signs of recession drove stocks in Tokyo to a 15-year low. </p> <p>The Liberal Democratic party said it would draw up a package of emergency measures next week to boost financial markets, lift house prices and help banks reduce the bad loans on their books. </p> <p>\"The situation has become more severe than before,\" said Taro Aso, state minister for economic and fiscal policy. \"The government should implement all possible measures to secure recovery.\" </p> <p>Spurring the announcement was a cluster of data indicating that Japan's economy is not just slowing - as the government has been insisting - but grinding into reverse. </p> <p>Figures released yesterday showed that unemployment in January was at a record low of 4.9%, with 3.17m people out of work. That figure is expected to rise because the ratio of vacancies to job seekers deteriorated for the first time in almost two years. </p> <p>Further layoffs are likely as companies cut production in reaction to a slowdown in the United States, their main export market. Yesterday, Fujitsu joined NEC and Toshiba as the latest electronics manufacturer to scale back its profit forecasts by double digits. </p> <p>An increasing number of economists believe Japan has been sucked into a deflationary spiral of falling profits, wages, prices and spending. Adding to the evidence for this theory, government figures yesterday showed that spending by salaried households was flat in January while consumer prices, excluding perishables, fell for the 18th consecutive month. The 1.1% decline was the sharpest fall since records began in 1971. </p> <p>Investors are fleeing Japanese stocks in droves. The Nikkei index slumped by 3.3% yesterday to 12, 261. During the past week, shares have declined by 7.4%, making Tokyo the worst performing exchange in Asia this year. </p> <p>\"I am extremely worried,\" prime minister Yoshiro Mori told parliament. </p> <p>The government is hoping its \u00a582.65 trillion (\u00a3540bn) budget bill - which passed the lower house yesterday - plus the new package of measures from the LDP will soothe investors' fears. </p> <p>Economic policymakers have been distracted by political feuds and uncertainty over the future of Mr Mori, who is expected to stand down this month. With the prime minister's approval rating at just 6%, the opposition announced yesterday that it will submit a no-confidence vote against the government on Monday. </p> <p>The governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaru Hayami, is also under pressure to resign. The LDP blames the turmoil on his decision to end Japan's zero interest rate policy last August. On Wednesday, the bank effectively acknowledged that this decision had been a mistake by cutting rates by a tenth of a percentage point.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Japan's ruling party scrambled to stave off a meltdown of confidence in the world's second-largest economy yesterday as growing signs of recession drove stocks in Tokyo to a 15-year low. The Liberal Democratic party said it would draw up a package of emergency measures next week to boost financial markets, lift house prices and help banks reduce the bad loans on their books. \"The situation has become more severe than before,\" said Taro Aso, state minister for economic and fiscal policy. \"The government should implement all possible measures to secure recovery.\" Spurring the announcement was a cluster of data indicating that Japan's economy is not just slowing - as the government has been insisting - but grinding into reverse. Figures released yesterday showed that unemployment in January was at a record low of 4.9%, with 3.17m people out of work. That figure is expected to rise because the ratio of vacancies to job seekers deteriorated for the first time in almost two years. Further layoffs are likely as companies cut production in reaction to a slowdown in the United States, their main export market. Yesterday, Fujitsu joined NEC and Toshiba as the latest electronics manufacturer to scale back its profit forecasts by double digits. An increasing number of economists believe Japan has been sucked into a deflationary spiral of falling profits, wages, prices and spending. Adding to the evidence for this theory, government figures yesterday showed that spending by salaried households was flat in January while consumer prices, excluding perishables, fell for the 18th consecutive month. The 1.1% decline was the sharpest fall since records began in 1971. Investors are fleeing Japanese stocks in droves. The Nikkei index slumped by 3.3% yesterday to 12, 261. During the past week, shares have declined by 7.4%, making Tokyo the worst performing exchange in Asia this year. \"I am extremely worried,\" prime minister Yoshiro Mori told parliament. The government is hoping its \u00a582.65 trillion (\u00a3540bn) budget bill - which passed the lower house yesterday - plus the new package of measures from the LDP will soothe investors' fears. Economic policymakers have been distracted by political feuds and uncertainty over the future of Mr Mori, who is expected to stand down this month. With the prime minister's approval rating at just 6%, the opposition announced yesterday that it will submit a no-confidence vote against the government on Monday. The governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaru Hayami, is also under pressure to resign. The LDP blames the turmoil on his decision to end Japan's zero interest rate policy last August. On Wednesday, the bank effectively acknowledged that this decision had been a mistake by cutting rates by a tenth of a percentage point.",

      "body": "<p>Most City analysts believe that the UK economy will continue to grow strongly even if there is little or no progress in output across the Atlantic this year. Yet the strength of the US is unmatched.</p> <p>Backed by natural and managerial resources in depth and around the globe, there can be little doubt that its economy will remain the front-runner for as long as anyone can contemplate. In what seems set to be an era of disasters, natural and man-made, size and financial strength will count for most.</p> <p>London continues to be dominated by Wall Street. The strength of the dollar in the face of soaring trade deficits underlines that position. Expectations that faster growth in the eurozone would help its currency have faded, though the euro did recover some lost ground when the spate of continental takeovers of US companies eased.</p> <p>Whichever currency becomes the year's strong suit, it is unlikely to be the pound. Foreign investment has been a mainstay of both sterling and the economy, but it is bound to fall back while American profits dive. A significant proportion of the fall is arising in overseas subsidiaries. The hundreds of important UK firms owned by US parents would suffer if concern about the infrastructure continues to mount. After so many setbacks in a densely populated island, an erosion of confidence in the UK is inevitable.</p> <p>Despite unrivalled prosperity in the US, consumer confidence there is at its weakest for nearly five years. On top of profit warnings from both hi-tech and leading brand providers, this has undermined Wall Street lately. Hopes of further reductions in interest rates brought temporary rebounds, but the Federal Reserve central bank is apparently unwilling to resort to more cuts. Few doubt that interest rates will come down again shortly.</p> <p>Investment in the US by UK institutions and individuals has been far below that justified by the strength of the economy and currency. The failures in direct investment over there by UK companies may have had something to do with it, although the dominance of US financial institutions in the City of London and arrival of leading fund managers might have been expected to correct the situation.</p> <p>The best returns for UK private investors on Wall Street have been achieved by Fidelity, the privately owned US fund manager that extended its operations into Europe in the 80s. Its main US unit funds have shown fairly consistent appreciation, though over recent months Fidelity Special Situations, investing in smaller companies than the main Fidelity American retail fund, has fallen back. Both have achieved appreciation of more than 170% over three years.

      "bodyText": "Most City analysts believe that the UK economy will continue to grow strongly even if there is little or no progress in output across the Atlantic this year. Yet the strength of the US is unmatched. Backed by natural and managerial resources in depth and around the globe, there can be little doubt that its economy will remain the front-runner for as long as anyone can contemplate. In what seems set to be an era of disasters, natural and man-made, size and financial strength will count for most. London continues to be dominated by Wall Street. The strength of the dollar in the face of soaring trade deficits underlines that position. Expectations that faster growth in the eurozone would help its currency have faded, though the euro did recover some lost ground when the spate of continental takeovers of US companies eased. Whichever currency becomes the year's strong suit, it is unlikely to be the pound. Foreign investment has been a mainstay of both sterling and the economy, but it is bound to fall back while American profits dive. A significant proportion of the fall is arising in overseas subsidiaries. The hundreds of important UK firms owned by US parents would suffer if concern about the infrastructure continues to mount. After so many setbacks in a densely populated island, an erosion of confidence in the UK is inevitable. Despite unrivalled prosperity in the US, consumer confidence there is at its weakest for nearly five years. On top of profit warnings from both hi-tech and leading brand providers, this has undermined Wall Street lately. Hopes of further reductions in interest rates brought temporary rebounds, but the Federal Reserve central bank is apparently unwilling to resort to more cuts. Few doubt that interest rates will come down again shortly. Investment in the US by UK institutions and individuals has been far below that justified by the strength of the economy and currency. The failures in direct investment over there by UK companies may have had something to do with it, although the dominance of US financial institutions in the City of London and arrival of leading fund managers might have been expected to correct the situation. The best returns for UK private investors on Wall Street have been achieved by Fidelity, the privately owned US fund manager that extended its operations into Europe in the 80s. Its main US unit funds have shown fairly consistent appreciation, though over recent months Fidelity Special Situations, investing in smaller companies than the main Fidelity American retail fund, has fallen back. Both have achieved appreciation of more than 170% over three years. Over 10 years it is far more than 1,000% in Special Situations. Other fund managers who are now part of the international banking giants Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have invested quite actively in America and done well. Threadneedle American has been a long-term success and over more recent years Framlington units, too, have performed close to the best. The much smaller Abbey US Emerging has also done well, though not its much bigger stablemate Abbey American, which has grown by much less than half over three years. UK banks and insurers have also been pedestrian performers as has, surprisingly, Merrill Lynch, the top American broking firm over the years of booming mutual fund investment. In smaller companies it has done very well, along with Schroder. Gartmore performed reasonably with all of its American funds before it became part of Nationwide, the US insurer, but has now slipped way down the lists. Oddly, the benighted Equitable has done the reverse, showing one of the strongest performances, though the north American unit fund is tiny. Among investment trusts there are no outstanding US performers, in spite of the long experience of Scottish fund managers there. Alliance and Second Alliance are UK and international investors from their Dundee base, but they did not raise US stakes at the right time.

      "trailText": "The Chancellor has up to \u00a34bn to give away. Liz Stuart and Phillip Inman compile a wishlist.",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Chancellor Gordon Brown has \u00a33bn to \u00a34bn to give away over the next two years, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. He has already splashed out \u00a31.7bn on his package for motorists: the rest could be up for grabs in Wednesday's Budget. We asked a range of bodies representing consumer interests what they would like to see in Mr Brown's red box.</p> <p><b> Long-term care</b><br></p> <p>The Chancellor has dodged the issue of who will pay nursing and residential care in old age ever since the last election. Most pensioner groups want an end to all charges - a simple solution that would stop people having to sell their homes to pay for care services. But the cost is believed to be \u00a31.1bn, rising to \u00a32.4bn in 2021.</p> <p><b> Retirement</b><br></p> <p>Along with most pensioner groups, the TUC is looking for a restoration of the link between the basic state pension and the earnings or prices index, whichever is higher. It wants to replace the minimum income guarantee, which tops up the state pension with income support payments, with an age-related supplement of \u00a322 a week for a single person and \u00a329 per couple. Age Concern says it wants the Chancellor to use his pot to move the state pension closer to its stated target of \u00a390 a week.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Taxation is taking a slightly different stance: it wants pensions to be given the best tax breaks, making it more attractive for long-term saving than Isas or unit or investment trusts. \"Isas are about saving money to spend, whereas pensions are about people not having to rely on the state in their old age,\" says the institute's deputy president, John Whiting.</p> <p>The National Association of Pension Funds is calling for greater flexibility over the retirement age: it wants people to be able to draw just one part of their pension, allowing them to downshift to a less stressful job and so continue working beyond 65. The other part of their pension would be taken later on. \"There needs to be a rethink on the issue of compulsion. There is a danger that the new stakeholder pensions will not be as attractive without compulsion,\" he adds.</p> <p><b> Childcare</b><br></p> <p>Gingerbread, the organisation supporting lone parents, is pushing for additional paid parental leave which could be taken at any point in the child's life. This would be particularly useful at times of change or during school holidays.</p> <p>It also says that benefit poverty traps must be tackled. Many people who qualify for the Working Families Tax Credit find they no longer qualify for housing benefit, which makes them no better off, says a spokeswoman.</p> <p>The TUC, meanwhile, wants the new Children's Tax Credit to increase by \u00a31.50 a week to \u00a310.</p> <p><b> Savings and investment </b><br></p> <p>The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif) is looking for just one thing on Wednesday: a change in the way stamp duty is charged on the buying of shares within a fund of funds (a fund which, as the name suggests, trades only in other funds rather than in stocks themselves - the ultimate collective, and therefore risk-averse, investment). Currently the duty is effectively charged three times, and Autif would like to see it levied just once.</p> <p><b> Tax</b><br></p> <p>\"We want the whole taxation regime to be simplified. While it may look like there are only three tax bands, because of the multitude of exceptions and clauses and bits and pieces, it's actually more complicated than that: just look at the number of people who can't fill out their self-assessment forms,\" says the Chartered Institute of Taxation's Mr Whiting, echoing the call of many groups that despair of Mr Brown's complicated tax reforms.</p> <p>Age Concern, meanwhile, would like more pensioners to join the non-taxpaying community (two-thirds of retired people pay tax). It says the best way to do this is to increase the levels of age- related personal allowances.</p> <p><b> The workplace</b><br></p> <p>The Low Pay Unit is calling for an increase in the minimum wage from \u00a33.70. \"Ideally we would like to see it going up to \u00a35,\" says director Bharti Patel. The unit also wants an enforcement agency covering all employment rights issues, to be set up. \"Even if we get an indication that the Chancellor is looking to bring this in, we will be very pleased,\" she says. And it is calling for a reform of the National Insurance system so that the low-paid become eligible for the full benefits; this could be paid for by abolishing the upper earnings limit to increase contributions from high earners.</p> <p>The TUC will be keeping its fingers crossed for a new tax credit designed to encourage companies to spend more on research and development and training.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Chancellor Gordon Brown has \u00a33bn to \u00a34bn to give away over the next two years, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies. He has already splashed out \u00a31.7bn on his package for motorists: the rest could be up for grabs in Wednesday's Budget. We asked a range of bodies representing consumer interests what they would like to see in Mr Brown's red box. Long-term care The Chancellor has dodged the issue of who will pay nursing and residential care in old age ever since the last election. Most pensioner groups want an end to all charges - a simple solution that would stop people having to sell their homes to pay for care services. But the cost is believed to be \u00a31.1bn, rising to \u00a32.4bn in 2021. Retirement Along with most pensioner groups, the TUC is looking for a restoration of the link between the basic state pension and the earnings or prices index, whichever is higher. It wants to replace the minimum income guarantee, which tops up the state pension with income support payments, with an age-related supplement of \u00a322 a week for a single person and \u00a329 per couple. Age Concern says it wants the Chancellor to use his pot to move the state pension closer to its stated target of \u00a390 a week. The Chartered Institute of Taxation is taking a slightly different stance: it wants pensions to be given the best tax breaks, making it more attractive for long-term saving than Isas or unit or investment trusts. \"Isas are about saving money to spend, whereas pensions are about people not having to rely on the state in their old age,\" says the institute's deputy president, John Whiting. The National Association of Pension Funds is calling for greater flexibility over the retirement age: it wants people to be able to draw just one part of their pension, allowing them to downshift to a less stressful job and so continue working beyond 65. The other part of their pension would be taken later on. \"There needs to be a rethink on the issue of compulsion. There is a danger that the new stakeholder pensions will not be as attractive without compulsion,\" he adds. Childcare Gingerbread, the organisation supporting lone parents, is pushing for additional paid parental leave which could be taken at any point in the child's life. This would be particularly useful at times of change or during school holidays. It also says that benefit poverty traps must be tackled. Many people who qualify for the Working Families Tax Credit find they no longer qualify for housing benefit, which makes them no better off, says a spokeswoman. The TUC, meanwhile, wants the new Children's Tax Credit to increase by \u00a31.50 a week to \u00a310. Savings and investment The Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds (Autif) is looking for just one thing on Wednesday: a change in the way stamp duty is charged on the buying of shares within a fund of funds (a fund which, as the name suggests, trades only in other funds rather than in stocks themselves - the ultimate collective, and therefore risk-averse, investment). Currently the duty is effectively charged three times, and Autif would like to see it levied just once. Tax \"We want the whole taxation regime to be simplified. While it may look like there are only three tax bands, because of the multitude of exceptions and clauses and bits and pieces, it's actually more complicated than that: just look at the number of people who can't fill out their self-assessment forms,\" says the Chartered Institute of Taxation's Mr Whiting, echoing the call of many groups that despair of Mr Brown's complicated tax reforms. Age Concern, meanwhile, would like more pensioners to join the non-taxpaying community (two-thirds of retired people pay tax). It says the best way to do this is to increase the levels of age- related personal allowances. The workplace The Low Pay Unit is calling for an increase in the minimum wage from \u00a33.70. \"Ideally we would like to see it going up to \u00a35,\" says director Bharti Patel. The unit also wants an enforcement agency covering all employment rights issues, to be set up. \"Even if we get an indication that the Chancellor is looking to bring this in, we will be very pleased,\" she says. And it is calling for a reform of the National Insurance system so that the low-paid become eligible for the full benefits; this could be paid for by abolishing the upper earnings limit to increase contributions from high earners. The TUC will be keeping its fingers crossed for a new tax credit designed to encourage companies to spend more on research and development and training.",

The bank, which counts one in three of the UK's farmers among its customers, is offering the repayment delays to all its farming customers, regardless of whether they are livestock farmers. Other businesses, such as hauliers which specialise in moving livestock around the country, will be considered for the help with repayments on a case-by-case basis. Farmers and hundreds of associated businesses have seen their income evaporate overnight as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. Those forced to incinerate their herds have lost all chance of generating any revenue for months. The government has promised compensation, but many of those affected fear the time delay until any cash is received could be fatal for their businesses.

One supplier claimed to have been asked for cash payments from one supermarket chain three times in a few months. \"The third was by telephone for \u00a3100,000 .. as a contribution towards profits,\" according to the report. However, the commission did not impose any dramatic sanctions, recommending only that supermarkets should be made to abide by a legally binding code of practice. It is agreement on this code that Mr Blair is now saying he wants to see hurried up. Planning laws, which rarely give permission for two out-of-town superstores in the same place, have prevented the sector from being truly competitive. As supply chains have become longer and more complicated, the cost of the food itself has become a smaller part of the price we pay for groceries. The processors, packagers, marketers, and distributors all want to add their margins along the way. Cutting out the middle men and encouraging shoppers to deal more directly with the producers sounds attractive. But working patterns have changed. In the past women spent many hours a day buying food in several different shops. The success of supermarkets has been at least in part a response to the changing needs of working women. And no review of British farming policy will have any impact without an overhaul of the EU common agriculture policy. What's going on?

He pops a few in his own mouth to prove that he only gives his animals what he is prepared to consume himself. </p> <p>In 1991, following the fall of the iron curtain, Mr Wendt, now aged 49, returned to the stretch of land his ancestors began farming in 1688. Within four years he had transformed an East German state-run intensive collective into a 1,400-hectare (3,500-acre) cooperative.

But Michael Lohse of the Deutsche Bauern Verband (DBV), the German farmers' union, insists his organisation remains agnostic on the issue. \"It's no problem. Even 30% would be no problem,\" he says. \"But we know that most of the consumers do not want it. Right now, we have more consumers buying organic.

If they go organic, their union says, they risk not having a market for their produce. But if they keep to the established, intensive methods, and the demand for organic produce holds up, there is the danger that others will meet it. Denmark, which is committed to a detailed programme of conversion to organic methods, is right next door. </p> <p>\"Since Ms K\u00fcnast took office, we have had more than 1,000 calls from farmers seeking information,\" says Thomas Dosch, the director of Bioland, the largest of six bodies in Germany representing organic producers. </p> <p>Hans-Peter Wendt, who joined Bioland in 1991, remembers the five-year transition programme as \"the hardest years of my life\". </p> <p>\"I had been told in advance that initially, without the use of sprays and chemical fertilisers, yields were going to be low, and that weeds had to be allowed to take over.

Average conversion costs are between 450 and 600 marks per hectare per annum. How much the authorities contribute varies from region to region.

Most retailers reported signs of panic buying as the public responded to speculation about shortages of meat by stocking up not just on meat and poultry but also on other emergency supplies of food such as milk, dried milk, pasta and frozen meals. Fears of shortages took a new twist yesterday with eight more cases of foot and mouth disease being confirmed, bringing the total to 40. But farmers were thrown a lifeline with the decision to allow licensed movement of animals in areas not affected. Demand for meat has surged by between 40% and 50% and supermarkets have struggled to keep their shelves stocked, even though they have adequate supplies at their depots and plans for imports in place should British meat run out. Asda accused Mr Blair of looking for a scapegoat amid concerns that falling farming standards and the industrialisation of food might have contributed to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease. \"If Mr Blair wants to play politics that is up to him. We were under the impression that it was the Ministry of Agriculture, and not the supermarkets, which set agri-policy in this country,\" a spokesperson said. The prime minister's comments had been made to farmers and Labour party supporters at Hartpury agricultural college in Gloucestershire on Thursday. \"We all want cheaper food, but on the other hand the supermarkets have pretty much got an armlock on you people at the moment,\" he said.

As the competition commission report identified last autumn, there is an issue around the relationship between supermarkets and their suppliers, and the office of fair trading is currently consulting on a code of practice in this area.\" To add to consumers' growing sense of crisis, the safety of foreign meat was called into question as the independent food standards agency disclosed that consignments of beef from Germany and Holland imported into East Sussex were found to contain remnants of spinal chord, which are banned under BSE regulations.The FSA said local authorities and the meat hygiene service had been told to increase BSE-related checks. The new cases confirmed yesterday were in Tyne and Wear, Worcestershire, Staffordshire, Wiltshire, Dumfries and Galloway, Essex and Cumbria.

The first animals are expected to start moving on Monday or Tuesday. Further restrictions on countryside access were imposed yesterday. The National Trust for Scotland placed off-limits all its rural and countryside properties. Large parts of the Lake and Peak districts were closed to walkers; and the Reading, Berkshire, half-marathon on March 11 was cancelled. What's going on?

His many friends will recall not just his humour but the extraordinary courage he showed as he fought his illness.\"</p> <p>Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian, said: \"He always denied being brave, but of course he was immensely brave. He charted his encounter with cancer (he refused to call it a fight) in a remarkable way - painfully honest, painfully funny and sometimes just pain-filled.\" Last week he had attended a party organised by Tina Brown, editor of Talk magazine, where he was \"scribbling one-liners, eyes full of mischief, living the life he had left to the full. It was an extraordinary life.\"</p> <p>Peter Stothard, editor of the Times, said in a statement: \"John Diamond brought all his skill as a journalist to report for the Times from the frontline of the cancer war.

The BBC said last night that a TV adaptation of the play would go ahead, as long as Diamond's family agreed.</p> <p>Ruth Rogers, co-owner of the River Cafe and godmother to Cosima, recalled a party she and her husband, the architect Lord Rogers, organised in 1999 for the couple's 10th anniversary. \"People thought it might be the last time they would ever see him, and were worried it was going to be a wake before the death - but of course John and Nigella walked in and everybody realised it was going to be a fabulously happy occasion.\"</p> <p>Roger Alton, editor of the Observer, said: \"He was the most lovable man I've ever met.

I'm never going to progress here,\" she says. \"I've had a few interviews already and I'll get a good reference.\" </p> <p>Sophie's decision to get on and do the best job she can gets top marks from career experts, but her decision to leave is not regarded as a wise move. </p> <p>\"It smacks of sour grapes,\" comments Professor Cary Cooper, an occupational psychologist at UMIST. If you stay you might find out things about yourself you may not like to hear, but they will help you improve.\" </p> <p>If you've been passed over for promotion, the worst thing you can do is have a seemingly endless pity party. To worry or get angry at your company can be counterproductive, as you'll only end up demotivated and your performance at work will suffer. </p> <p>Instead, try asking yourself honestly why you didn't get the job. You could begin by drawing up your strengths then looking at your weaknesses. Also consider the strengths of the colleague who was promoted over you. You may well be able to learn something from him or her. And you might consider asking your peers why they think you didn't get the promotion. </p> <p>Often we miss out on promotion because we are not projecting the right image says Neil Franklin, chief executive of Dataworkforce, a telecoms outsourcing company.

That's how you get noticed.

Give your career hopes a boost by trying one of the following: </p> <p> <strong> The Business Card CV</strong> </p> <p> US magazine Fortune recently suggested that, for movers and shakers who do their career-advancement networking at conferences and parties, a business card CV might be just the ticket. During the self-introduction and handshake, you hand over a normal business card - but the flip side features a brief CV of achievements to date. Follow-up contact can be made later and more details provided via the traditional CV and covering letter. </p> <p> <strong> The Beamable CV</strong> </p> <p> It isn't such a great leap to the next new format for transmitting your qualifications - the \"beamable\" CV. Beamable CVs would be broadcast via a hand-held device like a Palm or Psion palmtop, with a very brief summary of your contact details, qualifications, and experience. </p> <p> <strong> The Web CV</strong> </p> <p> Web CVs are electronic documents posted on a personal web site. Add the URL (website address) to the bottom of an email and potential employers can view your details with a single click. Quick and easy to update, posting a web CV is particularly useful for job-hunters in creative fields who want to display writing samples, illustrations or screen shots. Your portfolio is just another click away. </p> <p>With the right meta tags - words picked up by search engines like Google or Yahoo! - your CV will be easily accessible to recruiters. The trick of this approach is to make the entire website as professional looking, easy to find, and readable as possible. Forget the cute but amateurish pictures of your pet hamster or recent holiday. A web CV ought to have its own domain, where you can display credentials and supporting materials in a professional, attractive, and printable format. </p> <p>Companies involved in e-commerce or the creative industries like advertising and design are likely to be the most appreciative of such an approach. </p> <p> <strong> The Flash CV</strong> </p> <p> Another new trend is the interactive multi-media CV, which uses the latest animation effects of downloadable Flash software to catch the reader's eye. The form might range from a space age motif with supersonic sound effects to a Game Boy mock-up with buttons that deliver information on your education and experience. A growing number of companies offer creative CV design using Flash software with standard theme templates and custom designs aimed at producing a \"wow\" effect. The CV package often includes elements like a photo and covering letter. </p> <p>A simple search for \"Flash CVs\" on any big internet search engine will turn up samples of individuals who have gone the multimedia route and companies that provide the service. Prices are usually reasonable, but you might have to pay extra for updates and hosting. </p> <p> <strong> The Talking CV</strong> </p> <p> Bath-based Talking CV gives employers the chance to see job-hunters in action. You simply book a slot at Talking CV's assessment centre in Bath (other centres are to open soon) where you record a \"live\" structured interview (though you can re-record your answers at any time). The interview can be pre-set up to be industry or role-specific or more general. You answer questions relating to your career, experience, achievements, working style, aptitudes, and aspirations - as well as your hobbies and interests. </p> <p>After you have completed the recording, the interview is combined with your CV details to produce a web page and CD-Rom for you to send potential employers. The service costs \u00a349.35 and more details are available at <a href=\"http://www.talkingcv.com\">www.talkingcv.com</a>. </p> <p>While there's no doubting the entertainment factor in these souped-up CVs, bear in mind their primary purpose: to impress an employer and land an interview. </p> <p>No matter what format you try, certain elements are non-negotiable. Your CV must be well written, using effective short descriptions, phrases, and \"action\" verbs that emphasise results. The language should be tailored to the industry or profession and convey personal qualities that parallel the culture of the targeted company or organisation. </p> <p>Whether you embellish presentation with a colourful template or post it on the web, you must still communicate the skills, ability, and attitude to fit the targeted position. </p> <p>\"Your CV is your representative,\" says Charles Walker of recruitment agency Blue Arrow, \"and by taking the time to ensure it is easy to read and professionally presented, you can dramatically increase your chances of getting an interview.\"</p>",

I hope that in three or four years' time it will be running smoothly and I can take a back seat.\" Article 13 Jane Fiona Cumming took an MBA in strategic marketing at Hull Business School to improve her understanding of the language that business speaks. Right at the start, she was surprised by the need for a module on ethics in business and began to think about that and other issues. She set up Article 13 with her business partner Neela Betteridge, assisting companies to embed ethics and good environmental practices in their businesses. \"We emphasise that being ethical brings benefits to the business as well as the staff,\" she explains.",

I don't know the scientific causes, but during this dawn, this one single dawn in the whole of a disconcerting August, the moon is a hammock of swaying iridescence, the stars marshal themselves to encircle it, and the Milky Way proudly lights up its thousand wounds of clotted light. In this August of the end of the millennium, the calendar pointed to the sixth day when this dawn appeared. And with the swaying moon came back a memory of another August and another sixth, 15 years ago, when I began my entry into these mountains that were and are, like it or not, home, school, road, and door. I began my entry in August, and I didn't complete it until September. </p> <p>I should confess something to you. When I laboriously climbed the first of the steep hills that abound in these parts, I was sure it would be my last. I wasn't thinking of revolution, of high human ideals or a shining future for the dispossessed and forgotten of always. </p> <p>No, I was thinking I'd made the worst decision in my life, that the pain that squeezed my chest, more and more, would end up totally closing off my increasingly skimpy airway, that the best thing for me would be to go back and let the revolution manage itself without me. If I didn't go back, it was only because I didn't know the way back. All I knew was that I had to follow the compa\u00f1ero preceding me, who, judging by the cigarette he was smoking while effortlessly negotiating the mud, seemed to be merely out for a stroll. I didn't think that one day I'd be able to climb a hill while smoking and not feel as if I was dying with each step, or that a time would come when I'd be able to manage the mud that was as abundant underfoot as the stars are overhead. No, I wasn't thinking at all then. I was concentrating on every breath I was trying to take. </p> <p>At some point we reached the highest crest of the hill, and the man in charge of the meagre column (we were three) said we would rest there. I let myself fall in the mud and told myself that perhaps it wouldn't be so hard to find the way back, that all I would have to do would be to walk down for another eternity, and that some day I would have to reach the point where the truck had dropped us off. I was making my calculations, including the excuses I would give them and give myself for abandoning the beginning of my career as a guerrilla, when the compa\u00f1ero approached me and offered me a cigarette. I refused with a shake of my head, not because I didn't want to talk but because I'd tried saying, \"No thanks\", and only a groan had come out. </p> <p>After a bit, taking advantage of the fact that the man in charge had gone off some distance to satisfy what is referred to as a basic biological need, I used the .20-calibre rifle that I was carrying more like a walking stick than a combat weapon, and pulled myself up as best I could. That was how I was able to see something from the top of that mountain that had a profound im-pact on me. </p> <p>No, I didn't look down. I didn't look towards the twisted scribble of the river, nor to the weak lights of the bonfires that dimly illuminated a distant hamlet, nor to the neighbouring mountains that painted the ravine, sprinkled with small villages, fields and pastures. </p> <p>I looked upward. I saw a sky that was a gift and a relief - no, more like a promise. The moon was like a smiling nocturnal swing, the stars sprinkling blue lights, and the ancient serpent of luminous wounds that you call the Milky Way seemed to be resting its head there, very far away. </p> <p>I stayed looking for a time, knowing I'd have to climb up that wretched hill to see this dawn, that the mud, the slips, the stones that hurt my flesh inside and out, the tired lungs incapable of pulling in the necessary air, the cramped legs, the anguished clinging to the rifle walking stick to free my boots from the imprisoning mud, the feeling of loneliness and desolation, the weight I was carrying on my back (which, I came to know later, was only a token, since in reality there would always be three times that or more), that all of that - and much more that would come later - is what had made it possible for that moon, those stars, and the Milky Way to be there and no other place. </p> <p>When I heard, from behind, the orders to renew the march, up in the sky a star, surely fed up by its subjugation to the black roof, managed to break away and, by falling, to leave a brief and fugitive trace on the nocturnal blackboard. </p> <p>\"That's what we are,\" I said to myself, \"fallen stars that barely scratch the sky of history with a scrawl.\" As far as I knew, I had only thought this, but apparently I had thought it aloud, because the compa\u00f1ero asked, \"What did he say?\" </p> <p>\"I don't know,\" replied the man in charge. \"Could be he's already got a fever. We have to hurry.\" </p> <p>What I'm telling you happened 15 years ago. Thirty years ago, a few people scratched history, and, knowing this, they began calling to many others so that, by dint of scribbling, scratching and scrawling, they would end up rending the veil of history, and so the light would finally be seen. That, and nothing else, is the struggle we are making. And so if you ask us what we want, we will unashamedly answer: \"To open a crack in history.\" </p> <p>Perhaps you are asking what happened to my intention to turn back and abandon the guerrilla life, and you might suppose that the vision of that first dawn in the mountains made me abandon my idea of fleeing, lifted my morale and firmed my revolutionary conscience. Well, you are wrong. I put my plan into operation and went down the hill. What happened is I mistook which side to go down. Instead of going down the slope that would take me back to the road and from there to \"civilisation\", I went down the side that took me deeper into the rainforest and that led me to another hill, and another and another . . . </p> <p>That was 15 years ago. Since then, I have kept climbing hills and I have kept mistaking which side to go down, and every August 6 keeps giving birth to a special dawn, and all of us keep being falling stars barely scratching our history. </p> <p>Wait. What is that shining so bright in the distance? It looks like a crack . . . </p> <p> <strong> Opening remarks at the First Intercontinental Encuentro For Humanity and Against Neoliberalism, July 27, 1996</strong> </p> <p>Chiapas, Mexico </p> <p> Brothers and sisters of Asia, Africa, </p> <p>Oceania, Europe and America, </p> <p>Welcome to the mountains of the </p> <p>Mexican Southeast. </p> <p>Let us introduce ourselves. </p> <p>We are the Zapatista National Liberation </p> <p>Army. </p> <p>For 10 years, we lived in these mountains, preparing to fight a war. </p> <p>In these mountains, we built an army. </p> <p>Below, in the cities and plantations, we did not exist. </p> <p>Our lives were worth less than those of machines or animals. </p> <p>We were like stones, like weeds in the road. </p> <p>We were silenced. </p> <p>We were faceless. </p> <p>We were nameless </p> <p>We had no future. </p> <p>We did not exist. </p> <p>For the powers that be, known internationally by the term \"neoliberalism\", </p> <p>we did not count, </p> <p>we did not produce, </p> <p>we did not buy, </p> <p>we did not sell. </p> <p>We were a cipher in the accounts of big capital. </p> <p>Then we went to the mountains to find ourselves and see if we could ease the pain of being forgotten like stones and weeds. </p> <p>Here, in the mountains of the Mexican Southeast, our dead live on. </p> <p>Our dead, who live in the mountains, know many things. </p> <p>They speak to us of their death, and we hear them. </p> <p>Coffins speak and tell us another story, that comes from yesterday and points to tomorrow. </p> <p>The mountains spoke to us, the Macehualob, we common and ordinary people. </p> <p>We are simple people, as Power tells us. </p> <p>The kaz-dzul , the false man, rules our lands and has giant war machines, </p> <p>like the boob, half-puma and half-horse, </p> <p>that spread pain and death among us. </p> <p>The trickster government sends us the aluxob , </p> <p>the liars who fool our people and make them forgetful. </p> <p>This is why we became soldiers. </p> <p>This is why we remain soldiers. </p> <p>Because we want no more death and trickery for our people, </p> <p>because we want no more forgetting. </p> <p>The mountain told us to take up arms so we would have a voice. </p> <p>It told us to cover our faces so we would have a face. </p> <p>It told us to forget our names so we could be named. </p> <p>It told us to protect our past so we would have a future. </p> <p>Brothers and sisters: </p> <p>We have invited you to this meeting to seek for and find yourselves and us. </p> <p>You have all touched our hearts, and you can see we are not special. </p> <p>You can see we are simple and ordinary men and women. </p> <p>You can see we are the rebellious mirror that wants to be a pane of glass and break. </p> <p>You can see we are who we are so we can stop being who we are to become the you, who we are. </p> <p>We are the Zapatistas. </p> <p><strong> Letter to John Berger, Haute Savoy, France</strong> </p> <p> May 12, 1995 </p> <p> A cold dawn drags itself between the fog and the thatched roofs of the village. It is morning. The dawn leaves, the cold remains. The little streets of mud begin to fill with people and animals. The cold and a small bench accompany me in the reading of Boar Land. Heriberto and Eva (five and six years old, respectively) come and snatch the book. They look at the picture on the front cover (it is a Madrid edition from 1989). It is a copy of a painting by John Constable, an image of an English countryside. </p> <p>The drawing, Mr Berger, elicits from them a quick connection between image and reality. For Heriberto, for example, there is no doubt that the horse in the painting is La Mu\u00f1eca [The Doll] - a mare that accompanied us in the long year when the indigenous rebellion governed southeastern Mexico, which no one could mount except Manuel, a playmate who was twice the age, size and weight of Heriberto. And what Constable called \"a river\" is really a stream that passes through \"La Realidad\". (\"La Realidad\" is the name of the reality of the village of La Realidad, which is the outer reaches of Heriberto's horizons.) The most distant place that Heriberto's trips and running around have taken him is \"La Realidad\". </p> <p>Constable's painting does not transport Heriberto and Eva to the English countryside. It does not take them outside the Lacandon Jungle. It leaves them here, or it brings them back. It brings them back to their land, their place, to their being children, to their being campesinos, to their being indigenous, to their being Mexicans and rebels. For Heriberto and Eva, Constable's painting is a coloured drawing of La Mu\u00f1eca, and its title, Scene On A Navigable River, is not a valid argument: the river is the stream in \"La Realidad,\" the horse is the mare La Mu\u00f1eca, Manuel is riding it, and his hat has fallen off. That's it. On to another book. This time it is Van Gogh's turn, and for Eva and Heriberto, the Dutchman's paintings are scenes from their land, of their being indigenous and campesinos. After this, Heriberto tells his mother that he spent the morning with the Sup. \"Reading grown-up books,\" says Heriberto, and believes that this earned him a free hand with a box of chocolate cookies. Eva is more farsighted, and asks me if I have a book about her doll with the little red bandanna. </p> <p> <strong> It Continues Raining Here</strong> </p> <p> September 8, 1998 </p> <p> I was with Pedrito one afternoon, both of us smoking (he a chocolate cigarette and I a pipe), when I wanted to be like Old Don Antonio, and so I began to lecture Pedrito (a Tojolabal and two years old) about life and other painful treasures. And I began to tell him: </p> <p>\"Look, Pedrito, there are things you need to know about when you grow up. Important things like tying your boots, doing up your shirt without missing any buttons, getting comfortable in the hammock, lighting the pipe with the pot mouth down, and other etceteras that you will be learning about. But now we are going to talk about when a man loves a woman.\" </p> <p>Pedrito was looking at me seriously, and he continued sucking on his chocolate cigarette. I suppose that I had then, as they say, \"captured\" his imagination, and I continued: \"Look, Pedrito, when a man loves a woman . . . because it's not the same as when a woman loves a man, or when a man loves another man, or when a woman loves another woman, because there is a bit of everything, and it's necessary to know and to understand it. Well, when a man loves a woman . . . well, it's not as easy to explain as, say, what you need to do so that you have no extra buttons when you've buttoned up your shirt, which can be a complicated thing if you don't pay attention. For example, I use a 'from the bottom up' technique, which, in addition to being a concept of political science, is very good for buttoning up. Look, you put on the shirt and look down to the bottom end of the shirt, seriously and with concentration.\" </p> <p>Pedrito frowned and looked at me seriously. </p> <p>\"Like that! Good, then you line up the lower edges of the shirt, the right at the same level as the left, which is not as simple as the 'centrists' in politics make it appear. Here, if you aren't careful, the left side could be higher, which wouldn't be an issue; however, the right side could be higher, in which case it would be very regrettable indeed. The balance is very important; they must be even. Then you have to look for the bottom button on the shirt, but the bottom button isn't always the last one. You should know this, Pedrito, there are some evil shirt manufacturers who put on an extra button (to replace a button if you lose one, they say) for the obvious purpose of making this indispensable garment difficult to button. Good, now that you've found the last button, keep on looking for the corresponding buttonhole (double-entendre fanciers, refrain), something that is more difficult to find than any reference to Chiapas in a Zedillo report. As you will learn later on, you'll never lack a ripped seam for a buttonhole. That could be, but what is certain is that there are more buttons than buttonholes, as you will see when you skip buttons. </p> <p>\"Certainly, there are other techniques for not missing buttons. There is, for example, the Sea's method, who puts on shirts as if they were T-shirts. That is, she does not undo the buttons. Ergo, there are no missing buttons. However, I do not recommend that technique because . . . Well, because the Sea and etceteras, and I was explaining to you that when a man loves a woman . . . So, you see now, Pedrito, that it is very difficult to explain how it is when a man loves a woman, but, nonetheless, it's very important to understand it, because . . .\" </p> <p>While I was explaining, Pedrito ate his cigarette. \"Cocate,\" he said to me, stretching out his hand, asking me in his dialect for more chocolates. \"There aren't any,\" I told him. He turned around and left. It's obvious that today's youth has no interest in important issues (sigh). Where was I? Ah, yes! When a man loves a woman . . . </p> <p> <strong> PS</strong> </p> <p>December 23, 1995 </p> <p> La to\u00f1ita arrives to show off her new teacup. Without warning, she comes out with - </p> <p>\"Love is like a teacup that every day falls to the ground and breaks to pieces. In the morning the pieces are gathered, and with a little wet and a little warmth, the pieces are glued together, and again there is a little teacup. He who is in love spends life fearing that the terrible day will come when the teacup is so broken that it can no longer be mended.\" </p> <p>She leaves just as she arrived, reiterating her refusal to give me a kiss, that now more than ever \"really prickles\". </p> <p> <strong> The Story Of The Live Person And The Dead Person</strong> </p> <p> October 23, 1996 </p> <p> Once there was a live person and a dead person. And the dead person said to the live person: </p> <p>\"My, I envy your restlessness.\" </p> <p>And then the live person said to the dead person: </p> <p>\"My, I envy your tranquillity.\" </p> <p>And there they were, envying each other, when, suddenly, a bean-brown horse went by at full gallop. </p> <p> Tan-tan. </p> <p>The moral of the story, I repeat, is that all final options are a trap. It's imperative to find the bean-brown horse. </p> <p> Don Durito of the Lacandon </p> <p> (Please send fan letters, requests for interviews, carnations, and signatures of support for the Anti-Big-Boots Beetle Society to Huapac Leaf #69, Mountains of the Mexican Southeast [on the side where the Sup lives]. Phone callers, please note: don't worry if the answering machine isn't on. I don't have one.) </p> <p><strong> The Tale Of The Little Seamstress</strong> </p> <p>September 3, 1997 </p> <p> Once upon a time, there was a little seamstress who sewed mightily on his sewing machine. The other machines in his neighbourhood laughed at him, and shouted: </p> <p>\"Fairy! Only old women are seamstresses!\" </p> <p>So the little seamstress sewed shut the mouths of everyone who made fun of him. That's why, to this day, we don't know how the story ended, because no one could tell it. </p> <p> Tan-tan </p> <p><strong> The Tale Of The Little Newsboy</strong> </p> <p> Once upon a time, there was a little newsboy who was very, very poor and he only sold old newspapers because he didn't have enough money for new ones. People didn't buy his newspapers because they were all so out of date, and they wanted new newspapers. So the little newsboy never sold any, and every day he accumulated more and more old newspapers. What the little newsboy did was put up a paper recycling plant, and he became a millionaire, bought out all the newspaper businesses and the news agencies, prohibited publishing current news, and thus obliged people to read only news of the past. In the papers on sale today, for example, you'd read that the Zapatistas are about to arrive in Mexico City and that they'll meet with the Villistas there. You can't quite make out the date, but it seems to be either 1914 or 1997. </p> <p>Tan-tan.</p>",

Opening remarks at the First Intercontinental Encuentro For Humanity and Against Neoliberalism, July 27, 1996 Chiapas, Mexico Brothers and sisters of Asia, Africa, Oceania, Europe and America, Welcome to the mountains of the Mexican Southeast. Let us introduce ourselves. We are the Zapatista National Liberation Army. For 10 years, we lived in these mountains, preparing to fight a war. In these mountains, we built an army. Below, in the cities and plantations, we did not exist. Our lives were worth less than those of machines or animals. We were like stones, like weeds in the road. We were silenced. We were faceless. We were nameless We had no future. We did not exist. For the powers that be, known internationally by the term \"neoliberalism\", we did not count, we did not produce, we did not buy, we did not sell. We were a cipher in the accounts of big capital. Then we went to the mountains to find ourselves and see if we could ease the pain of being forgotten like stones and weeds. Here, in the mountains of the Mexican Southeast, our dead live on. Our dead, who live in the mountains, know many things. They speak to us of their death, and we hear them. Coffins speak and tell us another story, that comes from yesterday and points to tomorrow. The mountains spoke to us, the Macehualob, we common and ordinary people. We are simple people, as Power tells us. The kaz-dzul , the false man, rules our lands and has giant war machines, like the boob, half-puma and half-horse, that spread pain and death among us. The trickster government sends us the aluxob , the liars who fool our people and make them forgetful. This is why we became soldiers. This is why we remain soldiers. Because we want no more death and trickery for our people, because we want no more forgetting. The mountain told us to take up arms so we would have a voice. It told us to cover our faces so we would have a face. It told us to forget our names so we could be named. It told us to protect our past so we would have a future. Brothers and sisters: We have invited you to this meeting to seek for and find yourselves and us. You have all touched our hearts, and you can see we are not special. You can see we are simple and ordinary men and women. You can see we are the rebellious mirror that wants to be a pane of glass and break. You can see we are who we are so we can stop being who we are to become the you, who we are. We are the Zapatistas.

After this, Heriberto tells his mother that he spent the morning with the Sup. \"Reading grown-up books,\" says Heriberto, and believes that this earned him a free hand with a box of chocolate cookies. Eva is more farsighted, and asks me if I have a book about her doll with the little red bandanna. It Continues Raining Here September 8, 1998 I was with Pedrito one afternoon, both of us smoking (he a chocolate cigarette and I a pipe), when I wanted to be like Old Don Antonio, and so I began to lecture Pedrito (a Tojolabal and two years old) about life and other painful treasures. And I began to tell him: \"Look, Pedrito, there are things you need to know about when you grow up. Important things like tying your boots, doing up your shirt without missing any buttons, getting comfortable in the hammock, lighting the pipe with the pot mouth down, and other etceteras that you will be learning about. But now we are going to talk about when a man loves a woman.\" Pedrito was looking at me seriously, and he continued sucking on his chocolate cigarette. I suppose that I had then, as they say, \"captured\" his imagination, and I continued: \"Look, Pedrito, when a man loves a woman . . . because it's not the same as when a woman loves a man, or when a man loves another man, or when a woman loves another woman, because there is a bit of everything, and it's necessary to know and to understand it. Well, when a man loves a woman . . . well, it's not as easy to explain as, say, what you need to do so that you have no extra buttons when you've buttoned up your shirt, which can be a complicated thing if you don't pay attention. For example, I use a 'from the bottom up' technique, which, in addition to being a concept of political science, is very good for buttoning up. Look, you put on the shirt and look down to the bottom end of the shirt, seriously and with concentration.\" Pedrito frowned and looked at me seriously. \"Like that! Good, then you line up the lower edges of the shirt, the right at the same level as the left, which is not as simple as the 'centrists' in politics make it appear. Here, if you aren't careful, the left side could be higher, which wouldn't be an issue; however, the right side could be higher, in which case it would be very regrettable indeed. The balance is very important; they must be even. Then you have to look for the bottom button on the shirt, but the bottom button isn't always the last one. You should know this, Pedrito, there are some evil shirt manufacturers who put on an extra button (to replace a button if you lose one, they say) for the obvious purpose of making this indispensable garment difficult to button. Good, now that you've found the last button, keep on looking for the corresponding buttonhole (double-entendre fanciers, refrain), something that is more difficult to find than any reference to Chiapas in a Zedillo report. As you will learn later on, you'll never lack a ripped seam for a buttonhole. That could be, but what is certain is that there are more buttons than buttonholes, as you will see when you skip buttons. \"Certainly, there are other techniques for not missing buttons. There is, for example, the Sea's method, who puts on shirts as if they were T-shirts. That is, she does not undo the buttons. Ergo, there are no missing buttons. However, I do not recommend that technique because . . . Well, because the Sea and etceteras, and I was explaining to you that when a man loves a woman . . . So, you see now, Pedrito, that it is very difficult to explain how it is when a man loves a woman, but, nonetheless, it's very important to understand it, because . . .\" While I was explaining, Pedrito ate his cigarette. \"Cocate,\" he said to me, stretching out his hand, asking me in his dialect for more chocolates. \"There aren't any,\" I told him. He turned around and left. It's obvious that today's youth has no interest in important issues (sigh). Where was I? Ah, yes! When a man loves a woman . . . PS December 23, 1995 La to\u00f1ita arrives to show off her new teacup. Without warning, she comes out with - \"Love is like a teacup that every day falls to the ground and breaks to pieces. In the morning the pieces are gathered, and with a little wet and a little warmth, the pieces are glued together, and again there is a little teacup. He who is in love spends life fearing that the terrible day will come when the teacup is so broken that it can no longer be mended.\" She leaves just as she arrived, reiterating her refusal to give me a kiss, that now more than ever \"really prickles\". The Story Of The Live Person And The Dead Person October 23, 1996 Once there was a live person and a dead person. And the dead person said to the live person: \"My, I envy your restlessness.\" And then the live person said to the dead person: \"My, I envy your tranquillity.\" And there they were, envying each other, when, suddenly, a bean-brown horse went by at full gallop. Tan-tan. The moral of the story, I repeat, is that all final options are a trap. It's imperative to find the bean-brown horse. Don Durito of the Lacandon (Please send fan letters, requests for interviews, carnations, and signatures of support for the Anti-Big-Boots Beetle Society to Huapac Leaf #69, Mountains of the Mexican Southeast [on the side where the Sup lives]. Phone callers, please note: don't worry if the answering machine isn't on. I don't have one.) The Tale Of The Little Seamstress September 3, 1997 Once upon a time, there was a little seamstress who sewed mightily on his sewing machine. The other machines in his neighbourhood laughed at him, and shouted: \"Fairy! Only old women are seamstresses!\" So the little seamstress sewed shut the mouths of everyone who made fun of him. That's why, to this day, we don't know how the story ended, because no one could tell it. Tan-tan The Tale Of The Little Newsboy Once upon a time, there was a little newsboy who was very, very poor and he only sold old newspapers because he didn't have enough money for new ones. People didn't buy his newspapers because they were all so out of date, and they wanted new newspapers. So the little newsboy never sold any, and every day he accumulated more and more old newspapers. What the little newsboy did was put up a paper recycling plant, and he became a millionaire, bought out all the newspaper businesses and the news agencies, prohibited publishing current news, and thus obliged people to read only news of the past. In the papers on sale today, for example, you'd read that the Zapatistas are about to arrive in Mexico City and that they'll meet with the Villistas there. You can't quite make out the date, but it seems to be either 1914 or 1997. Tan-tan.",

      "body": "<p>Jail was going to get me over my fear of saying the obvious, because there was no way to ignore all morning the fact that everyone in the cell was either black or Hispanic. The irony, for me, was that an all-black gathering usually meant a special event, a stirring occasion. I thought back to some black guys I used to know who enjoyed telling me that black guys like me ought to hang out with black groups like theirs. It flattered me to believe that I flattered them with my yearning for instruction in the art of how to be down with it. But this was not what they had in mind. The mood in the cell was like that of an emergency room in a city hospital: a mixture of squalor, panic, boredom, and resentment at the supposed randomness of bad luck. </p> <p>Some guys, the Rasta youth among them, had elected to slip down on to the concrete floor. They were opting out of consciousness. Our cell had no television, no radio, no newspapers. There was a water fountain, a disgusting toilet, and two pay phones from which collect calls could be made. I don't know how those guys knew when the corrections officers had their backs turned, or how they'd held on to the contraband of drugs and matches they'd been thoroughly searched for, or how they knew who in which cell had what, but at one moment, as if by some secret signal, paraphernalia went flying through green bars from cell to cell. The next thing I knew, guys were taking turns smoking crack behind the waist-high partition of the raised open toilet. I'd switched seats and, as a result, was too near the burning funk. I saw my Hispanic comrade casually walk away from the hot spot, and soon I, too, got up and crossed the cell. His look of approval after I'd eased in somewhere else told me that I'd made the right move. </p> <p>A black guy with broken teeth, dressed in a torn car coat, emerged from behind the toilet. He ambled around and then seized the floor. \"You remember Lucky Lou Diamond? I had twenty thousand dollar over to Jersey City.\" I tuned in, eager for a jailhouse Richard Pryor who could turn the cell into something else. \"Nineteen- seventy-five? Bunny hat on my head? Your honour. There's no mouth on the girl he touched.\" His free association promised much, but it gutter-balled into such incoherence that the black youth with break braids spoke for everyone when he barked, \"Sit down.\" </p> <p>It was quiet for a while, but then the Rasta youth snapped to attention. Something jerked him to his feet and set him standing squarely in front of the cell door, his right knee pounding out a steady rhythm. I thought: just when things were manageable, my brother in Selassie has to flip out. I braced myself for his rap. But he was ready for his lunch. He was first in the line we were commanded to make; first to march out of the cell towards stacks of chalk-coloured squares on long, low trolleys that looked like what bricks are transported on at a building site. We were to pick up a sandwich, turn, take a plastic cup of grape juice from another low trolley, and then march back to the cell. </p> <p>A black guy in an orange jumpsuit - a trusty - called after me to let me know that I'd missed my allotted sandwich. Something about being urged to march rendered me unable to lift anything other than a cup of juice. Very soon the cell was strewn with sandwich remnants. Leaking sachets of mustard and mayonnaise found their way under the bench. A wedge of cheese crowned one of the pay phones. Lunch added to the odours of incarceration. However, there was still plenty of room, because some of the men whose size so alarmed me when I first entered the cell had dived to the floor. I counted nine guys asleep in the grime, six of them in the foetal position, their wrists between their knees. Heads had to loll down some broad shoulders before they could touch concrete. A young, crack-thin guy woke and, using his palms for locomotion, crawled along on his stomach to the trash can, where he reached up to extract sandwich remains. </p> <p>I overheard some of the guys say a little while later that the police had arrested so many people in the sweep of the previous evening that two special night courts had been set up to process the haul. They would start to call names at four o'clock. Waiting might have been easier if there were no clock. At the appointed hour, the only official movement came from the black corrections officer who'd flipped out that morning. I'm sorry to report that he went through all the transparent manoeuvres of rubbing it in. He paraded by us on his way back to the oblong station desk, ostensibly laughing at himself for forgetting something. And just in case the black youth with break braids was pretending to take no notice of him, the corrections officer brought over a white officer holding a clipboard and pointed at the youth. His colleague tapped him a Have-a-good-night. \"I told you when you got here not to give me problems.\" The black youth looked toward the bars at last, his arms hugging his chest. The black corrections officer flicked a salute. </p> <p> <strong> <sup>'</sup>Y </strong> o, Pops,\" I heard the black youth say once the air had calmed down again around us. \"Pops,\" he called again in my direction. I couldn't believe he was talking to me. Pops? Everybody in the cell who spoke to someone he didn't know said, \"Yo, G.\" I pointed to myself. Who, me? \"Mind me asking what you're in for?\" I made a smoking gesture with two fingers of my right hand. \"Uh-huh. You dress Italian. But.\" A neighbour of his wanted to give him five for that observation, but he just looked at him hard. It was true. The soundtrack of brotherhood in my head was nearly all Marvin Gaye. It had finally happened: I was older than a cartoon father on television. I was older than Homer Simpson. </p> <p>I wasn't sure if Old Four Eyes in the Robert Hayden poem fled to \"danger in the safety zones\" or to \"safety in the danger zones\". It was important to me, sitting there in my concrete elsewhere, which seemed dirtier and dimmer the longer I had to wait. </p> <p>As the cell emptied, it got eerier. The few new guys, dressed in their garrulous night selves, were out of sympathy with the general tone of exhaustion and passivity. One new guy ranted about calling his girlfriend to tell her to hook up a plane to Canada, because after he made bail, he was going to step off, boy. Another, the lone white, clung to a pay phone. He suggested to a friend that they deceive his brother-in-law. \"Don't tell him it's for me.\" He could press telephone numbers with amazing speed. He insisted to the next friend that she had to get her bail money out of her mother, because he could not, he said, shooting his eyes across us, the non-white, do Riker's. </p> <p>My name was called, the cell door gapped open, and I floated out. Neither my Hispanic comrade nor the Rasta youth followed. I regretted that I would not have the chance to thank the man who'd watched my back. Very soon I found myself upstairs in a new cell that had an iron-lattice screen. Beyond it was the outside world. I heard the voices of what I supposed were women corrections officers, and then over the walls I heard Billie and Rona in their interview cells. They heard me, we heard one another. The public defender on the free person's side of the barrier was a heavy-set white woman. She went from cubicle to cubicle, guiding us toward a plea: adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, or ACD. If we didn't get picked up for the same offence within a 12-month period, then the charge would be dropped. ACD. </p> <p>I told the PD that I'd used the pay phones. I knew that that afternoon a friend of mine had come zooming down with news-papers and a criminal lawyer and had been denied access. She said they were entitled to hold us for 24 hours before they had to do anything with us. I said that being in custody was the punishment. I said prosecution of so-called quality-of-life crimes was a form of harassment. She explained that under the circumstances they didn't have to read us our rights. I was about to compare such offences to civil disobedience, but the last thing this calm and capable PD was interested in was anybody's vanity. She said that high arrest figures justified the large increase in the number of police on the streets. It was that simple. </p> <p>In the courtroom, I felt as though we were guest speakers at a high school, the offenders with us behind the court recorder looked so tadpole, so young. We stood when the judge entered. \"He's not that kind of judge,\" a black bailiff said. Maybe because I was minutes and a plea away from getting out, tenderness got the better of me. I thought of my older sister and her practice in defence of juvenile defenders valiantly conducted from files in shopping bags in the trunk of her car. Our case was called, and we sat some rows back from the attorneys' desks, where we were unable to hear the grim PD, even if we could have concentrated enough. </p> <p>God bless the old-hippie souls who still believed in public life and social responsibility, I thought, but the PD had no time for effusive thanks. I'd been so hypnotised by green bars that the marble floor outside the courtroom was dazzling. The white clerks behind the counter in a payment-and-records office were accustomed to a stressed-out public and were rude back. Down in the lobby, Rona and Billie ran for the door marked \"Women\". I rushed over to a rickety booth for my fix of those former slave crops - tobacco, sugar, coffee. </p> <p>Perhaps our elation on Rona's rooftop was unearned, but we felt like released hostages. We made jokes as soon as we had an audience of friends. Even the squalid bits, when told the right way, got laughs. Maybe we were defending ourselves against our deeper reactions to what had happened to us. Rona's husband said that now his little boy was old enough to play in the street he had had to tell him what to do should the police ever stop him. Don't move; do exactly what they say; take no chances; give no lip. We wondered how popular these sweeps would be after some more white people had been caught in the net. </p> <p>We'd been abruptly deprived of our liberty, and that would always make for a chilling memory. And as I'd learned sitting in the cell with all those guys whose stories I didn't know and couldn't ask for: the system exists, the system - for the non-white youth, the poor - is real. New arrest records had been created, but we were out, and friends were standing in wreaths of smoke, savouring the night view of fire escapes, water tanks, and lights in distant windows. Six days after my release, I was back on the Lower East Side. I understood what Rona meant when she said that she fell in love with New York the day she realised that she could get a candy bar on every corner. But jail worked, it won. I thought, I'm not doing that again. The romance was over. For me, the changes in the streets went with everything else. Once upon a time, people moved to New York and thought it perfectly OK to remain themselves. Goodbye, Frank O'Hara.</p> <p> \"Yo, Papi,\" I heard. I was astonished. It was my Hispanic comrade. They'd given him five days on Riker's Island for possession of a crack pipe. He was selling vinyl records on the sidewalk before he got moved off that bit of Second Avenue. Could I help him out? It would be my privilege. He said he remembered what the black youth with break braids had said when they took him out of that cell in the Tombs. \"Kidnapped by the mayor, y'all.\"</p>",

I said prosecution of so-called quality-of-life crimes was a form of harassment. She explained that under the circumstances they didn't have to read us our rights. I was about to compare such offences to civil disobedience, but the last thing this calm and capable PD was interested in was anybody's vanity. She said that high arrest figures justified the large increase in the number of police on the streets. It was that simple. In the courtroom, I felt as though we were guest speakers at a high school, the offenders with us behind the court recorder looked so tadpole, so young. We stood when the judge entered. \"He's not that kind of judge,\" a black bailiff said. Maybe because I was minutes and a plea away from getting out, tenderness got the better of me. I thought of my older sister and her practice in defence of juvenile defenders valiantly conducted from files in shopping bags in the trunk of her car. Our case was called, and we sat some rows back from the attorneys' desks, where we were unable to hear the grim PD, even if we could have concentrated enough. God bless the old-hippie souls who still believed in public life and social responsibility, I thought, but the PD had no time for effusive thanks. I'd been so hypnotised by green bars that the marble floor outside the courtroom was dazzling. The white clerks behind the counter in a payment-and-records office were accustomed to a stressed-out public and were rude back. Down in the lobby, Rona and Billie ran for the door marked \"Women\". I rushed over to a rickety booth for my fix of those former slave crops - tobacco, sugar, coffee. Perhaps our elation on Rona's rooftop was unearned, but we felt like released hostages. We made jokes as soon as we had an audience of friends. Even the squalid bits, when told the right way, got laughs. Maybe we were defending ourselves against our deeper reactions to what had happened to us. Rona's husband said that now his little boy was old enough to play in the street he had had to tell him what to do should the police ever stop him. Don't move; do exactly what they say; take no chances; give no lip. We wondered how popular these sweeps would be after some more white people had been caught in the net. We'd been abruptly deprived of our liberty, and that would always make for a chilling memory. And as I'd learned sitting in the cell with all those guys whose stories I didn't know and couldn't ask for: the system exists, the system - for the non-white youth, the poor - is real. New arrest records had been created, but we were out, and friends were standing in wreaths of smoke, savouring the night view of fire escapes, water tanks, and lights in distant windows. Six days after my release, I was back on the Lower East Side. I understood what Rona meant when she said that she fell in love with New York the day she realised that she could get a candy bar on every corner. But jail worked, it won. I thought, I'm not doing that again. The romance was over. For me, the changes in the streets went with everything else. Once upon a time, people moved to New York and thought it perfectly OK to remain themselves. Goodbye, Frank O'Hara. \"Yo, Papi,\" I heard. I was astonished. It was my Hispanic comrade. They'd given him five days on Riker's Island for possession of a crack pipe. He was selling vinyl records on the sidewalk before he got moved off that bit of Second Avenue. Could I help him out? It would be my privilege. He said he remembered what the black youth with break braids had said when they took him out of that cell in the Tombs. \"Kidnapped by the mayor, y'all.\"",

      "body": "<p>In Edward Marriott's debut book, The Lost Tribe , he ventured to a remote jungle in Papua New Guinea, where he was accused of being responsible for a fatal lightning strike and had to flee for his life. In his second book, Wild Shore: Life and Death with Nicaragua's Last Shark Hunters , published in paperback this month, he finds himself in the squalid and menacing world of bull-shark fishermen in Nicaragua. It is daring stuff, stylishly written, with as sharp an eye on the history of these places as on their geography. One critic said that Marriott \"plays his role as the linen-clad Brit in the jungle with superb nonchalance\", but despite all this he claims: \"The truth of it is, I don't really have a huge wanderlust.\" </p> <p>He says he suffers from homesickness, and that the demands of his young family - his wife was pregnant with their now three-year-old son while he was in Nicaragua - mean he won't travel so much in the future. \"My first book did turn into a dangerous expedition, but I didn't intend that,\" he recalls. \"I'm really more interested in the story than the location. I nearly wrote a book about a vicar in Norfolk. There was this huge schism in his parish and it's not exaggerating too much to say there was a war going on. It was an excellent story, full of interesting, rich characters.\" </p> <p>But while he adds to his parochial credentials by declaring that he always went to Scotland on holidays as a child and that his first trip abroad was on a French exchange at the age of 15, he also acknowledges that he finds it easier to describe places that are very rough and off the beaten track. \"I do find they get my juices flowing more.\" It was a news story about the lost tribe in Papua New Guinea that first attracted his attention. \"I had a cousin who lived there, so I went on a little recce. It wasn't that I wanted to go into the heart of darkness and all those other clich\u00e9s.

      "bodyText": "In Edward Marriott's debut book, The Lost Tribe , he ventured to a remote jungle in Papua New Guinea, where he was accused of being responsible for a fatal lightning strike and had to flee for his life. In his second book, Wild Shore: Life and Death with Nicaragua's Last Shark Hunters , published in paperback this month, he finds himself in the squalid and menacing world of bull-shark fishermen in Nicaragua. It is daring stuff, stylishly written, with as sharp an eye on the history of these places as on their geography. One critic said that Marriott \"plays his role as the linen-clad Brit in the jungle with superb nonchalance\", but despite all this he claims: \"The truth of it is, I don't really have a huge wanderlust.\" He says he suffers from homesickness, and that the demands of his young family - his wife was pregnant with their now three-year-old son while he was in Nicaragua - mean he won't travel so much in the future. \"My first book did turn into a dangerous expedition, but I didn't intend that,\" he recalls. \"I'm really more interested in the story than the location. I nearly wrote a book about a vicar in Norfolk. There was this huge schism in his parish and it's not exaggerating too much to say there was a war going on. It was an excellent story, full of interesting, rich characters.\" But while he adds to his parochial credentials by declaring that he always went to Scotland on holidays as a child and that his first trip abroad was on a French exchange at the age of 15, he also acknowledges that he finds it easier to describe places that are very rough and off the beaten track. \"I do find they get my juices flowing more.\" It was a news story about the lost tribe in Papua New Guinea that first attracted his attention. \"I had a cousin who lived there, so I went on a little recce. It wasn't that I wanted to go into the heart of darkness and all those other clich\u00e9s. But having been there, it was such an interesting country and quite unlike anything I had known before.\" He admits that as the situation worsened, his journalistic and survival instincts came into conflict. \"I jotted down some impressions in my notebook, but I had no idea how I could make them into a book.

      "body": "<p><strong> Ways of Hearing: A User's Guide to the Pop Psyche, from Elvis to Eminem</strong> <br>Ben Thompson <br>327pp, Orion, \u00a314.99 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000303067,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br></p> <p> In an exchange from a radio interview reproduced here, American hip-hop artist KRS-1 says that the word on the Brixton streets is that his interviewer, Tim Westwood, is uncool. Westwood, a white man in a predominantly black milieu, knows something about how to anticipate and possibly deal with slurs on his professionalism, and asks KRS-1 when he was last in the UK. The factually accurate answer to this question is \"six years ago\", but what KRS-1 chooses to say instead is: \"I'm always here.\" </p> <p>Ben Thompson glosses this with the stage direction: \"An awkward silence as the awesome bogosity of these words sinks in.\" I cite this not as an example of Thompson's confidence with his subject, but as a good use of the word \"bogosity\", which also appeared in his last collection of writings on pop music, Seven Years of Plenty . There - and I don't even have to look this up, although I read the book nearly two-and-a-half years ago - he refers to the \"inherent bogosity of MTV's Unplugged \", that part of the rock channel's schedule devoted to performers playing acoustic versions of their songs. (Or \"acoustical\", the term contemptuously coined by Colin B Morton and Chuck Death in their sublimely twisted cartoon history of rock'n'roll, Great Pop Things , which has a similar subtitle to that of Ways of Hearing . Unamplified music is simply not pop, rock or anything that the young of heart need bother with.) </p> <p>The question of bogosity underlies almost all critical thinking - both public and private - about pop music. Is so-and-so fake? And if so, in what way, precisely? Thompson, in a hilarious piece on Beavis and Butthead , says that \"their division of all artistic phenomena into two categories - 'stuff which is cool' and 'stuff which sucks' - bespeaks an evaluative aesthetic of inspirational directness\". The joke lies in the use of language that would fly high over B &amp; B's heads; but is there not, too, a note of wistfulness at their ease in making snap judgments? Punk rockers chose to tackle that particular argument by declaring that pretty much everything, punk itself possibly included, was bogus; at least they were frank about it. But it's a circular accusation that backfires on the accuser: the word \"bogosity\" is, in itself, bogus. That's why it's so much fun to use it. And it also hints at the essence of the pop performer, who has necessarily reinvented him- or herself to an extraordinary degree. </p> <p>This notion of pop music as a matter of reinvention is the key to this book - not that it is exactly locked. It is, after all, a collection of pieces, many of which have been published previously: interviews with bands and stars from Air to Neil Young, their alphabetical arrangement here emphasising the randomness of the commissions (unless Thompson really wanted to have an interview with Eminem, and no one else, precede his interview with Brian Eno). It also offers amusing digressions and expanded versions of sleevenotes. </p> <p>You can dip into it anywhere and take great pleasure from Thompson's wit and artfully constructed sentences, which at times have all the earthly grace and snap of a beautifully modulated chord change: \"The most cherished image of a memorable evening is the hulking figure of [Einst\u00fcrzende] Neubauten's mighty human talisman FM Einheit, advancing into the crowd in his blacksmith's apron brandishing a fully operational chainsaw. This action - long before the Archaos circus had made such antics a cabaret staple - sends the leather-clad cream of London's counterculture scurrying to the back of the hall, their faces struggling to convey the message: 'I just want to get a look at this from another perspective.'\" </p> <p>But even here, in this paragraph chosen more or less at random, you can see another skirmish in pop's battle between bogosity and sincerity: the above gig took place at the ICA, which over the years has trodden a very fine and wavering course in the mined borderlands between art, pop and outright pretension. </p> <p>Which is almost what Ways of Hearing does, too. Its title is a deliberate nod to John Berger's Ways of Seeing , a book Thompson found \"forbidding and arid\". But he liked the idea of pinching and adapting the title, \"thereby doing for music what you might imagine John Berger's Ways of Seeing did for the visual image, if you hadn't actually read it\". The paragraph then rapidly tumbles through the following positions: an apology to John Berger, an apology-cum-justification to the reader for being so cheeky, and a perfectly gratuitous swipe at Jools Holland or, more specifically, \"the plinky-plunk totalitarianism of Jools Holland's turn-of-the-century TV persona\". (Not exactly the words I'd have chosen, but they still attest to something that needs to be said.) </p> <p>Thompson uses puckishly flamboyant prose for a subject that, as he quotes Hanif Kureishi, is \"crying out not to be written about\". He raps Kureishi over the knuckles for saying this, particularly as it occurs in his introduction to the Faber Book of Pop , but, as with bogus words like bogosity, part of the thrill of writing so eloquently about pop, as Thompson emphatically does, is that it is transgressive in itself. This is why he persists in the technique, also used in Seven Years of Plenty , of the comedy index (not that his interviewees are incapable of speaking with surprising complexity and intelligence when the mood so takes them). </p> <p>And as Thompson himself is fully aware, those searching for unsullied purity in the form are looking in the wrong place. As he says in his introduction, even such notionally cut-and-dried issues as the blackness or whiteness of one's skin begin to look ambiguous in pop music's supercharged atmosphere of re-creation and adulation: look at Mick Jagger, whom many have accused of appropriating blackness, in his voice and music if nothing else. Or think of \"another, still more famous MJ\", Michael Jackson, whose \"terrible saga\" is a kind of \"minstrelsy in reverse\". </p> <p>Not that Thompson belabours the more serious points. He doesn't have to: his feel for the subject means that even bite-sized snippets dealing with wildly disparate artists reveal the same evaluative aesthetic at work. His critical ear is almost infallibly trustworthy; his writing, which both dances round the point and then gets straight to it, is a delight. When he writes that our ears \"wax up protectively\" when exposed to the worst excesses of one particular band, you can see both of these attributes in action. It is wit, in its 18th-century sense: an acuity of judgment that makes you laugh.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ways of Hearing: A User's Guide to the Pop Psyche, from Elvis to Eminem Ben Thompson 327pp, Orion, \u00a314.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL In an exchange from a radio interview reproduced here, American hip-hop artist KRS-1 says that the word on the Brixton streets is that his interviewer, Tim Westwood, is uncool. Westwood, a white man in a predominantly black milieu, knows something about how to anticipate and possibly deal with slurs on his professionalism, and asks KRS-1 when he was last in the UK. The factually accurate answer to this question is \"six years ago\", but what KRS-1 chooses to say instead is: \"I'm always here.\" Ben Thompson glosses this with the stage direction: \"An awkward silence as the awesome bogosity of these words sinks in.\" I cite this not as an example of Thompson's confidence with his subject, but as a good use of the word \"bogosity\", which also appeared in his last collection of writings on pop music, Seven Years of Plenty . There - and I don't even have to look this up, although I read the book nearly two-and-a-half years ago - he refers to the \"inherent bogosity of MTV's Unplugged \", that part of the rock channel's schedule devoted to performers playing acoustic versions of their songs. (Or \"acoustical\", the term contemptuously coined by Colin B Morton and Chuck Death in their sublimely twisted cartoon history of rock'n'roll, Great Pop Things , which has a similar subtitle to that of Ways of Hearing . Unamplified music is simply not pop, rock or anything that the young of heart need bother with.) The question of bogosity underlies almost all critical thinking - both public and private - about pop music. Is so-and-so fake? And if so, in what way, precisely? Thompson, in a hilarious piece on Beavis and Butthead , says that \"their division of all artistic phenomena into two categories - 'stuff which is cool' and 'stuff which sucks' - bespeaks an evaluative aesthetic of inspirational directness\". The joke lies in the use of language that would fly high over B &amp; B's heads; but is there not, too, a note of wistfulness at their ease in making snap judgments? Punk rockers chose to tackle that particular argument by declaring that pretty much everything, punk itself possibly included, was bogus; at least they were frank about it. But it's a circular accusation that backfires on the accuser: the word \"bogosity\" is, in itself, bogus. That's why it's so much fun to use it. And it also hints at the essence of the pop performer, who has necessarily reinvented him- or herself to an extraordinary degree. This notion of pop music as a matter of reinvention is the key to this book - not that it is exactly locked. It is, after all, a collection of pieces, many of which have been published previously: interviews with bands and stars from Air to Neil Young, their alphabetical arrangement here emphasising the randomness of the commissions (unless Thompson really wanted to have an interview with Eminem, and no one else, precede his interview with Brian Eno). It also offers amusing digressions and expanded versions of sleevenotes. You can dip into it anywhere and take great pleasure from Thompson's wit and artfully constructed sentences, which at times have all the earthly grace and snap of a beautifully modulated chord change: \"The most cherished image of a memorable evening is the hulking figure of [Einst\u00fcrzende] Neubauten's mighty human talisman FM Einheit, advancing into the crowd in his blacksmith's apron brandishing a fully operational chainsaw. This action - long before the Archaos circus had made such antics a cabaret staple - sends the leather-clad cream of London's counterculture scurrying to the back of the hall, their faces struggling to convey the message: 'I just want to get a look at this from another perspective.'\" But even here, in this paragraph chosen more or less at random, you can see another skirmish in pop's battle between bogosity and sincerity: the above gig took place at the ICA, which over the years has trodden a very fine and wavering course in the mined borderlands between art, pop and outright pretension. Which is almost what Ways of Hearing does, too. Its title is a deliberate nod to John Berger's Ways of Seeing , a book Thompson found \"forbidding and arid\". But he liked the idea of pinching and adapting the title, \"thereby doing for music what you might imagine John Berger's Ways of Seeing did for the visual image, if you hadn't actually read it\". The paragraph then rapidly tumbles through the following positions: an apology to John Berger, an apology-cum-justification to the reader for being so cheeky, and a perfectly gratuitous swipe at Jools Holland or, more specifically, \"the plinky-plunk totalitarianism of Jools Holland's turn-of-the-century TV persona\". (Not exactly the words I'd have chosen, but they still attest to something that needs to be said.) Thompson uses puckishly flamboyant prose for a subject that, as he quotes Hanif Kureishi, is \"crying out not to be written about\". He raps Kureishi over the knuckles for saying this, particularly as it occurs in his introduction to the Faber Book of Pop , but, as with bogus words like bogosity, part of the thrill of writing so eloquently about pop, as Thompson emphatically does, is that it is transgressive in itself. This is why he persists in the technique, also used in Seven Years of Plenty , of the comedy index (not that his interviewees are incapable of speaking with surprising complexity and intelligence when the mood so takes them). And as Thompson himself is fully aware, those searching for unsullied purity in the form are looking in the wrong place. As he says in his introduction, even such notionally cut-and-dried issues as the blackness or whiteness of one's skin begin to look ambiguous in pop music's supercharged atmosphere of re-creation and adulation: look at Mick Jagger, whom many have accused of appropriating blackness, in his voice and music if nothing else. Or think of \"another, still more famous MJ\", Michael Jackson, whose \"terrible saga\" is a kind of \"minstrelsy in reverse\". Not that Thompson belabours the more serious points. He doesn't have to: his feel for the subject means that even bite-sized snippets dealing with wildly disparate artists reveal the same evaluative aesthetic at work. His critical ear is almost infallibly trustworthy; his writing, which both dances round the point and then gets straight to it, is a delight. When he writes that our ears \"wax up protectively\" when exposed to the worst excesses of one particular band, you can see both of these attributes in action. It is wit, in its 18th-century sense: an acuity of judgment that makes you laugh.",

Did Martin Bormann, Hitler's secretary, live to a ripe old age somewhere in South America? Are we sure it was the F\u00fchrer's corpse that was burned by aides in the courtyard of the Reich Chancellory as the Red Army stormed Berlin in May 1945? And what about Himmler? Is it just possible that the scrawny middle-aged man in glasses who committed suicide at the British camp at Luneburg after capture that same month was in fact a stand-in for the feared SS Reichsf\u00fchrer? That Himmler himself - who as late as May 5 had claimed that he, for one, \"would never commit suicide\" - had somehow slipped out of the Fatherland and set out on some not-so-vainglorious quest to set up a secret Fourth Reich? </p> <p>Well, maybe. Possibly. Perhaps. Anything is possible, after all, in the breathless aftermath of world war. Certain physical details of the dead man at L\u00fcneburg do seem different from Himmler's: you can see them in the studious photos reproduced in this book. One nostril is larger than the other, whereas Himmler's were symmetrical. The corpse doesn't appear to sport a duelling scar, which means that unless the dead man was wearing make-up (popular among senior Nazis), he wasn't the son born to Anna and Dr Gebhard Himmler on October 7 1900. </p> <p>Hugh Thomas is \"a surgeon and forensic expert of international repute\", says the blurb to this dense, fascinating yet ultimately bothersome book. \"His first book, The Murder of Rudolf Hess , caused a worldwide furore. His second, Hess: A Tale of Two Murders , precipitated a six-month Scotland Yard inquiry that saw its report immediately suppressed.\" Thomas does have a scalpel-sharp eye for detail - as you would hope of a man of his profession. He also writes well when he allows himself to get beyond the weight of the obsessive detail that bogs parts of this book down like one of Panzer General Guderian's tanks attempting to advance on Moscow in December 1941. It was Guderian who commented that Himmler was \"a man from another planet\". </p> <p>The central thesis of Thomas's book - and the evidence for it is vivid - is that Himmler was attempting to set up a Fourth Reich outside the boundaries of Hitler's Germany. Quite aware that Germany had effectively lost the war as early as 1943, Thomas's Himmler set about channelling the Croesan riches amassed by the SS and pro-Nazi German finance and industry into Swiss and South American bank accounts. An FBI/OSS report of November 1944, written by Senator Harley M Kilgore and backed by the US Treasury and State departments, noted: \"The German aggressors have begun to pursue the strategy which they found successful a quarter of a century ago. They are already deploying their economic wares throughout the world in preparation for a third attempt at world domination.\" Which, of course, appeared to happen from the 1950s, when the Federal Republic's \"economic miracle\" astounded the nations that had borne the brunt of the fighting against Hitler, Himmler and the rest of their vile crew. </p> <p>Thomas piles up a massively detailed case suggesting that Nazi money exported to safe financial havens in the late stages of the second world war was, to a previously underplayed extent, responsible for Germany's rise to economic power in the decade following Hitler's downfall. Well, maybe. Perhaps. Possibly. To his credit, Thomas uses these defusing words frequently in a book that might otherwise overstretch the imagination and, in turn, credit Himmler with too much intelligence and insight. </p> <p>His portrait of Himmler is, in fact, the best part of SS-1 , which suffers from being three books in one. There's an excellent mini-biography of Himmler, a Byzantine analysis of the links between Nazi and international finance during the war, and a forensic examination of the corpse that may or may not have been that of the Reichsf\u00fchrer. </p> <p>The description of Himmler's childhood and youth is compelling. This \"man of quiet, unemotional gestures, a man without words\" was fastidious and possessed of a phenomenal memory; he kept a daily diary recording everything that happened to him. He put these skills to chilling use when he began to wipe out Europe's Jews and gypsies, communists and homosexuals. Everything the SS did was planned and recorded fastidiously. No one escaped the Reichsf\u00fchrer's eyes, beady behind those infamous rimless glasses. Everyone needed to be watched, especially Paula Stolzle, his elder brother's pretty and flirtatious fianc\u00e9e. Disapproving of sexy women, shortly before he joined the Nazi party the puritanical young Himmler employed a private detective to follow Stolzle; he made the couple's lives so fraught that the engagement was called off. </p> <p>Himmler went on to become a lot creepier and a lot more dangerous, although he did marry, losing his virginity at the age of 28 to a nurse seven years his senior who thought those rimless glasses - she persuaded him to wear them - rather fetching. It's just this sort of near-forensic detail that makes Thomas's book worthwhile. Quick as a blitzkrieg, this bloodless young man is Reichsf\u00fchrer SS (in 1929, aged 28). The title SS-1 refers to Himmler's position as head of the Schutz Staffel; it was also the licence plate of his BMW staff car. According to Josef Goebbels, \"except for Hitler, no one is entirely without fear of Himmler\". </p> <p>No one? German business certainly appears to have gone along with him. So too did business interests in Washington, London and Zurich. If there had been some shady Allied agreement to allow Himmler to escape the wrath of the Nuremberg trials and set up shop elsewhere while pretending that he had committed suicide, then it had surely been abandoned by May 1945. Himmler, the SS and German big business may well have been in cahoots with elements in Wall Street and the City of London; Britain's royal family, with its shareholding in German companies, was also that bit too close to him (Prince Christopher Mountbatten, says Thomas, was on Himmler's staff). Yet ultimately the SS Reichsf\u00fchrer was surely too ghastly to be acceptable to the international business and banking community. </p> <p>It's true that the British dug up the corpse for reidentification, and it's true that several members of British intelligence, Kim Philby among them, were not immediately convinced that Himmler was dead. Yet if he weren't, we would surely have heard something about it by now. Wouldn't we?</p>",

The description of Himmler's childhood and youth is compelling. This \"man of quiet, unemotional gestures, a man without words\" was fastidious and possessed of a phenomenal memory; he kept a daily diary recording everything that happened to him. He put these skills to chilling use when he began to wipe out Europe's Jews and gypsies, communists and homosexuals. Everything the SS did was planned and recorded fastidiously. No one escaped the Reichsf\u00fchrer's eyes, beady behind those infamous rimless glasses. Everyone needed to be watched, especially Paula Stolzle, his elder brother's pretty and flirtatious fianc\u00e9e. Disapproving of sexy women, shortly before he joined the Nazi party the puritanical young Himmler employed a private detective to follow Stolzle; he made the couple's lives so fraught that the engagement was called off. Himmler went on to become a lot creepier and a lot more dangerous, although he did marry, losing his virginity at the age of 28 to a nurse seven years his senior who thought those rimless glasses - she persuaded him to wear them - rather fetching. It's just this sort of near-forensic detail that makes Thomas's book worthwhile. Quick as a blitzkrieg, this bloodless young man is Reichsf\u00fchrer SS (in 1929, aged 28). The title SS-1 refers to Himmler's position as head of the Schutz Staffel; it was also the licence plate of his BMW staff car. According to Josef Goebbels, \"except for Hitler, no one is entirely without fear of Himmler\". No one? German business certainly appears to have gone along with him. So too did business interests in Washington, London and Zurich. If there had been some shady Allied agreement to allow Himmler to escape the wrath of the Nuremberg trials and set up shop elsewhere while pretending that he had committed suicide, then it had surely been abandoned by May 1945. Himmler, the SS and German big business may well have been in cahoots with elements in Wall Street and the City of London; Britain's royal family, with its shareholding in German companies, was also that bit too close to him (Prince Christopher Mountbatten, says Thomas, was on Himmler's staff). Yet ultimately the SS Reichsf\u00fchrer was surely too ghastly to be acceptable to the international business and banking community. It's true that the British dug up the corpse for reidentification, and it's true that several members of British intelligence, Kim Philby among them, were not immediately convinced that Himmler was dead. Yet if he weren't, we would surely have heard something about it by now. Wouldn't we?",

For Barzun, who was born in France in 1907 and whose education was supervised by a great-grandmother born in the year of the final fall of the Bourbons, it is precisely that - an event of recent vintage - and it is one of the virtues of his vast, synoptic book that he makes the history of the past 500 years vivid and urgent. For a generation for whom history largely comprises BBC2 theme nights on the 1970s and 1980s, it is a salutary lesson. </p> <p>Barzun's book, written in a light, lucid, epigrammatic style, reads like a set of notes drawn from a lifetime's contemplation of the route by which the US and Europe arrived at Eminem, George W Bush and the Millennium Dome. He offers a history of ideas, not a historical narrative; it is an interpretation, not a description, of what happened, which is why he gives parenthetical suggestions of other books to browse. </p> <p>Barzun moved to the US in 1920 and, based at Columbia University, became one of its starriest and most combative academics, using his elegant pen in books such as The House of Intellect and Darwin Marx Wagner to oppose premature academic specialisation and defend the place of the humanities. He has been an emeritus professor since 1967, suggesting the need for some enhanced term of venerability. This book concludes his lifelong quest to relate historical events to cultural expression, and to understand the process of change. His question is nothing less than that which Tolstoy poses at the end of War and Peace : \"What is the force that moves nations?\" </p> <p>Barzun arranges his answer by period. From 1500 to 1660 it was religion: the Protestant challenge to Catholicism that led men, suddenly given direct access to God, to redefine themselves and states.

      "bodyText": "From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life Jacques Barzun 877pp, HarperCollins, \u00a325 Buy it at a discount at BOL In assessing the French revolution, Jacques Barzun describes it as an upheaval that occurred \"not so very long ago\". For Barzun, who was born in France in 1907 and whose education was supervised by a great-grandmother born in the year of the final fall of the Bourbons, it is precisely that - an event of recent vintage - and it is one of the virtues of his vast, synoptic book that he makes the history of the past 500 years vivid and urgent. For a generation for whom history largely comprises BBC2 theme nights on the 1970s and 1980s, it is a salutary lesson. Barzun's book, written in a light, lucid, epigrammatic style, reads like a set of notes drawn from a lifetime's contemplation of the route by which the US and Europe arrived at Eminem, George W Bush and the Millennium Dome. He offers a history of ideas, not a historical narrative; it is an interpretation, not a description, of what happened, which is why he gives parenthetical suggestions of other books to browse. Barzun moved to the US in 1920 and, based at Columbia University, became one of its starriest and most combative academics, using his elegant pen in books such as The House of Intellect and Darwin Marx Wagner to oppose premature academic specialisation and defend the place of the humanities. He has been an emeritus professor since 1967, suggesting the need for some enhanced term of venerability. This book concludes his lifelong quest to relate historical events to cultural expression, and to understand the process of change. His question is nothing less than that which Tolstoy poses at the end of War and Peace : \"What is the force that moves nations?\" Barzun arranges his answer by period. From 1500 to 1660 it was religion: the Protestant challenge to Catholicism that led men, suddenly given direct access to God, to redefine themselves and states. From 1660 to 1789 it was the pursuit of political freedom and individual rights, culminating in the French Revolution. From 1790 to 1920 it was the search for social and economic equality, exploding in the Russian Revolution. In the past century, it has been an uneasy amalgam of all three. Now, if his bleakest pronouncements are to be taken at face value, it is nothing at all: we are ruled by inertia. Entropy has replaced ideology.

Solitaire managing director Harvey Shulman expects annual rent rises just over inflation. </p> <p>But the income is pushed back up thanks to the split-level trust set-up. Investors can choose between income shares and capital shares. Seven income shares at 100p will be issued for each three capital shares at 100p. And during the 10-year life of the trust, the income holders will benefit from a gearing effect from the cash put up by the capital shareholders. </p> <p>The arithmetic puts the gross yield back to 10% - 9% net to basic taxpayers and 6.35% to 40% payers. The income will be paid quarterly. When the trust is wound up in 2011 investors should receive their original stake. </p> <p>Whatever is left goes to the capital shareholders, who benefit from any property price uplifts.

Alternative Investment Market listed Solitaire already organises smaller buy-to-let portfolios for private investors. Subtracting an allowance for \"voids\" - periods when a property remained unlet - and insurance against defaulting tenants leaves a real 7% return on rents. Solitaire managing director Harvey Shulman expects annual rent rises just over inflation. But the income is pushed back up thanks to the split-level trust set-up. Investors can choose between income shares and capital shares. Seven income shares at 100p will be issued for each three capital shares at 100p. And during the 10-year life of the trust, the income holders will benefit from a gearing effect from the cash put up by the capital shareholders. The arithmetic puts the gross yield back to 10% - 9% net to basic taxpayers and 6.35% to 40% payers. The income will be paid quarterly. When the trust is wound up in 2011 investors should receive their original stake. Whatever is left goes to the capital shareholders, who benefit from any property price uplifts. Provided values move ahead by 1.5% a year, the lowest level recorded over any 10-year period since 1974, capital investors will get their cash back in 2011. But if the average rises by 2.5%, they get 159p, equal to 4.7% a year, at 5% annual growth, the result is 334p or 12.6% annualised, while at 7.5%, the return per share will be 550p or 18.3% a year.

The depiction of the sea in all its moods - from the magical to the terrifying - is wonderfully vivid. And Britten's compassionate, penetrating music brings the characters to life in ways only hinted at in the libretto. </p> <p>But the message remains hard to fathom. Every character is deeply flawed. Grimes may have visionary qualities, but his treatment of his boy apprentices, emotionally and physically, is appalling. The widow Ellen Orford is hopelessly deluded about him, and her misguided attempts to help are partly responsible for one boy's death. Captain Balstrode may seem a relatively earthed character, but he's the one who sends Grimes to his wretched end at sea. The villagers are horrific as a mob, but are portrayed sympathetically as individuals. There are no heroes and no villains, only victims. </p> <p>Britten's vision of humanity seems to be one of helplessness, the heartless sea making nonsense of human aspirations. Or at least, that was the feeling after this semi-staged concert performance. </p> <p>There have been singers - Philip Langridge is a recent example - who have made the opera focus much more on Grimes himself. With Langridge, the drama of the sea was a reflection of Grimes's inner turbulence. There are qualities in John Daszak's voice that resemble Langridge. But moving as he was in the final mad scene, Daszak came nowhere near his great precursor in depth and power - nor was his intonation quite as steady. Yvonne Kenny's Ellen Orford too was only partially successful: tender in her scenes with the boy, but less involving as the mad scene approached, and with signs of strain at the top of her vocal register. </p> <p>And yet the performances still packed a punch. This was partly due to excellent singing and characterisation in some of the lesser roles: Andrew Forbes-Lane as the deranged lay-preacher Bob Boles, Anne Wilkins as the brothel-keeper Auntie, and Jeremy Huw Williams as the apothecary Ned Keene. Leading them was Steven Page's Balstrode, arrogant one moment, understanding the next. </p> <p>The City of Birmingham Symphony Chorus and Youth Chorus were splendid, as was the CBSO itself under Sakari Oramo. Details that get lost when the orchestra is placed in the theatre pit emerged with fresh clarity. Under Oramo's direction the pacing was compelling from the start, and got better as the evening progressed. Not a perfect Grimes, but one to leave you thinking.</p>",
