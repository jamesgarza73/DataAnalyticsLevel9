The increase effectively cancels out May's 0.3% decline in prices, leaving them broadly stable over the past two months. In consequence, the annual rate of increase in house price growth is continuing to decline - it was 15.1% in June, compared with 15.8% in May and 17.5% in April. \"These figures show that prices continue to rise, but at a slower pace than they were during the first quarter of the year,\" said David Parry, a Na tionwide spokesman. \"We believe that house price inflation has been running at an unsustainable pace in the past year and it was natural and expected that some slowing would take place.\" The figures are the latest to indicate that the market is slowing down following the surge in property values seen in the last two years. Last week the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said that house prices had come to a standstill in London, the region that has led the boom, and had \"slowed to a walking pace\" across the rest of the country. Prospects for the wider economy remain favourable, with unemployment expected to fall further and average take-home pay predicted to rise this year. Given this backdrop, house prices would continue to climb, though the British economy was unlikely to see a return to the rapid growth seen at the end of last year, and there was a good chance that the annual rate of house price inflation would continue to slide in the coming months, said Mr Parry.

      "body": "<p>When France lifted the World Cup in Paris two years ago, Fabien Barthez said he cried for the first time in his life. The new Manchester United goalkeeper might have wept again after 90 minutes last night but it would have been for very different reasons. </p> <p>His joy as Sylvain Wiltord squeezed in an injury-time equaliser to send this game into extra-time was unconfined, as he leapt about his penalty area. </p> <p>Knowing him, though, it will not have come as a surprise because Barthez is renowned for possessing the self-confidence of Naseem Hamed. And it was a disappointment that he chose not to enter by flying carpet but walked behind Didier Deschamps for the national anthems instead. </p> <p>Then again, if ever there is a time for Barthez to feel insecure it is during the Marseillaise, because it always appears that he has sat beneath the wrong peg and slipped on the goal keeper's jersey by mistake. </p> <p>The official tournament statistics list Barthez as 6ft, the same height as Marcel Desailly, which can only mean he turned up on measuring day wearing a Don King wig. The fact that he stood between Deschamps and Bixente Lizarazu, France's two smallest players, during the anthems certainly seemed to give the game away. No wonder the 29-year-old feels the need to date supermodels, wear dark glasses and shave his head. </p> <p>So famous is the bald pate that it is shaved by contractual agreement with Bic razors. And a particular shiver must have gone through his cranium as he got his customary pre-match peck from Laurent Blanc. The defender had said this would be his international farewell and - whatever the state of play in his on-off romance with Linda Evangelista - Barthez must find it hard to imagine being kissed by another man. </p> <p>Not that he was given time to consider such matters.

      "bodyText": "When France lifted the World Cup in Paris two years ago, Fabien Barthez said he cried for the first time in his life. The new Manchester United goalkeeper might have wept again after 90 minutes last night but it would have been for very different reasons. His joy as Sylvain Wiltord squeezed in an injury-time equaliser to send this game into extra-time was unconfined, as he leapt about his penalty area. Knowing him, though, it will not have come as a surprise because Barthez is renowned for possessing the self-confidence of Naseem Hamed. And it was a disappointment that he chose not to enter by flying carpet but walked behind Didier Deschamps for the national anthems instead. Then again, if ever there is a time for Barthez to feel insecure it is during the Marseillaise, because it always appears that he has sat beneath the wrong peg and slipped on the goal keeper's jersey by mistake. The official tournament statistics list Barthez as 6ft, the same height as Marcel Desailly, which can only mean he turned up on measuring day wearing a Don King wig. The fact that he stood between Deschamps and Bixente Lizarazu, France's two smallest players, during the anthems certainly seemed to give the game away. No wonder the 29-year-old feels the need to date supermodels, wear dark glasses and shave his head. So famous is the bald pate that it is shaved by contractual agreement with Bic razors. And a particular shiver must have gone through his cranium as he got his customary pre-match peck from Laurent Blanc. The defender had said this would be his international farewell and - whatever the state of play in his on-off romance with Linda Evangelista - Barthez must find it hard to imagine being kissed by another man. Not that he was given time to consider such matters. If, after Italy's semi- final against Holland, Barthez expected his most testing moment of the first half would be jumping to touch the crossbar before kick-off, he was in for a nasty surprise. Within 80 seconds he was rushing outside his area to demonstrate his famous kicking ability as Marco Delvecchio chased a Francesco Totti pass. His new club manager Sir Alex Ferguson, spotted here before the start, must have liked that. But Barthez's relative lack of inches seemed to be exposed when he was caught well off his line as Totti headed wide from a Stefano Fiore corner minutes later. Yet it is personality as well as undoubted ability that marks Barthez out, and his reaction to an early Demetrio Albertini free-kick that flew over indicated that any Manchester United defenders who threw away their ear plugs when Peter Schmeichel departed could have made an error. Delvecchio also got a mouthful, and nearly a fistful, when he caught the prone Barthez with his leg. But as the half progressed there was little to test France's No16, who had enough toilet roll lobbed at him by Italy's fans before the second period to last him to the next European Championship. A few pieces might have been needed to wipe away the tears of anger and frustration when Delvecchio put Italy ahead, Barthez rooted to the spot as the Roma forward scored from close in.

      "body": "<p>The crowd stayed long after the baubles and bouquets had been handed out and the champagne corks popped in the England dressing room. As Dominic Cork, bathed in soft seven o'clock sunshine, clubbed the winning boundary and set off on his adrenalin-fuelled celebrations, they poured across the green acres in their thousands to stand in amazement in front of the pavilion and there they remained, unable or unwilling to tear themselves away, hoping the magic might last just a little longer, until finally the sweeper crews moved in and they wandered off into the St John's Wood evening. </p> <p>This had been not only a vivid Test match but a truly great one, a game that for all three days fluctuated wildly in fortune before the most dramatic of climaxes. West Indies were not out of it until the moment Cork's final square-slash left his bat and, eluding the cover fielders, raced to the boundary between the Tavern and Mound stands; certainly not while the giants Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose had a breath left in their bodies. </p> <p>Together these two warriors, up there with the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China as wonders of the age, pulled West Indies back from the brink just as they had done so often in the past. Walsh claimed the first six wickets, to finish with 10 in the match, and is marching relentlessly on towards 500 Test dismissals. No spoils for Ambrose, though, until he had Andy Caddick lbw as the match came to a head, but that merely serves to illustrate that there is no justice, certainly not in the cricket world. </p> <p>Quite simply Ambrose served up one of the finest displays of relentless, metronomic, micrometer-accurate pace bowling that anyone had witnessed, passing the lunging edge of the bat time and again, the difference between success and failure little more than a hair's breadth. Mike Atherton, who has faced him down more than most, said it was the most searching examination of his career. </p> <p>Lord's will not see the pair in Test action again and gave them a rousing send-off as the throng parted and, led by Walsh, the West Indies team made their way to the Nursery End of the ground to take the plaudits of their supporters and give their own thanks. </p> <p>In a match containing heroes in abundance, Cork took the man-of-the-match award from Ian Botham, who had himself so famously turned the tide of match and series 19 years ago. On the first day of Cork's return to international cricket it had been his waspish bowling which gained control after Sherwin Campbell and Adrian Griffith had taken toll of England's early inertia, and which then began the process of chipping away at the innings. Then, on that incredible Friday when 21 wickets had fallen and for the only time in Test history a part of all four innings was played in a day, he had breezed in to finish the job of demolishing West Indies' secondinnings after Caddick and Darren Gough had started the task. </p> <p>On Saturday, though, the fire of competition burned fiercest in his eyes at a time when history suggested that the game was up for England; 48 runs were still needed when he arrived at the crease, and 28 when he was joined by Gough with only the rookie Matthew Hoggard to come. </p> <p>While Gough employed studious defence against Ambrose, Cork launched into Franklyn Rose, pulling him into the Grandstand for six and lofting him to the long-on boundary. Sixteen needed and it might have been 60. Singles were scampered in hair-raising fashion, leg byes greeted with acclaim by the crowd. </p> <p>Finally, as his last throw of the dice, Jimmy Adams brought back Walsh to partner Ambrose. Drip by drip England closed in until leg byes brought the scores level. In came the field, Cork held his nerve and carved his place in English cricket history. The stand had occupied three nail-biting quarters of an hour. </p> <p>The win was set up by the second-wicket partnership of 92 between Atherton, whose whole cricket existence is for days and confrontations such as this, and Michael Vaughan, who restated his Test match credentials. Neither rushed: Atherton took nine overs to get off the mark and Vaughan 11, and Atherton's 45 took him 3 hours before Walsh got him. He has never made a Test century at Lord's but this was as good as. Graeme Hick and Alec Stewart continued the aggression with some forthright strokes and suddenly the win was in range. </p> <p>So a series has been resurrected in the most dramatic fashion, and goodness knows the summer has needed it. And no one should be blinded by the fact that this was a great escape by England; West Indies have suffered a huge setback at Lord's because they are proud of a marvellous record of triumphing in the close games, especially when they are bowling last. </p> <p>Losing now has taken the wind from the tourists' sails and were the series continuing a week on Thursday, as it normally would, England's momentum might have proved irresistible just as it was when Botham and Willis turned the tide at Headingley. Instead, though, we move into one-day mode, and there is a chance for West Indies to regroup and specifically for Walsh and Ambrose to recharge. A one-day series, with strokeplay the imperative, may just prove the catalyst that revitalises Brian Lara too. </p> <p>England really needed this to be a continuous series and they now have selection dilemmas for the third test at Old Trafford, which starts on August 3.

      "bodyText": "The crowd stayed long after the baubles and bouquets had been handed out and the champagne corks popped in the England dressing room. As Dominic Cork, bathed in soft seven o'clock sunshine, clubbed the winning boundary and set off on his adrenalin-fuelled celebrations, they poured across the green acres in their thousands to stand in amazement in front of the pavilion and there they remained, unable or unwilling to tear themselves away, hoping the magic might last just a little longer, until finally the sweeper crews moved in and they wandered off into the St John's Wood evening. This had been not only a vivid Test match but a truly great one, a game that for all three days fluctuated wildly in fortune before the most dramatic of climaxes. West Indies were not out of it until the moment Cork's final square-slash left his bat and, eluding the cover fielders, raced to the boundary between the Tavern and Mound stands; certainly not while the giants Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose had a breath left in their bodies. Together these two warriors, up there with the Taj Mahal and the Great Wall of China as wonders of the age, pulled West Indies back from the brink just as they had done so often in the past. Walsh claimed the first six wickets, to finish with 10 in the match, and is marching relentlessly on towards 500 Test dismissals. No spoils for Ambrose, though, until he had Andy Caddick lbw as the match came to a head, but that merely serves to illustrate that there is no justice, certainly not in the cricket world. Quite simply Ambrose served up one of the finest displays of relentless, metronomic, micrometer-accurate pace bowling that anyone had witnessed, passing the lunging edge of the bat time and again, the difference between success and failure little more than a hair's breadth. Mike Atherton, who has faced him down more than most, said it was the most searching examination of his career. Lord's will not see the pair in Test action again and gave them a rousing send-off as the throng parted and, led by Walsh, the West Indies team made their way to the Nursery End of the ground to take the plaudits of their supporters and give their own thanks. In a match containing heroes in abundance, Cork took the man-of-the-match award from Ian Botham, who had himself so famously turned the tide of match and series 19 years ago. On the first day of Cork's return to international cricket it had been his waspish bowling which gained control after Sherwin Campbell and Adrian Griffith had taken toll of England's early inertia, and which then began the process of chipping away at the innings. Then, on that incredible Friday when 21 wickets had fallen and for the only time in Test history a part of all four innings was played in a day, he had breezed in to finish the job of demolishing West Indies' secondinnings after Caddick and Darren Gough had started the task. On Saturday, though, the fire of competition burned fiercest in his eyes at a time when history suggested that the game was up for England; 48 runs were still needed when he arrived at the crease, and 28 when he was joined by Gough with only the rookie Matthew Hoggard to come. While Gough employed studious defence against Ambrose, Cork launched into Franklyn Rose, pulling him into the Grandstand for six and lofting him to the long-on boundary. Sixteen needed and it might have been 60. Singles were scampered in hair-raising fashion, leg byes greeted with acclaim by the crowd. Finally, as his last throw of the dice, Jimmy Adams brought back Walsh to partner Ambrose. Drip by drip England closed in until leg byes brought the scores level. In came the field, Cork held his nerve and carved his place in English cricket history. The stand had occupied three nail-biting quarters of an hour. The win was set up by the second-wicket partnership of 92 between Atherton, whose whole cricket existence is for days and confrontations such as this, and Michael Vaughan, who restated his Test match credentials. Neither rushed: Atherton took nine overs to get off the mark and Vaughan 11, and Atherton's 45 took him 3 hours before Walsh got him. He has never made a Test century at Lord's but this was as good as. Graeme Hick and Alec Stewart continued the aggression with some forthright strokes and suddenly the win was in range. So a series has been resurrected in the most dramatic fashion, and goodness knows the summer has needed it. And no one should be blinded by the fact that this was a great escape by England; West Indies have suffered a huge setback at Lord's because they are proud of a marvellous record of triumphing in the close games, especially when they are bowling last. Losing now has taken the wind from the tourists' sails and were the series continuing a week on Thursday, as it normally would, England's momentum might have proved irresistible just as it was when Botham and Willis turned the tide at Headingley. Instead, though, we move into one-day mode, and there is a chance for West Indies to regroup and specifically for Walsh and Ambrose to recharge. A one-day series, with strokeplay the imperative, may just prove the catalyst that revitalises Brian Lara too. England really needed this to be a continuous series and they now have selection dilemmas for the third test at Old Trafford, which starts on August 3. Ostensibly the side who lost at Edgbaston were kept together as far as was practical and were offered the chance of redemption, and redeem themselves they have. Doors were opened, however, by injuries to Nasser Hussain and Andy Flintoff, and although Craig White had a modest game, Vaughan must now have put pressure on Mark Ramprakash, who failed yet again at Lord's and whose opening spot is in jeopardy; he looked a forlorn figure amid the triumphalism on the England balcony. There must surely be a recall soon for Graham Thorpe too, although with Hussain's return one further batsman would have to make way. Hick would be most under pressure but one solution, with an all-seam attack, is to employ seven batsmen. But that is in the future. For now England should relish the moment. Their endeavours have given new life to test cricket and resuscitated a series. And for that, in a hitherto depressing sporting summer, we should be grateful.",

One test back in the England side and Cork has brought salvation to a troubled game. This victory did far more than re-emphasise his star quality, or enliven a summer's Test series between well matched but flawed opponents. It was a win which challenged the supercilious posing of the self-styled modernists who habitually depict English cricket as an outdated pastime in terminal decline.</p> <p>Not only was Cork back in the national side, millions actually knew and cared that he was. Over the final two days of a match overladen with emotion and tension, the England cricket team had grabbed the nation's attention in a manner not rivalled since Ian Botham's destruction of the Australians nearly 20 years ago. It was meant to happen in last summer's World Cup and never quite did. </p> <p>There were others involved, of course: Andrew Caddick, bowling with rare ferocity; the staunch batting of Michael Atherton and Michael Vaughan. But the most instant, uplifting image was of Cork, batting as if he relished the pressure, energised by the burden placed upon him, not unnerved as so many had been before. </p> <p>From the moment early in his innings when he twice drove Franklyn Rose down the ground, the wonderful conviction was that here was a late-order English batsman yearning for a scrap. He lived it, loved it and won it. </p> <p>Cork finished with a three-finger salute to the dressing-room balcony, which he chooses not to explain, so we can only assume he was telling his detractors where to go, 1 times. In awarding him the man-of-the-match award, Botham honoured a cricketing soul mate. </p> <p>Nasser Hussain's captaincy has gone a long way towards acknowledging that England do not have so many high-calibre players that they can readily overlook the awkward squad. Team spirit is paramount but England's only hope is to educate the non-conformists into basic team requirements, not to shun them in favour of malleable players of lesser ability. </p> <p>Popularity is something that Cork has not won easily. His brash and bumptious ways are best suited to the garish international spotlight. In more relaxed moments he has been accused of being overbearing and egotistical, a man who the former England coach David Lloyd said in his autobiography, Anything But Murder, \"can be as unpopular with his own team-mates as he is with the opposition\". </p> <p>Lloyd, a passionate believer in team spirit, was dismayed by Cork's attitude in New Zealand in 1997, even allowing for the fact that a messy marriage break-up had left his life in turmoil. England had just turned their backs on a disastrous tour in Zimbabwe and when Cork joined them in New Zealand, having skipped compulsory fitness sessions back in England, and quickly regressed into a brooding state of mind, Lloyd was not the only person to regard him as a disruptive influence. According to Lloyd, Cork's \"boorish\" on-field behaviour caused Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, to propose that he \"should be sent home because his conduct on the field did not fit an image of what an England cricketer should be\". </p> <p>Lloyd is now a convert. \"Now that he is settled, England need the Dominic Cork of old,\" he said. \"He can be world class; it is not too late.\" </p> <p>Cork, at 28, insists that he possesses a new maturity and that the Derbyshire captaincy has helped enormously. It is easy to say, of course, like Mark Ramprakash assuring us that he is more relaxed or Andrew Flintoff spouting about the importance of fitness. But an aggressive Cork, both getting up the opposition's noses and contributing to a harmonious dressing room, would be a marvellous thing. </p> <p>It is never too late. But it should have happened years ago and he has largely himself to blame that it didn't.</p>",

This victory did far more than re-emphasise his star quality, or enliven a summer's Test series between well matched but flawed opponents. It was a win which challenged the supercilious posing of the self-styled modernists who habitually depict English cricket as an outdated pastime in terminal decline. Not only was Cork back in the national side, millions actually knew and cared that he was. Over the final two days of a match overladen with emotion and tension, the England cricket team had grabbed the nation's attention in a manner not rivalled since Ian Botham's destruction of the Australians nearly 20 years ago. It was meant to happen in last summer's World Cup and never quite did. There were others involved, of course: Andrew Caddick, bowling with rare ferocity; the staunch batting of Michael Atherton and Michael Vaughan. But the most instant, uplifting image was of Cork, batting as if he relished the pressure, energised by the burden placed upon him, not unnerved as so many had been before. From the moment early in his innings when he twice drove Franklyn Rose down the ground, the wonderful conviction was that here was a late-order English batsman yearning for a scrap. He lived it, loved it and won it. Cork finished with a three-finger salute to the dressing-room balcony, which he chooses not to explain, so we can only assume he was telling his detractors where to go, 1 times. In awarding him the man-of-the-match award, Botham honoured a cricketing soul mate. Nasser Hussain's captaincy has gone a long way towards acknowledging that England do not have so many high-calibre players that they can readily overlook the awkward squad. Team spirit is paramount but England's only hope is to educate the non-conformists into basic team requirements, not to shun them in favour of malleable players of lesser ability. Popularity is something that Cork has not won easily. His brash and bumptious ways are best suited to the garish international spotlight. In more relaxed moments he has been accused of being overbearing and egotistical, a man who the former England coach David Lloyd said in his autobiography, Anything But Murder, \"can be as unpopular with his own team-mates as he is with the opposition\". Lloyd, a passionate believer in team spirit, was dismayed by Cork's attitude in New Zealand in 1997, even allowing for the fact that a messy marriage break-up had left his life in turmoil. England had just turned their backs on a disastrous tour in Zimbabwe and when Cork joined them in New Zealand, having skipped compulsory fitness sessions back in England, and quickly regressed into a brooding state of mind, Lloyd was not the only person to regard him as a disruptive influence. According to Lloyd, Cork's \"boorish\" on-field behaviour caused Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, to propose that he \"should be sent home because his conduct on the field did not fit an image of what an England cricketer should be\". Lloyd is now a convert. \"Now that he is settled, England need the Dominic Cork of old,\" he said. \"He can be world class; it is not too late.\" Cork, at 28, insists that he possesses a new maturity and that the Derbyshire captaincy has helped enormously. It is easy to say, of course, like Mark Ramprakash assuring us that he is more relaxed or Andrew Flintoff spouting about the importance of fitness. But an aggressive Cork, both getting up the opposition's noses and contributing to a harmonious dressing room, would be a marvellous thing. It is never too late. But it should have happened years ago and he has largely himself to blame that it didn't.",

Downing Street said the seminar would focus on street crime, robbery and disorder - offences which have seen increased incidence during the past 10 years.</p> <p>Sir John Evans, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, expressed scepticism about Mr Blair's plan for on-the-spot fines: \"There are many legal and practical difficulties. We don't have a tradition of collecting on-the-spot fines, we issue fixed penalties. \"I think that the whole process of thinking that people who are raging drunk, or indeed those who are being disorderly or even violent, can be made quiescent to go to a cashpoint, will cause us some difficulties.\" He added that the scheme would increase the potential for false allegations to be made against police officers.</p> <p>Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe was derisive about the crime summit and in particular the proposal for on-the-spot fines. \"These very police officers have themselves severe queries about it. Did [Mr Blair] bother to test that through?\"</p> <p>Ken Livingstone, who today took over responsibility for overseeing the Metropolitan Police as London mayor, also voiced concern about Mr Blair's on-the-spot fine proposal. He said that the fines would \"clearly\" open the door to police corruption.</p> <p>Other items on the agenda today included new powers to close down pubs and clubs for public order offences, the use of parenting orders to compel mothers and fathers to control their children, and fixed penalties or spot fines for trouble-makers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the government was expected to come under pressure to put money alongside the new law and order measures.</p> <p>Chairman of the Police Federation Fred Broughton said that the \"chaotic scenes\" seen throughout the UK on Friday and Saturday nights were set to spiral unless more investment was poured into the police.</p> <p>Paul Cavadino, policy director at the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, argued that the government was misdirecting its efforts.</p> <p>\"New York-style zero tolerance policing, increased use of stop and search and longer jail sentences sound tough but are not the most effective ways of addressing crime. Policing by community consent and measures to tackle youth boredom and disaffection would be far more effective,\" he said.</p> <p>\"A determined strategy covering prevention, education and treatment for alcohol misusers, backed by resources, would do far more to cut alcohol-related crime than impractical ideas like marching drunken people to cashpoints,\" added Mr Cavadino.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government appears to have backtracked from a proposal to impose instant fines for loutish behaviour, a key prong in its crime reduction strategy revealed at a summit at Downing Street today. Chief constables from Britain's major police forces attended the talks with prime minister Tony Blair and home secretary Jack Straw. Downing Street said the seminar would focus on street crime, robbery and disorder - offences which have seen increased incidence during the past 10 years. Sir John Evans, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, expressed scepticism about Mr Blair's plan for on-the-spot fines: \"There are many legal and practical difficulties. We don't have a tradition of collecting on-the-spot fines, we issue fixed penalties. \"I think that the whole process of thinking that people who are raging drunk, or indeed those who are being disorderly or even violent, can be made quiescent to go to a cashpoint, will cause us some difficulties.\" He added that the scheme would increase the potential for false allegations to be made against police officers. Shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe was derisive about the crime summit and in particular the proposal for on-the-spot fines. \"These very police officers have themselves severe queries about it. Did [Mr Blair] bother to test that through?\" Ken Livingstone, who today took over responsibility for overseeing the Metropolitan Police as London mayor, also voiced concern about Mr Blair's on-the-spot fine proposal. He said that the fines would \"clearly\" open the door to police corruption. Other items on the agenda today included new powers to close down pubs and clubs for public order offences, the use of parenting orders to compel mothers and fathers to control their children, and fixed penalties or spot fines for trouble-makers. Meanwhile, the government was expected to come under pressure to put money alongside the new law and order measures. Chairman of the Police Federation Fred Broughton said that the \"chaotic scenes\" seen throughout the UK on Friday and Saturday nights were set to spiral unless more investment was poured into the police. Paul Cavadino, policy director at the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, argued that the government was misdirecting its efforts. \"New York-style zero tolerance policing, increased use of stop and search and longer jail sentences sound tough but are not the most effective ways of addressing crime. Policing by community consent and measures to tackle youth boredom and disaffection would be far more effective,\" he said. \"A determined strategy covering prevention, education and treatment for alcohol misusers, backed by resources, would do far more to cut alcohol-related crime than impractical ideas like marching drunken people to cashpoints,\" added Mr Cavadino.",

Twelve Tribes, whose 24-hour cafe, The Common Ground, was a popular meeting point at this year's Glastonbury festival, handed out literature blaming Jewish people for the death of Jesus. One article says: \"Murder is the very crime which the Jews are still cursed for.\" It goes on to speak of the Jews' \"responsibility for the Messiah's crucifixion\". The movement's magazine, Alien Ant, also argues in favour of racial segregation, claiming that \"multiculturalism increases murder, crime and prejudice,\" and \"politicians who rally different races to be one are forerunners of the antichrist\". Jewish community leaders yesterday expressed concern and urged organisers of the imminent Reading festival to consider banning the group. The group's use of the accusation that Jews \"murdered\" Christ, a longstanding basis for Christian anti-semitism, has prompted concerns of links with white supremacists in the United States. Mike Whine, a spokesman for the British Board of Deputies, said the name Twelve Tribes hinted at a shared philosophy with American white supremacist groups. \"There is a belief that the white Anglo-Saxon protestant is the true descendant of the 12 tribes of Israel and that the Jews are impostors,\" he said. \"It is the role of the white Anglo-Saxon protestant in America and Europe to take back their world from the blacks - whom they call the 'mud people' - and the Jews.

Twelve Tribes was founded in Tennessee in the early 1970s but now has at least six \"communities\" in rural locations in Europe, including one set up six years ago at Stentwood Farm in Dunkeswell, Devon. Their cafe, a smart, two-storey wooden structure painted with rural scenes, serves mainly vegetarian food and is used as a recruiting ground.

Its author, David Rudd, also suggests more controversially that golliwogs were not simply a crude expression of any racism on Blyton's part. Dr Rudd, a senior lecturer at Bolton Institute in Greater Manchester, argues that a golliwog appears as a total villain only in the notorious Here Comes Noddy Again, where a golly asks the hero with a bell on his hat to give him a lift into the dark dark wood - and then steals his car. Elsewhere, goblins and monkeys emerge more consistently as villains than golliwogs and bears are regularly portrayed as more naughty. Dr Rudd traces the pre-Blyton semantic and fictional history of the golliwog and concludes: \"The golliwog, it seems, was not in origin a racist icon, whereas the offensive term 'wog' had a separate derivation. \"However, there is no doubt that the golly came to prominence in an age that was racist and that he was all too easily implicated in racist discourses, both in name and image.\" Although it could be argued that the golliwog was not originally intended as a representation of a black person, anti-racists fastened on to the character as a key symbol of racism and sought to ban it, which gave it a status and significance it did not originally have. Once the golliwog was given a new negative meaning in the public mind, its days had to be numbered and the Noddy stories had to be revised. Part of Dr Rudd's study is based on what children - rather than disapproving adults - think about Enid Blyton. \"All I can say is that, of the children who were not previously aware of the equation 'golliwog equals ethnically black person', none made it,\" he writes. When he showed two 14-year-old Asian boys Noddy stories in which golliwogs had been replaced by white goblins, they were outraged that a black character had been removed.

And they scored an equaliser so deep into injury time that even Alex Ferguson was tapping his watch in bewilderment. But, predictably, after scraping a slightly fortuitous victory, the French press and players were magnanimous - humble even - in praising the Italians for their tremendous...</p> <p>Just kidding! \"Champions of the Universe!\" blazed the classically-understated headline in France Soir, who went on to herald \"the alchemy of Les Bleus, combining an unparalleled physical power and technical virtuosity\". If that wasn't modest enough, Youri Djorkaeff then popped up to claim: \"Had Italy won, it would have taken football 10 years back.\"</p> <p>Strangely, it was up to the Italian media to inject a modicum of rationality after the match. Sure, they cursed their side's dismal luck and \"intolerable\" refereeing. But by and large they were quite reasonable. \"We got into to the final by a stroke of luck because the Dutch deserved to go through,\" claimed L'Unita newspaper in a front-page editorial. \"And we were beaten in the final by a stroke of bad luck. We deserved to win yesterday's match.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, RAI state radio pointed out that Italy were used to winning by playing badly, but not to losing when they played well. Which is quite true, although whether that rare praise - or the fact they've just been made Knights of the Republic by Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi - will make it easier for Alessandro Del Piero to watch the match video is another matter.</p> <p><strong>TEDIOUS TRANSFERS</strong></p> <p>He could create history in a second by dropping a shoulder, skinning both Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro at once, and pulling back a perfect ball for a loitering team-mate to hammer home. But could Robert Pires make a decision about where he wants to play his football next year? Of course he couldn't.</p> <p>The will-he-won't-he saga involving Marseille winger Pires, Arsenal and Real Madrid had been dragging on for weeks. Initially, the affair was merely tedious: the player was going to sign for Arsenal, but changed his mind when Real showed an interest. It then became unbearable: skinny Bob changed his mind again, deciding that London was the place for him, and intimated he would sign a contract with the Gunners when the Euro 2000 championships were over.</p> <p>So did Pires scratch his name on a sheet of Arsenal-headed paper the minute he got his mitts on a shiny new medal? \"Madrid is the best club for me,\" he predictably about-faced two minutes after last night's final. \"We will see what the people at Madrid want. Money is not the most important thing but how the game is played.\"</p> <p>Good riddance to the indecisive get, the Fiver thought. And sure enough, Arsene Wenger this afternoon confirmed that Pires had changed his tiresome mind once again and had signed a four-year Arsenal contract worth \u00a317,000-a-week. Which is all good and well, except that the Fiver has lost the will to live and doesn't care any more.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE YESTERDAY</strong></p> <p>\"Wiltord's goal will be remembered in French folk history for ever. The name of the man who scores the next goal will be remembered for a little bit longer\" - ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley. At least he didn't say \"from whence cometh the hero\", but then again he's not Barry Davies.</p> <p><strong>OUR BID TURNS BADDER</strong></p> <p>England's knackered old dog of a World Cup bid really is on its last legs. Brazil today pulled out of the race for the 2006 tournament, which means South Africa is now almost certain to get the nod on Thursday when the winners are announced in Zurich.</p> <p>The move is part of a deal which will see the three South American votes handed to South Africa in return for a reciprocal gesture in the 2010 bidding process. It means that Europe is unlikely to see a World Cup for another 14 years, something which could have been easily avoided had the FA not reneged on a similar deal between themselves and the German FA (who voted for England's Euro 96 in turn for some support for their 2006 campaign). But there you go.</p> <p>In effect, England have spent over \u00a310m just to ensure Germany failed in their bid to host the championships.

      "bodyText": "TOP PRESS For large parts of the game, they were out-thought, out-played and hopelessly impotent in attack. And they scored an equaliser so deep into injury time that even Alex Ferguson was tapping his watch in bewilderment. But, predictably, after scraping a slightly fortuitous victory, the French press and players were magnanimous - humble even - in praising the Italians for their tremendous... Just kidding! \"Champions of the Universe!\" blazed the classically-understated headline in France Soir, who went on to herald \"the alchemy of Les Bleus, combining an unparalleled physical power and technical virtuosity\". If that wasn't modest enough, Youri Djorkaeff then popped up to claim: \"Had Italy won, it would have taken football 10 years back.\" Strangely, it was up to the Italian media to inject a modicum of rationality after the match. Sure, they cursed their side's dismal luck and \"intolerable\" refereeing. But by and large they were quite reasonable. \"We got into to the final by a stroke of luck because the Dutch deserved to go through,\" claimed L'Unita newspaper in a front-page editorial. \"And we were beaten in the final by a stroke of bad luck. We deserved to win yesterday's match.\" Meanwhile, RAI state radio pointed out that Italy were used to winning by playing badly, but not to losing when they played well. Which is quite true, although whether that rare praise - or the fact they've just been made Knights of the Republic by Italian president Carlo Azeglio Ciampi - will make it easier for Alessandro Del Piero to watch the match video is another matter. TEDIOUS TRANSFERS He could create history in a second by dropping a shoulder, skinning both Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro at once, and pulling back a perfect ball for a loitering team-mate to hammer home. But could Robert Pires make a decision about where he wants to play his football next year? Of course he couldn't. The will-he-won't-he saga involving Marseille winger Pires, Arsenal and Real Madrid had been dragging on for weeks. Initially, the affair was merely tedious: the player was going to sign for Arsenal, but changed his mind when Real showed an interest. It then became unbearable: skinny Bob changed his mind again, deciding that London was the place for him, and intimated he would sign a contract with the Gunners when the Euro 2000 championships were over. So did Pires scratch his name on a sheet of Arsenal-headed paper the minute he got his mitts on a shiny new medal? \"Madrid is the best club for me,\" he predictably about-faced two minutes after last night's final. \"We will see what the people at Madrid want. Money is not the most important thing but how the game is played.\" Good riddance to the indecisive get, the Fiver thought. And sure enough, Arsene Wenger this afternoon confirmed that Pires had changed his tiresome mind once again and had signed a four-year Arsenal contract worth \u00a317,000-a-week. Which is all good and well, except that the Fiver has lost the will to live and doesn't care any more. QUOTE OF THE YESTERDAY \"Wiltord's goal will be remembered in French folk history for ever. The name of the man who scores the next goal will be remembered for a little bit longer\" - ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley. At least he didn't say \"from whence cometh the hero\", but then again he's not Barry Davies. OUR BID TURNS BADDER England's knackered old dog of a World Cup bid really is on its last legs. Brazil today pulled out of the race for the 2006 tournament, which means South Africa is now almost certain to get the nod on Thursday when the winners are announced in Zurich. The move is part of a deal which will see the three South American votes handed to South Africa in return for a reciprocal gesture in the 2010 bidding process. It means that Europe is unlikely to see a World Cup for another 14 years, something which could have been easily avoided had the FA not reneged on a similar deal between themselves and the German FA (who voted for England's Euro 96 in turn for some support for their 2006 campaign). But there you go. In effect, England have spent over \u00a310m just to ensure Germany failed in their bid to host the championships. Which will sound highly amusing to many England fans we're sure, until they decide to follow their team to Durban instead of Dortmund. Because it's going to be a very expensive business jetting to Africa and back - at least Alec McGivan, Tony Banks and Bobby Charlton will have clocked up enough air miles to knock a few quid off their tickets, eh? THE RUMOUR MILL Liverpool have been told to increase their \u00a33.5m offer if they want to sign Nick Barmby. Everton are believed to want at least the \u00a35.75m they paid Middlesbrough four years ago. Newcastle have been linked with a \u00a31m move for Arsenal and England goalkeeper David Seaman. Aston Villa are back in the hunt for Chris Sutton after John Gregory's bid to sign Nuno Gomes collapsed. According to reports from Germany, former Manchester City striker Uwe R\u00f6sler has signed for Southampton on a two-year contract. Chelsea are preparing a \u00a36m bid for Roma striker Marco Delvecchio. NEWS IN BRIEF Middlesbrough are remaining tight-lipped over reports that Paul Gascoigne failed to turn up for a cards-on-the-table meeting with manager Bryan Robson, chief executive Keith Lamb and agent Mel Stein to discuss his future on Monday. Marcel Desailly has signed a two-year extension to his contract with Chelsea. Arsenal have confirmed the \u00a36m signing of Brazilian midfielder Edu. Manchester City have expanded their scouting network by forming a partnership with Republic of Ireland junior side Cherry Orchard. City will have first pick of Cherry Orchard's players and have already signed up Stephen Paisley and Will Flood from the Irish club.

      "body": "<p>If it wasn't for a huge slice of luck, Eric Voight would almost certainly have died the day he drove from Lichfield to Manchester. Without realising, the 76-year-old violin dealer and restorer drove into the oncoming lane of a dual carriageway. Only the frantic flashing of an approaching driver - and a convenient gap in the barriers - enabled Voight to avert a horrific crash. But it left him shaken. He went to his GP who assured him it was a one-off. </p> <p>\"He should have warned me then,\" says Voight. \"He knew my age. But I soon realised my driving ability was failing. I was no longer thinking quickly and had trouble noticing the signs. After more close shaves I finally thought, 'That's enough.' I took my car to an auction, sold it and that was that. People often say, 'I can't do without my car.' But it's no argument - not when you consider your safety and that of other people.\" </p> <p>Ask an elderly driver to recall their fondest motoring memories and it's unlikely they'll select any from the past few decades. Gone are the days of not seeing another car for miles. The generation who passed their driving tests in the post-war years have had to become accustomed to motorway gridlock, road rage, tailgating and a whopping 10-fold increase in road traffic. </p> <p>But new research suggests that modern-day motoring is taking its toll on elderly drivers. Studies are showing that intimidation, lack of confidence and declining ability are forcing many elderly drivers off the road altogether. And with the elderly population expected to soar in the next 20 years, steps are now being taken to ensure safer motoring for the \"baby boomer\" elderly drivers of the future. </p> <p>According to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), elderly drivers are involved in as many accidents per mile as 25 year-olds. This is partly due to elderly motorists driving predominantly on local urban roads, which have the worst safety record. Another recent study commissioned by the Automobile Association has found that elderly drivers have particular problems turning at road junctions. </p> <p>\"The crushing message for older drivers is that, in spite of all their fears about motorways and busy traffic, it's the right-hand turn that is their biggest enemy,\" says Andrew Howard, AA head of road safety. \"Older people feature highly in junction accidents. They seem to have trouble judging the speed of approaching vehicles and finding a gap between them to pull out. On today's busy roads, they are forced to take risks they are often not capable of achieving.\" </p> <p>It would be alarmist to suggest that elderly drivers are generally unsafe. Many older people are highly competent drivers with years of experience and Howard points out that few elderly drivers drive drunk or use their cars as machismo objects. </p> <p>But age inevitably slows us down. AA research shows that failing vision is the main reason elderly people stop driving. Eyes become more sensitive to headlight dazzle and take longer to focus back on the road. But deterioration of our faculties is often an insidious process - and some may not recognise a decline until too late. </p> <p>To help assess potential risks, the DETR is currently conducting a three-year study of elderly motorists' driving. One early finding is that elderly people restrict their motoring by avoiding busy town centres, unfamiliar routes and driving at night. Yet despite this self-regulation, many competent elderly drivers still become anxious about their driving. And this anxiety can reach a crisis point. </p> <p>\"I have worried myself so sick that I can't eat or sleep,\" says Dennis Cox, a 72-year-old retired sales manager. Ten years ago, he began worrying obsessively after journeys that he had jumped a red light or even killed a pedestrian without realising. The only way he can stop the worry is to retrace his journey to check for signs of imagined carnage. For Cox, an otherwise stable and jovial person, this obsessive worry has become a millstone around his neck. </p> <p>\"I realise it's irrational,\" he says. \"If you hit someone, you'd know about it. But I can't get that into my head. I once drove past a pub where there were young people coming out. I heard shouting and when I got home thought, 'Perhaps they were shouting because I hit someone.' I actually went back but, of course, there was no sign of anything.\" </p> <p>To quell this anxiety, Cox booked a refresher lesson. The instructor said his driving was good but that didn't help. Dennis now suspects that his pride about his 48-year clean driving record - and his fear of not being able to maintain it - may have contributed to his anxiety. </p> <p>Matthew Joint, AA behavioural psychologist, echoes Cox's suspicions. He is well aware of the anxiety that elderly drivers can experience. Retirement sometimes prompts people to dwell on things, he says, and driving is one of them. And such sufferers are predominantly male. \"Driving is an important part of many men's lives,\" he says. \"To realise they're not as good as they once were can be devastating. They've often dominated the driving for a long time. Sometimes their wives never learned. Then being unable to share the driving only increases the pressure. I've known people to go into panic attacks because of this.\" </p> <p>It's unlikely that the next generation of older men will experience this problem as, according to AA predictions, the number of elderly women drivers will double in the next 15 years. But this upcoming older generation will still suffer declining faculties. In anticipation of this, some local authorities are launching mature driver schemes. Devon county council has pioneered such courses, and other counties look set to follow. On them, drivers are encouraged to voice their concerns. One subject that always comes up, says instructor Mike Howell, is young drivers. </p> <p>\"They feel very intimidated by young drivers. I always stress it's nothing personal, just people leading busy lives. Roundabouts are another worry - hardly surprising as roundabouts didn't exist when many of them learned to drive.\" </p> <p>In August, the DETR will conclude its study and research is already under way to assess how road signs can be improved. But some fear these studies will ultimately lead nowhere. \"Yes, there's a lot of DETR research and some good learning taking place,\" says Peter Gimber, Devon county council head of road safety. \"But I fear the whole national issue of older drivers is in the tray marked 'Too difficult'.\" </p> <p>One finding is that many older drivers want to give up driving simply because it has become a chore. Eric Voight is one. While he misses the car for shopping, he does not miss the stress of driving through Manchester and having profane insults hurled at him by impatient boy racers. And he certainly does not miss worrying about landing himself or a pedestrian in hospital because of his lapsed concentration. </p> <p>\"I read recently about an elderly man who killed his wife backing out of their garage. Things like that strike a chord with me. Traffic in Manchester is horrendous nowadays and I can go anywhere by bus for 36p. So no, I don't miss it. I started driving at 17 and enjoyed the best years of motoring. That will do me.\"</p>",

And with the elderly population expected to soar in the next 20 years, steps are now being taken to ensure safer motoring for the \"baby boomer\" elderly drivers of the future. According to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), elderly drivers are involved in as many accidents per mile as 25 year-olds. This is partly due to elderly motorists driving predominantly on local urban roads, which have the worst safety record. Another recent study commissioned by the Automobile Association has found that elderly drivers have particular problems turning at road junctions. \"The crushing message for older drivers is that, in spite of all their fears about motorways and busy traffic, it's the right-hand turn that is their biggest enemy,\" says Andrew Howard, AA head of road safety. \"Older people feature highly in junction accidents. They seem to have trouble judging the speed of approaching vehicles and finding a gap between them to pull out. On today's busy roads, they are forced to take risks they are often not capable of achieving.\" It would be alarmist to suggest that elderly drivers are generally unsafe. Many older people are highly competent drivers with years of experience and Howard points out that few elderly drivers drive drunk or use their cars as machismo objects. But age inevitably slows us down. AA research shows that failing vision is the main reason elderly people stop driving. Eyes become more sensitive to headlight dazzle and take longer to focus back on the road. But deterioration of our faculties is often an insidious process - and some may not recognise a decline until too late. To help assess potential risks, the DETR is currently conducting a three-year study of elderly motorists' driving. One early finding is that elderly people restrict their motoring by avoiding busy town centres, unfamiliar routes and driving at night. Yet despite this self-regulation, many competent elderly drivers still become anxious about their driving. And this anxiety can reach a crisis point. \"I have worried myself so sick that I can't eat or sleep,\" says Dennis Cox, a 72-year-old retired sales manager. Ten years ago, he began worrying obsessively after journeys that he had jumped a red light or even killed a pedestrian without realising. The only way he can stop the worry is to retrace his journey to check for signs of imagined carnage. For Cox, an otherwise stable and jovial person, this obsessive worry has become a millstone around his neck. \"I realise it's irrational,\" he says. \"If you hit someone, you'd know about it. But I can't get that into my head. I once drove past a pub where there were young people coming out. I heard shouting and when I got home thought, 'Perhaps they were shouting because I hit someone.' I actually went back but, of course, there was no sign of anything.\" To quell this anxiety, Cox booked a refresher lesson. The instructor said his driving was good but that didn't help. Dennis now suspects that his pride about his 48-year clean driving record - and his fear of not being able to maintain it - may have contributed to his anxiety. Matthew Joint, AA behavioural psychologist, echoes Cox's suspicions. He is well aware of the anxiety that elderly drivers can experience. Retirement sometimes prompts people to dwell on things, he says, and driving is one of them. And such sufferers are predominantly male. \"Driving is an important part of many men's lives,\" he says. \"To realise they're not as good as they once were can be devastating. They've often dominated the driving for a long time. Sometimes their wives never learned. Then being unable to share the driving only increases the pressure. I've known people to go into panic attacks because of this.\" It's unlikely that the next generation of older men will experience this problem as, according to AA predictions, the number of elderly women drivers will double in the next 15 years. But this upcoming older generation will still suffer declining faculties. In anticipation of this, some local authorities are launching mature driver schemes. Devon county council has pioneered such courses, and other counties look set to follow. On them, drivers are encouraged to voice their concerns. One subject that always comes up, says instructor Mike Howell, is young drivers. \"They feel very intimidated by young drivers. I always stress it's nothing personal, just people leading busy lives. Roundabouts are another worry - hardly surprising as roundabouts didn't exist when many of them learned to drive.\" In August, the DETR will conclude its study and research is already under way to assess how road signs can be improved. But some fear these studies will ultimately lead nowhere. \"Yes, there's a lot of DETR research and some good learning taking place,\" says Peter Gimber, Devon county council head of road safety. \"But I fear the whole national issue of older drivers is in the tray marked 'Too difficult'.\" One finding is that many older drivers want to give up driving simply because it has become a chore. Eric Voight is one. While he misses the car for shopping, he does not miss the stress of driving through Manchester and having profane insults hurled at him by impatient boy racers. And he certainly does not miss worrying about landing himself or a pedestrian in hospital because of his lapsed concentration. \"I read recently about an elderly man who killed his wife backing out of their garage. Things like that strike a chord with me. Traffic in Manchester is horrendous nowadays and I can go anywhere by bus for 36p. So no, I don't miss it. I started driving at 17 and enjoyed the best years of motoring. That will do me.\"",

Although Straw may see feral children as the spectre haunting the country, the newly-empowered youth offending teams, set up to do joined-up law and order, don't think riotous tiny tots are the problem. No local child curfews have been is sued, according to the Home Office. Child safety orders, targeting prolific offenders under 10, have been used controversially to control a few infant offenders: boys. This is not surprising, because around 90% of young offenders are boys.</p> <p>But it is mothers, not men, who are being targeted for parenting orders. \"It was never intended that these orders should be used just on women,\" comments the manager of the youth offending team in one of the pilot areas for the community safety orders. But Straw's statute makes it \"quite difficult to get at the men\".</p> <p>Working with mothers has nevertheless revealed to youth offending teams in hard-pressed communities that what they need to do is not scold the mothers, but empower them. Something about which both Blair and Straw have been silent.</p> <p>In one area, all of the mothers under parenting orders were the victims of domestic violence and most had endured abuse in their own childhoods. Many mothers ultimately appreciate the parenting programme. After all, at last they are getting help. But some of the women dread the challenge to their relationships with men for whom no one but these women take responsibility.</p> <p>\"These boys have watched their mothers being beaten to hell by their fathers,\" says one YOT manager. \"They're all misogynists. We try to deal with these gender issues in an ongoing way but you can't undo the effect of 16 years of doctrine in a child's life very easily.\" Sometimes the objects of ASBOs are unfortunate souls whose mental health problems make them irritating or even menacing, but not necessarily criminal. Everyone expects them to breach their ASBO (a civil order), and thus face criminal sanctions. They can't be locked up for their habits, but they will be locked up for breaching their ASBOs.</p> <p>The home secretary invokes the \"broken windows\" theory imported from America, which proposes that if you prevent incivility you pre-empt serious crime. That's why he promotes ASBOs. Amazingly, despite the high profile of Straw's community safety orders, the Home Office can't tell us what kind of people - age, sex and race - are the subject of 80 or so ASBOs already issued, or the other orders introduced in pilot schemes.</p> <p>Former sports minister Tony Banks spotted the usual suspects in his comments on the football riots. Their only distinguishing features were that they were young, white and male - as if that explained the government's paralysis.</p> <p>But at least Banks was in the ballpark if not on the ball. It is snobbery as well as sexism that blind both Blair and Straw to the alchemy of mastery and masculinity - not morals or mothers - which creates football rioters and anti-social criminals and, lest we forget, New Labour lads.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Child safety orders, targeting prolific offenders under 10, have been used controversially to control a few infant offenders: boys. This is not surprising, because around 90% of young offenders are boys. But it is mothers, not men, who are being targeted for parenting orders. \"It was never intended that these orders should be used just on women,\" comments the manager of the youth offending team in one of the pilot areas for the community safety orders. But Straw's statute makes it \"quite difficult to get at the men\". Working with mothers has nevertheless revealed to youth offending teams in hard-pressed communities that what they need to do is not scold the mothers, but empower them. Something about which both Blair and Straw have been silent. In one area, all of the mothers under parenting orders were the victims of domestic violence and most had endured abuse in their own childhoods. Many mothers ultimately appreciate the parenting programme. After all, at last they are getting help. But some of the women dread the challenge to their relationships with men for whom no one but these women take responsibility. \"These boys have watched their mothers being beaten to hell by their fathers,\" says one YOT manager. \"They're all misogynists. We try to deal with these gender issues in an ongoing way but you can't undo the effect of 16 years of doctrine in a child's life very easily.\" Sometimes the objects of ASBOs are unfortunate souls whose mental health problems make them irritating or even menacing, but not necessarily criminal. Everyone expects them to breach their ASBO (a civil order), and thus face criminal sanctions. They can't be locked up for their habits, but they will be locked up for breaching their ASBOs. The home secretary invokes the \"broken windows\" theory imported from America, which proposes that if you prevent incivility you pre-empt serious crime. That's why he promotes ASBOs. Amazingly, despite the high profile of Straw's community safety orders, the Home Office can't tell us what kind of people - age, sex and race - are the subject of 80 or so ASBOs already issued, or the other orders introduced in pilot schemes. Former sports minister Tony Banks spotted the usual suspects in his comments on the football riots. Their only distinguishing features were that they were young, white and male - as if that explained the government's paralysis. But at least Banks was in the ballpark if not on the ball. It is snobbery as well as sexism that blind both Blair and Straw to the alchemy of mastery and masculinity - not morals or mothers - which creates football rioters and anti-social criminals and, lest we forget, New Labour lads. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>PC Danny Morgan was not looking for trouble when he walked into the village pub, but he had a funny feeling he would find it anyway.</p> <p>A group of Gypsies had been drinking in the London Inn, and their rowdy behaviour was disturbing the locals. The landlord sent for Danny, who lived with his wife and daughter in the police house close by. Minutes later PC Morgan was confronting the ringleader.</p> <p>\"I think you'd better leave now, don't you?\" said Danny. The Gypsy, a heavily-built amateur boxer, sneered. \"I have no reason to respect you,\" he replied. \"You wouldn't dare talk to me like that if you weren't wearing that uniform.\"</p> <p>PC Morgan realised he was in a spot of bother. There was no way he could call for reinforcements. Othery in Somerset is seven miles from the nearest town.</p> <p>The villagers in the pub that night were elderly, so back-up seemed unlikely. PC Morgan was, however, a proud local bobby, and he knew the community looked to him for leadership. Taking off his helmet and unbuttoning his tunic, he politely asked the man to leave again.</p> <p>Again, he refused. They stood toe to toe. Then...mayhem. Against the odds, PC Morgan, a muscular Welshman who played schoolboy international rugby, held his own. Eventually they separated. The Gypsy was the first to speak. He promised PC Morgan he would not cause any more trouble. \"I respect you now.\"</p> <p>The scrap is part of folklore in Othery, a village which dates back to Saxon times. The story is told with affection and probably some embellishment by Mervyn Winslade, who has lived in the village all his life. Mr Winslade, chairman of the parish council and churchwarden for 30 years, is trying to make a point. He has seen the character of the village change since PC Morgan was on patrol in the 1950s and 60s. It is a more nervous, untrusting place. Things, he says dolefully, are not what they used to be.</p> <p>The village policeman is now a policewoman, PC Rachael Cooke. She does not live in Othery - the police house was sold off several years ago. She is not even a beat bobby: Avon and Somerset has named its community officers \"beat managers\". PC Morgan rode a bicycle around his four parishes, covering between 10 and 15 miles a day. PC Cooke, 31, has a car to patrol 12 parishes. She drives up to 100 miles every day. \"She does her best, bless her heart,\" said Mr Winslade, 57, a farmer who sold his dairy herd last year.</p> <p>\"She's a lovely woman, and very efficient. But the area she covers is just too big for one person. When Danny lived in the village you could get hold of him day or night. He knew everyone by their first name. He was a deterrent to crime. I miss the sheer physical presence.\"</p> <p>Like everyone else in Othery, Mr Winslade yearns for a return to the way things were. But he is realistic enough to admit it will never happen because Othery is not a \"hot spot\". In policing terms, it is not even lukewarm.</p> <p>According to PC Cooke and her supervisor, Sergeant Steve Crago, there were only 30 reported crimes in Othery between June last year and May - no major incidents and only two burglaries. The figure was a big increase on the previous year, when 21 were reported. But 1998/99 was a blip. Crime rates, it seems, have been constant over the past decade. Sgt Crago says more than a quarter of crimes in Othery are solved, the highest detection rate of the surrounding rural areas.</p> <p><b> Move from CID</b><br></p> <p>PC Cooke moved from the rough and tumble of CID five months ago after having a child. She struggled to think of any significant crimes. Land Rover thefts and the occasional assault - one every four months or so - were as bad as it got. There had been no robberies, but she had chased a flock of runaway sheep off the A39. \"I'm not being facetious, but this is a community where kids kicking the heads off begonias is considered a serious matter.\"</p> <p>PC Cooke and Sgt Crago do not want to play down the importance of country crime, but they believe it has to be put in context.</p> <p>\"The fear of crime in a place like Othery is huge, but the number of crimes committed is really very small,\" said PC Cooke. \"The two are out of all proportion. The villagers fear they are isolated, and that if anything happens, the police will not be able to get to them quick enough. I can understand that. There isn't a bobby living in the village any more, that's true. But if there was a 999 emergency, the force could get someone out from Bridgwater very swiftly.\"</p> <p>She said she spent most of her time advising villagers about crime prevention. \"If you are going to do the flowers in your back garden, don't leave the windows open at the front, because that's asking for trouble. Lock your front door when you go out. It sounds obvious to people who live in the city, but in Othery people have grown up with a different way of life. They think differently. They need reassurance, as much as anything else.\"</p> <p>Mr Winslade did not accept that fear of crime was all in the mind. Crime rates, he said, were much higher than the police thought. \"Many villagers won't report petty thefts. They can't see the point. They don't want to bother Rachael with minor things when they know she is so busy.\" Tonya Maisey, 39, who runs the village bakery, agreed. The shop had been broken into twice in recent months, but she reported it only once. Then her daughter Ellanor's car was vandalised. \"Let's face it, we are easy pickings for criminals who come from town centres.\"</p> <p>The 12th century church, St Michael's, is closed during the day, following thefts; the last straw was the disappearance of a brass ewer. When the organist started looking for it during a spring clean, she found \u00a325 and a note of apology from the thief - proof the village is not just a target for teenagers.</p> <p>And there are crimes that hardly register on a graph at police headquarters, but are devastating to the victim and the spirit of the community.</p> <p>May Tottle was a widower who had lived in the village all her life. When a girl knocked on her door and asked for help to find a 50p she had lost, May, who was in her 70s, went out to help. Meanwhile, an accomplice sneaked inside, and stole her pension money and her jewellery. May was unhurt, but heartbroken. She died in hospital soon after.</p> <p>At the moment, the village is in a state of mild panic about the newcomers living at Peppard's Cottage, a thatched house on the high street. At first, the late vicar told everyone he thought students from a nearby farming college had moved in. After some cars went missing and a boy was spotted perched dangerously on the roof, the parish council became suspicious. Neighbours discovered the cottage was owned by an organisation called Families Care Ltd, which provides foster and residential care for young people, including youths with criminal records. \"You can imagine the fuss this caused!\" howled Mrs Maisey. \"Most of the elderly people who live here feel more vulnerable than ever.\"</p> <p>Fifty people went to last month's parish council meeting to protest, one of the highest turnouts in years. \"Normally, we don't get a soul,\" said Mr Winslade. By law, Families Care had no obligation to tell the village what it was doing, but secrecy made things worse. \"We tend to get blamed for everything now, which is quite unfair,\" said its spokesman, Roger Perry.</p> <p><b> Fear of crime</b><br></p> <p>The police accept the fear of crime in places like Othery is genuine.

The warden will have a police radio, uniform and a car. \"It will probably be an old police car of some sort, but without the flashing blue lights and sirens,\" said Mr Jones. \"We'll give them on-the-job training. What the warden needs most, though, is a suitcase full of commonsense.\"</p> <p>He promised the warden would not replace the beat manager. \"The resources for community policing are ring-fenced. Hopefully, the wardens will be the eyes and ears of the local officers.

Members of the white supremacist group Combat 18 are also expected to join in the week of protest.

But for two men who should be better than most at getting their stories straight, Hall and Max Clifford are strangely at odds over how their deliciously subversive relationship was consummated. </p> <p>While Clifford is being photographed on the other side of his new office suite, Hall says the PR guru was on the phone with a job offer as soon as news began to spread of his sacking from the editorship of the News of the World. Later, after Hall departs for a meeting with a prominent Labour peer, Clifford's version is the exact opposite - Hall called him.

He said: 'Come and see me.' We went for a coffee, and we sat and talked and he said: 'You know, there's a job for you here.'\") Clifford's side of the story is merely scribbled down the old-fashioned way in a notebook. (\"Phil phoned me up and said: 'I'd like to come and work with you.'\") </p> <p>Were this a real PR crisis, it would require a classic piece of Clifford damage limitation. Clifford, for example, could claim to have been misquoted, or to have \"mis-remembered\". Hall, perhaps, might claim that events on the day of his dismissal from Wapping had become blurred. Doubtless there would be a joint statement denouncing \"press mischief-making\". </p> <p>But perhaps not: for having indulged in mischief-making of the highest order for the past five years, Hall could hardly chastise another journalist for it. Indeed, this will be the test of his mettle as a PR: will he be able to rise above the inevitable frustration at not being on the other end of the phone? Hall believes he will. \"I think PR is fascinating. In the past 10 years it has been transformed by Max, in particular, but also people such as Alastair Campbell, Tim Bell - they're only doing what Max has been doing for the past 25 years. He has made PR fashionable when it was once scorned.\" </p> <p>Hall will be a \"media consultant\" to Clifford, although there is no suggestion that he will be anything other than involved at the heart of the firm. \"I'm going to do a lot of the stories for him, but also I want get into the PR. Everybody thinks OJ Simpson, celebrities, showbiz; but he's got this refugee group, a group that runs homes for refugees, he's got an internet company, and a new landmining venture which will wipe out miles of landmines a day. I've been doing a lot of frothy showbiz stuff and to do something that's worthy and worthwhile is great.\" </p> <p>Despite the worthy words, there is little doubt that Hall will be at the centre of the big showbiz scandals. At the NoW, many of the biggest scoops came from Clifford's clients, and Hall's intimate knowledge about what newspapers want from those sorts of stories will be put to profitable use. \"Half of my time is still going to be journalism because I will be able to devote more time to leverage stories. For example, a former PA to Naomi Campbell came into Max's office, and he sold her story to the News of the World. But with a bit more time, there could have been a TV show, there could be a great mag azine feature on being a PA to a supermodel. It's about making the story work better for us, and for the client.\" </p> <p>For the past five years, though, it has been about making the stories work best for the News of the World. His abrupt dismissal a month ago came as a surprise, as much to Hall as to the rest of the newspaper world. During his tenure, the NoW broke numerous exclusives. Crucially, however, sales continued to fall, and when the figures dropped below 4m, it seems that Hall's time was up. </p> <p>\"I was surprised, because we had improved the market share and I'd won seven awards in five years, but I can't say I was shocked, because the average life expectancy of an editor of the News of the World was 14 months. I always knew that one day we would part company.\" </p> <p>But when the time came, it was a poignant moment. Hall had no inkling, but when Les Hinton, the News International executive chairman, called him in on June 23, it was not to give him a pay rise. Both, says Hall, were close to tears. \"Les is a friend, and he had as much of a lump in his throat as I had. It was bizarre, we were hardly talking really. He said he was really sorry. There was no reason given, he just said it was time for a change. That happens in newspapers. </p> <p>\"Later I was speaking to Roy Evans, the former Liverpool manager, and he said: 'I was building a great Liverpool team, but we didn't win the championship and we didn't win the FA Cup.' That's what newspapers are like, you can build a great newspaper, get all the exclusives, improve the market share but if you don't win the FA Cup, ie you don't get the circulation up, you don't stay. Every editor knows it's going to come to them some time, and I knew that sooner or later it would come to me.\" </p> <p>On the subject of his 31-year-old successor, Rebekah Wade, Hall is diplomatic. \"I think she's doing fine. She's doing the great important stories. Sex, drugs and rock'n'roll, balanced with politics, which is what Rupert [Murdoch] always wanted.\" </p> <p>Wade was Hall's first deputy on the NoW. \"Rebekah is a protegee of mine. I backed her all the way, pushed her, and she pushed me - we were as thick as thieves. To be replaced by her is great. If it was a stranger, I'd feel a bit different about it. If you are going to pass the crown on to somebody, you'd rather pass it to somebody who you'd helped, brought along, so I'm proud.\" </p> <p> There is a sense, however, that although Hall does not say so - indeed, he would emphatically deny it - he thinks that Wade has demonstrated her inexperience. There is, for instance, the PCC complaint from St James's Palace over apparently unauthorised pictures of Prince William published by Wade, a decision other commentators feel to have been misguided. Hall is careful not to get drawn into the row, saying only: \"That was an interesting call.\" One feels that had it been down to Hall to make the call, he would probably have printed the pictures, but might have handled the story in a different way. We will never know: Hall won't discuss it, and the matter is now with Lord Wakeham. </p> <p>When it comes to his own mistakes, Hall is more open. He believes there was one error of judgment, and one error of taste. The first, of course, is the Gary Glitter affair. During the singer's trial on paedophile charges, it emerged that the News of the World had agreed to pay the key witness for her story if Glitter was convicted. The trial judge heavily criticised the deal, and Glitter was acquitted - the worst moment of my editing career, says Hall - only to be sentenced later the same day on charges of downloading images of child pornography from the internet. Hall insists that the deal was perfectly innocent - there would have been no point in publishing the woman's story if the court found it not to have been substantiated - but admits it was a mistake. He also concedes that publishing the salacious details of the affair of a Coronation Street star surpassed the boundaries of good taste. </p> <p>But the gloom of the crises was far outweighed by the glory of the triumphs. The greatest moment? \"Jeffrey Archer, really, when he resigned that day. That was obviously a huge story.\" Showing that the NoW was not just about showbiz froth, the paper was first with the story that he had attempted to persuade a friend to lie on oath in court. The revelation forced the former Tory party chairman to give up his ambitions to be mayor of London. </p> <p>Hall insists, however, that editing a tabloid newspaper - especially one that goes as close to the wire as the NoW - is no easy ride. The pressures are more intense than ever: on the one hand, the market is shrinking, forcing editors to demand bigger exclusives, saucier scandals. On the other, in a climate where privacy laws are rarely far from the press regulation agenda, there is more pressure than ever on newspapers to justify their stories. \"Justification is a really hard thing, it's very subjective. Somebody would think it's justified to do Lord Levy and his tax problems. Other people would say what's the justification in that? If he didn't break the law what's the justification? It's a really difficult call.\" </p> <p>In the Coronation Street affair, the star objected to having intimate details of her sex life splashed across a double-page spread without her consent. But if that principle was taken to an extreme, says Hall, no one could write an autobiography until all those mentioned had agreed. </p> <p>Was it, for example, justified to print details of Robin Cook's extra- marital affair? \"I thought, 'I don't know, are we justified here or not?' I went to Alastair Campbell and said: 'This is the situation, I don't think we're going to run it, unless Robin Cook wants to talk about it. But if I don't run it, maybe somebody else will, there's a freelance involved. It's up to you.' Alastair came back and said: 'I know how you work, run it straight please,' which was a fair quid pro quo, and that's what I did.\" </p> <p>So does that mean it was justified to reveal the homosexuality of the Tory MP Michael Brown? \"We threatened him with a rent boy. We said: 'A young man has come to us and told us this story. We've got no evidence, but he's going round telling this story. Do you want to talk about it? If it's out there maybe it would be better for you, it's your call.' Two hours later, there was the statement, admitting it all. Now, I don't know, it's a hard situation because people don't have a right necessarily to know he's gay, I don't know, my view is that it doesn't matter. But it maybe left him open to blackmail, and attacks on his credibility. Those sorts of decisions come every day.\" </p> <p>Now on the other side of the fence, Hall knows that it will be different kinds of decisions that will plague him daily. For a start, Hall wants Sky News in the new offices into which they move today. Until now, in the cramped and cluttered rooms where he has worked for the past 30 years, Clifford has been happy to make do with the fuzzy picture on his standard set, with its aerial balanced on one side. So Clifford's long-time PA is perplexed at Hall's request - she is used to working for a traditionalist. (\"When are the GPO coming?\" Clifford had inquired of her, earlier, as he inspected the telephone lines in his new premises.) </p> <p>Hall persists for a while, before realising he's not getting his message across. He gives up for now, promising to \"sort it out next week\". Sooner or later, multi-channel television will come to the Clifford empire. There is a sense that some things are going to change, and Hall is relishing the challenge. \"I've been in journalism for 27 years. It's so different that it's frightening and exciting at the same time. It's the best stimulant there is.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Depending on your perspective, the demise of Minx magazine was either a loss of nerve about the best thing to happen to women's publishing since Helen Gurley-Brown, or the timely end of an outdated fad. </p> <p>Emap's reticence on the reasons for the closure is deafening. In a statement, Emap Elan Network's chief executive Barry McIlheney said Minx had \"failed to find a sales figure high enough to make the magazine financially sustainable\". The last magazine ABCs in February showed the title's sales had slipped 18.2% in the previous 12 months, but it was still achieving sales of 123,278. Emap has promised to find jobs within the company for the staff, under editor Vanessa Thompson, and the magazine will gasp its last in August. So what went wrong? </p> <p>At first glance it's not obviously apparent why Emap should want to close a magazine still selling 120,000 copies a month. </p> <p>Minx was launched in 1996 under editor Toni Rogers with an edgy \u00a31.5m TV and poster ad campaign and a brief to go after \"girls who don't buy magazines\", according to Sam Baker, who edited the magazine between April and December 1998 and now edits Company: \"The girls who bought Minx always made up a very specific market - girls who bought Diesel jeans, girls who went clubbing and who didn't necessarily have time for other women's magazines.\" Arriving in the wake of the ladette movement, it steered an uncertain path somewhere between the locker-room sexual obsession of more! and the aspirational intelligence of Marie Claire. </p> <p>Minx's sexual explicitness and \"upfront\" approach to subjects like drugs brought it into a few predictable brushes with controversy, notably a slapped wrist from drugs czar Keith Hellawell after \"recommending\" its readers try an \"ecstasy-style\" drug called BOD. The editorial described the drug as \"hip\" and said, with its tongue firmly in its cheek, that it will deliver \"inner strength, good humour and contentedness\". </p> <p>Minx's response to the criticism, that \"our readers can make up their own minds\", seemed to encapsulate its approach; that readers were big and ugly enough to appreciate the discrepancy between the received wisdom peddled by women's magazines on health and lifestyle issues and the way young women were increasingly choosing to live. This was backed up by a more leftfield approach to fashion, plus articles extolling the virtues of the scooter as a status symbol offering a refreshing alternative to the standard interiors shoots, and thoughtful - if explicit - writing on sexual encounters. </p> <p>The magazine's ethos was built around kicking back at the narcissism that it believed characterised the women's market. </p> <p>Polly Vernon, a former staffer, wrote in the Guardian following the spat between Marie Claire's Liz Jones and Sam Baker over magazines' responsibility for anorexia: \"I write for Minx, a women's magazine whose proposition bounces between a desire to be smart and funny and irreverent and feelgood and also aspirational, glamorous and just that little bit prettier than anyone has a right to be. The point that Jones and Baker are missing [in slinging mud about whether women's magazines contribute to or alleviate anorexia] is that women's magazines are not about helping women feel better. Quite the opposite. They're silly, vacant, extravagant and often cruel. Like the fashion industry, they can't help themselves.\" Minx's subtext, laced with a liberal helping of fashion and lifestyle, was about trying to help women feel better. The irony of its closure, in the week after the launch of Tessa Jowell's anti-anorexia taskforce, will not be lost on any of its former staff. </p> <p>Or that, at least, was the grand plan. But, for one former staffer, the Minx experience is a salutary lesson in why pressure from advertisers means it's virtually impossible to create a women's magazine that does help women feel better. \"There was this constant feeling that we were trying to make a success of going for a 'naughty niche' but not having the balls to really go for it,\" says the journalist, who prefers to remain anonymous. \"As with all consumer magazines, it wasn't about the copy; it was about the relationships with advertisers. There were a number of occasions when we were told not to do this or that so as not to upset the people from Chanel. I remember once we had an article about female ejaculation. I took it to show the editor of the time and she was absolutely terrified,\" the journalist recalls. \"She told me to go away and de-quim it a bit. Minx was a missed opportunity. There was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm around its launch. But that rapidly disappeared.\" </p> <p>Other observers believe Minx's ladette tag came to be an albatross. \"It was too tough for its market,\" says Rita Lewis, director of publishing at Emap Elan rival IPC Southbank. \"At the age it was pitched to, you've got to be pretty confident to go for that sort of lifestyle proposition.\" At any rate, the magazine never achieved the sales figures of 200,000 it aimed for at launch. </p> <p>Minx's competitors in the young adult market, including Nat Mags' Company and IPC's 19, also saw significant falls in sales in the last ABCs - 16% to 242,180 and 26.9% to 126,606 respectively. At the ABC launch, the big magazine publishing houses - Emap, IPC, Attic Futura and Nat Mags - all conceded that the market has become more competitive. The success stories this year have tended to come from the older, glossier end of the sector. IPC's relaunched Woman's Journal added 20.4% to sales, while Marie Claire and Cosmopolitan maintained a relative stability at 450,000 and 470,000 respectively. </p> <p>The teen market has also seen a loss in sales across the board. The total circulation of this lucrative market experienced a 10.6% slump in year-on-year sales between December 1998 and December 1999 from 3.21m to 2.87m. In February, Emap Elan closed the teenage title Big after sales fell below the 100,000 mark. Bliss's circulation also fell 14.6% to 287,796. </p> <p>Lewis says magazine sales are falling at an unprecedented rate in the teen and glossy sectors. \"As a total market, the women's sector is extremely tough, and in decline at the moment. Over the past few years, the increased coverage in the nationals of a range of women's issues is eating into what used to be the exclusive preserve of the glossies.\" </p> <p>She thinks the young adult market is having a particularly tough time, caught between the teen and glossy sectors. \"The glossy market has a much larger ad base, so it can afford to get away with lower cover sales. The younger magazines, titles like Minx, B and Sugar, have to sell far more copies because the ad base is much smaller.\" </p> <p>She says Minx's sales would have been sustainable with a title pitched at an older market, but \"in that sector you'd need to be selling somewhere around the 150,000 mark to make the magazine financially sustainable\". And 150,000 is small fry for magazines like Sugar, which was still shifting a healthy 430,217 in the last ABCs. </p> <p>B, launched a year after Minx, was deliberately positioned as an alternative to ladette magazines and is now selling 223,532 copies per month - almost 100,000 more than Minx. Baker is not surprised that B is doing better than Minx. \"Minx was not editorially consistent,\" she says. Gina Johnson, editor in chief of B, agrees that Minx's lack of editorial cohesiveness was its downfall. \"Minx was one of the original 'ladette' magazines and had gone from that to being an aspirational, fashion-based magazine. But it couldn't successfully make the transition.\" </p> <p>Baker adds: \"As a style magazine for girls within a limited market, Minx was successful, but Emap wanted a big-circulation, mainstream magazine.\" She believes that it suffered increasingly from an identity crisis, caught between the upbeat, sex-obsessed world of the teen titles and a desire to break into what she describes as \"the freedom years market\", over which Company still exercises a tenuous hold. </p> <p>Interestingly, Emap Elan's more!, which pitches its equally explicit content at a younger market, is still holding its own at 300,000 sales. Lewis thinks more! succeeds where Minx failed partly because of the younger market and partly because it \"takes itself less seriously\". Vernon thinks Minx fell down on the editorial pitch. \"People never quite understood that Minx wasn't a teenage magazine.\" </p> <p>Is it OK to be rude and lewd in the teenage market but not after you hit 20? Magazine marketing wisdom certainly seems to suggest that consumers and advertisers expect a degree of gravitas to kick in as you move from the teen to the young adult market. </p> <p>In the larger scheme of things, Emap may regard the demise of Minx as necessary damage incurred in the longer-term battle it faces - to position itself for the internet. Last November the company created a subsidiary, Emap Digital, designed to focus on developing magazine brands into online ones, and in March it was spun off. Emap Digital is working with Channel 4 on interactive content for the teen market for a broadband interactive service - believed to be a joint venture with BT. Its new projects department, elanInvent, is thought to be working on several pre-teen projects. </p> <p>When it announced the restructuring, Emap said its future strategy for its offline magazine brands meant \"money [will only be] invested where there is a substantial opportunity to create value\" through digital opportunities. The company's sales staff now sell across print and digital media. Staff working on the company's less successful consumer magazine brands are nervous about a future where a magazine will have to demonstrate not only its capability of delivering sales, but its viability as an online brand. Magazines like Heat and Sky, which occupy the cross-gender lifestyle market, are thought to be being watched, hawk-like, for signs of further sales decline. Heat, which recorded an ABC of 72,510 is undergoing a makeover to help it appeal more to the female marketplace, and rumours abound within Emap that Sky's days are numbered after the magazine shed 24% of its sales. </p> <p>As B's Johnson notes: \"The single most important factor in the survival of a magazine brand is how easily it can be leveraged across different platforms. This means more than just taking magazine content and dumping it online, it means a magazine will have to have strong editorial concepts which will also lend themselves to online sales opportunities and interactive concepts.\" She thinks that the market for offline magazine launches has also become more cut-throat. \"The shelf life for a women's magazine is a lot shorter today and companies need to be constantly thinking about launching new products.\" </p> <p>For Polly Vernon, as for other former staff, it's \"desperately sad\". \"The editorial team was made up of hugely talented people and the failure was no reflection on the editorial product. It's a tragic indictment of the women's magazine market that Minx didn't work and the market will be the worse for it.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Depending on your perspective, the demise of Minx magazine was either a loss of nerve about the best thing to happen to women's publishing since Helen Gurley-Brown, or the timely end of an outdated fad. Emap's reticence on the reasons for the closure is deafening. In a statement, Emap Elan Network's chief executive Barry McIlheney said Minx had \"failed to find a sales figure high enough to make the magazine financially sustainable\". The last magazine ABCs in February showed the title's sales had slipped 18.2% in the previous 12 months, but it was still achieving sales of 123,278. Emap has promised to find jobs within the company for the staff, under editor Vanessa Thompson, and the magazine will gasp its last in August. So what went wrong? At first glance it's not obviously apparent why Emap should want to close a magazine still selling 120,000 copies a month. Minx was launched in 1996 under editor Toni Rogers with an edgy \u00a31.5m TV and poster ad campaign and a brief to go after \"girls who don't buy magazines\", according to Sam Baker, who edited the magazine between April and December 1998 and now edits Company: \"The girls who bought Minx always made up a very specific market - girls who bought Diesel jeans, girls who went clubbing and who didn't necessarily have time for other women's magazines.\" Arriving in the wake of the ladette movement, it steered an uncertain path somewhere between the locker-room sexual obsession of more! and the aspirational intelligence of Marie Claire. Minx's sexual explicitness and \"upfront\" approach to subjects like drugs brought it into a few predictable brushes with controversy, notably a slapped wrist from drugs czar Keith Hellawell after \"recommending\" its readers try an \"ecstasy-style\" drug called BOD. The editorial described the drug as \"hip\" and said, with its tongue firmly in its cheek, that it will deliver \"inner strength, good humour and contentedness\". Minx's response to the criticism, that \"our readers can make up their own minds\", seemed to encapsulate its approach; that readers were big and ugly enough to appreciate the discrepancy between the received wisdom peddled by women's magazines on health and lifestyle issues and the way young women were increasingly choosing to live. This was backed up by a more leftfield approach to fashion, plus articles extolling the virtues of the scooter as a status symbol offering a refreshing alternative to the standard interiors shoots, and thoughtful - if explicit - writing on sexual encounters. The magazine's ethos was built around kicking back at the narcissism that it believed characterised the women's market. Polly Vernon, a former staffer, wrote in the Guardian following the spat between Marie Claire's Liz Jones and Sam Baker over magazines' responsibility for anorexia: \"I write for Minx, a women's magazine whose proposition bounces between a desire to be smart and funny and irreverent and feelgood and also aspirational, glamorous and just that little bit prettier than anyone has a right to be. The point that Jones and Baker are missing [in slinging mud about whether women's magazines contribute to or alleviate anorexia] is that women's magazines are not about helping women feel better. Quite the opposite. They're silly, vacant, extravagant and often cruel. Like the fashion industry, they can't help themselves.\" Minx's subtext, laced with a liberal helping of fashion and lifestyle, was about trying to help women feel better. The irony of its closure, in the week after the launch of Tessa Jowell's anti-anorexia taskforce, will not be lost on any of its former staff. Or that, at least, was the grand plan. But, for one former staffer, the Minx experience is a salutary lesson in why pressure from advertisers means it's virtually impossible to create a women's magazine that does help women feel better. \"There was this constant feeling that we were trying to make a success of going for a 'naughty niche' but not having the balls to really go for it,\" says the journalist, who prefers to remain anonymous. \"As with all consumer magazines, it wasn't about the copy; it was about the relationships with advertisers. There were a number of occasions when we were told not to do this or that so as not to upset the people from Chanel. I remember once we had an article about female ejaculation. I took it to show the editor of the time and she was absolutely terrified,\" the journalist recalls. \"She told me to go away and de-quim it a bit. Minx was a missed opportunity. There was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm around its launch. But that rapidly disappeared.\" Other observers believe Minx's ladette tag came to be an albatross. \"It was too tough for its market,\" says Rita Lewis, director of publishing at Emap Elan rival IPC Southbank. \"At the age it was pitched to, you've got to be pretty confident to go for that sort of lifestyle proposition.\" At any rate, the magazine never achieved the sales figures of 200,000 it aimed for at launch. Minx's competitors in the young adult market, including Nat Mags' Company and IPC's 19, also saw significant falls in sales in the last ABCs - 16% to 242,180 and 26.9% to 126,606 respectively.

      "body": "<p>Last week United, the media conglomerate that owns Express newspapers, unveiled a copper-bottomed \u00a3300m strategy for its new-media division, Xilerate. Hot on its heels, News International is about to go public with its substantial growth plans for News Network. Both, along with Trinity Mirror, which recently pledged a \u00a3150m online investment, are manoeuvring to become the dominant players in an increasingly heavyweight new-media arena. </p> <p>Not so long ago, their online plans were looking pretty sketchy compared to Associated New Media, Guardian Unlimited, or even Hollinger Digital, who were all early adopters (Hollinger as early as 1994), but the pecking order is changing as the nature of online publishing is changing. The last six months have provided the steepest learning curve yet for newspaper publishers trying to swing their weight online. </p> <p>A new report from PriceWaterhouseCoopers, entitled New Directions in European Publishing, outlines some of the critical issues they face: the breakneck pace of technological innovation and the proliferation of new platforms; declining loyalty in the consumer marketplace; the increasing demand (driven by the industry) for customisation and personalisation. Add to this the prospect of depleting print-ad revenues as the money moves into interactive marketing, online 24-hour media cornering the market for breaking news and the dangerously catchy trend for pan-global mergers such as those between Liberty Media and United GlobalCom, Time Warner and AOL, and most publishers have good reason for sleeping with the door open and the light on, for fear of being eaten. </p> <p>Oh yes, the romantic days of newspaper publishing - the ones that only ever really existed in movies like Citizen Kane - have gone. This is the era of \"strategic authoring\" (extending the brand across all platforms into commerce, insurance and even theme parks), \"cannibalisation\" (bulk reappropriation of original content for your own and others' websites) and \"monetisation\" (turning your loyal customers into cash cows). The latter is the one that is keeping publishers awake at night. </p> <p>But with the age of interactive consumption comes increased consumer power. The future, according to PriceWaterhouseCoopers, is about \"reaching the consumer community with what the customer wants via the channel the consumer wants to use\", or, to use their three commandments on the road to convergence: \"Content, Community and Commerce\". In order to keep reader loyalty, publishers are having to segment their readerships and extend their services into new areas such as commerce, retail and goods delivery. Electronic customer relationship management (eCRM), a constant response service, is the new science in publishing. </p> <p>Since all publishers are in the same boat (what are newspapers if not broad portals?), the report concludes, they need to identify their strengths, to ask questions such as: are we trade or consumer? Regional or global? Do we form a stand-alone division to sell off or keep it in-house? </p> <p>Xilerate, News Network and Trinity Mirror are compensating for their late entry by focusing on commerce and internet services. The good news for the tabloid publishers is that the C2 market (think mum with five kids in KwikSave) is the fastest-growing on the internet, and it will be even more so with interactive TV and wireless. \"It's a good market for e-commerce, promising strong revenue streams,\" says Matt Jellicoe, marketing director of Express Online. </p> <p>Xilerate is a five-headed commercial hydra. The first division is Business to Consumer, which includes such brands as dotmusic.com, lads' portal Megastar, parenting site allaboutparents.com, youth entertainment site Rapture and interactive site Exchange &amp; Mart. A number of other lifestyle sites are mooted. </p> <p>\"United News and Media has gained its position by stealth - no one saw it coming,\" says Jellicoe. \"Dotmusic is well ahead of nme.com, and Line One [the business's second division] is Britain's second biggest ISP. Behind the scenes we've been developing very strong products. Look at Megastar, which had no marketing whatsoever and has grown organically to 250,000 unique users and 10 million page impressions.\" Megastar will benefit from the \u00a39m advertising spend that United is discussing. </p> <p>The other three divisions of Xilerate - Business 2 Business (an investment of \u00a3120m), Xilerate Ventures, a fledgling external investments division, and E Services, which includes web hosting, media sales and a raft of technical and \"back end\" support services - ensure that everything can be done cheaply in-house. Xilerate generated \u00a333m in 1999 and revenues are expected to reach \u00a3350m-\u00a3500m by 2004. </p> <p>Commerce, Consolidation and Convergence are the three Cs that Xilerate follows. \"We have excellent PC and TV skills but we don't have wireless skills. Broadband is our weakest point but today that is where the opportunity is greatest,\" said CEO Andrew Nugee recently. Xilerate is currently in discussion with a mobile phone operator (thought to be Vodafone Airtouch) about partnering to exploit its existing gaming and betting service. </p> <p>Meanwhile, News Network has been as cagey as United has been perspicacious. Following analysts' reports which suggested that the online versions of the Times and the Sun were failing to provide an adequate service to their customers, there was a tentative revamp back in May and rumours have been circulating that the company is investing in a 24-hour interactive news portal, thereby taking on the BBC. </p> <p>A large portion of the proposed investment will be going straight into \"shop\" sites. According to Brett Miller, head of e-commerce activities at NN and general manager of its auction site fired-up.com, 15 sites are being planned, ranging from finance to cookery, which will be \"tailored to the consumer with retail buying opportunities\". Unlike Associated, which has entered into a partnership with Zoom, NN aims to own as much of the transactional process as possible. </p> <p>Trinity Mirror has a different tack. Earlier this year it announced the rolling-out of 16 localised \"ic\" portals around the UK, covering news, sports and entertainment, all offshoots of the central revenue-driving ic portal and ISP ic24, which currently has 450,000 customers (target 900,000 by the end of the year). Managing director David Clarke recognises that with 152 local newspaper titles, Trinity Mirror's main strength is in cornering local online habits and advertising revenues. In addition, four more portals are imminent - icShowbiz, icChoice, icSport and icTravel - and there will be \"substantial\" investment in interactive TV and mobile phone applications. </p> <p>\"We are the consumer's champion,\" says Clarke. \"As a consumer portal we are far ahead of the other newspaper groups.\" This year, \u00a320m will be spent on targeting new customers. The online versions of the group's papers, including the Mirror, Daily Record and Sunday Mirror, register only faintly in the corporate strategy; Clarke sees his main competitors as being Yahoo, Freeserve and MSN. </p> <p>But where does all this leave Hollinger Telegraph, Guardian Unlimited and Associated New Media? Money is not in short supply at two-year-old ANM - revenues were up nearly 300% on the first half of last year - but Associated has opted to focus on its areas of expertise, building up This Is London (which draws on the strengths of the London Evening Standard and Metro), the recruitment site BigBlueDog and This Is Money, a new personal finance portal. UKPlus, the net directory, also appears to be performing well. </p> <p> ANM's showcase site, charlotte-street.com, has lagged dangerously behind in the women's portal race, however, despite a partnership with the shopping portal Zoom. According to Kevin Beatty, chief operating officer of Associated News Media, it will receive a big cash injection which will \"take it on to a higher plane\", but it also will be brought back into the fold of the Daily Mail, \"in order to get the best of both worlds\". In other words, a rebranding is on the cards. </p> <p>Hollinger Digital, which includes the Electronic Telegraph, Handbag and Interactive Investor, has been preoccupied with upgrading its outdated technology (at a cost of \u00a310m) and getting outside hosting, to the detriment of its business development plans. Now the division is future-proof, however, it can start to concentrate on content under the new editorial direction of former Independent on Sunday editor Kim Fletcher. </p> <p>The Telegraph Sport site will be upgraded in August and money, travel, jobs, property and motoring are next up for exploitation, at a projected cost of \u00a330m-\u00a350m. \"It would be easy to say that if we'd made the big investments in '98 we would be in better shape, but the market just wasn't big enough then,\" says managing director Hugo Drayton. </p> <p>Drayton is aware that the only way to \"take on the big guys\" is to partner up - a policy it made public in April - but he is confident: \"You can't just buy reputation, trust and brand strength overnight, and we can carry those over. We recognise that our key competence is editing, writing and presentation. How we make money out of that is today's and tomorrow's challenge.\" </p> <p>Hollinger's strategy will echo Guardian Unlimited's: push content out simultaneously to print and websites and aim for \"scalable, organic growth\". GU's traffic has reached 14.5m page impressions per month, and a media portal launches in September. \"There is an enormous amount of investment going on among our competitors and we have to double our efforts,\" says GU head Simon Waldman. \"But how much you spend and how big you look is not as important as what you do and whether you spend that money efficiently.\" </p> <p>Waldman is sceptical about the late- comers' ability to catch up. \"Traditionally, media companies have been able to come in late and be bigger, but that doesn't work any more. Look at Yahoo: they are now almost as big as News Corp, where once News Corp considered buying them.\" By scaling up their new media assets, Trinity, United and News Network are pitting themselves against a raft of new competitors: the online giants AOL/Time Warner, Freeserve and Yahoo. The rewards could be great, but experiments are getting more and more costly.</p>",

The first division is Business to Consumer, which includes such brands as dotmusic.com, lads' portal Megastar, parenting site allaboutparents.com, youth entertainment site Rapture and interactive site Exchange &amp; Mart. A number of other lifestyle sites are mooted. \"United News and Media has gained its position by stealth - no one saw it coming,\" says Jellicoe. \"Dotmusic is well ahead of nme.com, and Line One [the business's second division] is Britain's second biggest ISP. Behind the scenes we've been developing very strong products. Look at Megastar, which had no marketing whatsoever and has grown organically to 250,000 unique users and 10 million page impressions.\" Megastar will benefit from the \u00a39m advertising spend that United is discussing. The other three divisions of Xilerate - Business 2 Business (an investment of \u00a3120m), Xilerate Ventures, a fledgling external investments division, and E Services, which includes web hosting, media sales and a raft of technical and \"back end\" support services - ensure that everything can be done cheaply in-house. Xilerate generated \u00a333m in 1999 and revenues are expected to reach \u00a3350m-\u00a3500m by 2004. Commerce, Consolidation and Convergence are the three Cs that Xilerate follows. \"We have excellent PC and TV skills but we don't have wireless skills. Broadband is our weakest point but today that is where the opportunity is greatest,\" said CEO Andrew Nugee recently. Xilerate is currently in discussion with a mobile phone operator (thought to be Vodafone Airtouch) about partnering to exploit its existing gaming and betting service. Meanwhile, News Network has been as cagey as United has been perspicacious. Following analysts' reports which suggested that the online versions of the Times and the Sun were failing to provide an adequate service to their customers, there was a tentative revamp back in May and rumours have been circulating that the company is investing in a 24-hour interactive news portal, thereby taking on the BBC. A large portion of the proposed investment will be going straight into \"shop\" sites. According to Brett Miller, head of e-commerce activities at NN and general manager of its auction site fired-up.com, 15 sites are being planned, ranging from finance to cookery, which will be \"tailored to the consumer with retail buying opportunities\". Unlike Associated, which has entered into a partnership with Zoom, NN aims to own as much of the transactional process as possible. Trinity Mirror has a different tack. Earlier this year it announced the rolling-out of 16 localised \"ic\" portals around the UK, covering news, sports and entertainment, all offshoots of the central revenue-driving ic portal and ISP ic24, which currently has 450,000 customers (target 900,000 by the end of the year). Managing director David Clarke recognises that with 152 local newspaper titles, Trinity Mirror's main strength is in cornering local online habits and advertising revenues. In addition, four more portals are imminent - icShowbiz, icChoice, icSport and icTravel - and there will be \"substantial\" investment in interactive TV and mobile phone applications. \"We are the consumer's champion,\" says Clarke. \"As a consumer portal we are far ahead of the other newspaper groups.\" This year, \u00a320m will be spent on targeting new customers. The online versions of the group's papers, including the Mirror, Daily Record and Sunday Mirror, register only faintly in the corporate strategy; Clarke sees his main competitors as being Yahoo, Freeserve and MSN. But where does all this leave Hollinger Telegraph, Guardian Unlimited and Associated New Media? Money is not in short supply at two-year-old ANM - revenues were up nearly 300% on the first half of last year - but Associated has opted to focus on its areas of expertise, building up This Is London (which draws on the strengths of the London Evening Standard and Metro), the recruitment site BigBlueDog and This Is Money, a new personal finance portal. UKPlus, the net directory, also appears to be performing well. ANM's showcase site, charlotte-street.com, has lagged dangerously behind in the women's portal race, however, despite a partnership with the shopping portal Zoom. According to Kevin Beatty, chief operating officer of Associated News Media, it will receive a big cash injection which will \"take it on to a higher plane\", but it also will be brought back into the fold of the Daily Mail, \"in order to get the best of both worlds\". In other words, a rebranding is on the cards. Hollinger Digital, which includes the Electronic Telegraph, Handbag and Interactive Investor, has been preoccupied with upgrading its outdated technology (at a cost of \u00a310m) and getting outside hosting, to the detriment of its business development plans. Now the division is future-proof, however, it can start to concentrate on content under the new editorial direction of former Independent on Sunday editor Kim Fletcher. The Telegraph Sport site will be upgraded in August and money, travel, jobs, property and motoring are next up for exploitation, at a projected cost of \u00a330m-\u00a350m. \"It would be easy to say that if we'd made the big investments in '98 we would be in better shape, but the market just wasn't big enough then,\" says managing director Hugo Drayton. Drayton is aware that the only way to \"take on the big guys\" is to partner up - a policy it made public in April - but he is confident: \"You can't just buy reputation, trust and brand strength overnight, and we can carry those over. We recognise that our key competence is editing, writing and presentation. How we make money out of that is today's and tomorrow's challenge.\" Hollinger's strategy will echo Guardian Unlimited's: push content out simultaneously to print and websites and aim for \"scalable, organic growth\". GU's traffic has reached 14.5m page impressions per month, and a media portal launches in September. \"There is an enormous amount of investment going on among our competitors and we have to double our efforts,\" says GU head Simon Waldman. \"But how much you spend and how big you look is not as important as what you do and whether you spend that money efficiently.\" Waldman is sceptical about the late- comers' ability to catch up. \"Traditionally, media companies have been able to come in late and be bigger, but that doesn't work any more. Look at Yahoo: they are now almost as big as News Corp, where once News Corp considered buying them.\" By scaling up their new media assets, Trinity, United and News Network are pitting themselves against a raft of new competitors: the online giants AOL/Time Warner, Freeserve and Yahoo. The rewards could be great, but experiments are getting more and more costly.",

Oddly, Stott's column was about the only thing Rupert Murdoch liked in the tired old paper. The diary hears a New Labour-friendly commentator is likely to assume his space. </p> <p>\u0095 Eddie Mirzoeff, the man who made Elizabeth R, the last BBC royal series, and encouraged new talents including Molly Dineen, is quitting the corporation next month after 38 years and nearly as many awards. It's not that he is retiring, or has lost his touch; he's a victim of the changing fashions that have downplayed the crafted documentary in favour of docu-soaps and video series like MacIntyre Undercover, forcing him to make Children's Hospital and cover for other people's absences. The final straw came when his proposed History of 20th Century Architecture was turned down by BBC2. Over to Channel 4? </p> <p> \u0095 A visibly pregnant Elisabeth Murdoch, stepping down from Sky, held a glittering farewell party last week at chic Moroccan restaurant Momo with all the usual suspects: Tony Ball, chief executive of BSkyB, Kelvin MacKenzie, Alan Yentob, Lord (Waheed) Alli and, naturally, Peter Mandelson. \"It was a very nice party.

      "bodyText": "Richard Stott, left-of-centre columnist for the News of the World for the last three years, is the first big name to be sacked by new editor Rebekah Wade. He was given the bullet in time-honoured Fleet Street fashion, over drinks at the Savoy, and next week's contribution will be his last. Reports of a row over the champers are denied despite Stott's combative reputation, but as a former editor of the People, the Mirror and Today, Stott understands the rough ways of newspapers. Oddly, Stott's column was about the only thing Rupert Murdoch liked in the tired old paper. The diary hears a New Labour-friendly commentator is likely to assume his space. \u0095 Eddie Mirzoeff, the man who made Elizabeth R, the last BBC royal series, and encouraged new talents including Molly Dineen, is quitting the corporation next month after 38 years and nearly as many awards. It's not that he is retiring, or has lost his touch; he's a victim of the changing fashions that have downplayed the crafted documentary in favour of docu-soaps and video series like MacIntyre Undercover, forcing him to make Children's Hospital and cover for other people's absences. The final straw came when his proposed History of 20th Century Architecture was turned down by BBC2. Over to Channel 4? \u0095 A visibly pregnant Elisabeth Murdoch, stepping down from Sky, held a glittering farewell party last week at chic Moroccan restaurant Momo with all the usual suspects: Tony Ball, chief executive of BSkyB, Kelvin MacKenzie, Alan Yentob, Lord (Waheed) Alli and, naturally, Peter Mandelson. \"It was a very nice party. The thing about her is that she always makes an effort,\" said one guest. It's not clear if she is being replaced at the head of Sky networks by deputy Mark Sharman. But Sky is doing something right.

      "body": "<p>At the end of a week of wild speculation, the BBC news director, Tony Hall, issued a cheery email to staff last Friday saying an appointments board had \"unanimously\" named Peter Horrocks as head of current affairs. Seasoned readers of BBC doublespeak immediately concluded that it was split down the middle. </p> <p>They were not far wrong. For even as the Panorama editor celebrated, moves were under way to entice one of his rivals for the post, the Channel 4 current affairs commissioning editor, Dorothy Byrne, to a specially created position that would effectively emasculate Horrocks and cast her in a powerful role. It is a piece of cynical chicanery that has left observers and participants breathless. </p> <p>The position of current affairs head has been vacant since Helen Boaden moved to head up Radio 4 in March. The choice of successor, which fell to the news and current affairs directorate and the controllers of BBC1 and BBC2 was simple: experienced insider, or revolutionary newcomer. But views were sharply divided. The news chiefs, led by Hall, favoured a safe pair of hands; the channel heads, Peter Salmon and Jane Root, distinctly unhappy with what they regard as journalistic under-ambition at Panorama, wanted drastic change. </p> <p>Horrocks's name went into the ring at the start. He was seen as a natural successor to the current affairs throne: from editing Newsnight, masterminding election coverage and overseeing Panorama, he has been in training for the top job for 10 years, a classic BBC Brahmin. </p> <p>Byrne would be the revolutionary. Admirers says she has the populist touch, an eye for a good story; but in her rise to the top - from World in Action through the Big Story to Dispatches - she has made as many enemies as friends and her detractors say she can be difficult and unnecessarily aggressive. </p> <p>A number of other internal and external candidates - including Horrocks, Byrne, Fiona Murch from Correspondent and Sian Kevill from Newsnight - were interviewed. The quality of the internal hopefuls did not impress some members of the board and another slate of candidates from outside the BBC was drawn up for a second round. Still, the board could not agree. </p> <p>So, buoyed up by his controversial speech about the future of the BBC in Canada, the director of television, Mark Thompson - not regarded as a Horrocks ally - took charge. A third round of interviews was held within the last two weeks, with Byrne and Horrocks still in the running. </p> <p>But such was the chasm between the news chiefs and channel controllers that it was clear there was only one way out. Fudge it. </p> <p>The plan, agreed upon in an unholy alliance of Horrocks's friends and foes in high places, envisages the head of current affairs being responsible for regular series, with Byrne installed in a new role as head of current affairs specials - including Panorama spin-offs such as last Friday's edition on the London nail bomber and the earlier programme on football hooliganism. This crafty move - deeply Machiavellian even by BBC standards - allows all sides to claim victory, and enabled Hall to boast, accurately but disingenuously, of unanimity in the promotion of Horrocks. </p> <p>Supporters of Horrocks are delighted, because they believe his position in the BBC is strong enough to allow his power base to grow. But Byrne's backers are pleased too, pointing out that Horrocks's sphere of influence would not extend beyond the Panorama, Money Programme and Correspondent strands. Given that the future of the second is in doubt, and the third is not a prime-time show, they argue that it leaves him in control of little more than at present. Byrne would be left to claim the credit for the high-profile successes - at Channel 4, she has made one-off and short-run current affairs her speciality, and the BBC's best Panoramas have been the special editions, which would fall within the borders of her empire. </p> <p>Byrne must now decide whether she wants to step into this nest of vipers from her comfortable position at Channel 4. Such is the sensitivity of the situation that Byrne refused to speak to the Guardian at the weekend. </p> <p>It is not known whether Horrocks is aware of the machinations. Certainly, of the rumour sweeping the BBC last week, little was accurate. Byrne was never, as one story had it, offered the position of head of current affairs first, turning it down because she could not install her Channel 4 colleague, Julian Bellamy, as editor of Panorama. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Horrocks soared above the fray, determined to prove his doubters wrong. BBC current affairs must make waves, punch above its weight, and do so with solid, original and aggressive journalism. \"These are vital for current affairs,\" he says. \"We have to make sure we get noticed.\" </p> <p>He is confident that the department can be turned around. \"There is a huge amount of health in BBC current affairs. It is the most attractive place to be because it does serious news with passion.\" Unlike Thompson, Horrocks is convinced there is a long-term future for serious current affairs on the principal BBC channel. \"I've got no doubt that strong current affairs will remain a part of what BBC1 does. There will always be important stories that need to be told to a mass audience.\" That, he says, is central to the BBC's public service role. </p> <p>Today, Byrne is considering her next move. Certainly, some senior BBC executives are convinced she will join them. They are impressed by her populist touch at Channel 4 - she won a clutch of awards as series editor of Dispatches - but her current employers are determined to retain her. </p> <p>Whether or not Byrne decides to swap sides, Horrocks will have a hard task rallying the troops: even his defenders acknowledge that he has a \"man management problem\". He seems both phlegmatic and shy, poor at socialising and the cut and thrust of daily exchanges. The real question is whether Horrocks has something extra, the flair, and the authority to protect the serious agenda of things people need to know about, while finding new ways to bring audiences to current affairs on BBC1, while at the same time fending off the enemies within. </p> <p>It's a tough billet.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Digital radio. Those two words sound like a dirge. And deservedly so. For the past five years listeners have been promised a revolution in listening. \"Pin-sharp\" sound and more choice. But it's been a case of jam tomorrow. </p> <p>The stations continue to crackle away, and, in the BBC's case, even fall off air. Only a few thousand music buffs and owners of flashy cars have the equipment - estimates range from 3,000 to 20,000. No company is ready to dish out free receivers or spend gargantuan sums on promoting fancy new content - in marked contrast to the competitive ploys of Sky and ONdigital in the growing digital TV market. A Roberts-designed digital radio with government backing is so clunky I overheard a leading radio figure, who longs to see digital radio soar, quietly mock it as ugly. Just last week BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland admitted the corporation had mistakenly invested too much too early since the launch in September 1995. </p> <p>But don't stop reading. If digital radio is a boring white elephant why are the moneymen suddenly so active? Could Bland be wrong? Well, the \u00a322.5bn auction of frequencies to host a third generation of mobile phones has made people sit up smartly. Licences for digital radio frequencies (organised as in television into \"multiplexes\") are being awarded for free, one every month or thereabouts, by the Radio Authority (14 have so far been allocated, covering most of the big cities). </p> <p>And though they are designed for broadcasting, not one-to-one phone messages, digital radio frequencies have great potential to deliver the same message to any number of callers without the system overloading - avoiding the kind of phone- jam that occurred on millennium night. And up to 20% of the capacity can be used for text messages, alongside conventional audio radio. Digital radio licences are hence coming to be seen as the last great spectrum freebie. </p> <p>So Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group, now floated on the stock exchange, has seen its shares trading healthily, not (just) on the quality of his quips, TalkSport's controversial football coverage, and the advertising boom, but because analysts appreciate his stake in Switchdigital, which was awarded a London-wide digital radio \"multiplex\" licence in April. Last week it started broadcasting its first services. Crucially, Carphone Warehouse is a (5%) shareholder. </p> <p>Simon Spanswick, director of Switchdigital, says: \"The BBC was led up the garden path by manufacturers promising equipment which never arrived. But Carphone Warehouse has seen the digital opportunities, as have a lot of consumer electronics companies.\" </p> <p>MacKenzie adds: \"The market is beginning to value the bandwidth after discounting it before. It's all part of the convergence taking place around all media companies.\" Yet, he acknowledges, \"at the moment it is more of a business than a consumer dynamic\". </p> <p>Everyone now expects hot competition for future licences. Up to now only the two in London were conteste, the rest going to established radio operators - GWR, Capital, Emap and Score (Scottish Radio) - in the areas in question. </p> <p>Chrysalis Radio chief executive Phil Riley, who has just put Heart 106.2 on Switchdigital, says: \"We are passionate believers in digital, this will be the first of many\". A further reason for the buzz was graphically demonstrated at ITN's briefing on its 24-hour news channel plans. Chief executive Stewart Purvis gave a star role, alongside Julia Somerville and Carol Barnes, to an eye-catching device resembling a silver saucer. On the market this autumn, the \"Wavefinder\" can feed news and provide internet access to laptops or PCs. </p> <p>This development is backed by Psion, the hand-held computer specialist, and will be its first digital radio product. It was also the talk of last Thursday's annual meeting of the Commercial Radio Companies Association, attended by Culture Secretary Chris Smith - who naturally warned that there was still some way to go before consumers saw something for them in digital radio. Who knows if people will want a Wavefinder aerial? And then bother to hook it to their laptop? It sounds like a City trader's toy. But the Wavefinder and products like it are generating excitement about a new generation of mobile hand-held \"palm\" products, which will be phones, mini-laptops and radios, all rolled into one. </p> <p>When you're not on the mobile phone, you could be listening to one of 30 carefully streamed music stations through ear-phones. And ordering a track you like over this new e-commerce device. Who is to say whether the pundits are right or wrong? </p> <p> Simon Cole, chief executive of Unique Broadcasting, the independent radio company best known for producing the Pepsi Network Chart, says: \"Digital radio is much more than just audio. It has an opportunity to be part of the converging, multi-content future. Those manufacturers spending time making big grey boxes to plug into hi-fis at \u00a3400 so you get slightly better reception for Classic FM are wasting their time. No one is going to pay so much for that. But if you can plug a receiver for your PC to a device you carry around in your pocket, that's different.\" </p> <p>Unique's holding company, UBC plc, is itself floating on Aim (the alter native investment market) today, raising \u00a35m which will partly fund its involvement in the Wavefinder approach to digital radio. </p> <p>There is the unmistakable sound of a digital buzz in GWR's recent annual results. Already the UK's most important commercial radio operator - a dominance reinforced by its takeover of the Daily Mail and General Trust's radio holdings - the company that controls Classic FM also owns 63% of the sole national commercial multiplex, Digital One, which was launched last November. \"We have a commanding position in digital radio and the take-up is encouraging,\" says GWR chairman Henry Meakin. </p> <p>What about old-fashioned radio services, programmes that people listen to? Well, some variety is starting to appear, to target older listeners and those with a hunger for culture. Talk and Bloomberg start their money news service next month. One Word, a speech-based cultural station featuring readings from books (run by Unique but also backed by the Guardian Media Group), launched in May. </p> <p>Despite the current flurry of activity, the Radio Authority has barely begun allocating licences, with the first ones for big regional territories, such as central Scotland and north-west England, starting this autumn. It seems inevitable that auctioning spectrum will become an issue in the current debate about future regulation of communications: once there is competition, price provides a way to decide. </p> <p>As for the BBC, the sadder but wiser digital pioneer finds itself in the middle of a re-examination of its priorities, ordered by Greg Dyke, at the very moment when the market is taking off. Plans for new services on its own public service digital radio multiplex will have to pass new government tests. </p> <p>\"We have had years when manufacturers promised us sets but they did not turn up,\" says the BBC's Glyn Jones, managing editor of its digital radio division. \"They are in the shops. But we have learned to ask them questions like 'when is production starting?' Manufacturers are now naming factories for production, giving details of chips, in the run-up to Christmas. That is building confidence.\" </p> <p>The BBC is \"simulcasting\" its five radio networks digitally and piloting parliamentary coverage, extended sports coverage and the World Service. But new channel ideas - comedy, Asian services, archive programming, oldie pop \"gold\" and dance and rap music- are on hold. </p> <p>Jones is unconvinced by the convergence buzz. \"Digital radio has been driven so far by people who like radio. They're Radio 3 listeners, music fans. I think radio listening is going to drive it. Not internet usage.\" </p> <p>But then radio, as he observes, is a bizarre product. You can pay \u00a32,000 for a snazzy tuner, or collect tokens and get a cheap trannie free. Kelvin MacKenzie has the last word: \"I'll be astonished if there is a sizeable audience for digital for about five to seven years. But we are at the beginning of things changing now.\"</p>",

Just last week BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland admitted the corporation had mistakenly invested too much too early since the launch in September 1995. But don't stop reading. If digital radio is a boring white elephant why are the moneymen suddenly so active? Could Bland be wrong? Well, the \u00a322.5bn auction of frequencies to host a third generation of mobile phones has made people sit up smartly. Licences for digital radio frequencies (organised as in television into \"multiplexes\") are being awarded for free, one every month or thereabouts, by the Radio Authority (14 have so far been allocated, covering most of the big cities). And though they are designed for broadcasting, not one-to-one phone messages, digital radio frequencies have great potential to deliver the same message to any number of callers without the system overloading - avoiding the kind of phone- jam that occurred on millennium night. And up to 20% of the capacity can be used for text messages, alongside conventional audio radio. Digital radio licences are hence coming to be seen as the last great spectrum freebie. So Kelvin MacKenzie's Wireless Group, now floated on the stock exchange, has seen its shares trading healthily, not (just) on the quality of his quips, TalkSport's controversial football coverage, and the advertising boom, but because analysts appreciate his stake in Switchdigital, which was awarded a London-wide digital radio \"multiplex\" licence in April. Last week it started broadcasting its first services. Crucially, Carphone Warehouse is a (5%) shareholder. Simon Spanswick, director of Switchdigital, says: \"The BBC was led up the garden path by manufacturers promising equipment which never arrived. But Carphone Warehouse has seen the digital opportunities, as have a lot of consumer electronics companies.\" MacKenzie adds: \"The market is beginning to value the bandwidth after discounting it before. It's all part of the convergence taking place around all media companies.\" Yet, he acknowledges, \"at the moment it is more of a business than a consumer dynamic\". Everyone now expects hot competition for future licences. Up to now only the two in London were conteste, the rest going to established radio operators - GWR, Capital, Emap and Score (Scottish Radio) - in the areas in question. Chrysalis Radio chief executive Phil Riley, who has just put Heart 106.2 on Switchdigital, says: \"We are passionate believers in digital, this will be the first of many\". A further reason for the buzz was graphically demonstrated at ITN's briefing on its 24-hour news channel plans. Chief executive Stewart Purvis gave a star role, alongside Julia Somerville and Carol Barnes, to an eye-catching device resembling a silver saucer. On the market this autumn, the \"Wavefinder\" can feed news and provide internet access to laptops or PCs. This development is backed by Psion, the hand-held computer specialist, and will be its first digital radio product. It was also the talk of last Thursday's annual meeting of the Commercial Radio Companies Association, attended by Culture Secretary Chris Smith - who naturally warned that there was still some way to go before consumers saw something for them in digital radio. Who knows if people will want a Wavefinder aerial? And then bother to hook it to their laptop? It sounds like a City trader's toy. But the Wavefinder and products like it are generating excitement about a new generation of mobile hand-held \"palm\" products, which will be phones, mini-laptops and radios, all rolled into one. When you're not on the mobile phone, you could be listening to one of 30 carefully streamed music stations through ear-phones. And ordering a track you like over this new e-commerce device. Who is to say whether the pundits are right or wrong? Simon Cole, chief executive of Unique Broadcasting, the independent radio company best known for producing the Pepsi Network Chart, says: \"Digital radio is much more than just audio. It has an opportunity to be part of the converging, multi-content future. Those manufacturers spending time making big grey boxes to plug into hi-fis at \u00a3400 so you get slightly better reception for Classic FM are wasting their time. No one is going to pay so much for that. But if you can plug a receiver for your PC to a device you carry around in your pocket, that's different.\" Unique's holding company, UBC plc, is itself floating on Aim (the alter native investment market) today, raising \u00a35m which will partly fund its involvement in the Wavefinder approach to digital radio. There is the unmistakable sound of a digital buzz in GWR's recent annual results. Already the UK's most important commercial radio operator - a dominance reinforced by its takeover of the Daily Mail and General Trust's radio holdings - the company that controls Classic FM also owns 63% of the sole national commercial multiplex, Digital One, which was launched last November. \"We have a commanding position in digital radio and the take-up is encouraging,\" says GWR chairman Henry Meakin. What about old-fashioned radio services, programmes that people listen to? Well, some variety is starting to appear, to target older listeners and those with a hunger for culture. Talk and Bloomberg start their money news service next month. One Word, a speech-based cultural station featuring readings from books (run by Unique but also backed by the Guardian Media Group), launched in May. Despite the current flurry of activity, the Radio Authority has barely begun allocating licences, with the first ones for big regional territories, such as central Scotland and north-west England, starting this autumn. It seems inevitable that auctioning spectrum will become an issue in the current debate about future regulation of communications: once there is competition, price provides a way to decide. As for the BBC, the sadder but wiser digital pioneer finds itself in the middle of a re-examination of its priorities, ordered by Greg Dyke, at the very moment when the market is taking off. Plans for new services on its own public service digital radio multiplex will have to pass new government tests. \"We have had years when manufacturers promised us sets but they did not turn up,\" says the BBC's Glyn Jones, managing editor of its digital radio division. \"They are in the shops. But we have learned to ask them questions like 'when is production starting?' Manufacturers are now naming factories for production, giving details of chips, in the run-up to Christmas. That is building confidence.\" The BBC is \"simulcasting\" its five radio networks digitally and piloting parliamentary coverage, extended sports coverage and the World Service. But new channel ideas - comedy, Asian services, archive programming, oldie pop \"gold\" and dance and rap music- are on hold. Jones is unconvinced by the convergence buzz. \"Digital radio has been driven so far by people who like radio. They're Radio 3 listeners, music fans. I think radio listening is going to drive it. Not internet usage.\" But then radio, as he observes, is a bizarre product. You can pay \u00a32,000 for a snazzy tuner, or collect tokens and get a cheap trannie free. Kelvin MacKenzie has the last word: \"I'll be astonished if there is a sizeable audience for digital for about five to seven years. But we are at the beginning of things changing now.\"",

He said: \"If London does not have the adequate resources to compete with this, whatever its current advantages, the entire UK economy will be weakened. \"This has to be understood by central government.\" Mr Livingstone added: \"Creating a squalid London with a broken-down transport system, deep pools of poverty and inadequate policing will not aid the rest of the UK's regions, but weaken the attractiveness of the whole economy of the country.\" He said London's representatives \"must push for the UK to join the euro as the only way to ensure London remains the financial centre of Europe.\" At a press conference after the speech, Mr Livingstone said that his discussions with leading international companies had convinced him that they were planning investment on the assumption that Britain would join the euro by around 2003 and would rethink their multimillion pound plans if this looked unlikely. \"London would be devastated if it became clear that over a decade we weren't going to join,\" he said. \"If you are pushing the government [to join the euro] you are pushing at an open door. \"I don't think there is a split in the government about whether or not to join the euro, the issue is simply at what time we tell the British people we are going to join the euro.\" Mr Livingstone maintained his opposition to government policy for a public-private partnership to fund improvements to the London Underground, calling on it to \"respect the wishes of the people of London by abandoning partial privatisation and break-up of the Tube\". Transport was \"the real test of my mayoralty\", he said, adding: \"If I get it wrong I will be a one-term mayor.\" He said that, despite public confrontation over the Tube, he had found \"broad agreement with ministers\" over the need for large-scale investment in London's transport system. He said he was \"optimistic\" that London's budget for transport spending for the next three years - due to be announced later this month - would be at least 50%, if not 100%, higher than the \u00a31.8bn expected. He reaffirmed his commitment to congestion charging in central London, saying he expected charges to run at around \u00a35 a day on weekdays. Mr Livingstone also threatened bus operators with a new penalty system of fines for delays and outlined plans for a freeze on bus fares and a single blanket fare for bus travel in London. Mr Livingstone sought to play down suggestions that he would seek to use the mayor's office as a platform from which to attack the New Labour leadership. He said: \"There is not one major decision taken since my election that has been affected by whether I was inside or outside the Labour party. Nor will there be during the next four years.\" London Assembly chairman Trevor Philips - deputy to official Labour candidate Mr Dobson during the election campaign - warned Mr Livingstone not to use the mayoral office to pursue personal political goals. He said: \"We [GLA members] want to influence your policies and we want to work with you, and should you be successful, we will carry you in triumph through the streets - figuratively speaking at least.\" He added: \"This is a democracy, not a Kenocracy. If you decide to use your position to advance politics that are not in the interests of Londoners or choose to use the platform for other political ends, we will, I promise, kick your ass.\"",

      "byline": "Gary Younge",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In March last year David Cripps, the headteacher of Radburn primary school in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, checked the post, saw the future and felt a deep wave of nausea swell up inside him. \"We get a lot of mail from Ofsted,\" he says. \"But if you get one with a contract number on the envelope then that can only mean one thing - you're going to be inspected. When I saw it I just felt sick. I knew that it was going to take a year out of my life. I knew that there was going to be this colossal amount of work to do and that we would have to put on this big show. I just knew it was going to be horrendous. And it was.\" </p> <p>The letter gave six months' notice of the inspectors' visit. No sooner had it arrived than three teachers and one school assistant announced their departure, insisting that they would not go through another Ofsted inspection - the school had been tested in 1996. </p> <p>Cripps holds up two ring-bound folders full of policies reviewed and revised specifically for the report. In the month running up to the inspectors' arrival, he and his deputy worked from 8am until 8pm every day including weekends. The entire mood of the school changed. \"There was just this quiet, manic hysteria,\" says one teacher. </p> <p>It seems like an extreme emotional reaction to what is ultimately a 36-page report on the performance of your school. But not, says the chair of the school governors, when you consider the stakes. \"If you failed then a lot of staff would probably leave or the head could be fired,\" says Terry Ware. </p> <p>Last week all 12 teachers at a primary school in south west London resigned following an Ofsted inspection. Moor Lane junior school in Chessington was found to have \"serious weaknesses\" by inspectors last April. After a follow-up inspection last month they told the headmistress and chair of governors that \"insufficient progress\" had been made. The chairman of the governors said the school had been \"wrecked\" by Ofsted's decision. </p> <p>In January, a teacher in Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire, committed suicide after Ofsted inspectors criticised her teaching. Pamela Relf, 57, jumped into a river, leaving a handwritten note which made it clear that she could no longer cope with the stress of modern teaching. The school had been found to have \"serious weaknesses\". Last month Ofsted partly upheld a complaint brought by the school, admitting that there had been a breakdown in communication between its inspection team and members of the staff. </p> <p>There are basically three things that can happen as a result of a report from the Office for Standards in Education. Inspectors can pass a school, fail it, or decide that it has \"serious weaknesses\". If a school fails it then goes on to \"special measures\". The headteacher has to provide an action plan which is sent to the secretary of state for education. Around six months later, inspectors will return to find out whether the school is following its action plan and they will continue to return on a termly basis. The school is expected to be able to turn itself around and get off special measures within two years. </p> <p>A school with \"serious weaknesses\" goes through a similar but less extreme procedure and is expected to address its problems within a year. </p> <p>At Radburn primary, the inspectors finally arrived on a Monday from a hotel they were staying in nearby. It was three weeks into a new school year and Cripps had three new teachers, some of whom were newly qualified. \"By this stage,\" says Cripps, \"I felt completely detached.\" After a short talk the inspectors roamed around the classrooms during lessons. \"You just hope that one of the children isn't going to start playing up or come up with something inappropriate,\" says one teacher. At the end of the day the inspectors told Cripps they had seen one or two problems in the lessons they had seen. He left school late feeling depressed. </p> <p>On Tuesday they observed more classes and delivered far more positive feedback. \"At this stage I went from thinking this is going to be disastrous to this is going to be OK,\" he says. But when an inspector walked into one class, one of the teachers tried to defuse the tension by making a joke: \"I think you must have the wrong room,\" he said. It fell horribly flat. \"No I haven't,\" replied the inspector. \"I can visit any class in the school.\" </p> <p>On Wednesday Cripps had a couple of interviews with the inspectors. They asked him about long-term financial planning and he tried to explain that it was not possible to plan long term when you are not in control of your income and funding changes from year to year. \"I might as well have been speaking a different language,\" he says. </p> <p>That night they told him the school was not a failing school. But that only convinced him they would decide it had serious weaknesses. \"Thursday was dreadful. They were supposed to tell us their verdict the next day but I looked so awful that they asked if I would like to know that evening. I said yes and so they went away and then pulled it together and told us the result. He talked about the strengths and then the weaknesses and I was waiting for him to say 'serious weaknesses'. After a while I just stopped him and said, 'Sorry, do you mean serious weaknesses?', and he said, 'No, sorry I should have made that clear. There are no serious weaknesses.' </p> <p>\"Afterwards I felt relieved but mostly I just felt crushed and exhausted.\" </p> <p>During the last inspection cycle around 3% of primary schools failed, and around 10% were found to have \"serious weaknesses\". The reality of working in a failed school, however, is far less clinical than the statistics. \"It just creates a mood where everyone thinks it is all right to blame the school for everything,\" says one teacher who used to work in a failed school. The pressure not to fail comes not just from the school but from the local education authority. If there is a large number of failed schools in one area the government could remove the provision of education from its tasks and take it over itself or hand it over to a private company. By the time these strains have trickled down to ordinary teachers the stress can just be all too much. </p> <p>Ofsted says it has now reduced the warning it gives schools to six weeks so staff have less time to worry. Schools that get good reports and have consistently high scores in the Standard Attainment Tasks (Sats) will now get less rigorous, shorter inspections. \"We have always recognised that inspection is a stressful business,\" says a spokesman. \"Inspectors don't expect to be liked. Partly because it is human nature not to like someone who is there to pass judgment on your work and, more significantly, because teachers have never had to do anything like this before. It is a shock to their collective system.\" </p> <p>Teachers have had a lot of shocks to the system in recent years - Sats, literacy and numeracy hours, the national curriculum - and Ofsted inspections will soon be followed by performance-related pay. Those who have been in the profession more than a decade talk as though they are being drowned under relentless tidal waves of initiatives. Yet Ofsted was more than just one more broadside in the battle to overhaul the education system. </p> <p>Created in 1992, it was born out of the wave of consumer rights initiatives - from the Citizen's Charter to the cone hotline - which can be identified, for better or for worse, as Majorism. \"Before Ofsted came along nobody knew what was going on in our schools,\" says the Ofsted spokesman. \"There was no way of the customer, the parents and the children, knowing how good an education children were getting. </p> <p>\"Sensible schools would see it as a free consultancy. It isn't about criticism but about identifying what a school does well and what it does badly.\" </p> <p>Cripps does not see it that way. He describes most of the inspectors who came to his school as \"pleasant\" and \"humane\" people doing a terrible job. One of them, however, told his deputy: \"This is an elite team.\" When a teacher pointed to the concrete statues the children made in the front of the school as part of a project, the inspector said: \"I've seen better.\" </p> <p>Ofsted, points out one former inspector, is there to judge, not to advise. \"It is essentially punitive. I think if it were supportive it would make a big difference but that is not its function. At the end of the day a lot of it comes down to whether you have a good team of inspectors or not and that hardly seems fair.\" </p> <p>So Radburn primary school didn't fail. There was never really any question that it would fail. This small school in Britain's first garden city, which sits on a working-class estate created from the overspill from north London, does not have any of the advantages of schools in middle-class areas. But nor is it located in an area of major deprivation. Of its 226 full-time pupils, 30 have English as an additional language, 60 are entitled to free school meals and 56 are registered as having special educational needs. As such, demands on its teachers are tougher than for some but less extreme than for many. And given the circumstances, it manages well. The Sats at seven and 11 suggest that its average intake arrives well below the national average at seven and leaves only marginally below the national average at 11, indicating considerable improvement. </p> <p>In this parallel universe where semantics are everything, the Ofsted report claimed there were \"significant weaknesses\" but not \"serious weaknesses\" at the primary. Among the findings was real praise. (\"Teachers manage behaviour well in lessons.\" \"Pupils are well-behaved and their attitudes to work are good.\") </p> <p>But there were also criticisms. The school had not done enough to improve on problems raised during the last inspection, it was claimed. \"The strategic management, financial planning and performance monitory\" were \"unsatisfactory\"; \"effective strategies for staff appraisal and the identification of professional development needs,\" had not been implemented; and \"attainment in English and mathematics is generally below average and significantly below average in writing across the school\". Inspectors recommended taking 10 minutes off the lunch hour and adding five to the end of the school day to create more time for the basics. The teachers went into post-Ofsted depression - that flat, numb feeling that comes with a sudden release of pressure. Three governors resigned. \"They were volunteers and the report was demanding more than many of them were prepared to give,\" says Ware, the chair of governors. </p> <p>\"From their [the inspectors'] point of view the whole thing is completely data-driven,\" says Cripps. \"It's one way of looking at the world but it's not one that I would subscribe to. I consider my work child-driven. There is a lot of this work that you simply cannot quantify in a report but which is essential to the job.\" Other teachers said there were some useful things to come out of the report, but none believed that the pain justified the gain. </p> <p>Sitting outside Cripps' office is \"the biter\" - a small boy who bit a small girl because she kept saying she was his girlfriend. Soon afterwards comes another small boy who has been accused of pulling a different girl's hair in the playground. He starts off insisting that he didn't touch her. Then he concedes that he might have flicked her. </p> <p>\"It was just a joke,\" he tells Cripps. </p> <p>\"A joke for you or a joke for her, because it doesn't look like she found it funny,\" says Cripps, and points him to the floor on the other side of his office door.

      "bodyText": "In March last year David Cripps, the headteacher of Radburn primary school in Letchworth, Hertfordshire, checked the post, saw the future and felt a deep wave of nausea swell up inside him. \"We get a lot of mail from Ofsted,\" he says. \"But if you get one with a contract number on the envelope then that can only mean one thing - you're going to be inspected. When I saw it I just felt sick. I knew that it was going to take a year out of my life. I knew that there was going to be this colossal amount of work to do and that we would have to put on this big show. I just knew it was going to be horrendous. And it was.\" The letter gave six months' notice of the inspectors' visit. No sooner had it arrived than three teachers and one school assistant announced their departure, insisting that they would not go through another Ofsted inspection - the school had been tested in 1996. Cripps holds up two ring-bound folders full of policies reviewed and revised specifically for the report. In the month running up to the inspectors' arrival, he and his deputy worked from 8am until 8pm every day including weekends. The entire mood of the school changed. \"There was just this quiet, manic hysteria,\" says one teacher. It seems like an extreme emotional reaction to what is ultimately a 36-page report on the performance of your school. But not, says the chair of the school governors, when you consider the stakes. \"If you failed then a lot of staff would probably leave or the head could be fired,\" says Terry Ware. Last week all 12 teachers at a primary school in south west London resigned following an Ofsted inspection. Moor Lane junior school in Chessington was found to have \"serious weaknesses\" by inspectors last April. After a follow-up inspection last month they told the headmistress and chair of governors that \"insufficient progress\" had been made. The chairman of the governors said the school had been \"wrecked\" by Ofsted's decision. In January, a teacher in Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire, committed suicide after Ofsted inspectors criticised her teaching. Pamela Relf, 57, jumped into a river, leaving a handwritten note which made it clear that she could no longer cope with the stress of modern teaching. The school had been found to have \"serious weaknesses\". Last month Ofsted partly upheld a complaint brought by the school, admitting that there had been a breakdown in communication between its inspection team and members of the staff. There are basically three things that can happen as a result of a report from the Office for Standards in Education. Inspectors can pass a school, fail it, or decide that it has \"serious weaknesses\". If a school fails it then goes on to \"special measures\". The headteacher has to provide an action plan which is sent to the secretary of state for education. Around six months later, inspectors will return to find out whether the school is following its action plan and they will continue to return on a termly basis. The school is expected to be able to turn itself around and get off special measures within two years. A school with \"serious weaknesses\" goes through a similar but less extreme procedure and is expected to address its problems within a year. At Radburn primary, the inspectors finally arrived on a Monday from a hotel they were staying in nearby. It was three weeks into a new school year and Cripps had three new teachers, some of whom were newly qualified. \"By this stage,\" says Cripps, \"I felt completely detached.\" After a short talk the inspectors roamed around the classrooms during lessons. \"You just hope that one of the children isn't going to start playing up or come up with something inappropriate,\" says one teacher. At the end of the day the inspectors told Cripps they had seen one or two problems in the lessons they had seen. He left school late feeling depressed. On Tuesday they observed more classes and delivered far more positive feedback. \"At this stage I went from thinking this is going to be disastrous to this is going to be OK,\" he says. But when an inspector walked into one class, one of the teachers tried to defuse the tension by making a joke: \"I think you must have the wrong room,\" he said. It fell horribly flat. \"No I haven't,\" replied the inspector. \"I can visit any class in the school.\" On Wednesday Cripps had a couple of interviews with the inspectors. They asked him about long-term financial planning and he tried to explain that it was not possible to plan long term when you are not in control of your income and funding changes from year to year. \"I might as well have been speaking a different language,\" he says. That night they told him the school was not a failing school. But that only convinced him they would decide it had serious weaknesses. \"Thursday was dreadful. They were supposed to tell us their verdict the next day but I looked so awful that they asked if I would like to know that evening. I said yes and so they went away and then pulled it together and told us the result. He talked about the strengths and then the weaknesses and I was waiting for him to say 'serious weaknesses'. After a while I just stopped him and said, 'Sorry, do you mean serious weaknesses?', and he said, 'No, sorry I should have made that clear. There are no serious weaknesses.' \"Afterwards I felt relieved but mostly I just felt crushed and exhausted.\" During the last inspection cycle around 3% of primary schools failed, and around 10% were found to have \"serious weaknesses\". The reality of working in a failed school, however, is far less clinical than the statistics. \"It just creates a mood where everyone thinks it is all right to blame the school for everything,\" says one teacher who used to work in a failed school. The pressure not to fail comes not just from the school but from the local education authority. If there is a large number of failed schools in one area the government could remove the provision of education from its tasks and take it over itself or hand it over to a private company. By the time these strains have trickled down to ordinary teachers the stress can just be all too much. Ofsted says it has now reduced the warning it gives schools to six weeks so staff have less time to worry. Schools that get good reports and have consistently high scores in the Standard Attainment Tasks (Sats) will now get less rigorous, shorter inspections. \"We have always recognised that inspection is a stressful business,\" says a spokesman. \"Inspectors don't expect to be liked. Partly because it is human nature not to like someone who is there to pass judgment on your work and, more significantly, because teachers have never had to do anything like this before. It is a shock to their collective system.\" Teachers have had a lot of shocks to the system in recent years - Sats, literacy and numeracy hours, the national curriculum - and Ofsted inspections will soon be followed by performance-related pay. Those who have been in the profession more than a decade talk as though they are being drowned under relentless tidal waves of initiatives. Yet Ofsted was more than just one more broadside in the battle to overhaul the education system. Created in 1992, it was born out of the wave of consumer rights initiatives - from the Citizen's Charter to the cone hotline - which can be identified, for better or for worse, as Majorism. \"Before Ofsted came along nobody knew what was going on in our schools,\" says the Ofsted spokesman. \"There was no way of the customer, the parents and the children, knowing how good an education children were getting. \"Sensible schools would see it as a free consultancy. It isn't about criticism but about identifying what a school does well and what it does badly.\" Cripps does not see it that way. He describes most of the inspectors who came to his school as \"pleasant\" and \"humane\" people doing a terrible job. One of them, however, told his deputy: \"This is an elite team.\" When a teacher pointed to the concrete statues the children made in the front of the school as part of a project, the inspector said: \"I've seen better.\" Ofsted, points out one former inspector, is there to judge, not to advise. \"It is essentially punitive. I think if it were supportive it would make a big difference but that is not its function. At the end of the day a lot of it comes down to whether you have a good team of inspectors or not and that hardly seems fair.\" So Radburn primary school didn't fail. There was never really any question that it would fail. This small school in Britain's first garden city, which sits on a working-class estate created from the overspill from north London, does not have any of the advantages of schools in middle-class areas. But nor is it located in an area of major deprivation. Of its 226 full-time pupils, 30 have English as an additional language, 60 are entitled to free school meals and 56 are registered as having special educational needs. As such, demands on its teachers are tougher than for some but less extreme than for many. And given the circumstances, it manages well. The Sats at seven and 11 suggest that its average intake arrives well below the national average at seven and leaves only marginally below the national average at 11, indicating considerable improvement. In this parallel universe where semantics are everything, the Ofsted report claimed there were \"significant weaknesses\" but not \"serious weaknesses\" at the primary. Among the findings was real praise. (\"Teachers manage behaviour well in lessons.\" \"Pupils are well-behaved and their attitudes to work are good.\") But there were also criticisms. The school had not done enough to improve on problems raised during the last inspection, it was claimed. \"The strategic management, financial planning and performance monitory\" were \"unsatisfactory\"; \"effective strategies for staff appraisal and the identification of professional development needs,\" had not been implemented; and \"attainment in English and mathematics is generally below average and significantly below average in writing across the school\". Inspectors recommended taking 10 minutes off the lunch hour and adding five to the end of the school day to create more time for the basics. The teachers went into post-Ofsted depression - that flat, numb feeling that comes with a sudden release of pressure. Three governors resigned. \"They were volunteers and the report was demanding more than many of them were prepared to give,\" says Ware, the chair of governors. \"From their [the inspectors'] point of view the whole thing is completely data-driven,\" says Cripps. \"It's one way of looking at the world but it's not one that I would subscribe to. I consider my work child-driven. There is a lot of this work that you simply cannot quantify in a report but which is essential to the job.\" Other teachers said there were some useful things to come out of the report, but none believed that the pain justified the gain. Sitting outside Cripps' office is \"the biter\" - a small boy who bit a small girl because she kept saying she was his girlfriend. Soon afterwards comes another small boy who has been accused of pulling a different girl's hair in the playground. He starts off insisting that he didn't touch her. Then he concedes that he might have flicked her. \"It was just a joke,\" he tells Cripps. \"A joke for you or a joke for her, because it doesn't look like she found it funny,\" says Cripps, and points him to the floor on the other side of his office door. And so it goes on. The ebb and flow of little people and their misdemeanours, staff requests, paperwork and phone calls. The variety and scale of work that Cripps insists leaves little time for the kind of administrative tasks that would please Ofsted. The biter is dismissed just after 2pm and rejoins his class. An hour later, parents gather at the school gate to collect their children. School finishes at 3.10. Next term it will be 3.15. Another five minutes, courtesy of Ofsted.

Trouble flared for several hours on Sunday night when several hundred loyalists at the church outside Portadown threw bottles, stones and other missiles at security forces. Loyalists also set fire to an armoured vehicle and fired ball bearings from a catapult at Drumcree Hill on Sunday night. Police arrested a youth in Portadown, who is being questioned about a crate of petrol bombs found in Meadow Lane. There were also minor scuffles in Belfast. In the north of the city, two men were injured when fights broke out among around 100 people in rival gangs at Westland Road. In east Belfast, police came under attack as they tried to dismantle barricades on Templemore Avenue and one officer needed stitches above his eye when he was hit by a bottle. The Orange Order has appealed for no violence but the head of the Portadown Lodge, Harold Gracey, has called for thousands of people around the Province to protest against the Parades Commission. Tension is likely to build, particularly in Portadown, with continued loyalist demonstrations planned for the rest of the week. Craigavon deputy mayor, Mark Neale, put forward proposals to try to break the deadlock which include Orangemen being allowed to march down Garvaghy Road on July 9 and a civic forum being set up to help regenerate all sides in Portadown on the following day.",

Matthau, who has died aged 79, was quite something. But never your conventional Hollywood star.</p> <p>There is hardly a director in the world who would not have welcomed him into his cast - Danny Boyle wanted him to play God in A Life Less Ordinary, but he could just as well have played the Devil. He was almost everybody's favourite character actor who, if he couldn't quite hold a film on his own, formed some notable partnerships on the screen. He rose to the challenge of a good script and another first-class actor with unbeatable panache. He was mostly closely identified with Jack Lemmon in The Fortune Cookie (1966), The Odd Couple (1968), The Front Page (1975) and Buddy Buddy (1981). And as a seamed veteran - was he ever really young? - he matched with him again in Grumpy Old Men (1993).</p> <p>By then both he and Jack had become unwitting caricatures of themselves. But no matter what Hollywood did to him, Matthau managed slyly to momentarily transcend the part. He had plenty of practice. For some years he was cast either as a smirky villain or as the American version of a jolly decent chap. His first film, The Kentuckian (1955), in which he was an evil saloon keeper, was followed by A Face In The Crowd (1957), Charade (1963), Fail Safe (1964) and Goodbye Charlie (1964). But Matthau was still largely unfulfilled, and knew it.</p> <p>It was Gene Saks's The Odd Couple, which he had played with great success on Broadway, that really made him. After that, Hollywood and particularly the shrewd Billy Wilder, knew what to do with him. Wilder always used to think of Matthau as the quintessential conman - \"Watch out,\" he once commented, \"this guy could sell you Brooklyn Bridge.\"</p> <p>Saks's film of The Odd Couple, taken from the Neil Simon original, wasn't all that great. But nobody could have played it better than Matthau and Lemmon, the one nervy and panic-stricken, the other totally unable to comprehend the reason why.</p> <p>Other film-makers followed. Matthau was wonderfully curmudgeonly, coupled with Anne Archer, in George Axelrod's The Secret Life Of An American Wife (1968); hilarious opposite Elaine May in her underrated A New Leaf (1971) and, playing with the great George Burns,who also could time a line to perfection, made Herbert Ross's The Sunshine Boys (1975) into something special.</p> <p>There were some comparatively straight parts in films like Don Siegel's clever Charley Varrick (1973), where Matthau played a bank robber hounded by the Mafia, and as Senator Russell Long in Oliver Stone's JFK (1991). But by then he was best-known for just being Matthau - wry and ironic, slightly crumpled, derisive of himself and the world at large and a dab hand at timing a line for the maximum effect.</p> <p>All this hid a more complex personality not unfamiliar with depression, probably the result of his awful childhood, who would tell funny anecdotes on TV talk shows to prevent anyone enquiring too closely about his private life. He was a star who seemed to be giving confidences away by the bucketload but actually told you absolutely nothing personal. The less you say about yourself, he was quoted as saying, the better off you are.</p> <p>Born in New York, Matthau was always said to be the son of a Russian Orthodox priest who had emigrated to America and eventually migrated from his family. But it seems father was an electrician, carpenter and photographer in whose life prayer did not play a prime part. Nor did his son, so Walter was brought up in the Daughters of Israel Day Nursery while his mother worked as a seamstress for upwards of 12 hours a day to keep everything together.</p> <p>All this had its effect on him, as did his mother who used, because of her extreme poverty, to collect toilet paper from diners where she had a cup of coffee. Even when Matthau was one of the highest paid Hollywood actors, she did so, despite his protests. At one time she had 15 large paper bags full and a furious Matthau, trying to break her of the habit, put them in the bath and turned the tap on. When he came back to the new apartment he had bought for her in Florida, he found the paper spread all over the terrace floor to dry.</p> <p>He had started life very much as a poor Jewish boy from the Lower East side whose real name was Matuschanskayasky. Just for fun, he called himself that as the drunk in Mark Robson's Earthquake (1974), where I met him on the set. \"This,\" he said, \"is a film which gives me the shakes in more ways than one. I do not wish to comment further until I hear what Charlton Heston has to say to you. He's a serious fellow, and we might not quite match up, you know.\" I got the impression, since he was playing an alcoholic, that I was talking to a reincarnation of W C Fields. It's a great pity he never played Fields on the screen.</p> <p>He changed his name soon after appearing as a child actor in New York's Yiddish Theatre, realising that you couldn't get very far with it in show business. During the second world war he served in the USAF as a radioman and gunner, finally making his proper acting debut first in summer stock and then on Broadway in 1946. The part of Oscar in the stage version of The Odd Couple was written for him.</p> <p>But to him it seemed a long time before he was appreciated as a comic talent. He used to say that he learned most about his craft (which he took so seriously it seemed as if he was not really trying at all) from his days in live television when accidents regularly happened, like the phone ringing when it wasn't supposed to.

Since by then he looked passably old and wise, there would be no real argument.</p> <p>As for advice about acting, Matthau would quote his mother: \"You know,\" she would say, \"'If you'd had a decent father, you could have been a lawyer.\" Then he would add: \"An actor is one who sings and dances on the street and passes the hat to get pennies. It's shameful.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal are rumoured to have signed Robert Pires on a four-year contract, despite the French winger stating last night that \"Madrid is the best club for me\". Marc Overmars is now likely to move to either Barcelona, Roma or Lazio. According to reports from Germany, former Manchester City striker Uwe R\u00f6sler has signed for Southampton from Tennis Borussia Berlin on a two-year contract. Everton hope to complete the \u00a32.5m transfer of Aston Villa's Steve Watson today. Chelsea are preparing a \u00a36m for Roma striker Marco Delvecchio. Turkish international keeper Recber Rustu has expressed a desire to play in the Premiership. The Fenerbahce player is available for \u00a35m - Ipswich, who are resigned to losing Richard Wright, may make a move. But Wright is unlikely to be moving to Chelsea - former Italian under-21 keeper Carlo Cudicini has signed a permanent contract at Stamford Bridge after a year-long loan period. \"Carlo is a very capable keeper and is adequate cover for Ed de Goey. We are no longer interested in Richard Wright and will not be contacting Ipswich,\" managing director Colin Hutchinson said today. Everton, Bradford and Manchester City are all interested in \u00a32m Leeds midfielder David Hopkin. Leicester's Neil Lennon wants to join his former manager Martin O'Neill at Celtic. The 29-year-old is expected to ask Peter Taylor for a transfer this week. Sheffield Wednesday's Ian Nolan will move to Bradford on a free transfer today. Didier Deschamps may return to France in the summer. Monaco are poised with a \u00a32.5m offer for the 31-year-old Chelsea midfielder. Chelsea have offered Aston Villa striker Tore Andre Flo in exchange for Gareth Southgate.",

This may give the shop - co-founded by the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti in 1953 - a status that could help it survive the current crisis.</p> <p>Last week the new Borders store in Santa Cruz was invaded by protesters throwing stinkbombs and a group of masked topless women called the Bare-Breasted Ladies. The Bare-Breasted Ladies have also staged actions against Gap and Starbucks.</p> <p>Their sentiments, if not their action, received the backing of the local mayor, Keith Sugar, who said: \"Borders is not welcome here and they know that. These kinds of predatory businesses pose a threat to our town and to local businesses.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, an anti-trust suit is being brought against the Borders and another book chain, Barnes &amp; Noble, by the American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,100 independent book shops and 26 bookstores throughout the US.</p> <p>It alleges that the chains have unfairly used their clout to coerce publishers into offering special deals and promotions which have not been offered to the smaller bookshops. It will go to trial next year in the San Francisco district court.</p> <p>Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble deny that they are \"engaged in a pattern of soliciting, inducing and receiving secret discriminatory and illegal terms from publishers\".</p> <p>But many bookshop owners believe the future of the small bookshop may depend on the outcome of the case.

      "bodyText": "The ghost of Jack Kerouac, the Bare-Breasted Ladies, and some of America's top lawyers are all part of a fight to save the independent bookshops of the United States: a battle which has international implications for the small independent retailers who are being forced out of business by multinational chains. This week it was confirmed that one of America's best-known bookshops, City Lights of San Francisco, is to become a city \"landmark\", giving it the protection from developers in enjoyed by listed buildings in Britain. This may give the shop - co-founded by the poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti in 1953 - a status that could help it survive the current crisis. Last week the new Borders store in Santa Cruz was invaded by protesters throwing stinkbombs and a group of masked topless women called the Bare-Breasted Ladies. The Bare-Breasted Ladies have also staged actions against Gap and Starbucks. Their sentiments, if not their action, received the backing of the local mayor, Keith Sugar, who said: \"Borders is not welcome here and they know that. These kinds of predatory businesses pose a threat to our town and to local businesses.\" Meanwhile, an anti-trust suit is being brought against the Borders and another book chain, Barnes &amp; Noble, by the American Booksellers Association, which represents 3,100 independent book shops and 26 bookstores throughout the US. It alleges that the chains have unfairly used their clout to coerce publishers into offering special deals and promotions which have not been offered to the smaller bookshops. It will go to trial next year in the San Francisco district court. Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble deny that they are \"engaged in a pattern of soliciting, inducing and receiving secret discriminatory and illegal terms from publishers\". But many bookshop owners believe the future of the small bookshop may depend on the outcome of the case. The decision is likely to have ramifications in the chains v independents war that stretch beyond the world of bookselling. Jack Kerouac - who has a nearby street called after him - Allen Ginsberg and the beat poets all used City Lights as a gathering place, and it was the first bookshop in the US to sell only paperbacks. \"We have a very, very loyal base of customers but the future is never assured,\" said Paul Jamazaki, who is a buyer for the shop. An encouraging number of new young customers and a \"brilliant\" young staff kept the shop in business, he said, but since the chains arrived its customers had been buying fewer books. San Francisco still has about 50 small bookshops, many of them specialist ones. Margie Ghiz, owner of the Midnight Special bookstore in Santa Monica, renowned throughout Los Angeles as the place for liberal leftwingers to buy books, believes that her shop has survived because of loyal customers, staff who know and care about books, and a generous landlord. \"When Borders opened down the street from us in 1995 our sales fell by between 35 and 40% in the first year,\" she said. \"I don't know how long we're going to be able to last.\" Ms Ghiz said that the arrival of Amazon.com and the electronic book were another difficulty facing small bookshops. The fact that the electronic book trade was having its first convention in New York this autumn was a sign of its growing power. \"When they're big enough to have their own convention, you know they're big,\" she said. Orin Teicher, the chief operating officer of the ABA, said of the civil action yesterday: \"We're confident the things we've alleged will be proven true and we will prevail.\" He said that the number of independent bookshops had declined significantly over the years but every poll of book-buyers indicated that there was support for the smaller bookshops.

      "byline": "Patrick Wintour, chief political correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A memo leaked to the Guardian from the heart of government warns that Britain's manufacturing heartlands face \"meltdown\" unless the cabinet declares that membership of the single european currency is inevitable. </p> <p>The stark memo, marked \"restricted policy\", has been sent to Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, by one of the most senior civil servants in his department. </p> <p>It also warns that the relative strength of sterling means the government's policy of gradual convergence with the economies already using the euro is \"no longer working\". </p> <p>The memo predicts: \"We must expect significant high-profile closures. The impact of this will be felt disproportionately in manufacturing heartland regions, exacerbating regional imbalances with all the attendant political problems that implies.\" </p> <p>The memo comes from Andrew Fraser, chief executive for the past six years of the DTI Invest in Britain Bureau. He wants ministers, including the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to massage sterling's level down by saying its current level is dangerously unrealistic and that the euro is indispensable to the preservation of Britain's manufacturing base. </p> <p>The memo's almost desperate tone suggests that inside Whitehall concern at the high pound, the receding political will to confront Eurosceptics and the consequent impact on jobs is far greater than ministers will publicly admit. </p> <p>The memo states: \"The government can no longer escape the essential choice: continue with perception growing that we are slipping back to 'wait and see' and not addressing a growing sense of crisis; or argue publicly for management towards greater convergence - including a more sensible exchange rate - along with firm commitment to euro entry once conditions are right\". </p> <p>The paper concedes: \"Carrying public opinion is critical, but the alternative is to preside over meltdown of major manufacturing sectors, and loss of major inward investors.\" </p> <p>Recent job losses at Ford and Rover represent, Mr Fraser says, \"perhaps the first high profile closures of the major magnet investors\". He forecasts that the rate of closures is likely to accelerate dramatically, especially in electronics, textiles, automotive and Japanese-owned factories. The crisis will extend to the City \"if the perception grows that we are perhaps not on course for convergence and entry\". </p> <p>The memo comes before a DTI announcement this week that inward investment is at record levels, with 118,000 jobs created or safeguarded. But Mr Fraser clearly feels that British industry is on the edge of a precipice. If the government continues as now, \"we face a growing perception of drift as manufacturers are in crisis and anti-euro lobbies build political momentum\". </p> <p>He claims many in business feel a sense of betrayal over the government's loss of nerve over the euro. \"The alarming relative appreciation of sterling is leading investors to de mand a policy response.

      "bodyText": "A memo leaked to the Guardian from the heart of government warns that Britain's manufacturing heartlands face \"meltdown\" unless the cabinet declares that membership of the single european currency is inevitable. The stark memo, marked \"restricted policy\", has been sent to Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, by one of the most senior civil servants in his department. It also warns that the relative strength of sterling means the government's policy of gradual convergence with the economies already using the euro is \"no longer working\". The memo predicts: \"We must expect significant high-profile closures. The impact of this will be felt disproportionately in manufacturing heartland regions, exacerbating regional imbalances with all the attendant political problems that implies.\" The memo comes from Andrew Fraser, chief executive for the past six years of the DTI Invest in Britain Bureau. He wants ministers, including the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to massage sterling's level down by saying its current level is dangerously unrealistic and that the euro is indispensable to the preservation of Britain's manufacturing base. The memo's almost desperate tone suggests that inside Whitehall concern at the high pound, the receding political will to confront Eurosceptics and the consequent impact on jobs is far greater than ministers will publicly admit. The memo states: \"The government can no longer escape the essential choice: continue with perception growing that we are slipping back to 'wait and see' and not addressing a growing sense of crisis; or argue publicly for management towards greater convergence - including a more sensible exchange rate - along with firm commitment to euro entry once conditions are right\". The paper concedes: \"Carrying public opinion is critical, but the alternative is to preside over meltdown of major manufacturing sectors, and loss of major inward investors.\" Recent job losses at Ford and Rover represent, Mr Fraser says, \"perhaps the first high profile closures of the major magnet investors\". He forecasts that the rate of closures is likely to accelerate dramatically, especially in electronics, textiles, automotive and Japanese-owned factories. The crisis will extend to the City \"if the perception grows that we are perhaps not on course for convergence and entry\". The memo comes before a DTI announcement this week that inward investment is at record levels, with 118,000 jobs created or safeguarded. But Mr Fraser clearly feels that British industry is on the edge of a precipice. If the government continues as now, \"we face a growing perception of drift as manufacturers are in crisis and anti-euro lobbies build political momentum\". He claims many in business feel a sense of betrayal over the government's loss of nerve over the euro. \"The alarming relative appreciation of sterling is leading investors to de mand a policy response. There is a growing sense that the government is backsliding on its commitment to convergence - and when the time is right for entry - and leaving the political argument to the anti-euro brigade.\" Claiming that manufacturers are pleading with him to know how soon Britain will join the euro, Mr Fraser says he meets investors in Japan who say: \"We put our commitment into the UK, you are our special and trusted partners in Europe. How could you stay out and let us down?\" He urges a courageous and clear response: \"It must challenge the Eurosceptics head-on politically and it must express the view that entry into the euro is indispensable if we are to secure the future of Britain's manufacturing base. Perversely, the weakness of manufacturing competitiveness as a direct result of the pound-euro uncertainties - may provide a window of opportunity politically to drive home the message.\" Mr Fraser told Mr Byers: \"At the current exchange rates, pound/euro, I suspect very few manufacturing investors are currently profitable.

What, 26 years after the Turkish army hit the beaches, is so frowningly intractable here. Would President Chirac like to clear his throat?</p> <p>The components of continuing crisis can be amplified interminably over the wasted years or contracted in contentious simplicity. History first - and always. Did ethnic cleansing begin in 1964 when Greek Cypriot gangs, often wearing police uniforms, ran amok and shot or terrified into flight too many Turkish Cypriots? Or did it only begin in 1974 with the invasion? If '64 was the start of chaos (fomented from Athens) then it was the Greek Cypriot side which broke the treaty of guarantee that gave Cyprus its independence and the legitimacy of the government of Cyprus (all Greeks, no Turks) is flawed (whatever the UN or the international courts say). But if history begins in '74, then the Greek Cypriots are the ethnically cleansed victims and Mr Denktash runs a doomed little charade of an unrecognised and unrecognisable state.</p> <p>I was here (for the Guardian) in 1964. I have to say that I saw too many dead or dispossessed Turkish Cypriots to wipe that slate of history squeaky clean. I can understand the north's muck sweat over security - just as I can understand the profound injustice that Greek Cypriots feel about seeing their homes, lands and livelihoods taken away one night at the point of a Turkish bayonet. With 35,000 Turkish mainland troops still on site, security sweat runs two ways.</p> <p>But when fear turns into bleak constitutionality on lawyers' lips, hell freezes over. The one thing Greek Cypriots won't negotiate is their international legitimacy as the government of the island - right down to anything as humble as cutting Turkish Cyprus out of a kids' football tournament. The one thing that Mr Denktash won't countenance is any implied slight to his self-proclaimed status - right down to making the UN troops on the ground use a single checkpoint on the long green line. Goalposts move, but goals, including partition - don't.</p> <p>Thus principle comes to seem pettily vindictive. Thus cross-border contacts wither as Mr Denktash shuts his saddened citizens away and the people of one small island grow so far apart that they might as well inhabit different planets. Thus Greek Cypriots, in the ignorance of isolation, think the north is a flyblown basket case (which it isn't) - and, while everybody says they want a settlement, the inertia of a realpolitik status quo descends - even on Greeks still striving manfully. Thus the EU representative here is persona non grata in Turkish Nicosia, because the union accepted the (Greek) government's application.</p> <p>Confused? Of course. Anyone would be. But the sheer pettifoggery of the dispute sends its own insular message. How does it sit with Greece's buoyant euro economy and move into the European mainstream? How does it suit a Turkey which argued passionately for the right to be an EU candidate - and prevailed? Where does the crucial rapprochement between Athens and Ankara go from here? Down the drain in October, when Nicosia may call on the Greeks to veto Turkey's candidature unless a palatable solution appears on a negotiating timetable? If Brussels reneges (as it may) on Greek Cypriot admission, will Athens then heed the cry to veto all enlargement - from Poland to Hungary - as a wrecking act of brotherly solidarity?</p> <p>There isn't slow boat to nowhere any longer; only a speedboat heading for the rocks on a coast near us. Cyprus hasn't been settled these past 30 years because there's been no overwhelming imperative to shift. Dust alley by the Ledra Palace is a monument to decisions evaded and half truths limply embraced. But no. No more. The stakes are rising. This - in its bounty, beauty and necessity for reconciliation - is our fine mess now. Summon the blood, for we shall have to sort it out.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Thus cross-border contacts wither as Mr Denktash shuts his saddened citizens away and the people of one small island grow so far apart that they might as well inhabit different planets. Thus Greek Cypriots, in the ignorance of isolation, think the north is a flyblown basket case (which it isn't) - and, while everybody says they want a settlement, the inertia of a realpolitik status quo descends - even on Greeks still striving manfully. Thus the EU representative here is persona non grata in Turkish Nicosia, because the union accepted the (Greek) government's application. Confused? Of course. Anyone would be. But the sheer pettifoggery of the dispute sends its own insular message. How does it sit with Greece's buoyant euro economy and move into the European mainstream? How does it suit a Turkey which argued passionately for the right to be an EU candidate - and prevailed? Where does the crucial rapprochement between Athens and Ankara go from here? Down the drain in October, when Nicosia may call on the Greeks to veto Turkey's candidature unless a palatable solution appears on a negotiating timetable? If Brussels reneges (as it may) on Greek Cypriot admission, will Athens then heed the cry to veto all enlargement - from Poland to Hungary - as a wrecking act of brotherly solidarity? There isn't slow boat to nowhere any longer; only a speedboat heading for the rocks on a coast near us. Cyprus hasn't been settled these past 30 years because there's been no overwhelming imperative to shift. Dust alley by the Ledra Palace is a monument to decisions evaded and half truths limply embraced. But no. No more. The stakes are rising. This - in its bounty, beauty and necessity for reconciliation - is our fine mess now. Summon the blood, for we shall have to sort it out. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

Doctors at Leeds general infirmary and St James's hospital, where three people have died and the lives of 20 others have been endangered by interference with anaesthetic equipment, believe that a disgruntled employee is deliberately damaging life-support systems. The Guardian has learned that suspected sabotage includes breathing pipes and reservoir bags being deliberately punctured or slashed and other anaesthetic equipment being tampered with. Anaesthetists were sent letters in February warning them to check machinery for tampering before each operation. The incidents have all taken place in the last 18 months and are believed to be the work of an individual with specialist knowledge of anaesthetic drugs and equipment and legitimate access to them.

Its tax-based system has proved the cheapest and fairest way of funding health care, but it has suffered from one persistent and serious defect: the politicians had to be persuaded to find the cash. Now they have done just that. Labour has promised to increase spending on the service by a third over the next five years from \u00a350bn to \u00a369bn. Annual spending increases will rise to 6% in real terms, double the historic trend. But as a quid pro quo, ministers have insisted the service must be modernised. A 10-year plan is to be published later this month. </p> <p>Traditionalists believe the NHS has continued to provide clinical treatment as good as anywhere in the world, but concede that the continuous financial squeeze has left us in some areas with conditions which would cause a riot if experienced on a package holiday: shabby rooms, peeling paint, grim grey corridors. Two recent reports have questioned even the standard of health care. The World Health Organisation's league table of health systems, published two weeks ago, placed the UK 18th out of the 191 member nations - below France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Japan, Norway and Portugal, though ahead of the US, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. The nation which topped the league, France, carries out 30% more hip-replacement operations and 42% more heart bypasses. One reason, as the health secretary has conceded, is that they have more doctors. Yet it is not that simple. Germany, with twice as many doctors as the UK, came 25th. </p> <p>A more disturbing report was last Friday's study on lung cancer in the Clinical Oncology journal, which found the disease had become untreatable in more than one in five sufferers because of the time they had waited for treatment. Although the study involved only 29 patients, the government's cancer tsar conceded it was highlighting \"unacceptable problems that we know exist and are determined to tackle in our cancer services\". Fast-growing tumours are not restricted to lung cancer, but affect head, neck and cervical cancer too. </p> <p>Changes in the pipeline are not restricted to the national plan. Last week's row at the British Medical Association conference, when the General Medical Council was censured for the first time, was driven by the GMC's proposals for a medical MOT, under which all doctors will have to have their licences to practise revalidated every five years. Labour's Commission for Health Improvement has begun its inspections, which will monitor all units and services in the system. Hospital and health authorities are drawing up annual appraisal systems. A traditionally independent profession is having to come to terms with being made accountable. </p> <p>Gross though recent medical abuses have been - incompetent operations on children, arrogant removal of organs from dead babies, inappropriate operations on women - doctors point to the numbers treated by the NHS: 1m patients each day. What they ignore is the chief medical officer's report which suggested that one in three hospital consultants and one in five GPs suffered from some performance problem. His aim was not to find scapegoats but to move away from the present blame culture to a system which would identify underperformance early and provide the medics involved with more support. That serves the interests of both patients and doctors. Making the health service more patient-oriented will have that double benefit too. The government is right to ignore BMA grumbles against the new NHS helpline, walk-in clinics and online health care. Medics as well as patients will gain if ministers succeed in breaking down the rigid professional demarcation barriers which prevent doctors, nurses and allied professionals from working more flexibly. A more responsive service can give the professionals more cause for pride and greater job satisfaction. </p> <p>On one issue both medics and managers are united: their suspicion of central controls. In its 1997 manifesto, Labour insisted that \"there can be no return to top-down management\"; yet top- down management has returned. But this may have been necessary to generate the energy for reform. The test is whether ministers will be ready to let go of the levers once their framework is in place. The health secretary has spoken of \"earned autonomy\", which managers have welcomed: successfully run units will be left alone. A modernising blitz is justified. But it must not ignore the old unsolved challenges facing the NHS: chronic care and health inequalities.</p>",

It also secured a proportionately higher share of middle-class votes than it ever had before.</p> <p>Some say that Labour's rightwards policy shift has failed to make provision for its traditional supporters. Low turnouts and weak showing in local authority and European parliament elections are taken as evidence that working-class supporters are frustrated by the government's failure to address their everyday concerns. The fear is that, in spite of Labour's continuing lead in the polls, it will be unable to persuade core voters to make the effort to turn out and take part in the next general election.</p> <p>But class-based voting has been in decline for 30 years. In the 60s, voters tended to support the party that they thought best represented their class interests. The Tories' stance as the party of property and enterprise resonated with the middle class and the rich.

      "bodyText": "A distinctive feature of Labour's victory in 1997 was that it successfully appealed to all social classes. The party not only obtained a clear majority of working-class votes. It also secured a proportionately higher share of middle-class votes than it ever had before. Some say that Labour's rightwards policy shift has failed to make provision for its traditional supporters. Low turnouts and weak showing in local authority and European parliament elections are taken as evidence that working-class supporters are frustrated by the government's failure to address their everyday concerns. The fear is that, in spite of Labour's continuing lead in the polls, it will be unable to persuade core voters to make the effort to turn out and take part in the next general election. But class-based voting has been in decline for 30 years. In the 60s, voters tended to support the party that they thought best represented their class interests. The Tories' stance as the party of property and enterprise resonated with the middle class and the rich. Labour's broadly redistributive position attracted disproportionate support from working-class voters and the less well off. Roughly two-thirds of middle-class voters supported the Tories while two-thirds of the working-class voted Labour. These proportions declined gradually during the 70s and 80s because of changes in patterns of employment and lifestyle - a process labelled \"class de-alignment\". But in 1997, Labour still enjoyed a significant advantage over the Tories among the working class (58% compared with 29%). It also led them among the middle class (40% compared with 38%). This margin was crucial for a simple reason. Between 1964 and 1997, the size of the manual working class fell from around 60% of the electorate to around 40%. Labour has to appeal to the non-manual vote: no matter how much support Labour might have gained from the working class in 1997, it would have found it very difficult to win.

Note also how the Tory and LibDem vote shares are very similar across the categories. These figures are relevant to the \"heartlands\" debate. Labour no longer draws support disproportionately from the working class to any significant degree but instead draws support more or less equally from all social classes. So what are the political implications? Labour has lost working class (C2, D/E) support since 1997. Some say this implies future electoral success depends on the party's ability to restore its fortunes among its traditional voters. The danger with this approach is that any appeal directed purely at increasing working-class votes risks a proportionate loss of middle-class support.

He said the security forces could control a protest solely at Drumcree more easily.</p> <p>He called for mass support at next Sunday's parade, increasingly seen as the make-or-break flashpoint. He believed that up to 100,000 people could turn up.</p> <p>In an uncompromising address, Mr Gracey said: \"This battle is not just about Drumcree. This is about the Orange Order. It is about the Protestant people. They used to be on their knees. Now they are on their bellies. If they don't get up before it is too late this country will be gone.\"</p> <p>In a swipe at the prime minister, Mr Gracey told demonstrators: \"I said to Tony Blair, last year you may have duped us. You won't dupe us again.\"</p> <p>Orangemen claim Mr Blair promised them a march last autumn if they backed off last year. Downing Street denies there was any deal, but the protesters are furious at what they see as betrayal.</p> <p>Several paramilitaries were among the demonstrators, including members of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, which has been involved in violence in previous years, and the hardline outfit, the Orange Volunteers. Representatives of the fascist group Combat 18 are expected to join them this week.</p> <p>One leading loyalist dissident said yesterday: \"Next week will be the real test, and we are ready for it. We can't go on backing down.\"</p> <p>There was at first a thin line of officers separating the Orangemen from their traditional route back to Portadown after the service at the Church of the Ascension at Drumcree. As fighting began, two armoured vehicles blocked the road. An Ulster Freedom Fighters banner was draped on one of them.</p> <p>While the Portadown lodge was at the church service, Mark Harbinson, an Orangeman from Stoneyford, Co Antrim, told protesters: \"No longer can we stand by and let the same situation happen year after year. Today is a rallying call. This is Ulster's Alamo. Here we stand because we can do no other.\"</p> <p>The RUC had wanted to maintain a low-profile, and there had been no moves to build trenches or install rows of razor wire to stop protesters crossing police lines. They are certain to be put in place later this week.</p> <p>Orangemen confirmed there will be nightly protests at Drumcree, and some violence appears inevitable. But there was no confirmation of claims from one senior Orangeman that plans had been drawn up for demonstrations across Northern Ireland this week.</p>",

To roars of approval, Mr Gracey demanded that loyalists engage in province-wide demonstrations this week, to stretch the army and police. He said the security forces could control a protest solely at Drumcree more easily. He called for mass support at next Sunday's parade, increasingly seen as the make-or-break flashpoint. He believed that up to 100,000 people could turn up. In an uncompromising address, Mr Gracey said: \"This battle is not just about Drumcree. This is about the Orange Order. It is about the Protestant people. They used to be on their knees. Now they are on their bellies. If they don't get up before it is too late this country will be gone.\" In a swipe at the prime minister, Mr Gracey told demonstrators: \"I said to Tony Blair, last year you may have duped us. You won't dupe us again.\" Orangemen claim Mr Blair promised them a march last autumn if they backed off last year. Downing Street denies there was any deal, but the protesters are furious at what they see as betrayal. Several paramilitaries were among the demonstrators, including members of the Loyalist Volunteer Force, which has been involved in violence in previous years, and the hardline outfit, the Orange Volunteers. Representatives of the fascist group Combat 18 are expected to join them this week. One leading loyalist dissident said yesterday: \"Next week will be the real test, and we are ready for it. We can't go on backing down.\" There was at first a thin line of officers separating the Orangemen from their traditional route back to Portadown after the service at the Church of the Ascension at Drumcree. As fighting began, two armoured vehicles blocked the road. An Ulster Freedom Fighters banner was draped on one of them. While the Portadown lodge was at the church service, Mark Harbinson, an Orangeman from Stoneyford, Co Antrim, told protesters: \"No longer can we stand by and let the same situation happen year after year. Today is a rallying call. This is Ulster's Alamo. Here we stand because we can do no other.\" The RUC had wanted to maintain a low-profile, and there had been no moves to build trenches or install rows of razor wire to stop protesters crossing police lines. They are certain to be put in place later this week. Orangemen confirmed there will be nightly protests at Drumcree, and some violence appears inevitable. But there was no confirmation of claims from one senior Orangeman that plans had been drawn up for demonstrations across Northern Ireland this week.",

Last Thursday Col Tarakinikini said the temporary government would take office only once the hostages were released, but yesterday he said the army would not wait. Responding to the announcement, the rebel spokesman, Jo Nata, said: \"We hope they are prepared for the implications of their actions.\" The rebel leader, George Speight, has said that any military action seen as unfavourable to the indigenous population could lead to violence by his supporters.

He told the paper that he had concentrated so much on charitable work - he is an active chairman of Jewish Care - and on politics that his \u00a35,000 income tax year was not (as he had earlier suggested) his only low-tax year. In 1997-98 he had paid \"below \u00a310,000\" for similar reasons. Tory critics are publicly saying the Inland Revenue should take a close look at all Lord Levy's tax dealings and privately questioning whether there is any tax evasion as well as sophisticated avoidance of tax. Earlier this week it was reported that, in addition to the taxable income Lord Levy drew in 1998-99, he took repayment of a \u00a3160,000 loan to his company, Wireart, on which he said tax had already been paid. Among expenses it now appears were claimed by Lord Levy were motoring costs of \u00a314,983, travel bills - including hotels - of \u00a316,363, and sums for using his mobile and home phones. He explained that he had worked to set himself up as a consultant, but was not yet claiming fees. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, again signalled his support for Lord Levy yesterday, as Andrew Lansley, the Tory campaign strategist, promised to take it up with the Inland Revenue. Mr Blair confirmed that he will attend a mid-week dinner at the peer's north London home - though it has nothing to do with fundraising, aides stressed.",

Increasing unemployment and a severe economic crisis have contributed to the boom in kidnapping, but its roots lie in the violence generated by nearlym 40 years of civil war. Last year about eight people were kidnapped in Colombia every day, mostly by rebel factions who depend on extortion to fund their campaigns. Police figures show that more than 1,000 people, including 10 foreigners, have been kidnapped so far this year. But where once the rebels picked on the wealthy and foreign businessmen, they now cast their nets wider. Increasingly they abduct members of the urban middle class, snatching their victims either from city streets or from holiday traffic at roadblocks on country roads. Housewives, schoolchildren and shopkeepers have all been taken hostage, said Guillermo Restrepo, head of anti-kidnapping operations at the ministry of justice. \"People think kidnapping is something that only happens to the rich, but the reality is that any Colombian could be kidnapped.\" Even the poorest are at risk: earlier this year a five-year-old girl was abducted from a Bogota slum.

      "bodyText": "Mexicans voted yesterday in presidential and parliamentary elections which will decide whether the world's longest- governing party will win another six years of be forced out of office. Francisco Labastida is defending the presidency for the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) against the colourful Vicente Fox of the conservative National Action party. Mr Labastida's best ally is the PRI's impressive electoral machine, while Mr Fox appeals to voters fed up with a party that has held the presidency since 1929. \"For the first time our vote is actually going to count,\" Pablo Diaz said as he queued at polling station in Mexico City. The PRI's longevity owes much to its ability to win elections with the help of dirty tricks and, sometimes, fraud. But in recent years opposition parties have been allowed to gain ground at lower levels of government. In 1996 wide-ranging reforms created the independent body which is organising these elections. There are more than 800 international observers, led by former US president Jimmy Carter, and thousands of national observers watching out for irregularities. Before polling day observers collected widespread evidence that the PRI was shoring up its support by handing out donations and putting pressure on voters with threats of withdrawing government aid. With little to separate the two main candidates, much depends on whether supporters of the third-placed leftwinger, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolution party, decide to switch their vote at the last minute. One voter, Gabriela Ramirez. said: \"If I vote for Cardenas it is like giving my vote to Labastida, but I don't know if I can bring myself to support a rightwinger like Fox.\" Rob Allyn, who is coordinating the running of the poll, said: \"There is a long history of fraud in Mexico, so although we are all hoping for the best, we are also preparing for the worst. \"It is very important to have another pair of eyes.\" Besides the president the congress and senate, two state governors and the mayor of Mexico City are being elected.

      "bodyText": "The Catholic church in Italy helped the Nazis by laundering money and supplying intelligence about allied invasion plans, according to declassified documents. Clerics collaborated with the secret service of Hitler's SS while their flock was rebelling against the retreating German army. Cardinal Ildebrando Schuster, Archbishop of Milan, agreed to transfer money to pay an SS agent, according to a message intercepted by allied code-breakers in October 1943. The documents, part of a collection of 400,000 second world war British and US intelligence reports declassified last week, raise fresh questions about the Vatican's relationship with the Nazis. In a dispatch to Berlin from the Rome headquarters of the SS, a Captain Peisner wrote that an agent called Basilus had contacted the cardinal. \"And [Basilus] explained to me today how he intended to transfer 300,000 lire through Cardinal Schuster.\" The transcript is damaging because the cardinal was not previously thought to have been one of the church's Nazi sympathisers, said James Walston, a historian at the American University of Rome. \"If true it is terrible. Schuster's behaviour was part of a wider pattern of church cooperation, motivated partly by a strong anti-communist ideology.\" Another document has cast doubt on the record of Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty, representative of the American Red Cross at the Vatican. Fr O'Flaherty, who was Irish, was hailed for helping Jews. But according to an SS report dated October 19 1943, he told one of their informants that two US divisions in Sardinia were preparing to land near Civitavecchia, a port north of Rome. The information was correct, though the allies later changed their plan and landed south of Rome at Anzio. Prof Walston said the evidence that Fr O'Flaherty was a spy was weak, however. \"He may not have known he was talking to an informer. Everybody in Rome at that time would have been speculating about the invasion and Civitavecchia was an obvious guess. The SS agent would have known that quoting a Vatican official would make his report look more impressive to his bosses.\" The documents, decrypted by the British Enigma code-breaking operation, were held by the CIA in Maryland, Virginia and released under the auspices of the Nazi war criminal records inter-agency working group, set up in 1998. They bolstered claims that southern Italians aggressively resisted their allies-turned occupiers as British and US troops approached. The Germans rounded up 8,000 Jews in Rome in October 1943 but did not swoop south. \"Because of the attitude in the town and uncertain conditions, action could not be carried through in Naples,\" a report sent to SS General Karl Wolff said. A new book by Aldo De Jaco, 1943: The Resistance of the South, claims that German atrocities galvanised the population into an uprising. In reality, only a handful of Jews were there, but Naples was one of the few European cities to successfully block the round-ups of Jews.",

      "bodyText": "Greeted by neo-Nazis, angry cardinals, a mortified mayor and freshly-outed public figures, the 2000 world gay pride festival started partying in Rome at the weekend. More than 300,000 gay men and women are expected to turn the nine-day event into a confrontation with the Vatican which neither side will readily forget. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims are also sweeping into the Italian capital for the climax of the Vatican's jubilee, or Holy Year. Hours before Saturday's opening ceremony, riot police accompanied 700 supporters of the neo-fascist Forza Nuova group who marched in formation giving the Nazi salute. The group has vowed to disrupt the festival. Religious groups and the far-right National Alliance held a separate torch-lit procession to a shrine associated with solace to \"repair the shame\". Cardinal Ersilio Tonini said the church did not see gays as enemies, but he denounced the timing of the festival. \"By choosing the Holy Year, the Jubilee, one chooses provocation.\" Several Italian gay leaders agreed with the cardinal, but the Vatican's resistance appears to have boosted attendance. \"Whenever there's a problem, we have an outpouring of support. People are all revved up,\" said Deborah Oakley-Melvin, World Pride's international director. The Vatican, which considers homosexual sex a sin, fears that pilgrims may be caught up in thefashion parades, soccer matches in drag, art exhibitions and a concert with Gloria Gaynor, Geri Haliwell and the Village People. Heterosexual Roman men interviewed on television said they were afraid to step outdoors without their partners lest they be considered gay. Campaigners against the event say they have been vindicated by voluntary outings by public figures - a rarity in Italy. A cabinet minister who declared himself bisexual was followed by the fashion designer Egon Furstenberg, a member of the Agnelli family, which owns Fiat. A rebel French bishop, Jacques Gaillot, revealed yesterday that the Pope had banned him from attending a debate on religion and homosexuality. Both sides are preparing for a showdown on July 8, when the gays plan to march to the Colosseum, although the city council has refused them a permit to march there or past any religious building. The Green mayor, Francesco Rutelli, initially supported the festival but, to jeers, later joined forces with the rightwing opposition. The warmest welcome is being extended by hoteliers and tour operators, who have been stung by the failure of the jubilee to generate an expected bonanza. \"World Pride is a good thing, especially with rich groups coming from the United States and the Scandinavian countries,\" said Antonella Compagnucci of the STO-Incoming travel agency. Some Rome travel guides, gays point out, say that Boniface VIII called the first Holy Year in 1300 partly to divert attention from rumours of papal sodomy.",

It was one of several media stories suggesting that Blair had reined in his powerful chancellor. Campbell was challenged by the Tory MP David Ruffley at a select committee hearing and denied it. But Ruffley may have asked the wrong question and Campbell's authorship is widely believed. He may have wanted the \"flaws\" point to appear in a column - instead of page one. Verdict: guilty Margaret Beckett Like several middle-ranking ministers the ex-leader has been the target of whispers. Beckett is again tipped for the sack by the media. But Blair has found her a safe pair of hands. Yesterday she attacked the media for writing the opposite of what Campbell tells them. Verdict: not guilty",

      "body": "<p>In the 1980s - following the success of David Attenborough's zoological documentaries - most sitcoms and a majority of one-off plays would include a scene in which a couple snogging on a sofa were watching Life On Earth. Animal behaviour and animalistic passion would then be counter-pointed. \"At this point the female displays,\" Sir David would whisper, as the girlfriend leaned back to elevate her chest. The scene would generally end with the man doing a terrified detumescent flinch as the great naturalist intoned: \"After sex, the female kills the male.\" </p> <p>This old television joke turns serious, well, semi-serious, in The Secret Life Of The Family (Wednesday, 8pm, BBC1) in which the Attenborough tactics (filming of mating and nurturing rituals, time-delay cameras, dispassionate analysis of behaviour) are applied to a human family to produce a sort of Social Life On Earth. The Benthall family let cameras inside their house, and even drains, throughout an August day last year. An advanced environmental scanner showed the invisible bugs on their bed-clothes and food. </p> <p>Confusingly, the mother of this family's a well-known sitcom actress: Janine Duvitski from One Foot In The Grave, here using her married name. This may lead some viewers to believe that the project is a spoof, but the complicating presence of a recognisable actor may be explained by the fact that only Equity members were prepared to agree to this level of exhibitionism. Although in fairness it should be said that this show is partly a BBC spoiler of Big Brother - an elimination gameshow featuring members of the public in a lensed-up house, forthcoming from Channel 4. </p> <p>But The Secret Life Of The Family relies less on voyeuristic video (CCTV in the living room) than gimmick pictures. X-ray photography turns a Benthall daughter dancing in the kitchen into a skipping skeleton. Many other sequences resemble that sci-fi stand-by: the man with see-through vision who becomes unable to eat and drink because he sees bacterial monsters in every pie and pint. Fancy cameras reveal the \"giant cannibal mites\" stalking across the bedsheets. The white duvet is shown to have a hidden inner decoration resembling a 60s album cover. </p> <p>But analysis of these scenes finally brings to mind not Attenborough but Lineker and Hansen. Silky pundits - a cardiologist, a nutritionist, a pair of quip-slick behavioural consultants - talk us through slow-motion replays of the family sleeping, eating, disagreeing. We learn that burgers should be cooked through and that a hand held out for shaking should be \"straight not dominant, and give the same pressure you receive\". </p> <p>It's common to accuse these exercises of voyeurism - Big Brother is about to get that big-time - but the real complaint here is that the cameras aren't nosy enough to justify the anthropological billing. A Benthall adolescent has his first kiss with a girl transmitted to the nation, but the parents here submit to little more intrusion than interviews, although Janine's menopause is diagnosed by the medical pundit. </p> <p>What separates humans from animals is jobs, mortgages, contraception. Yet, although Paul Benthall jokes that his first thoughts on waking are \"sex and money\", The Secret Life Of The Family never opens the cheque book or pulls back the duvet. I'm not asking for BBC1 to become C5, but so much of human behaviour is driven by financial or erotic considerations that, without these aspects, any attempt to do an Attenborough on the family is superficial. </p> <p>For example, a cardiologist assesses the physical and mental pressures on Jan and Paul. But are they working? Is the lavish home with swimming pool paid for or exorbitantly loaned? Was their agreement to let the cameras in a career move, or financial necessity? These questions may be intrusive, but that's not an objection easily sustained by a couple who've just let the BBC wire their house for pictures and sound. </p> <p>In any secret camera project, the most important subject is sex, be it absent or present. The Dutch Big Brother showed couples making love under bed-clothes and the British version hints at the same possibility. This wouldn't be possible or desirable in BBC 1 peak-time, but mating is a major theme of anthropology and its absence prevents any sense that The Secret Life Of The Family is offering a man and woman in full. </p> <p>The project finally blows itself up when, over film of the Benthalls at a poolside barbecue, the behavioural consultants note that \"something is badly wrong\". Too many \"fake smiles and fake conversations\". They excitedly conclude that the presence of the cameras is causing people to act rather than behave. They might have added that, as the Benthalls are thespians, many of their friends may be actors, so what we're watching is professional actors acting socially. </p> <p>These layers of artificiality condemn The Secret Life Of The Family to keep its secrets. An anthropological film about humans, with no mention of sex, work or money, is about as useful as a zoological series which decides it's inappropriate to invoke the food chain. The revelation that our duvets and fridges are invisible Goyas of microscopic life is no compensation for this failure to go inside the humans. </p> <p><strong>Dramatic debut</strong></p> <p>In the last 15 years, the BBC has had more heads of drama - and more spells in which the desk sat empty while potential applicants pretended not to hear the request - than bosses of any other department. That's not surprising. Peak-time drama is the most terrifying area of scheduling. Location filming is more expensive per minute than any broadcasting genre except Premiership football, and the difference here is that Sky and ITV aren't trying to force the BBC out of this game. </p> <p>Drama is also the form in which it's hardest to predict how an idea will turn out on the screen. Game shows and documentaries can have formats so compelling that you'd need to leave the camera lens cap on to get them wrong. In fiction, there are so many variables - casting, direction, the mysterious matter of which characters win public affection - that it's alarmingly easy to spend \u00a36m on a series nobody watches. That's why head of drama is television's soccer-manager job. </p> <p>But Border Cafe (Sunday, 9.20pm, BBC1) has the feel of a justified gamble: a good day in the casino of popular taste. Written by Tim Firth (Preston Front, Neville's Island) and set in a cafe, the series is triggered by a genuinely original dramatic situation. Cafe owner Charlotte (Elizabeth Carling) is the former lead singer of hit rock band True North. She's stalked by Ronnie (Georgia McKenzie) who played her in tribute band Untrue North and lost her career when Charlotte left the band. Charlotte offers her a job at the cafe. </p> <p>The wit of this odd symbiotic relationship is matched by the quirkiness of Firth's writing. A young woman who makes fun of Yoko Ono's silly glasses suddenly pauses and adds that she wouldn't of course say that if there was anything wrong with her eyes. BBC1, though, has seen straight in commissioning Border Cafe, which is in a tradition of northern comedy (Bennett, Wood, Rosenthal) but also brings its own spices to the menu, both verbally and visually.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This Wednesday, at Lancaster House in London, there will be one of those very outward displays of the so-called special relationship. Some 250 British and American financiers and entrepreneurs - such as Frank Zarb, chairman of the Nasdaq stock market, and Sir Martin Sorrell, boss of advertising giant WPP - will line up to hear from the chancellor, Gordon Brown, the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, and the US ambassador, Philip Lader, just how well things are going. The evidence will be there in the statistics. Figures to be published on the day by the Department of Trade's Invest in Britain bureau will show that, despite the strength of sterling and the screams of pain from Britain's manufacturing heartlands, inward investment in the UK is booming. The figures released this time last year looked exceptional. A record 650 inward investment projects were recorded, creating or safeguarding almost 120,000 jobs. During 1998, Britain attracted some \u00a338bn from foreign investors - worth more than a quarter of all foreign direct investment inflows into the EU and some 13% of total world inflows. But this time around the numbers will be even bigger and they will come with a special, welcome twist: more than a quarter of all new projects will have come from the technology, media and telecoms sectors, indicating that US companies in particular view Britain as Europe's digital nerve centre in the new knowledge-based economy. But whatever the raw figures shout in terms of how the British economy is coping outside euroland, there will be clear reasons for caution. Whether they come from Japan, the far east, or across the Atlantic, inward investment decisions, due to their tendency to be heavily capital-intensive in nature, tend to be made on long-time horizons. Many of today's projects have been years in the making and a good proportion predate Labour's election victory. What is more, in the case of US investors at least, economists generally agree that Britain's competitive advantage is being steadily eroded, if only for the simple reason that American firms are becoming much more confident in dealing with continental business partners directly. The warning to Mr Byers from Andrew Fraser, chief executive of the bureau and one of the DTI's most senior civil servants, was written in early May, when sterling was at a historic high against the euro and the debate was raging over the effect on British exports. Since then, an interest rate hike by the European Central Bank has led to a weakening of sterling against the euro. But Mr Fraser's own concerns are long term and structural in nature - focusing on the growth of central and east European competition, for example, where labour costs are cheaper. Fraser, who was appointed chief executive of the Invest in Britain bureau by the last Conservative government in 1994, travels constantly drumming up investors and has an ideal vantage point from which to relay to ministers the mood in the international investment community. By way of illustration of what he describes as \"unendurable pain\" in the manufacturing community faced by the exchange rate, he points out that Philips employs over 15,000 in central Europe and recently closed a Scottish facility to shift production of lightbulbs to Hungary. His particular worry is that while plant closures in the automotive and textiles sectors have drawn the headlines, the real threat is in areas such as consumer electronics, where technologies are changing rapidly and investors, such as the Japanese, are having to make quick decisions about re-equipping manufacturing facilities. For the Japanese, the situation is particularly acute due to economic conditions at home, where the economy refuses to reinflate. Their corporations here can no longer tolerate continuing losses. At the same time, rows over moves in the budget to reform taxation of multinationals, leading to claims that some big firms based in the UK were being taxed twice on corporate profits, have highlighted a sense that Britain's standing in the world of global business is slipping away. The Lancaster House conference is entitled \"enterprise and technology for all: seizing the opportunity\".

      "body": "<p>This is a tale of two parties. The first is the Green party in America, which has just selected consumer-rights advocate and maverick, Ralph Nader as its presidential candidate. Nader's support currently stands at 7% in the polls. That is not enough for Nader to make it into presidential debates, but more than enough for him to make a crucial difference between Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W Bush, who are running neck and neck.</p> <p>The second is the Green party in Germany, which has just emerged from a divisive row at its congress over nuclear power. The government, in which it is a junior partner, had just reached a deal with the nuclear industry to phase out nuclear energy and shut down power stations, within 32 years. One of the party's co-leaders said she would resign if congress backed the deal; another said the coalition would collapse if he didn't. The congress supported it. The row continues. Meanwhile the party, which has seen its vote decline in the last 14 federal, state and European elections, is haemorrhaging support.</p> <p>The first has no chance of power and is rising in popularity; the second is in power and finding its popularity dwindling. More intriguingly, those two conditions may well be interrelated. Limited evidence seems to suggest that there is an inverse relationship between a Green party's proximity to power and the number of people who want to back it. In other words the more it looks as though they actually might play a significant role in running a country, the less of a role people want them to play.</p> <p>It is not a new dilemma. It has been an issue ever since the magical moment in 1983 when the German Greens wandered into the Bundestag wearing jeans and carrying potted plants. To what extent could they influence the political establishment and to what extent would the political establishment influence them? On the night of their election the late Petra Kelly, one of the key figures in the party during the 70s and 80s said: \"Parliament is like the marketplace for us, or the building site, where we can spread the information. Parliament is not our goal, only part of our strategy.\" On hearing this, one of her colleagues grumbled that if she carried on talking like that: \"We will slide into a minority sect faster than we can talk about it.\"</p> <p>You can see the argument played out in Joschka Fischer's wardrobe. When he took the oath as the environment minister of Hesse in 1985 he did so in jeans and trainers. Now he is the German for eign minister and wears three-piece suits. Superficial? It would be if his politics had not changed just as dramatically. Fifteen years ago he was an opponent of Nato; last year he supported the bombing of Serbia.</p> <p>This tension has always been depicted as a straightforward split between two factions - the \"realos\" and the \"fundis\". Realos believed that if you were going to stand in elections then you had to make some concessions to electoralism and if you wanted to work in coalitions you would have to compromise. The fundis declared that the very reason why they received their support was because they did not operate or look like other parties. As with most political constructs - old and New Labour, wet and dry Tories, modernisers and traditionalists - the putative split between realos and fundis was hopelessly simplistic and crude. However, it also had some basis in reality. The Greens have had to decide whether they can balance being a party of protest and a party of power and if so, at what price.</p> <p>Nor is it a dilemma particular to the Greens. These calculations underpin the nature of all electoral politics. \"What do we want to give up if we want to get in?\" are the staple issues that have informed Labour's transformation over the past 15 years. Only when the Tories start asking themselves the same questions might they have a chance of being re-elected.</p> <p>The answers necessarily change with the circumstances. Where the Greens are concerned, the circumstances at present are crucial. Greens have taken up positions in five European governments - France, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Finland. They also support center-left administrations in Sweden and New Zealand. And they have recently made a strong showing in Britain too. Thanks to the introduction of proportional representation they now have two MEPs, three GLA members and an MSP. The row between realos and fundis is no longer the stuff of internal bickering but the life and death of governments.</p> <p>By any standards this is an impressive achievement. All the more so when one considers that, unlike other parties, the Greens have no rigid socio-economic base on which to rely. The American Greens may be strongest among the alternative lifestyles of California. But it is run from the offices of the local steelworkers union in rundown Gary, Indiana, and the Texas branch was founded in the headquarters of the American TUC. To not only create but cement an electorally viable political tradition, drawn from a mixture of the young, pacifists, trade unionists and environmentalists, in less than 20 years, is no mean feat. Keeping it together in government will be just as tough.</p> <p>Key to its success will be the Greens' relationship both with the rest of the left and with its own activists. Nader, for example, is already being accused of drawing crucial support from Gore that might let Bush in through the back door. He rightly responds that the choice between Gore and Bush is scarcely a choice at all. Both are \"drab and dreary\" and reflect the interests of corporate America. If Gore wants his votes then he will have to shift to the left to get them, just as he has been shifting to the right to scoop up disenchanted Republicans.</p> <p>The Greens in Germany have also made a difference. The agreement on nuclear power and the granting of citizenship rights for foreigners born in Germany have been major achievements which would not have happened without them. But they have paid heavily for their support and have been hopelessly compromised by Fischer's support for the war. While Nader may not wish to follow the German Greens, the German Greens, and their European and Antipodean allies, could do worse than learn some things from. He gained his bargaining position partly through his work in the anti-capitalist demonstrations in Seattle and Washington and joint campaigns with unions. He is the candidate for a party, but he is also part of a movement. His relative electoral strength is not an end in itself, but an illustration of his influence outside of the mainstream. The stronger he is from the outside, the more clout he will have on the inside.</p> <p>Greens are right to take positions in government, but not at any price. Unlike their social democratic coalition partners, they are more than simply electoral machines. Taking up ministerial positions demands that they deepen, not weaken, their links with the wider movements. If the price for doing so is too high, they should forgo the opportunity and wait until the orthodox left has raised its game. It is possible to have power without office.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Francis King Norfolk \u0095 Simon Hoggart's fascination with the number of men having criminal records could start a whole new sport (Simon Hoggart's diary, July 1). A few months ago we had a brief spate of politicians confessing to having smoked cannabis as students. Perhaps Simon could find out how many male MPs have criminal records. Geraldine Curtis London geraldine@brixton.new.labour.org.uk \u0095 I cannot accept Quentin Poulsen's view that America is less violent than Britain (Letters, July 1). Of course there are areas of America where violence is minimal, but the same is true here. At at least in Britain we do not have (or at least have not yet had) schoolchildren killing other schoolchildren with firearms. Perhaps it will come as Britain assimilates more and more socio-economic policies which derive from the United States. Mr Poulsen is right however when he describes the moronic and boorish behaviour which is now the common currency in Britain. How sad to see the way we are now perceived by the rest of the world. Chris Waller Bristol chriswaller21@yahoo.co.uk \u0095 So Quentin Poulsen thinks we English are small-minded and spiteful? He says that we regard doing something that \"annoys the hell\" out of someone we have never met to be an achievement. Well, Quentin, you've just \"achieved\" with me. As I don't believe that living here is mandatory, I can only say \"missing you already\". Robin Muskett Peterborough Alpha1@droom.demon.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>There are a lot of nursing homes around Blackpool. It's the sort of place many elderly people imagine spending their last days - in a pleasant home, not far from the sea, with all those hazy memories of summer holidays. But not all these places offer the sort of care for their elderly residents that we might expect.</p> <p>In those where there is neglect and abuse, there are probably staff who don't like what they see. They are reluctant to speak out. They are frightened for their jobs. It is easier to stay silent or quietly leave.</p> <p>Bryan Bladon did neither. He blew the whistle and, like many before him, was sacked. But unlike his predecessors, Bladon had the law on his side - a new law that protects whistleblowers against sacking or other forms of victimisation.</p> <p>The Public Interest Disclosure Act, described by campaigners in the US as the most far-reaching whistleblower law in the world, is a year old this week. Last month Bladon, a 51-year-old nurse, became the first known whistleblower to receive compensation as a result of the legislation, after taking his former employer to an employment tribunal. He was awarded \u00a323,000 and hopes his experience will encourage others to expose bad practice - not only in nursing homes, which is Bladon's personal interest, but elsewhere too.</p> <p>Since the act came into force on July 2 last year, three cases are known to have been ruled on by a tribunal. In each, the so-called whistleblower has won the claim - compensation payouts on the other two claims are yet to be finalised. In total, 200 claims have been brought in the past year, yet campaigners say that unless government, businesses and union leaders embark on a major awareness campaign, the act will remain largely unheeded, particularly in the private sector.</p> <p>As a result, disasters such as the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise and the baby deaths at Bristol Royal Infirmary, which might have been prevented had employees been able to voice concerns without fear of persecution, could go on happening in a culture that remains one of inertia, cover-up and secrecy.</p> <p>So what does it take to become a whistleblower? Bladon had been working as a charge nurse at an old people's home outside Blackpool for almost three months when he became concerned about the way some residents were being treated. He was worried about drug records; he saw unexplained injuries and signs of neglect. One man, he said, had been gripped so tightly that a nail imprint was left in his arm.</p> <p>Bladon told his immediate manager - verbally first, then in a written account. He assumed it would be passed on to the home's proprietor, ALM Medical Services, but he heard nothing. He left it for nine days, but when he witnessed further incidents, he contacted the social services inspectorate and the home was raided last September. When he next turned up for work, Bladon received a frosty reception from colleagues.</p> <p>The inspectors sent a directive to the home's proprietor, ordering an investigation into Bladon's concerns. Bladon was summoned to a disciplinary hearing and, on September 16 last year, was dismissed. With the backing of his union, Unison, Bladon took the home's owner to an employment tribunal which found decisively in his favour - a triumph for whistleblowers, but at high personal cost.</p> <p>\"It's been horrendous,\" says Bladon. \"The most difficult things to deal with were the isolation by other staff and being made to look like some ogre who had challenged the system. I'm a professional nurse. I have a duty of care. \"I'm not easily intimidated. I know it's very difficult for people - especially younger people who have not long qualified, and people who have got families and responsibilities - to take on these employers. Good staff, staff who have a conscience, leave rather than blow the whistle.\"</p> <p>He is hoping his case will open the door to others who want to speak out but have been too frightened. \"To end up with \u00a323,000 - it does give a message to nurses that they are not going to walk away with nothing. It also gives employers a message, that they are not going to get away with it.\"</p> <p>Among the other successful cases is that of Antonio Fernandes, found to have been unfairly dismissed by Netcom Consultants, a Reading-based telecommunications company, after he blew the whistle on a boss who allegedly asked him to sign off bogus expenses amounting to \u00a3370,000.</p> <p>Fernandes, 59, was the company's financial controller. Although vindicated at his tribunal and expected to win a six-figure sum in compensation, he is not optimistic about finding another job. Age is against him and he thinks potential employers may be apprehensive and see him as a troublemaker. But faced with the same circumstances he would do the same again. He did not do it for himself, he says, but because he cared for the company.</p> <p>\"It's a long process. It leaves you out in the cold. You feel victimised and you lose confidence. All I did was follow my conscience.

      "bodyText": "There are a lot of nursing homes around Blackpool. It's the sort of place many elderly people imagine spending their last days - in a pleasant home, not far from the sea, with all those hazy memories of summer holidays. But not all these places offer the sort of care for their elderly residents that we might expect. In those where there is neglect and abuse, there are probably staff who don't like what they see. They are reluctant to speak out. They are frightened for their jobs. It is easier to stay silent or quietly leave. Bryan Bladon did neither. He blew the whistle and, like many before him, was sacked. But unlike his predecessors, Bladon had the law on his side - a new law that protects whistleblowers against sacking or other forms of victimisation. The Public Interest Disclosure Act, described by campaigners in the US as the most far-reaching whistleblower law in the world, is a year old this week. Last month Bladon, a 51-year-old nurse, became the first known whistleblower to receive compensation as a result of the legislation, after taking his former employer to an employment tribunal. He was awarded \u00a323,000 and hopes his experience will encourage others to expose bad practice - not only in nursing homes, which is Bladon's personal interest, but elsewhere too. Since the act came into force on July 2 last year, three cases are known to have been ruled on by a tribunal. In each, the so-called whistleblower has won the claim - compensation payouts on the other two claims are yet to be finalised. In total, 200 claims have been brought in the past year, yet campaigners say that unless government, businesses and union leaders embark on a major awareness campaign, the act will remain largely unheeded, particularly in the private sector. As a result, disasters such as the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise and the baby deaths at Bristol Royal Infirmary, which might have been prevented had employees been able to voice concerns without fear of persecution, could go on happening in a culture that remains one of inertia, cover-up and secrecy. So what does it take to become a whistleblower? Bladon had been working as a charge nurse at an old people's home outside Blackpool for almost three months when he became concerned about the way some residents were being treated. He was worried about drug records; he saw unexplained injuries and signs of neglect. One man, he said, had been gripped so tightly that a nail imprint was left in his arm. Bladon told his immediate manager - verbally first, then in a written account. He assumed it would be passed on to the home's proprietor, ALM Medical Services, but he heard nothing. He left it for nine days, but when he witnessed further incidents, he contacted the social services inspectorate and the home was raided last September. When he next turned up for work, Bladon received a frosty reception from colleagues. The inspectors sent a directive to the home's proprietor, ordering an investigation into Bladon's concerns. Bladon was summoned to a disciplinary hearing and, on September 16 last year, was dismissed. With the backing of his union, Unison, Bladon took the home's owner to an employment tribunal which found decisively in his favour - a triumph for whistleblowers, but at high personal cost. \"It's been horrendous,\" says Bladon. \"The most difficult things to deal with were the isolation by other staff and being made to look like some ogre who had challenged the system. I'm a professional nurse. I have a duty of care. \"I'm not easily intimidated. I know it's very difficult for people - especially younger people who have not long qualified, and people who have got families and responsibilities - to take on these employers. Good staff, staff who have a conscience, leave rather than blow the whistle.\" He is hoping his case will open the door to others who want to speak out but have been too frightened. \"To end up with \u00a323,000 - it does give a message to nurses that they are not going to walk away with nothing. It also gives employers a message, that they are not going to get away with it.\" Among the other successful cases is that of Antonio Fernandes, found to have been unfairly dismissed by Netcom Consultants, a Reading-based telecommunications company, after he blew the whistle on a boss who allegedly asked him to sign off bogus expenses amounting to \u00a3370,000. Fernandes, 59, was the company's financial controller. Although vindicated at his tribunal and expected to win a six-figure sum in compensation, he is not optimistic about finding another job. Age is against him and he thinks potential employers may be apprehensive and see him as a troublemaker. But faced with the same circumstances he would do the same again. He did not do it for himself, he says, but because he cared for the company. \"It's a long process. It leaves you out in the cold. You feel victimised and you lose confidence. All I did was follow my conscience. You have to do what you essentially believe is right.\" The third known case is that of Kostana Azmi who was found to have been unfairly dismissed after she raised concerns about the governance of the Orbis charitable trust for which she worked. There may be other resolved cases, details of which have not yet been made public. The government, it seems, would like to keep it that way.

      "body": "<p>Constructivism was a style and a way of thinking pursued by a number of radical architects just after Russia's October Revolution. It proved to be one of the most influential approaches to modern architecture. This abstract, geometric architecture, free of bourgeois, aristocratic and Tsarist traits, symbolised the hopes of those artists who truly believed that the workers' paradise was little more than a Five-Year Plan or a New Economic Policy away. </p> <p>The movement is physically best summed up by Ilya Golosov's Zuyev Club, still standing a little worse for wear on Moscow's Lesnaya Ulitsa. Built in 1929, not long before Stalin stamped down on Modern movement design, this workers' club is a memorable essay in the art of handling Platonic forms: a glass cylinder on the street corner containing the main stair intersects cubes and rectangles. There is no decoration. Eight hundred years of pre-revolutionary Russian history has been discarded. Architects from across Europe came to look and to borrow the stark yet powerful visual vocabulary of the constructivists, and they're still doing so today. One has only to look at the striking geometry of designs by Zaha Hadid and Daniel Libeskind to see how the Russian constructivists are still affecting the course of modern architecture. </p> <p>But not in Russia itself - far from it. The latest style in Moscow is what might be called reconstructivism. Wherever a historic building once stood but was destroyed, a more or less exact replacement now seems to be called for. Although not official policy, this growing attempt to re-create pre-revolutionary, pre-Stalin Moscow is largely driven by the office of the capital's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. So much so that Luzhkov, with his equal enthusiasm for flash-trash postmodern public art and shopping malls, has been nicknamed the \"great architect of capitalism\". Stalin was, of course, the \"great architect of socialism\", although this referred to his construction of the Soviet state and empire rather than his love of histrionic skyscrapers, bombastic hotels and eye-boggling apartment blocks. </p> <p>The triumphal symbol of Luzhkov's reconstructivism is without doubt the vast and vulgar Church of Christ the Saviour, completed between 1997 and last year at the cost of something like \u00a3240m. This hulking pile of domed white marble is a re-creation of the ugly church that Tsar Alexander I commissioned in celebration of Napoleon's retreat from the gates of Moscow in 1812. It took 45 years to build, but Stalin destroyed it in a day. That was in 1931; the site was to be used for the long-discussed Palace of the Soviets. The winning design was to be topped with a 300ft statue of Lenin that would bring the total height to about 1,000ft. It never materialised, because of a lack of funds and Hitler's Operation Barbarossa, which saw Nazi troops at the gates of Moscow at blitzkrieg speed. </p> <p>The abandoned site went on to house one of the largest swimming pools behind the Iron Curtain, and now the Church of Christ the Saviour. Ugly it may be, yet the church - or the church that was - has long been a part of Moscow folk memory. This is where many couples courted, canoodling on benches set around this enormous sacred snub to Napoleon. Now it snubs communism, even though hardened old ladies still walk here holding aloft portraits of the great architect of socialism, praying that the bad old days will come back as surely as the Church of Christ the Saviour has. </p> <p>The mayor's instincts are probably right as far as popular sentiment goes. In any case, Moscow is a huge city and the reconstruction of a few historic monuments is surely not a sign that the buzzing Russian capital is suffering from a debilitating case of cultural regression. Still, any city has to ask itself why it feels the need to rebuild the past, especially when that past was darker and more dismal than the present. </p> <p>Step into Red Square today and you pass through the Resurrection Gate. This colourful confection may look like a page of picture-book 17th-century Russian architecture but it is in fact a reconstruction of the chocolate-box gateway that Stalin had demolished, again in 1931. Removing the gateway enabled waves of high-kicking troops, together with tanks and artillery, and later rocket and missile launchers, to parade unhindered through the city and across Red Square, where Soviet leaders would take the salute from Lenin's tomb, a grim interlocking of less than lovely geometric forms designed by Aleksei Shchusev, one of Stalin's pet architects. Now the reconstructed gates help to protect the Kremlin from criminal elements who might have less ceremonial uses in mind for their military hardware. </p> <p>Pass through the gateway with today's army of garishly dressed tourists snapping away at any building with an onion dome, and here's another reconstruction, this time the blancmange-like Kazan Cathedral. This sweet conceit is a reproduction of the early 17th-century church demolished on the orders of you-know-who in 1936. Consecrated in 1637, the original cathedral was built to house the icon of the Kazan Virgin. She has since emigrated to St Petersburg and a reproduction went on show when the reconstructed cathedral was consecrated in 1993. Luzhkov and Boris Yeltsin, then president of Russia, were among the congregation. </p> <p>In a way this reconstruction has been a success. Where once there were long queues of Soviet citizens waiting to file past Lenin's cadaver on the other side of Red Square, today the first Soviet leader's mausoleum is largely a plaything for tourists, while local women and children crowd into the little new cathedral to light tapers and kiss freshly painted icons. Communism may have given way to criminally driven capitalism in Moscow, yet a much older religion represents the beliefs of Muscovites excluded from the loud and provocative world of the new rich. </p> <p>However, once you add in the rash of postmodern office blocks, shopping malls, banks and other new capitalist junk, plus some of the most bizarre new public art to be found anywhere in the world, 21st-century Moscow is about as vulgar as architecture gets this side of Shanghai or Shenzen. The new look is both unrepentantly kitsch and a perfect match for the rampant capitalism and reinvigorated Orthodoxy that drive and underscore it. </p> <p>Will things change? Not for a while - or only for the worse. Moscow has always been a showy city, its architecture loud and richly unclear. The oddities in its architectural history are purist buildings like Golosov's Zuyev Club, and not such hideous newcomers as the hugely popular Okhotny underground shopping mall. Foreign architects are not unwelcome here, but those who propose designs shot through with the spirit of the constructivists (very many architects worldwide) are considered to be too expensive to warrant serious attention. In any case they either can't or won't give post-revolutionary Moscow what it appears to want - commercial and religious kitsch and the history that Stalin stole away.</p>",

The most popular reason for keeping the monarchy is that they bring money in through tourism. But for much of the time the Queen and her entourage are not even in the country, never mind in Buckingham Palace. Even when they are in their most famous abode, they hardly stroll out on to the balcony and salute the visitors. Tourists don't come to see your Gran, William, but rather her house, and traditions like the changing of the guard. </p> <p>The next argument is that the Queen and her family are a good representation of Brits abroad. No! English people are seen as pompous, arrogant and obnoxious. These false assumptions are reinforced by the royals. Nobody is fooled by Prince Charles grinning at a party held in his honour in an African village. His eyes stare into space as if he is envisaging an extremely amusing polo match, or one of his pack of dogs chasing after a fox. The real representatives of our country should be the likes of Elton John and Richard Branson, or any of the people who were acknowledged at the bravery awards this spring: compassionate, hardworking, sincere people. </p> <p>Another argument from royal supporters is that \"Britain wouldn't be Britain without the monarchy\". If this is the case we should turf them out now, because we could do with a change. Britain would lose the elitism which stems from and is legitimised by the royals. Everything this country does is constantly compared to past achievements. Our football matches are always preceded by shots of us winning the World Cup in 1966. This nostalgic look into the past is a sure sign we are going to crash out of the competition. It's all right to be proud of our past achievements, but we always finish our nostalgia trips by saying, \"It will never be as good as it used to be.\" We can't shake this attitude off while the monarchy remains and reminds us of times gone by, when we were the best at everything. </p> <p>William, I feel sorry for you because you have been born into bonded slavery. I would never want to be in your position. I would love to ask you if you are happy, or if you really want to be king. From the day you were born the royal advisers and spin doctors were rubbing their hands together, shouting, \"Eureka!\", and began spreading statements like \"His upbringing will be different from the other royal children.\" </p> <p>Yeah, right. Your life was different from other royal children. It was also completely different from the upbringing of every other person in the world: you were pronounced \"the saviour of Britain\" (or at least of the monarchy). How can anyone live up to expectations like that? You have been through a lot in your life and you have handled it all spectacularly well. You have emerged with your dignity intact, but at the price of being able to enjoy yourself or live your life the way you want to. </p> <p>Practically every girl in the world sees you as a Prince Charming, but you can't have any of them. The extremely feisty Britney Spears has allegedly been knocking at your door, but imagine the coverage if you went out with her - the tabloid editors must pray every night for a story like that. You can't meet one girl who you could take out without permission, or without the press getting news of it. </p> <p>You have a huge personal fortune yet you can't go out and spend a penny of it. Your achievements and failures are scrutinised by society - and this must remove any sense of achievement for you. How many other people, for example, have to live up to the hopes of a nation when receiving their exam results? </p> <p>I also feel that although the press has been good to you while in school, now that you have turned 18 you will be followed like a fox in the middle of the Beaufort hunt. You can't slip up once, or your years of working on a squeaky-clean image will be ruined. </p> <p>That's why you should abdicate. You would still be Prince William, but you would be free from manipulation by the royal industry. No one could tell you how to behave, or who you could see. Then Britney and Christina could fight it out over you. You could sell your story to the papers and, my God, what a time you could have. </p> <p>Counterblast: Dear William is on BBC2, Monday July 10, at 7.30pm.</p>",

I have also just finished making a documentary for the BBC about my opinions on your life and your family. We have very few things in common apart from our age and I am very relieved this is the case. You may well be extremely rich (by a normal 18-year-old's standards), you may be the most eligible bachelor in Britain, if not the world, and you may also be a close personal \"friend\" of Britney Spears, but I would never want to be in your position. (Except for the Britney Spears thing.) The reason I wouldn't want to be you, and why I pity you, is that despite these things you are missing out on events that everyone should experience when they are young. You lack the basic thing that every other \"normal\" person of your age has: freedom. And the fact that you don't have this removes the chance you have for a life.

      "body": "<p>Irish theatre is stuffed with the great and the good. A lot of them are dead and most of them are men. Garry Hynes is an exception. Garry is short for Gearoidin, the Irish version of Geraldine. </p> <p>For the past 25 years, since she founded the Druid theatre company in Galway, Hynes has cut a swathe through Irish theatre and beyond. She championed neglected Irish writers such as Tom Murphy in the mid-80s, with productions that then transferred from Galway to London's Donmar Warehouse. These plays were the advance guard for the Irish invasion of London's theatreland a decade later, in which Hynes also played a major part. Martin McDonagh was a Hynes discovery, his Beauty Queen of Leenane plucked from a pile of unsolicited scripts. In 1998 Hynes's Broadway production of McDonagh's Leenane trilogy won her a Tony, making her the first woman ever to win one for best director. Anything Dublin could do, Hynes could almost always do better. </p> <p>Then there was Hynes's time as artistic director of Dublin's Abbey theatre, from 1990 to 1993. She was the sixth director in seven years and her first production was heavily criticised, yet she managed to drag that venerable but backward-looking institution into the modern era, despite much opposition and malicious rumour. </p> <p>If Hynes were a man she would probably be called determined and quietly confident, but since she's female and five foot nothing she tends to get labelled as tough as old boots. It doesn't worry her one jot. She is, says Deborah Warner, \"a woman who is brave and has tremendous nerve\". Her conversation is characterised by the same precise and forceful intelligence that marks her direction. What you see is what you get. </p> <p>Hynes, 47, is in London for the British premiere of Marina Carr's On Raftery's Hill, about a family living in the rural Midlands of Ireland. Before our meeting, I sit outside the Royal Court reading the script. Although the sun is warm, I feel as if a cold, clammy hand has taken hold of my heart. </p> <p>The story of a wealthy farmer whose fields are full of rotting carcasses but whose real acts of pollution take place with his own children inside the farmhouse, Carr's play, with its brutality and incest, is as terrible as any Greek tragedy. As the critic for the Irish Times quipped, it makes even The Beauty Queen of Leenane seem like a light romantic comedy. </p> <p>\"There is a ferocity about the play and subject matter that is not easy. But it's only hard to believe if you don't want to believe it,\" says Hynes. Druid commissioned On Raftery's Hill in 1996, shortly before Hynes returned to the company. Although the play was born in the mid-90s, its subject matter chimes with current events in Ireland, particularly the spate of revelations about child abuse. The play has become part of the nation's debate about how it cares for its children. </p> <p>\"There has been a stunned quality to the response, and a degree of shock. There is a real need for people to think that people aren't like the family in the play,\" explains Hynes. \"Some people have been angry that Marina doesn't condemn any of the characters, and it's something I had to work through and come to terms with when I was directing it. But you have to see these people's behaviour in the play as a continuum, and one of the things I realised is that the emotions and needs of these characters are exactly like my own. You can't say that they are less than human. These girls really love their father. Dinah and her father are locked in a terrible kind of marriage.\" </p> <p>As with all of Carr's plays, including The Mai and Portia Coughlan (which Hynes premiered at the Abbey), the family stands as a metaphor for Ireland, and what appears to be a domestic situation has a public application. This is a quality that runs through many of the plays that Hynes has championed, whether it is the old classics such as Juno and the Paycock or the plays of Synge, all six of which she shortly intends to produce in repertoire, or the work of young writers such as Carr and McDonagh. </p> <p>Hynes bristles slightly at the suggestion that a play such as On Raftery's Hill is a welcome breath of fresh air given the tendency of so much Irish drama to mythologise. \"This play is only a demythology if you take the view that all the previous plays are mythologies,\" she says briskly. She eyes me beadily: \"Would you say the work of Eugene O'Neill is a mythology or a debunking of the Irish American experience?\" </p> <p>Of course Hynes is right. Good plays can both mythologise and debunk, and Hynes's choice of work over the years has reflected a determination to explore the realities and myths of what it means to be Irish in the modern world. With the exception of some work for the RSC and the New York premiere of Arthur Miller's latest play, Mr Peter's Connections, Hynes has explored only the Irish canon. It is not for want of offers. The Tony brought in a flood of jobs that she turned down. </p> <p>\"I considered them all on the basis of whether they were something I absolutely needed to do, and most weren't. So often, all that people want you to do is repeat what you've just won an award for.\" Even returning to Druid after the Abbey is part of the pattern - although some suggested she was just running for shelter after a battering in Dublin. </p> <p>\"It is probably open to that interpretation,\" says Hynes dryly. She says she is interested in Irish plays simply because she is Irish - although that interest is more pronounced because the time she was born, the early 50s, marks the divide between the old Ireland and the new. </p> <p>\"Growing up, I had an automatic expectation of university and a career but all around me were the remnants and stories of an Ireland that was disappearing or gone. It was the need to explore that life that had gone before - how we had got from that to this - that interested me. I think that the plays of Martin McDonagh took me full circle. I feel there will be a shift in the coming years.\" </p> <p>That shift may be marked by the courage of Carr's play, which doesn't hold the characters up for judgment but peers into the dark heart of one family, maybe the dark heart of Ireland itself, and tries to understand it. </p> <p>\"The circumstances of the play are close to cases that have become public in Ireland ,\" says Hynes. \"But On Raftery's Hill is not documentary realism. What I like about it is that it doesn't fall into the trap of thinking that by revealing or documenting something we can stop it. Ireland has been awash with revelations. But nothing really changes.\" </p> <p>On Raftery's Hill is at the Royal Court, London SW1 (020-7565 5000), till July 22.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's a warm morning, the sky is blue and the sun is blazing. But none of that matters to the group of artists gathered in a south Wales lay-by. They are going where the sun never shines, where all is dim and gloomy - and that's just how they like it. These are the members of the International Society for Spelaeological Art (ISSA). </p> <p>The day starts with a communal change by the side of a road. The group squeeze into wetsuits, wellies and helmets, while chatting of pencils and sketchbook carriers. Their destination is Bridge Cave in the Little Neath cave system. Getting into it involves wriggling through a muddy tunnel, over sharp rocks that shred unprotected knees, then squeezing through a boulder choke, where the ceiling has caved in, and wading through a fast-flowing, freezing underground stream. And this is one of the easier outings. I was only minutes into it when I began to think that Bridge was a cave too far. </p> <p>This is the way Ceris Jones feels every time she goes underground. At the beginning of the day she had sat in the cave entrance, on the verge of hyperventilation, before forcing herself through this tunnel, which narrows to just 18in in parts. Even so, Jones, an art teacher from Preston, is an active member of this group of underground artists. Her terror manifests itself in stark prints that depict nightmarish worlds of suffocatingly black, claustrophobic tunnels. </p> <p>\"These are the nasty things that I've been going through,\" she says later, gesturing at a painting of a caver wedged inside a tunnel. \"I never depict the cave environment, just the people, and I try to get a feeling of why they are doing it.\" </p> <p>Why they do it soon becomes apparent as we wade into Bridge Cave's magnificent chamber, and a dozen head-torches light up banks of stalactites, glinting quartzite crystals and a natural bridge spanning the breach. The group perch on rocks, pull out their pencils and sketchbooks and begin to work, capturing the half-lit scene, its shapes and shadows. Non-artist cavers are employed as models, or hurriedly sketched as they wade by. </p> <p>The ISSA was started six years ago by a group who were cavers first, artists second. Now they have members who are \"artists who cave\". Between them they produce everything from dramatic compositions in charcoal to watercolours, pastels and silk screens. </p> <p>For Ian Chandler, a retired lecturer from Bristol, caving is about more than visual interpretation. A poet and sculptor, he records the sounds of the caves - the dripping of water and the scrape of boots on tunnel walls - to accompany his poetry readings. On the surface he works in reclaimed metals, hammering steel and water-stained copper piping to produce evocative images of sumps and rifts, sculptures you have to look inside - just like the caves themselves. </p> <p>Given artists' usual preoccupation with the quality and quantity of light, isn't the lack of it inside the caves frustrating? Jenny Keal, a professional artist from Builth Wells in Wales, explains that this very absence of light makes all the struggle and discomfort worthwhile. \"Cave painting is to do with light because you have only a small amount of light focused on what you're interested in. If you're a landscape painter, you see far too much outside. That's the hardest part of landscape painting - not being able to see it all. Whereas here it's easy because you can only see a little bit at a time.\" </p> <p>\"When I first came into caves to paint it was all about formations,\" says her partner, David Bellamy, who works in watercolours and pastels, and also leads painting expeditions to mountain regions. \"But then you suddenly realise it's more about caving itself. I like sketching the figure, like Jenny coming through a rift high up, about 60ft above, when all that's holding her up is the pressure of her limbs against the walls. I'll do a quick sketch and say, 'Can you hold it a second?' You should see the look on her face, but the dynamism in the body is just amazing. It's like a very dynamic life class.\" </p> <p>\"A lot of it's the lack of sky, as well,\" says Robin Gray, an art teacher who hails from Cheddar in Somerset. \"You're within a total landscape. Rather than sitting on top of, or in, the landscape, you're actually inside it - and it's wonderful. There's a colour that very few people need very much of on the surface, and that's black. Down here there's a lot of black.\" </p> <p>And a lot to discover, as Ian Chandler, who has caved for more than 40 years, points out: \"Caves are really one of the last unexplored places on earth, one of the places that still can't be seen by satellite and where you can go and know no one has been before.\" </p> <p>But they do have their down side. Drop your sketchbook, as Chandler did, and it will be swept away. Two years of work was lost in Bridge Cave that day, which is a shame because, as he says in his poem, Matienzo: 25 Years: \"It's not being there that's important/ It's draughting an image/ Of breezy funnels/ For others to sniff.\"</p> <p>The ISSA can be reached through Robin Gray on 01934 744957.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's a warm morning, the sky is blue and the sun is blazing. But none of that matters to the group of artists gathered in a south Wales lay-by. They are going where the sun never shines, where all is dim and gloomy - and that's just how they like it. These are the members of the International Society for Spelaeological Art (ISSA). The day starts with a communal change by the side of a road. The group squeeze into wetsuits, wellies and helmets, while chatting of pencils and sketchbook carriers. Their destination is Bridge Cave in the Little Neath cave system. Getting into it involves wriggling through a muddy tunnel, over sharp rocks that shred unprotected knees, then squeezing through a boulder choke, where the ceiling has caved in, and wading through a fast-flowing, freezing underground stream. And this is one of the easier outings. I was only minutes into it when I began to think that Bridge was a cave too far. This is the way Ceris Jones feels every time she goes underground. At the beginning of the day she had sat in the cave entrance, on the verge of hyperventilation, before forcing herself through this tunnel, which narrows to just 18in in parts. Even so, Jones, an art teacher from Preston, is an active member of this group of underground artists. Her terror manifests itself in stark prints that depict nightmarish worlds of suffocatingly black, claustrophobic tunnels. \"These are the nasty things that I've been going through,\" she says later, gesturing at a painting of a caver wedged inside a tunnel. \"I never depict the cave environment, just the people, and I try to get a feeling of why they are doing it.\" Why they do it soon becomes apparent as we wade into Bridge Cave's magnificent chamber, and a dozen head-torches light up banks of stalactites, glinting quartzite crystals and a natural bridge spanning the breach. The group perch on rocks, pull out their pencils and sketchbooks and begin to work, capturing the half-lit scene, its shapes and shadows. Non-artist cavers are employed as models, or hurriedly sketched as they wade by. The ISSA was started six years ago by a group who were cavers first, artists second. Now they have members who are \"artists who cave\". Between them they produce everything from dramatic compositions in charcoal to watercolours, pastels and silk screens. For Ian Chandler, a retired lecturer from Bristol, caving is about more than visual interpretation. A poet and sculptor, he records the sounds of the caves - the dripping of water and the scrape of boots on tunnel walls - to accompany his poetry readings. On the surface he works in reclaimed metals, hammering steel and water-stained copper piping to produce evocative images of sumps and rifts, sculptures you have to look inside - just like the caves themselves. Given artists' usual preoccupation with the quality and quantity of light, isn't the lack of it inside the caves frustrating? Jenny Keal, a professional artist from Builth Wells in Wales, explains that this very absence of light makes all the struggle and discomfort worthwhile. \"Cave painting is to do with light because you have only a small amount of light focused on what you're interested in. If you're a landscape painter, you see far too much outside. That's the hardest part of landscape painting - not being able to see it all. Whereas here it's easy because you can only see a little bit at a time.\" \"When I first came into caves to paint it was all about formations,\" says her partner, David Bellamy, who works in watercolours and pastels, and also leads painting expeditions to mountain regions. \"But then you suddenly realise it's more about caving itself. I like sketching the figure, like Jenny coming through a rift high up, about 60ft above, when all that's holding her up is the pressure of her limbs against the walls. I'll do a quick sketch and say, 'Can you hold it a second?' You should see the look on her face, but the dynamism in the body is just amazing. It's like a very dynamic life class.\" \"A lot of it's the lack of sky, as well,\" says Robin Gray, an art teacher who hails from Cheddar in Somerset. \"You're within a total landscape. Rather than sitting on top of, or in, the landscape, you're actually inside it - and it's wonderful. There's a colour that very few people need very much of on the surface, and that's black. Down here there's a lot of black.\" And a lot to discover, as Ian Chandler, who has caved for more than 40 years, points out: \"Caves are really one of the last unexplored places on earth, one of the places that still can't be seen by satellite and where you can go and know no one has been before.\" But they do have their down side. Drop your sketchbook, as Chandler did, and it will be swept away. Two years of work was lost in Bridge Cave that day, which is a shame because, as he says in his poem, Matienzo: 25 Years: \"It's not being there that's important/ It's draughting an image/ Of breezy funnels/ For others to sniff.\" The ISSA can be reached through Robin Gray on 01934 744957.",

It all kept you nicely nervous for 90 minutes and there were some particularly fine seaside shots with breakers coming in like killer whales. Abbie? Oh, she was an impostor, of course. Dalziel's bullet-riddled gut reaction was right from the start. There is something right about these old dinosaurs. Not correct, right . Witness (Channel 4), a documentary about the death of pets, was saddest at the end, which seems appropriate. A man was talking about the death of his dog. His distressed words fell over each other. \"She'd got all these cancers all the way round here. Took her to the vet, hoping for miracle. You take her down, you know? And they were very good. And they said it would be a shame to keep her going the state she was in. And it came as a bit of a shock but we lost her there and then.\" There was more to this than a dog. The waiflike wife, holding his hand, was dying of cancer too. He said \"Shall we take a stroll?\"and they walked round the pet cemetery perfectly in step, like a couple who had kept pace with each other for a long time. Pet Heaven was full of rather endearing eccentrics. It was also informative. The cremation of dead pets, who are treated as clinical waste, was a revelation. Machinery screamed, bin bags melted, stiff little legs emerged. Nigel, who collects 6,000 pets a week from veterinary practices, said \"I've got two dogs at home. They won't go as mass cremation.\" Terri, whose husband runs a pet cemetery as personal as a corner shop, has an even better idea. \"My dogs are not going to die. It's not allowed and that's the end of it.\" \"What's odd about me? Name one odd thing about me.\" Ron \"The Rug\" Dixon in Brookside (C4). Scriptwriters can be very cruel.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Paul Smith is a very British fashion designer. Seemingly genuinely embarrassed by all the fuss over his recently awarded knighthood, he waves away my congratulations. \"Ooh, yes! Aren't I posh?\" While the elegant young people working on the Covent Garden shopfloor downstairs have the faint haughtiness perfected by staff in such stores, upstairs in his chaotic attic workroom the boss appears devoid of airs and graces. The message is clear: I may be Britain's most successful designer and head of a multi-million pound fashion empire but I'm just a regular bloke.</p> <p>A regular bloke, that is, sporting a rather dapper, brightly coloured striped shirt in the finest cotton, with the whitest of white T-shirts showing at the collar. He is tall at 6ft 4in, but well-dressed enough to look elegant rather than lanky. His accent is Midlands-soft, but he talks as fast as any Cockney; even sitting still, he moves around constantly, balancing on the back legs of his chair like a child, raking his hands through his unruly salt-and-pepper hair.</p> <p>He heard about the knighthood in the office, when his assistant, Colette, was opening the post, he explains. \"She was going through the gas bills and so on, and suddenly she said, 'I think you'd better take a look at this one. It's from Downing St.' It was weird because I'm sure there's lots of other people out there who deserve them, so I feel very humbled by it. But really, I have worked hard and it is quite nice ... and my mum and dad aren't around anymore but they'd have been dead pleased.\"</p> <p>He may have successful stores from Taipei to New York - there are over 200 in Japan alone - but describing a talk he gave at a recent textile event in Italy, Smith exclaims \"there was the boss of Gucci, the boss of Prada, the boss of Louis Vuitton, and little old Paul Smith from England!\"</p> <p>How British: to spend 30 years building a business with an annual turnover of \u00a3177m, and then be surprised that anyone has noticed.</p> <p>Paul Smith, now by some distance Britain's most financially successful fashion designer, was born in Nottingham in 1946, the son of a draper. As a teenager he was a passionate cyclist, covering up to 300 miles a week until an accident at 17 landed him with a broken femur and put an end to his racing ambitions. At a loose end, he began hanging around a local pub, which happened to be frequented by students from the local art school. \"I met fashion designers, architects, photographers, artists ... this whole world opened up to me.\"</p> <p>It was at the Bell that he met Pauline Denyer, his partner ever since, a fashion design graduate of the Royal College of Art who encouraged Smith, by now something of a dandy, to open a boutique. \"The first Paul Smith collections were actually designed by Pauline, not by me. Then slowly, through working with her, and studying, I went on to design the clothes myself and she went back to art school and her original love of painting.\"</p> <p>In 1976, six years after the first Paul Smith boutique opened in Nottingham, Smith showed his first men's collection in Paris. The signature combination of first-class tailoring and witty detailing - \"classic with a twist\", as Smith terms it - was already there. The Covent Garden store, still his London headquarters, came three years later; childrenswear in 1991, womenswear in 1994; this summer sees the launch of Paul Smith fragrances for men and women. \"I don't actually have a lot of money stuck in a bank somewhere, but I've paid for my houses and I have a nice income,\" is how Smith puts it. Pauline owns \"a big part\" of the business, although she no longer takes an active design role.</p> <p>Smith has long been an outspoken critic of the British fashion industry. In 1992, he refused the British Designer of the Year award because he thought it was \"a bit self-congratulatory. I don't see the point of it. Most of the people who've won over the years have not had very substantial businesses. I wanted to say, we're great at ideas but can we please try to sort out the business side.\" He is now on a government taskforce which hopes \"to rethink how to make the most of the potential of the design industries, to encourage people to believe that design can create wealth. In Britain we have this goldmine of talent, but we don't understand how to harness ideas, promote and manufacture them.</p> <p>\"One of the things the industry suffers from in Britain is that a lot of the clothes are very extreme, and it's always the extreme clothes that get in the newspapers anyway because they make stronger pictures. So the perception of the public is that fashion is all very extreme, and the perception of young designers in college is that the way to be successful is to do something very extravagant and attention-seeking.\"</p> <p>Smith describes himself as not political, but responsible: \"I'm interested in issues and in doing things where I can help.\"</p> <p>So what is his take on the recent \"superwaif summit\", and the evidence that images of extremely thin catwalk models might encourage anorexia? Smith wheels out the fashion industry's stock response. \"I hope it's not true, but it could have an element of truth. It's hard to know what to do ... the fact is that, unfortunately, clothes do look better on the catwalk on slimmer girls.\"</p> <p>It is men upon whom Smith has had the greatest influence. \"The way men dressed changed in the early 80s and I sort of nudged them into it, I think. I helped persuade them that wearing a shirt that had some colour in it, or a tie that was a bit brighter, was fine - not feminine or attention-seeking.\" Which men in the public eye does he think dress well? There is a long pause. \"Very few,\" he offers sagely. Tony Blair? \"He looks fine. He wears some of our suits, actually. But the difference between politicians here and politicians in France and Italy is that on the continent they wear bespoke suits, so that they really fit.\"</p> <p>The secret of his success, Smith says, has been an ability to marry design and business. \"Hopefully, I'm similar to Tom [Ford, head designer at Gucci] in this way - he has that balance, in that he has a design talent and also understands the business.\"</p> <p>It is still designing that he loves best. \"I'm really hanging on to that, because what happens to a lot of people is that they become a businessman, a front man. I work hard at staying involved in every stage of the design process. I can still recognise my clothes when I see people wearing them in the street because I choose all the fabrics, all the colours.\"</p> <p>Attitude is important too. \"I'm a positivist. I'm a nice bloke - no, it sounds big headed to say that, doesn't it? But I love life and I've got an open mind.\"</p> <p>He still feels strong ties with Nottingham. One of the nice things about the knighthood, he says, apart from all the \"smashing\" letters (including one from Cherie Blair, who \"said she was delighted to see my name on the list and that it was very well deserved\") was the pleasure and pride it brought the pattern-cutters and box-packers at his Nottingham business. He doesn't bother wooing celebrity clients (he has plenty, anyway) but one of the few people he has given free clothes too (along with David Bowie, \"because he's quite a good friend\") is the actress Samantha Morton, \"because she's from Nottingham, and she was up for an Oscar and I was proud of her\".</p> <p>There is an endearing absence of suaveness about Smith. Standing behind my chair to take a call, he starts absent-mindedly rubbing my shoulders. A few minutes later, back in his chair, he breaks off mid-sentence and exclaims, \"Oh! I've just realised, I was stroking your neck! I'm sorry. I sometimes do that to the girls in the office, give them a little massage. Sorry, sorry, sorry.\"</p> <p>It is impossible to imagine the impeccably slick Tom Ford forgetting himself like that; there's something charming about Smith's guileless inability to stay in media-mode.</p> <p>It is Smith's birthday on Wednesday: \"Yup, 21\" (54, in fact). He'll be in Paris, dealing with the aftermath of his men's catwalk show the previous day so he won't have much time to celebrate, but \"we're going on holiday the week after. We're off for a month.\" Where to? \"Italy. We've, er, we've got a house there.\"</p> <p>Whereabouts? \"Well . . . we've got two actually. One in Tuscany, one in Sardinia. We'll spend two weeks in each. Oh, dear, sorry. That sounds like showing off, doesn't it?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Full name: F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association. Age: 96. Status: Governing body of football. Number of members: 202 (more than the UN). Size of executive committee: 24, including representatives from footballing hotbeds Botswana, Malta and New Zealand. Why has it got a French name? I thought we invented football. We did and the intention was to give the UK a leading role. But we failed to show up for the inaugural meeting in Paris. We also refused to play in the first World Cup, held in Uruguay in 1930. We eventually saw the light in 1946. Oh well, we're true believers in the global game now. Indeed. So much so that we've just spent \u00a310m trying to convince Fifa that England should host the 2006 World Cup. Will we get it? Don't be silly. Fifa would rather stage it on Mars than give it to England, as we'll discover when the committee announces its decision in Zurich on Thursday. It's a swiss: I think you mean a swizz. Why does Fifa hate England? Our 40-year sulk didn't help. But it's really all to do with neo-colonialism: read your Stuart Hall. The It's A Knockout presenter and Man City fan? Almost certainly not. Where did we go wrong? In about 1974, when Sir Stanley Rous was ousted as president of Fifa by the Brazilian Joao Havelange in a dastardly coup by third world ingrates against a fine old English gentleman/long-overdue democratic revolt against European domination (delete according to preferred Stuart Hall). So who will get it? South Africa, in line with the wishes of Havelange's successor, Sepp Blatter, who wants to develop the game in Africa. Admirable. Surely even backers of the English bid will accept that. \"It's a blatant piece of political chicanery\" (Tony Banks). Where do we go from here? Johannesburg. Do say: \"All we asked for was a level playing field.\" Don't say: \"Who is Stuart Hall?\"",

It's not pleasant, but it has to be done. In this sense, breaking up is hard to do in the same way that writing thank you letters is hard to do.</p> <p>Breaking up is, of course, much harder to do if you are the person getting dumped. Getting dumped isn't really breaking up; it's being told to piss off.

      "bodyText": "When we say, as Neil Sedaka once said over and over again, that breaking up is hard to do, we are usually thinking about the loathsome chore of dumping a boyfriend or girlfriend, the guilt that comes of having to break someone's heart, and the guilt that comes of not feeling that guilty after all. It's not pleasant, but it has to be done. In this sense, breaking up is hard to do in the same way that writing thank you letters is hard to do. Breaking up is, of course, much harder to do if you are the person getting dumped. Getting dumped isn't really breaking up; it's being told to piss off.

Another less successful survey taught a significant lesson. He was asked to forecast how much people would spend on gambling if controls were lifted: one of his assistants came up with \u00a310 per week per family, when average weekly family income was about \u00a312. Wilkins was sceptical. His inquiry revealed that an assistant, told to interview people at random, had worked the platform at Liverpool Street station which served Newmarket and its racecourse.</p> <p>Under the 1948 Criminal Justice Act, the Home Secretary could make criminological research grants. The first went to Wilkins and Herman Mannheim, at the London School of Economics, to predict the recidivism rate of Borstal boys. Their book, Prediction Methods In Relation To Borstal Training, is a classic tool of criminological analysis. Today's risk assessments in probation and parole are its direct result.</p> <p>In the early 60s, Wilkins, then deputy director of the Home Office research unit, resigned. His ideas about crime and its causes had not met with much favour, while his advice that the criminalisation of drug use would feed the black market and the power of organised crime had been officially rejected. He worked for the UN Institute in Tokyo and then emigrated to the School of Criminology at Berkeley, California, before moving to the University of Albany in 1969. He developed the Federal Parole Board's decision guidelines and, more controversially, federal sentencing guidelines. These became the basis for sentencing guidelines in many states.</p> <p>Wilkins kept returning to his wartime experience . In his book Social Deviance (1964), he applied his operational research approach to criminality. Before Wilkins, the tradition was to look for the reason individuals committed crimes. Wilkins pointed out that that approach did not explain why a crime takes place. He saw both the genesis of crime and the workings of criminal justice as - to use a Wilkins word - an analogue of a complex operating system. If you wanted to stop crime you must understand the system and intervene where most effective. His work on time series, deviance amplification and decision theory has been nearly as influential as his work on risk and process.</p> <p>Leslie Wilkins was a great teacher and mentor to those who studied under him. He is survived by his wife Barbara, two sons and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Leslie Wilkins, statistician and criminologist, born March 8 1915; died May 8 2000</p>",

Under the 1948 Criminal Justice Act, the Home Secretary could make criminological research grants. The first went to Wilkins and Herman Mannheim, at the London School of Economics, to predict the recidivism rate of Borstal boys. Their book, Prediction Methods In Relation To Borstal Training, is a classic tool of criminological analysis. Today's risk assessments in probation and parole are its direct result. In the early 60s, Wilkins, then deputy director of the Home Office research unit, resigned. His ideas about crime and its causes had not met with much favour, while his advice that the criminalisation of drug use would feed the black market and the power of organised crime had been officially rejected. He worked for the UN Institute in Tokyo and then emigrated to the School of Criminology at Berkeley, California, before moving to the University of Albany in 1969. He developed the Federal Parole Board's decision guidelines and, more controversially, federal sentencing guidelines. These became the basis for sentencing guidelines in many states. Wilkins kept returning to his wartime experience . In his book Social Deviance (1964), he applied his operational research approach to criminality. Before Wilkins, the tradition was to look for the reason individuals committed crimes. Wilkins pointed out that that approach did not explain why a crime takes place. He saw both the genesis of crime and the workings of criminal justice as - to use a Wilkins word - an analogue of a complex operating system. If you wanted to stop crime you must understand the system and intervene where most effective. His work on time series, deviance amplification and decision theory has been nearly as influential as his work on risk and process. Leslie Wilkins was a great teacher and mentor to those who studied under him. He is survived by his wife Barbara, two sons and two daughters. \u0095 Leslie Wilkins, statistician and criminologist, born March 8 1915; died May 8 2000",

      "bodyText": "Mongolia went to the polls yesterday in an election that has been strong on democracy but weak on solutions for the country's devastated economy. Nomadic herdsmen, many of whom lost most of their livestock in this year's severe winter, travelled many miles to cast their ballots. The Democratic Union coalition, weakened by infighting and economic paralysis, was strongly challenged by the former communist Mongolian People's Revolutionary party (MPRP). The MPRP's popular leader, Nambariin Enkhbayar, denounced the government for \"serving not the people of Mongolia but small groups of business people and politicians\". In 1998 the coalition was disrupted by controversies leading to three changes of administration and prime minister. Mr Enkhbayar, 42, says he is an admirer of Britain's New Labour and has promised more jobs, free education and higher public service wages. His eve-of-poll rally in Ulan Bator featured rock stars dressed in Genghis Khan warrior outfits. They paraded on horseback on a large stage in the Soviet-style former party headquarters. The MPRP added glamour by enlisting the help of the Spice Girls of the steppes - an all-girl band called Lipstick. The group signed an exclusive contract to play at MPRP rallies, where they sang and danced with Mr Enkhbayar. But Ganaa, Gerlee, Degi and Ichko said they would not vote for the new-look Communist party, which ruled Mongolia for 75 years until it was swept from power by the democratic coalition in a 1996 election. \"Democracy has given us a lot,\" said Gerlee, 21. \"It has given us the chance to sing and dance the way we want to.\" Mongolians have taken to democracy enthusiastically: in the 1996 election the turnout was 90%. There are twice as many candidates and parties for the current election to the parliament, the Great Hural. Most of the economy has been privatised, apart from such big state-owned companies as a copper mine and the national airline. Ulan Bator is a lively capital thriving on an extensive black economy. The winter of extreme frost and snowstorms known as the Zud, which devastated livestock, pushed up inflation, to an annual rate of 14.2% by the end of April. The price of meat has risen by 36% in the past quarter and has doubled since the beginning of 1999. Mongolia has lost nearly 10% of its animals since the beginning of the year and the number of newborn livestock has fallen by one million. More deaths are expected in the malnourished herds, because the grasslands have been denuded by overgrazing since the end of collective farming. Many nomad communities were chronically under-nourished even before the Zud. A 1997 survey showed that more than one in five children under five was seriously under-nourished, and more than a third showed clinical symptoms of rickets. Mongolia has moved from ultra-Stalinism during the long decades in the Soviet camp to an assertive democracy which nourishes national pride more successfully than it feeds the population. Progress towards strengthening democracy has been assisted by several projects for legal and institutional reform sponsored by the UN commission for human rights. The high commissioner, Mary Robinson, is expected to visit next month, when Ulan Bator hosts a regional meeting on human rights in north-east Asia. She can expect a much warmer reception than she received in neighbouring China last year.",
