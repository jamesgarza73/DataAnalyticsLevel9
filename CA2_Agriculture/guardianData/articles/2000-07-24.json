Early yesterday the exchange, which is battling to win support for its controversial plans to merge with its German rival, Deutsche B\u00f6rse, was valued at over \u00a3800m. By the end of the first day of trading - which does not take place on the stock exchange itself but through the offices of investment bank Cazenove - the valuation had fallen back to closer to \u00a3600m. Just under 300,000 shares were traded, which City sources said was an indication that much of the activity came from the privately owned stockbroking firms who were allowing individual partners to sell their shares. Each of the 297 member firms of the stock exchange received 100,000 shares, which meant that the 296,381 traded yesterday represented a small portion of the 29.7m available to trade under the exchange's plans to demutualise and merge with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse to form the iX exchange. Angela Knight, the chief executive of Apcims, the trade body which represents private clients and stock brokers, said that the vast majority of smaller firms who have voiced opposition to the merger were \"hanging in there\". The selling, she said, was most likely by firms where partners were retiring, for instance, or where partners wanted to sell some holdings. The first day of trading in the stock exchange's shares coincided with a move byCRESTCo and the London Clearing House to reduce the behind the scenes costs associated with settle share transactions - a move which was intrepreted as aiming to grab a lead for London as competition intensifies between Europe's stock markets.

      "body": "<p>It had been a heck of a week and it wasn't over yet. Alec Stewart's successive centuries for England at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge had not so much tired the veteran as stimulated his restlessness, and now, on the eve of the final, he lay fretful in his hotel bed unable to sleep. </p> <p>He found even a new cricket book co-authored by his captain Nasser Hussain induced no shuteye, so spent the darkest hours propped up on his pillow watching the live satellite transmission of the New Zealand v South Africa rugby match from Christchurch. </p> <p>\"And I bet you scored four tries in that an' all,\" his thankful captain was to chide matily next day when Stewart displayed no semblance of bleariness with a match-winning innings as rosy-ripe and full blown as the high summer's day itself. Simply, the 37-year old turned this final into an exhibition match after the England bowlers had strangled Zimbabwe and, to all intents, the game itself with another mercilessly spot-on morning show. </p> <p>Already, only the Monday morning after, this tournament seems no more than a diversionary mirage. Like the Giant's Causeway, or the Boat Race or the Dome, I suppose it was worth seeing, if not actually going to see - except for the colour, warmth and inspiration of Stewart's batsmanship at the head of England's parade. Lord's, as clean cut and tidy trim as Stewart himself, dozed benignly in the sunshine as the 37-year-old went about his afternoon work, each little passage prefaced with his unceasing and compulsive Ranji-like twirl of the bat and a readjustment, just so, of his shirt collar. When he runs he carries his bat lovingly and two-handed, as if it was precious to him. As, to be sure, it is. </p> <p>The ancient rose-red pavilion, indeed the full-up Saturday swirl of the whole arena, stood to acclaim Stewart's glistening gem. On 97 and the game well won, his eyes had popped out on stalks at gallant Heath Streak's offside long-hop and, astonished, he edged it into the gauntlets behind him. He could have clocked it anywhere - and it would have taken him to a third successive hundred with three successive fours. </p> <p>Stewart is by far the nearest thing we have to a modern-day Tom Graveney - a right-hander with the left-hand classically in charge of a light bat, which he can use almost like a wand. He played a series of front-foot pulls over midwicket on Saturday that were as pure Tom as they were theatrically dismissive. And all with the golfer's follow-through held, for that split-second, for the photographers. </p> <p>Alec, in a way, is a throwback - all his county and country partners play with bottom hands and heavy bats, not to say heavy hearts. Stewart has never, ever, done the latter. </p> <p>His batting this midsummer has been ripe glory to behold and his work behind the stumps remains exemplary too. He half-boasted on Saturday night about \"going out to celebrate\", but you knew that just meant a couple of cold Budweisers. He has already said pre-summer and pre-tour fitness will be the key to his game from now on, as well as a good \"plain-eater\" diet - \"I've never been a curry-shop bloke\". </p> <p>\"Sure, I can go on into my 40s,\" he says, \"But there's 30 Tests and 50 one-dayers until the next World Cup . . . let's concentrate now on the West Indies in August.\" </p> <p>Way back in the mid-70s, his father Micky introduced me to his son at the Oval. The boy, just in his teens, had long, flowing golden hair - \"because he wants to be a footballer like Rodney Marsh,\" said Micky, almost apologetically. Thank the Lord he went for cricket. </p> <p>Alec will play his 100th Test match in 10 days time - so will his mucker, rival and so different blood brother, Michael Atherton. It will be a famous dual centenary for sure.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It had been a heck of a week and it wasn't over yet. Alec Stewart's successive centuries for England at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge had not so much tired the veteran as stimulated his restlessness, and now, on the eve of the final, he lay fretful in his hotel bed unable to sleep. He found even a new cricket book co-authored by his captain Nasser Hussain induced no shuteye, so spent the darkest hours propped up on his pillow watching the live satellite transmission of the New Zealand v South Africa rugby match from Christchurch. \"And I bet you scored four tries in that an' all,\" his thankful captain was to chide matily next day when Stewart displayed no semblance of bleariness with a match-winning innings as rosy-ripe and full blown as the high summer's day itself. Simply, the 37-year old turned this final into an exhibition match after the England bowlers had strangled Zimbabwe and, to all intents, the game itself with another mercilessly spot-on morning show. Already, only the Monday morning after, this tournament seems no more than a diversionary mirage. Like the Giant's Causeway, or the Boat Race or the Dome, I suppose it was worth seeing, if not actually going to see - except for the colour, warmth and inspiration of Stewart's batsmanship at the head of England's parade. Lord's, as clean cut and tidy trim as Stewart himself, dozed benignly in the sunshine as the 37-year-old went about his afternoon work, each little passage prefaced with his unceasing and compulsive Ranji-like twirl of the bat and a readjustment, just so, of his shirt collar. When he runs he carries his bat lovingly and two-handed, as if it was precious to him. As, to be sure, it is. The ancient rose-red pavilion, indeed the full-up Saturday swirl of the whole arena, stood to acclaim Stewart's glistening gem. On 97 and the game well won, his eyes had popped out on stalks at gallant Heath Streak's offside long-hop and, astonished, he edged it into the gauntlets behind him. He could have clocked it anywhere - and it would have taken him to a third successive hundred with three successive fours. Stewart is by far the nearest thing we have to a modern-day Tom Graveney - a right-hander with the left-hand classically in charge of a light bat, which he can use almost like a wand. He played a series of front-foot pulls over midwicket on Saturday that were as pure Tom as they were theatrically dismissive. And all with the golfer's follow-through held, for that split-second, for the photographers. Alec, in a way, is a throwback - all his county and country partners play with bottom hands and heavy bats, not to say heavy hearts. Stewart has never, ever, done the latter. His batting this midsummer has been ripe glory to behold and his work behind the stumps remains exemplary too. He half-boasted on Saturday night about \"going out to celebrate\", but you knew that just meant a couple of cold Budweisers. He has already said pre-summer and pre-tour fitness will be the key to his game from now on, as well as a good \"plain-eater\" diet - \"I've never been a curry-shop bloke\". \"Sure, I can go on into my 40s,\" he says, \"But there's 30 Tests and 50 one-dayers until the next World Cup . . . let's concentrate now on the West Indies in August.\" Way back in the mid-70s, his father Micky introduced me to his son at the Oval. The boy, just in his teens, had long, flowing golden hair - \"because he wants to be a footballer like Rodney Marsh,\" said Micky, almost apologetically. Thank the Lord he went for cricket. Alec will play his 100th Test match in 10 days time - so will his mucker, rival and so different blood brother, Michael Atherton. It will be a famous dual centenary for sure.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Somerset</strong> moved to within two points of the fixtureless National League Division One leaders Worcestershire with a nail-biting victory over <strong>Yorkshire</strong> at Scarborough. </p> <p>In trouble at 74 for seven, they had Ian Blackwell to thank for their narrow win. He scored an unbeaten 50 to carry the visitors past Yorkshire's 141 with two wickets in hand. </p> <p><strong>Gloucestershire</strong>, also now two points behind the leaders, saw off <strong>Kent</strong> by five wickets at Cheltenham. Jack Russell and Mark Alleyne took them home with an unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 91 after Kent had set a target of 199. </p> <p>Division Two's big game at Guildford turned out to be a mismatch as the leaders, <strong>Surrey</strong>, eased to a 127-run win over <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>, who remain second despite their defeat. A second-wicket stand of 139 between Graham Thorpe (126 not out) and Ian Ward (51) proved decisive. </p> <p><strong> Sri Lanka</strong> crushed <strong>South Africa</strong> by an innings and 15 runs in 3 days of the first Test in Galle. It was South Africa's first ever loss to Sri Lanka and only their third innings defeat since returning to international cricket. </p> <p>Muthiah Muralitharan finished with match figures of 13 for 171, the best return against South Africa since Clarrie Grimmett took 14 for 199 for Australia at Adelaide in 1931-32. After their first innings 238, South Africa were all out for 269 in reply to Sri Lanka's 522. </p> <p>Indian tax inspectors today begin examining the contents of 60 safe deposit boxes seized in raids on the homes and offices of leading cricketers and cricket officials. The nationwide swoops were carried out to establish if anyone has amassed assets disproportionate to known sources of income.</p>",

In trouble at 74 for seven, they had Ian Blackwell to thank for their narrow win. He scored an unbeaten 50 to carry the visitors past Yorkshire's 141 with two wickets in hand. Gloucestershire, also now two points behind the leaders, saw off Kent by five wickets at Cheltenham. Jack Russell and Mark Alleyne took them home with an unbroken sixth-wicket partnership of 91 after Kent had set a target of 199. Division Two's big game at Guildford turned out to be a mismatch as the leaders, Surrey, eased to a 127-run win over Nottinghamshire, who remain second despite their defeat. A second-wicket stand of 139 between Graham Thorpe (126 not out) and Ian Ward (51) proved decisive. Sri Lanka crushed South Africa by an innings and 15 runs in 3 days of the first Test in Galle. It was South Africa's first ever loss to Sri Lanka and only their third innings defeat since returning to international cricket. Muthiah Muralitharan finished with match figures of 13 for 171, the best return against South Africa since Clarrie Grimmett took 14 for 199 for Australia at Adelaide in 1931-32. After their first innings 238, South Africa were all out for 269 in reply to Sri Lanka's 522. Indian tax inspectors today begin examining the contents of 60 safe deposit boxes seized in raids on the homes and offices of leading cricketers and cricket officials. The nationwide swoops were carried out to establish if anyone has amassed assets disproportionate to known sources of income.",

      "body": "<p>Some people think there is madness in the Method. But Eli Wallach - a superbly versatile character actor and a founding member of the New York Actors' Studio - has spent a lifetime proving you can apply the systematic realism of the Method to movie-acting. </p> <p>If he is still, at 84, recognised by cab drivers wherever he goes, it is because his mean heavies in films like The Magnificent Seven and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly had a veracity you don't expect to find in stereotype Western villains. </p> <p>Wallach is in London, on his way back from shooting a new movie in Prague, to take in a few shows, in particular Lucy Bailey's fine production of Baby Doll at the Albery - for it was in the heated, fury-raising film version of that Tennessee Williams play that Wallach made his screen debut back in 1956. He played the Sicilian, Silva Vaccaro, who aroused Carroll Baker's thumb- sucking heroine to a state of sexual excitement. He now looks back on the moral panic the film produced with amused wonder. </p> <p>\"I was shocked and surprised,\" he says. \"I thought the film was rather biblical, in that my character sought revenge on the heroine's husband for burning down his cotton-gin. Elia Kazan once asked me if I thought Silva seduced Baby Doll. I pondered it and later told him I might have wanted to but, as a Sicilian, I'd have led her to the point and not done it: part of my revenge would have been to establish the husband's complicity in the arson, but to leave him with an unsatisfied wife. </p> <p>\"People also made a lot of fuss about a scene in which I apparently stroke Carroll Baker's legs while she's on a swing. What they don't know is that we were shooting in Mississippi in late November and it was cold as hell. We were sucking on ice cubes and spitting them out when the director called 'Action' so you couldn't see our breath. And if my hand goes out of shot during the scene on the swing it was probably because I was warming it on the radiators at our feet.\" </p> <p>It's significant that Kazan cast Method actors such as Wallach and Karl Malden in the movie's lead roles: they even insisted they play scenes straight through without the familiar fragmentation of movie-making. But did Wallach have any problem working with Kazan who, after testifying to the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952, was seen as the quintessential informer? </p> <p>\"I was dismayed by what Kazan had done,\" says Wallach, \"and he knew that. At the same time I respected him as a director. Actors also have to live. Richard Dreyfuss was once asked if he'd make a film with Kazan. He said, 'Absolutely not,' and then paused before adding, 'unless it was a good role.' Kazan had the great gift, like many directors, of not directing too much. When I did The Misfits with John Huston, I found he directed by indirection. One day I had a drunk scene with Clark Gable and Huston told me about the drunkest he ever was: it was the previous day when he'd ridden a camel in a race against a horse. I told him he'd looked perfectly sober. And I realised what he was saying was you don't have to act drunk to make it real. In the same way Kazan would say, 'Did you seduce her?' and walk away leaving the actor's imagination to do the work.\" </p> <p>If Wallach's conversation is fuelled by famous-name anecdotes, it is largely because he has worked with everyone in the business over the past 50 years. But you feel the New York Actors' Studio and the Method (largely an attempt to bring the Stanislavsky system and its belief in emotional memory to the preparation for a role) lie at the heart of his beliefs. Wallach and his wife, Anne Jackson, were part of the core group of 25 who joined the Actors' Studio in 1947. And Wallach has actively proselytised for the Method: in 1958 he wrote a pugnacious article for the theatrical magazine, Encore, saying that it \"was, and is, in rebellion against posturing, singing orators and technically accomplished and emotionally empty actors\". </p> <p>It's a myth, Wallach argues, that the Method is only applicable to naturalistic drama and stunts an actor's versatility; and he cites, as his trump card, Marlon Brando: \"He's eccentric and odd but a brilliant actor. If you look at his movie work you find him as a Nazi in The Young Lions, an English fop in Mutiny on the Bounty, an ex-prizefighter in On the Waterfront, a Mexican revolutionary in Viva Zapata. He could do everything. </p> <p>'He also had a sense of danger. He and I were once doing an improvisation at the Actors' Studio in which I was an FBI man searching his apartment for drugs. I remember the door burst open and he cried out - and this was in the days before everyone swore - 'What the fuck are you doing?' I tried to explain that I'd been given the key by the janitor and had a licence to search, but it all ended with Marlon picking me up and throwing me bodily out of the room. I was criticised, in the post-scene discussion, for failing to carry out my intention of finding the drugs.

      "bodyText": "Some people think there is madness in the Method. But Eli Wallach - a superbly versatile character actor and a founding member of the New York Actors' Studio - has spent a lifetime proving you can apply the systematic realism of the Method to movie-acting. If he is still, at 84, recognised by cab drivers wherever he goes, it is because his mean heavies in films like The Magnificent Seven and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly had a veracity you don't expect to find in stereotype Western villains. Wallach is in London, on his way back from shooting a new movie in Prague, to take in a few shows, in particular Lucy Bailey's fine production of Baby Doll at the Albery - for it was in the heated, fury-raising film version of that Tennessee Williams play that Wallach made his screen debut back in 1956. He played the Sicilian, Silva Vaccaro, who aroused Carroll Baker's thumb- sucking heroine to a state of sexual excitement. He now looks back on the moral panic the film produced with amused wonder. \"I was shocked and surprised,\" he says. \"I thought the film was rather biblical, in that my character sought revenge on the heroine's husband for burning down his cotton-gin. Elia Kazan once asked me if I thought Silva seduced Baby Doll. I pondered it and later told him I might have wanted to but, as a Sicilian, I'd have led her to the point and not done it: part of my revenge would have been to establish the husband's complicity in the arson, but to leave him with an unsatisfied wife. \"People also made a lot of fuss about a scene in which I apparently stroke Carroll Baker's legs while she's on a swing. What they don't know is that we were shooting in Mississippi in late November and it was cold as hell. We were sucking on ice cubes and spitting them out when the director called 'Action' so you couldn't see our breath. And if my hand goes out of shot during the scene on the swing it was probably because I was warming it on the radiators at our feet.\" It's significant that Kazan cast Method actors such as Wallach and Karl Malden in the movie's lead roles: they even insisted they play scenes straight through without the familiar fragmentation of movie-making. But did Wallach have any problem working with Kazan who, after testifying to the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952, was seen as the quintessential informer? \"I was dismayed by what Kazan had done,\" says Wallach, \"and he knew that. At the same time I respected him as a director. Actors also have to live. Richard Dreyfuss was once asked if he'd make a film with Kazan. He said, 'Absolutely not,' and then paused before adding, 'unless it was a good role.' Kazan had the great gift, like many directors, of not directing too much. When I did The Misfits with John Huston, I found he directed by indirection. One day I had a drunk scene with Clark Gable and Huston told me about the drunkest he ever was: it was the previous day when he'd ridden a camel in a race against a horse. I told him he'd looked perfectly sober. And I realised what he was saying was you don't have to act drunk to make it real. In the same way Kazan would say, 'Did you seduce her?' and walk away leaving the actor's imagination to do the work.\" If Wallach's conversation is fuelled by famous-name anecdotes, it is largely because he has worked with everyone in the business over the past 50 years. But you feel the New York Actors' Studio and the Method (largely an attempt to bring the Stanislavsky system and its belief in emotional memory to the preparation for a role) lie at the heart of his beliefs. Wallach and his wife, Anne Jackson, were part of the core group of 25 who joined the Actors' Studio in 1947. And Wallach has actively proselytised for the Method: in 1958 he wrote a pugnacious article for the theatrical magazine, Encore, saying that it \"was, and is, in rebellion against posturing, singing orators and technically accomplished and emotionally empty actors\". It's a myth, Wallach argues, that the Method is only applicable to naturalistic drama and stunts an actor's versatility; and he cites, as his trump card, Marlon Brando: \"He's eccentric and odd but a brilliant actor. If you look at his movie work you find him as a Nazi in The Young Lions, an English fop in Mutiny on the Bounty, an ex-prizefighter in On the Waterfront, a Mexican revolutionary in Viva Zapata. He could do everything. 'He also had a sense of danger. He and I were once doing an improvisation at the Actors' Studio in which I was an FBI man searching his apartment for drugs. I remember the door burst open and he cried out - and this was in the days before everyone swore - 'What the fuck are you doing?' I tried to explain that I'd been given the key by the janitor and had a licence to search, but it all ended with Marlon picking me up and throwing me bodily out of the room. I was criticised, in the post-scene discussion, for failing to carry out my intention of finding the drugs. But I was pretty helpless in the face of a human tornado like Brando.\" Though never a full member, Marilyn Monroe was a frequent observer at the Actors' Studio. Wallach remembers her doing a scene from Eugene O'Neill's Anna Christie with great beauty and telling him, rather sadly, that the people who laughed at her for wanting to play Grushenka in the film of Brothers Karamazov had probably never, unlike her, read the book. But what strikes one is how people who attended the Actors' Studio - such as Brando, Paul Newman, Kim Stanley and Wallach himself - applied its emotional reality to their work in Hollywood.

The marketing director has surprised everybody in the office by her rather vigorous negotiations with one of our creative agencies. \"I'm Lebanese,\" she tells us, \"I have to feel I have got value for money.\" Perhaps, surprisingly, it has not been a huge challenge to manage the diversity of cultural backgrounds in our small team. The team's international outlook coupled with their relaxed personalities means that we all get on. There is conflict, but it is the healthy kind that helps resolve issues. Rools has two new members joining the technical team on Monday, both of whom are British. Where you come from is not going to bother us, it is where you are going to that counts. \u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are co-founders of Rools.com, a service that lets teenagers buy securely online without a credit card",

This is a sensitive time because Hong Kong votes for a new legislative council on September 10. The election is widely seen as an opportunity for the public to give its verdict on how Tung Chee-hwa's government has performed since Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997. A close adviser to Mr Tung, who was picked as Hong Kong's chief executive by Beijing, has admitted approaching the vice-chancellor of the University of Hong Kong to discuss the activities of an academic pollster on the staff. The vice-chancellor, Cheng Yiu-chung, said this weekend that Mr Tung's special assistant, Andrew Lo, who requested the meeting, \"raised questions\" about polls conducted by Robert Chung, saying he believed that there was a conflict of interest because Dr Chung also wrote political commentaries. The incident has brought accusations of government interference in academic freedom. Most people in Hong Kong are well aware that no university on the mainland would be allowed to carry out a survey of public attitudes towards President Jiang Zemin. A researcher at another institution, Hong Kong's Chinese University, says that he too was approached by Mr Lo to discuss a survey on Mr Tung's popularity. Mr Lo is said to have made suggestions on how to improve the polls to \"make them more objective and scientific\". Last month the Chinese leadership delivered heavy hints that they would like Mr Tung to have a second term of office when his mandate expires in 2002. Mr Tung does not have to face the people's judgment in September: he is chosen at a later date by a special election committee for which most people cannot vote. But Hong Kongers are showing increasing impatience with his administration, and his popularity rating has fallen from 50% last year to 38%. Mr Lo, who has no qualifications in the field of public opinion polling, says he met Professor Cheng so that he could gain \"a fuller understanding of opinion polls in general\". Mr Tung's office has denied that he was acting on the chief executive's behalf. Critics of the government say it is resorting to the kind of indirect pressure habitually used to stifle dissent on the mainland, whose officials are expert in sending out signals of their bosses' displeasure.",

Boro have refused to comment on the offer, which may well mean that they are resigned to losing Ziege, despite previously insisting he would stay.

      "body": "<p>It is being seen as a fight between David and Goliath. Two French anti-racist groups, the Union of Jewish students and the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism have today got Yahoo!, one of the world's leading internet service providers, before a French judge. </p> <p>The issue is whether the California-based web portal is going to comply with a court judgment made two months ago in Paris, barring French internet users from access to a US site which auctions Nazi memorabilia. That a site selling bayonets, medals and even canisters purportedly used in the gas chambers, is offensive is beyond question in California and in France. </p> <p>The problem for international internet lawyers is that the auction site is legal in the US under the first amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, and illegal in France under a section of the penal code which prohibits the sale of goods inciting violence or racism. </p> <p>American case law is quite clear: The US supreme court ruled in May this year that internet service providers (ISPs) have full protection against libellous or abusive messages over the web.

      "bodyText": "It is being seen as a fight between David and Goliath. Two French anti-racist groups, the Union of Jewish students and the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism have today got Yahoo!, one of the world's leading internet service providers, before a French judge. The issue is whether the California-based web portal is going to comply with a court judgment made two months ago in Paris, barring French internet users from access to a US site which auctions Nazi memorabilia. That a site selling bayonets, medals and even canisters purportedly used in the gas chambers, is offensive is beyond question in California and in France. The problem for international internet lawyers is that the auction site is legal in the US under the first amendment, which guarantees freedom of speech, and illegal in France under a section of the penal code which prohibits the sale of goods inciting violence or racism. American case law is quite clear: The US supreme court ruled in May this year that internet service providers (ISPs) have full protection against libellous or abusive messages over the web. It upheld a ruling against former boy scout Alexander Lunney, who sued the ISP Prodigy after an imposter used his name to send threatening messages to his neighbours in Westchester county. This ruling, and the quashing of a conviction by a German court of a former head of CompuServe in Germany who had been given a suspended sentence for aiding the spread of child pornography, caused some relief to a worried dot.com industry about the international liability that it faced. The supreme court and the Bavarian ruling judged that an ISP was as responsible for the material it carried as a telecom company was for an abusive call. ISPs were carriers, not purveyors.

At the end of last month, as he was worrying over the results of his crucial first-year exams, the home secretary's son, Will Straw, found a letter in his pigeonhole at New College, Oxford. </p> <p>Intrigued by the Sunday Times-headed notepaper, he was amazed, and then shocked, by what he read in the five handwritten (and misspelled) pages, signed by one of the paper's reporters, Adam Nathan. </p> <p>It suggested that Will Straw had \"prepared\" a letter that was critical of chancellor Gordon Brown's controversial Laura Spence speech about Oxford's alleged elitism. He had been intending to send it to the Times, but his hand was stayed, Nathan alleged, because of \"very strong pressure\" from Tony Blair's press secretary, Alastair Campbell. </p> <p>Nathan then outlined three \"options\" for Straw to consider. First, he could \"speak to me freely\", but this was unlikely, as it might mean \"going back on your assurances\". </p> <p>Second, he could deny the letter's existence, but that wasn't a good idea \"as it would enteil [sic] lying\". Third, he could confirm he had written the letter with \"a simple 'yes' \", which, Nathan advised, \"is your most advisable course of action\". </p> <p>Straw says: \"Quite apart from every allegation being untrue, it was a most unpleasant and aggressive letter to receive. I couldn't believe what I was reading.\" This is understandable, since it was totally false. Straw immediately contacted Campbell, who fired off a fierce letter to Nathan, condemning him for putting the teenager under pressure and also suggesting that he had been defamed by Nathan. </p> <p>Yet Nathan is far from cowed by that criticism and can't see why there should be a fuss. \"I think it was a fair letter. On reflection, I suppose it could be said to have exerted a little bit of pressure on him, though it was far from threatening. </p> <p>\"I was just checking a story and he should have called me. Instead of choosing [from] my options, he went back through the Downing Street machine, which is ironic because, essentially, that was what my piece was about, news management.\" </p> <p>In other words, Nathan was using a 19-year-old student, who just happens to be the home secretary's son, to try to debunk the prime minister's press secretary. </p> <p>Should a politician's son be used as a pawn for a newspaper to make political capital? Do we really believe that the views of a home secretary's son - whether in favour of Brown or against him - are of such public interest that they merit this effort by a leading national newspaper? </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Straw took up his grievance with Downing Street. A couple of years ago, Will Straw suffered from a welter of publicity when a Mirror journalist induced him to buy drugs. No wonder he is wary of the press. </p> <p>I have to say that Nathan isn't generally regarded as a bad lad. His tutor at the London College of Printing, Chris Horrie, thought him \"one of the best reporters\" he had taught. But Nathan is far from experienced. After leaving college, he worked briefly in television, and his contract position at the Sunday Times is his first in newspaper journalism. He is full of energy and ideas and known for his determination. </p> <p>Doesn't this episode suggest that what he needs, apart from a sense of proportion, is guidance, training (and a dictionary)? It shows once again that the Sunday Times is too reliant on junior reporters who feel under pressure to come up with stories they believe fit the paper's political agenda. </p> <p>But Sunday Times managing editor Richard Caseby says: \"It's pretty bizarre to criticise the paper, or one of its reporters, for checking out a story which wasn't published.\" </p> <p>One last, baffling point: why did Nathan feel so confident about his story? In his letter to Straw he claimed that his source was \"a senior government official who dissaproved [sic] of Mr Campbell's actions.\" </p> <p>Yet he told me: \"I can't tell you exactly where I got it, but I can say that it came from personal contacts at a social occasion.\" The former must be untrue, because Straw hadn't written a letter, so there had not been any Campbell \"actions\".

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Even by the frenzied standards of current media consolidation, the National Magazine Company's dawn raid on Gruner and Jahr (G+J), which was snatched from under the nose of IPC, seems to create an odd marriage. </p> <p>NatMags, always second fiddle to Cond\u00e9 Nast in the silver spoon stakes, was busy positioning itself to fight a war for posh hearts and minds. G+J, a German company part-owned by media conglomerate Bertelsmann, launched in the UK in 1986, and has carved a niche in the lower-end \"tea-break\" market. Its top two titles, Prima and Best, are targeted primarily at women with children. </p> <p>Just weeks ago, NatMags announced plans to concentrate its more upmarket titles - Esquire, Harpers &amp; Queen and Country Living - in a dedicated business division and has been bullish in claiming it can now take on Cond\u00e9 Nast on its own terms. The G+J purchase - understood to have cost NatMags \u00a343m - seems particularly odd in the light of this development. One wag at IPC wondered whether NatMags \"would have the front to create a business unit called Downmarket Magazines\" to sit alongside its Affluent Magazines division. </p> <p>The jewel in G+J's crown is Prima, a broadly focused, popular magazine aimed at women aged 25 and over. Despite a 17.4% fall in sales in the last ABCs, Prima's cocktail of home help, true life stories and some general interest - notably an exclusive interview with Tony Blair - means it's still shifting 413,000 a month. NatMags also buys Best, which sells 462,000 a week, Your Home, parenting magazine Prima Baby and science and technology title Focus. Some 180 staff will transfer to NatMags. </p> <p>NatMags' deputy managing director, Duncan Edwards, shrugs off widespread surprise at the move. \"We have had talks with G+J in the past but they never really got beyond the conversation stage,\" he says. \"But G+J's decision to pull out of the UK market meant a business of some scale had become available. It also offers us, with Best, an opportunity to get into the women's weekly sector.\" </p> <p>For G+J, the UK market was always a sideline. Despite the fact that Prima and Best have had consistently high sales, the company still only held a market share of 3% and its UK managing director, Holger Wiemann, says it now wants to focus on the US. When it became clear that G+J was to pull out of the UK, IPC put out feelers. Though IPC has not commented officially, insiders say the company was chiefly attracted to G+J because of Prima and the need to consolidate its hold over the women's and home interest sectors. But after the deal with IPC was soured by a high-profile wrangle between G+J and Tesco over distribution, NatMags stepped in with a better offer that IPC was not prepared to match. </p> <p>Britain's largest supermarket is pushing magazine publishers to move from existing distribution networks into a single deal with WH Smith's wholesale department, and is alleged to have threatened to drop Prima Baby, Your Home and Focus if the publisher did not do as it was told. </p> <p>Tesco denies adopting such \"bully boy\" tactics. But corporate affairs manager, David Sawday, confirms that the supermarket has been pressuring magazine publishers to overhaul distribution relationships that, he claims, are based on a creaky infrastructure dating back more than 100 years. Tesco has warned certain publishers that, if they do not play ball, the chain will \"reassess the magazine brands we carry\". IPC - weighing up the value of G+J - felt that renegotiating a raft of distribution contracts with a disgruntled Tesco was more trouble than it was worth. </p> <p>NatMags' Edwards is unworried by the situation with Tesco, saying he's confident that their contract will be honoured. But many in the industry feel the retailer would not have been able to strong-arm a larger pub lishing house in the same way. The Periodical Publishers' Association is threatening to report Tesco to the office of fair trading, accusing the retailer of anti-competitive behaviour, and publishers are planning to go on the offensive. But the dispute shows the increasing power of the supermarkets in magazine marketing and sales, and highlights publishers' absolute need for size. </p> <p>NatMags says it is too early to give a clear strategic outline for the future of G+J. Edwards stresses that the company is \"in the business of building magazines, not closing them down\". But, he added, \"in each case we will look at the best practice\", and it is understood that some magazines will ultimately be closed. </p> <p>Prima and Best - both established, high circulation titles - are expected to survive, but pressure from advertisers will probably result in some strategic repositioning. And Prima Baby looks reasonably secure amid a boom in parenting titles. But insiders say the company (which already owns House Beautiful) is looking at the viability of another, less upmar ket home interest magazine in Your Home. It's hard to imagine how Focus will fit - either culturally or strategically - in the NatMags stable. More significantly, perhaps, Project Florence, G+J's long-awaited 30-plus women's launch, will also be fighting for space between NatMags' existing mature women's glossies Good Housekeeping and She. Staff on other newly launched titles, from the BBC's Eve to IPC's Nova, will be watching avidly. </p> <p>Journalists working at G+J seem to be hugely relieved to be going to NatMags, rather than IPC. Project Florence's editor Helena Jaworski-Lang would only say that staff on the magazine were \"absolutely thrilled to be joining National Magazines\". Other sources have described a \"col lective sigh of relief\" when the IPC talks stalled. There would have been considerable overlap between IPC and G+J, and many feared job losses. </p> <p>In economic terms, the deal is logical at a time when magazine houses are consolidating. The acquisition will make NatMags the third largest magazine publisher in the UK, with sales of 3,401,250 (ABC, July to December 1999). Paul Thomas, a senior partner at media buyer Mindshare, says: \"It makes sense. It's partly economies of scale - the more paper you buy, the better prices you get. It's also about digital assets, leveraging more brands into a digital medium, and it offers more of a one-stop shop for advertisers.\" </p> <p>The G+J women's brands acquired will be put onto NatMags' new women's site Women.com, but research shows that future growth will be at the older, glossier and more upmarket end of the market. Many in the industry are still trying to figure out how NatMags will cope with what Mindshare's Thomas describes as \"what looks like a bit of a knee-jerk, gut reaction purchase.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>No expense was spared to nail the suspect. Seven policemen raided his home at dawn to arrest him. After he was released on bail, pending trial, the police kept him under surveillance in an operation codenamed Guatemala. For two years, he was followed through London, into hotels and on the underground. His phone was bugged. His pager was cloned. A watch was put on his bank accounts. </p> <p>So what did this man do to merit a cloak-and-dagger operation estimated to have cost close to \u00a31m? Dealt in heroin? Planted a bomb? Hacked into Downing Street's main-frame computer? None of these. He had, wait for it, \"shared information\" with a policeman. </p> <p>Last week, in a judgment of stunning clarity and with far-reaching implications, Neville Thurlbeck, the News of the World's chief crime reporter, was finally cleared - in the most emphatic terms - of any wrongdoing. </p> <p>He and his alleged accomplice, Detective Constable Dick Farmer, stepped from the dock of Luton crown court after the judge halted a case which, frankly, had descended into farce. </p> <p>Thurlbeck and Farmer had been charged under the 1906 Corruption Act, facing up to three years in jail if found guilty. It was claimed that they had a corrupt relationship because Thurlbeck had paid Farmer for supplying him with confidential information. Both men vehemently denied this claim and the prosecution was unable to produce a jot of evidence to show that any money had changed hands between them. </p> <p>Both men have cheerfully admitted having a close friendship from which they mutually benefited, as the NoW did with various police forces. Sometimes Thurlbeck provided Farmer with information useful to the police. Sometimes Farmer, a member of the National Crime Intelligence Service (NCIS), gave Thurlbeck information he required. </p> <p>Crucially, the judge ruled that what Farmer told Thurlbeck was \"not confidential or sensitive... but information principally about criminals' previous convictions\". Mr Justice McKinnon considered their relationship to be \"perfectly legitimate and appropriate\", adding: \"There is no suggestion supported by any evidence that Mr Farmer in any way behaved improperly in conducting the Police National Computer checks.\" </p> <p>During the case, which could not be reported while it was in progress because of legal restrictions, the court was told that Farmer made scores of computer checks on people's criminal records for Thurlbeck. Prosecuting counsel Stephen Kramer QC cited 36 stories published by the News of the World which were said to have contained information supplied by Farmer. </p> <p>These included a case of an unnamed Labour MP with a conviction for committing an obscene act; an alleged threat to the Queen from stalkers; a priest previously convicted of sex offences; and a sex offender who raped a child shortly after being released from jail. </p> <p>But it wasn't one-way traffic. One instance cited by Thurlbeck concerns the case of a drug-dealer who he discovered had been supplying PCP, nicknamed angel dust. With his help police were able to arrest the man who was later sentenced to five years. </p> <p>Perhaps the turning point in the trial came when another News of the World story was mentioned in which Thurlbeck had received information from Farmer about a taxi driver who had previously been convicted of rape. The paper warned readers in its headline to beware of getting in his cab, and six months later the man was found guilty of murdering a passenger. </p> <p>When it was suggested to a police witness by Thurlbeck's counsel, Roy Amlot QC, that such a story must surely be in the public interest, he replied: \"No.\" There was an audible groan from the jury. </p> <p>As for the allegation of money changing hands, the prosecution depended on \"unexplained cash deposits\" to Farmer's wife's bank account in 1996. First, this pre-dated the allegations of the conspiracy and second, the police never attempted to discover why that money was paid in.

      "bodyText": "No expense was spared to nail the suspect. Seven policemen raided his home at dawn to arrest him. After he was released on bail, pending trial, the police kept him under surveillance in an operation codenamed Guatemala. For two years, he was followed through London, into hotels and on the underground. His phone was bugged. His pager was cloned. A watch was put on his bank accounts. So what did this man do to merit a cloak-and-dagger operation estimated to have cost close to \u00a31m? Dealt in heroin? Planted a bomb? Hacked into Downing Street's main-frame computer? None of these. He had, wait for it, \"shared information\" with a policeman. Last week, in a judgment of stunning clarity and with far-reaching implications, Neville Thurlbeck, the News of the World's chief crime reporter, was finally cleared - in the most emphatic terms - of any wrongdoing. He and his alleged accomplice, Detective Constable Dick Farmer, stepped from the dock of Luton crown court after the judge halted a case which, frankly, had descended into farce. Thurlbeck and Farmer had been charged under the 1906 Corruption Act, facing up to three years in jail if found guilty. It was claimed that they had a corrupt relationship because Thurlbeck had paid Farmer for supplying him with confidential information. Both men vehemently denied this claim and the prosecution was unable to produce a jot of evidence to show that any money had changed hands between them. Both men have cheerfully admitted having a close friendship from which they mutually benefited, as the NoW did with various police forces. Sometimes Thurlbeck provided Farmer with information useful to the police. Sometimes Farmer, a member of the National Crime Intelligence Service (NCIS), gave Thurlbeck information he required. Crucially, the judge ruled that what Farmer told Thurlbeck was \"not confidential or sensitive... but information principally about criminals' previous convictions\". Mr Justice McKinnon considered their relationship to be \"perfectly legitimate and appropriate\", adding: \"There is no suggestion supported by any evidence that Mr Farmer in any way behaved improperly in conducting the Police National Computer checks.\" During the case, which could not be reported while it was in progress because of legal restrictions, the court was told that Farmer made scores of computer checks on people's criminal records for Thurlbeck. Prosecuting counsel Stephen Kramer QC cited 36 stories published by the News of the World which were said to have contained information supplied by Farmer. These included a case of an unnamed Labour MP with a conviction for committing an obscene act; an alleged threat to the Queen from stalkers; a priest previously convicted of sex offences; and a sex offender who raped a child shortly after being released from jail. But it wasn't one-way traffic. One instance cited by Thurlbeck concerns the case of a drug-dealer who he discovered had been supplying PCP, nicknamed angel dust. With his help police were able to arrest the man who was later sentenced to five years. Perhaps the turning point in the trial came when another News of the World story was mentioned in which Thurlbeck had received information from Farmer about a taxi driver who had previously been convicted of rape. The paper warned readers in its headline to beware of getting in his cab, and six months later the man was found guilty of murdering a passenger. When it was suggested to a police witness by Thurlbeck's counsel, Roy Amlot QC, that such a story must surely be in the public interest, he replied: \"No.\" There was an audible groan from the jury. As for the allegation of money changing hands, the prosecution depended on \"unexplained cash deposits\" to Farmer's wife's bank account in 1996. First, this pre-dated the allegations of the conspiracy and second, the police never attempted to discover why that money was paid in. I understand that these relatively small sums were in fact earned by Mrs Farmer, a cookery teacher, while she was working occasionally as a pastry chef. With the police unable to show that any money had changed hands, the judge commented: \"I am entirely clear that there is no evidence whatever against Mr Thurlbeck that he made any payments to Mr Farmer.\" As Thurlbeck says: \"The only currency which flowed freely between Dick and myself was information.\" All in all, the outcome of the trial after a two-year wait, and with Farmer suspended on full pay throughout that time, has been a devastating indictment of the police's decision to prosecute. So what are we to make of this odd saga? Despite the waste of public money and the distress suffered by Thurlbeck and Farmer (whose future remains in doubt), the case isn't without its merits. First, the judgment that what police hold on their computers about people's convictions isn't confidential is an eye-opener. Like many journalists, I have become so imbued with the culture of secrecy in our society that I, too, presumed it was secret. Second, by highlighting the Farmer-Thurlbeck relationship, it illustrates the reality of police-press relationships. Too many people are willing to believe that there is always a money nexus. In fact, payments by reporters to policemen are incredibly rare. Third, the fact that police decided to arrest and charge the pair shows the level of hypocrisy that exists in many forces. In my view, the vast majority of the nation's most senior policemen, at chief constable level, wish to promote better relations with the press. On the ground, among the ranks, friendships between officers and reporters are common. Most of the hostility towards journalists arises from the middle ranks, among sergeants and inspectors who jealousy guard their information, hiding behind professional PRs who provide almost no information. When the front door is shut, it isn't surprising that enterprising reporters such as Thurlbeck will test whether the back door is locked. If they find a friendly face of welcome, especially if they are willing to offer help, so much the better. The sad truth is that many police forces, which have long had a history of refusing to disclose all sorts of matters that the public have a right to to know, are now hiding behind the data protection act to prevent even more information from getting into the public domain. In such circumstances, crime reporters who have always depended on forming personal relationships to get information are bound to redouble their efforts to beat official bans. What we need is clear guidance on what should and shouldn't be freely available, and then the machinery to ensure we get it. At the moment, the system forces hole-in-the-corner deals. As Phil Hall, the former News of the World editor who championed Thurlbeck's case, says: \"I feel that not only has Neville has been vindicated, but so has the cause of investigative journalism.\" Thurlbeck, 38, certainly hasn't suffered at his paper.

      "body": "<p>It was 10 minutes before lunch in the sweaty, airless Guardian office in the parliamentary press gallery when the telephone rang. \"Can you come over to my office? I have a piece of paper which I think you would find very interesting,\" said the caller. </p> <p>When I arrived, I was handed four sheets of photocopied paper headed \"Confidential Memorandum by the Comptroller and Auditor General\". The succinct Whitehall document became known as the \"Rover sweeteners\" - the disclosure that British Aerospace had been given \u00a338m hidden aid to take the ailing car company off the government's hands. The information had been withheld from the sale statement to parliament - and led, years later, to BAe being ordered by the European court to pay back the cash, with interest. </p> <p>The disclosure was expensive for ministers. It both exposed them as double-dealers and forced the return of taxpayers' cash. It also led to a ferocious inquiry into the leak - and the Guardian's then editor Peter Preston and I were dragged before the powerful Commons privileges and standards committee, for breaking parliament's rules. </p> <p>But the leaker was never unmasked. Now, 11 years later, the person has been promoted to higher things in Whitehall and Westminster. Fortunately for others, the person has never again (to my knowledge) leaked such damaging information. But like last week's highly damaging leaks of Tony Blair's and Philip Gould's memos on spin, the timing was impeccable. It came the day after parliament had published a critical national audit office report showing that Rover had been sold \"on the cheap\". The leaker looked at that morning's papers. \"I was going to give the document to the Independent but I saw the Guardian gave better coverage, so I contacted you,\" the person said. </p> <p>As a leaker, the person may not have been atypical but the motives were - nearly all really damaging leaks come because the person involved is angered by hypocrisy or by what they see as a serious \"cover up\". They are almost always looking for an outlet where the issue will be treated seriously - and only then are they prepared to take a risk that could wreck their career or public standing. </p> <p>Occasionally the leak could be motivated by more deadly sins, such as malice, envy, or (if money was involved) greed and sometimes sexual jealousy - but most of these types of story come from low-life lobby gossipmongers around parliament, not from highly placed sources. (One gay Tory MP was once shopped to the News of the World for having an affair with a young civil servant, simply because his less handsome partner was furious that the MP had taken his mate rather than him on a Caribbean holiday). </p> <p>The serious leakers fall into two categories. They are the \"once in the lifetime\" person and the \"serial leaker\". Occasionally an issue arises that leads a mole to become a personal contact of a journalist for a period, and then when the issue is resolved the source dries up. </p> <p>The atmosphere in Whitehall and parliament also either facilitates or deters leakers. When Whitehall was under fire from the Tories with the prospect of huge job losses, the number of leaks rose correspondingly. Indeed at one stage the threat of large-scale redundancies and privatisation of the property services agency led to almost systematic leaking of ministerial letters designed to embarrass junior ministers John Redwood and Christopher Chope, and undermine their positions. Correspondingly Tony Blair's first two years in office - and the end of threats to many Whitehall jobs - led to a decline in leakers from contented Whitehall mandarins. The trouble Blair is currently in almost certainly coincides with disillusionment in Whitehall at the lack of change. </p> <p>Once a journalist has a leaker, the two biggest issues are the protection of the source and ensuring the veracity of their information. In the first instance - the Rover sweeteners story - it was instantly clear that the document was genuine and, as the source was known to me, it was easy to establish whether the person would have had access to such information. </p> <p>Other leaks are not so easy to verify but, despite the popular myth, \"brown envelope\" journalism is rare. Information is hardly ever sent to people \"on spec\". Most of it is suggested by known sources, making it easier to check where it has come from and examine the motives behind the leak. </p> <p>Once the source can be trusted, protection is everything. Sources are not there to be used and abused, then discarded once the tale has gone cold. They have to be cherished. There also has to be discretion: venues for meetings have to be chosen and the information released. This doesn't mean that every meeting has to be a Watergate-style tryst in the local underground car park. But it does mean that there has to be some imagination: it's not too clever to meet Home Office moles in a pub opposite their Queen Anne's Gate office. Better to bump into someone while feeding the ducks in St James's Park, or meet at a working-class cafe or pub a long way from Westminster. Even a crowded railway station, where everyone is rushing to catch a train, can be a good cover for an illicit encounter. </p> <p>Even better is to have a network of moles: one of the most scary things for putative leakers is that they alone are the source and their career will collapse if they are found out. They feel much more confident if they are supplying only part of the picture. Then when they see the story, they can say truthfully that they have not leaked everything. It is amazing how much better that makes them feel, and how much more information they are then prepared to leak. The detail about the dubious lobbying tactics of the now defunct Ian Greer Associates came not from one person but some dozen people, many of them unknown to each other and of varying political views. It is rarely the work of one \"Mr Big\". </p> <p>What should also not be under-estimated is the \"excitement\" factor in the leaking process. Not everybody wants a bit-part in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel, but there is a certain thrill in finding out what is really happening in Whitehall and this can rub off from the journalist to the leaker. </p> <p>One of the Guardian's award-winning lead stories was leaked by a very senior person in the heart of government, who has been ennobled by Tony Blair. The only thing is that he does not know that he is the source of the Guardian story. All he did was talk to one of my top Whitehall contacts and give the person highly confidential information. The person involved needed to find out the information anyway but was so trusted by me that he moved from leaker to investigative reporter. The name of either party - or even which story it was - can never be revealed, or it would blow apart how to get into the centre of government without ever being detected.</p>",

Four months later, out of the blue, Cathy called and asked if I had any ideas for the supplement. </p> <p>I had no idea what career I wanted to follow at the time, but it wasn't journalism. Between the ages of 12 and 21 I had at various times wanted to be a doctor, a professional revolutionary and an interpreter. But I had never contemplated writing for a living, and Heriot-Watt University did not have a student newspaper worth talking about, so there was little opportunity to try it even if I had. </p> <p>On the phone to Cathy, I rattled off a series of pompous polemics. Judging by the long silence at the other end of the line, I decided I was incriminating myself, and promised to write down some ideas and send them. I heard nothing for a couple of months and presumed failure. Then came another unexpected call from Cathy, saying that she liked two of my ideas. </p> <p>She had chosen the only non- worthy suggestion I had made - a piece about the perils of flatsharing - and another about the first black female sabbatical in Scotland. It was the summer holidays and I worked on the articles all day, every day for a week. When I handed them in I was incredibly nervous and Cathy was incredibly supportive. She could have said nothing and either rewritten or spiked them. But she took me for a coffee and gently explained the difference between an essay and an article; how the most interesting stuff, rather than the most logical, should go at the top, that the style should be simple and the vocabulary accessible. She let me do the rewrites myself. \"The most important thing is that you can write,\" she said. \"The other stuff you can learn.\" </p> <p>On an hourly rate, I would have done better if I had taken a summer job at Burger King. But the thrill of seeing those two articles in print was priceless. </p> <p>Over the next couple of years, I kept learning by writing the occasional piece for the Scotsman and reading from a wider range of sources than I had previously done. I still didn't know what I wanted to do when I left university. Then I saw an advert in the Guardian for bursaries to study newspaper journalism at City University, which specifically urged ethnic minority students to apply. That encouraged me because I had always considered journalism a profession so dominated by white middle-class people - which it still is - that it would be virtually impossible to get into, which it wasn't. Even after the Tories had won the 1992 election and the Berlin wall had crumbled, working on a national paper still seemed a more remote possibility than being a revolutionary. </p> <p>I applied, got an interview and was awarded a bursary. There was no job attached, since its aim was, and still is, to improve diversity in the media in general. But this is where I ended up. Trying to be polemical without being pompous; worthy without being dull.</p> <p>\u0095 Gary Younge is one of the judges of the Guardian Student Media Awards.

Judging by the long silence at the other end of the line, I decided I was incriminating myself, and promised to write down some ideas and send them. I heard nothing for a couple of months and presumed failure. Then came another unexpected call from Cathy, saying that she liked two of my ideas. She had chosen the only non- worthy suggestion I had made - a piece about the perils of flatsharing - and another about the first black female sabbatical in Scotland. It was the summer holidays and I worked on the articles all day, every day for a week. When I handed them in I was incredibly nervous and Cathy was incredibly supportive. She could have said nothing and either rewritten or spiked them. But she took me for a coffee and gently explained the difference between an essay and an article; how the most interesting stuff, rather than the most logical, should go at the top, that the style should be simple and the vocabulary accessible. She let me do the rewrites myself. \"The most important thing is that you can write,\" she said. \"The other stuff you can learn.\" On an hourly rate, I would have done better if I had taken a summer job at Burger King. But the thrill of seeing those two articles in print was priceless. Over the next couple of years, I kept learning by writing the occasional piece for the Scotsman and reading from a wider range of sources than I had previously done. I still didn't know what I wanted to do when I left university. Then I saw an advert in the Guardian for bursaries to study newspaper journalism at City University, which specifically urged ethnic minority students to apply. That encouraged me because I had always considered journalism a profession so dominated by white middle-class people - which it still is - that it would be virtually impossible to get into, which it wasn't. Even after the Tories had won the 1992 election and the Berlin wall had crumbled, working on a national paper still seemed a more remote possibility than being a revolutionary. I applied, got an interview and was awarded a bursary. There was no job attached, since its aim was, and still is, to improve diversity in the media in general. But this is where I ended up. Trying to be polemical without being pompous; worthy without being dull. \u0095 Gary Younge is one of the judges of the Guardian Student Media Awards.

      "body": "<p>On May 4, as most of the country went to the polls to vote in the local council elections, something unique in community television history was taking place in Oxford. It was one of the most exciting local elections the city had witnessed. The Labour party was fast losing control of the city council for the first time in 20 years - and it was losing its leader, too. </p> <p>As the results poured in from wards across the city in the early hours of the morning, they were flashed live across the screens of those tuned to the Oxford Channel - a local television station which was carrying the news six hours ahead of BBC Radio Oxford and without the regional baggage carried by Newsroom South-East. Oxford's viewers had also been treated to a televised local-election question-time special, in which party leaders had fielded political salvoes from members of their own community. </p> <p>Mind-rot if you happen to hail from Southport, say, or Skegness; but riveting and relevant if you live and vote in Oxford. For the first time, local viewers were able to gain immediate live access to the political results and analysis that mattered most to them. It was public-service broadcasting at its best; a salad of local democracy, public accountability and viewer participation, tossed and transmitted to an enlightened electorate. It epitomised the raison d' tre of the restrictive service licence (RSL). </p> <p>Two weeks ago, the Oxford Channel sacked almost all of its 40 production and affiliated staff and gave them minutes to leave the premises. Stunned employees, many of whom had played a pivotal role in the channel's launch and development and had worked tirelessly to create a role for community television, looked on in disbelief as security codes were altered and locks on the doors were changed; many were in tears. Within 24 hours, normal transmission had ceased and a test card was aired, stating that alongside local output, a new schedule of lifestyle features, tele-shopping and international news was to be introduced, offering viewers \"a mix of quality programmes from around the world\". Viewers who tuned in the next morning hoping to catch up on the burning local issues were instead served a feast of cartoons. </p> <p>What had happened? Rewind a few days to a crisis board meeting convened by the directors of Oxford Broadcasting, who were pondering the company's financial position. In the 12 months since it had launched, the channel had failed to attract significant interest from local advertisers, sponsors or investors, despite the fact that one in four adults were tuning in at peak time on a weekly basis. Although the station had been run predominantly by unsalaried trainees, the company had accrued losses totalling \u00a3500,000; they had simply run out of money. With just 12 minutes to go before the receivers were to be officially called in, control was ceded to the Milestone Group, a private media concern with interests in radio and newspapers, but one that has not previously held any local television broadcasting licences. Within hours, the new managing director proudly introduced himself to his staff and promptly sacked them all. </p> <p>For outgoing managing director and former social justice campaigner Thomas Harding and his wife Deborah Cackler, it was the end of a bitter struggle to retain control of a very personal project, the details of which had first been scribbled on the back of an envelope. </p> <p>The channel had been beset by problems from the start. Just two days before the official launch, the key advertising partner pulled out of the project. The directors later ran into hot water with the National Union of Journalists, which had publicly expressed deep concern regarding trainees working 60-hour weeks without pay and the requirement that staff waive their right to claim for unfair dismissal. Also, poor picture reception due to uneven topography in parts of the county meant that some viewers couldn't view at all. </p> <p>Their problems weren't unique. TV12 on the Isle of Wight was the first RSL to begin broadcasting last June. Chairman Graham Benson, formerly controller of drama and arts at TVS, understands the complex dilemmas and cashflow problems experienced by Harding. </p> <p>\"It's an uphill struggle and you have to run on very, very low overheads indeed. You're competing with local newspapers and radio for advertising and until you've built up a head of steam, which sometimes takes three to four years, it is difficult to get the confidence of the smaller business people,\" he says. </p> <p>Benson hints that consolidation may be the only way to secure the future of the RSL community: \"I don't think that one station standing alone can survive. We've survived for quite a long time, we'll probably survive for a little bit longer, but our plans are to consolidate and try to acquire other stations and become a series of mini-networks which can do a certain amount of programme exchange. If that all happens then I think that there is a rosy future for local television.\" </p> <p>Concerns are also being expressed about the threat posed by the switch-off of the analogue signal and the frenzied dash to digital. At the moment there is no guarantee of a digital future for local television. </p> <p>\"Legislation must be introduced to provide sufficient dedicated spectrum throughout the entire UK, enabling a dense network of over 1,000 local digital TV stations to exist,\" says Geoff Bush, controller of Herts TV. In a recent submission to the Department of Culture consultation on the communications white paper, he stressed the opportunities that needed to be seized to ensure the successful continuation and development of the RSL network: \"Current RSL licences are too short-lived, over-restricted, and suffer from an unreasonably low position in the pecking order for the allocation of broadcast spectrum. The local television opportunity could be missed if appropriate policies are not put in place to ensure that the new television landscape ushered in by the act is not simply a digital replica of that created 50 years ago.\" </p> <p> Support has already come from the Independent Television Commission (ITC), which revealed that the RSLs can only survive if they are an integral part of the jigsaw puzzle that is the digital future. In its white paper contribution, the ITC declared that legislation will need to address \"the establishment of a digital successor to the analogue RSL system for local TV services\", and that \"switching off the analogue TV broadcasts will provide a unique opportunity to re-deploy the spectrum they vacate\". </p> <p>Assuming that the digital divide can be bridged, Milestone director Andy Craig maintains that local programming will still form the core of their output: \"The Oxford Channel is the real jewel in the crown of local television and it has a terrific future ... 'Localness' is at the top of our list.\" </p> <p>What future then for truly independent local television? One wonders how the growing trend for consolidation, imitating the national networks, can enable the RSL community to retain its most valuable asset - independence. Although it was originally built on principles of probity, it is clear that the restricted service needs to be de-restricted because, in an unpredictable age of digital media, RSLs may well become the last outpost of public service broadcasting. </p> <p>At a time when technology is moving people away from their communities, the need to bring them back home has never been stronger.</p>",

Earlier this month, Time Warner's book-publishing arm bought the north American rights for a book by Jack Welch. Interest in the revered head of the US conglomerate General Electric is such that four publishers fought over the contract, pushing the final amount to a record $7.1m (\u00a34.7m). Not even the Pope could top that. </p> <p>But the right to publish the words of the management wizard did not just go to the highest bidder. Welch, who is to hand over his share of the advance to charity, decided to stop the bidding at just over $7m. He then had further discussions with the salivating agents and finally chose Time Warner over HarperCollins, the book publisher owned by News Corp. </p> <p>Why? The obvious explanation, confirmed by insiders, was that Time Warner won because it was able to offer an unbeatable array of marketing opportunities. Publish with Time Warner and you not only gain access to some of America's most popular magazines but to AOL's 23m online subscribers. </p> <p>The publishing deal, a record-breaker even before worldwide rights are discussed, could be the first concrete example of the much-hyped synergies expected from the proposed merger. </p> <p>Opponents of the blockbuster deal, which has still to be agreed by US regulators, have jumped on this example of the overriding power of the combination. Just think, the merger of AOL and Time Warner makes News Corp look like the underdog, albeit in the tiny part of the media galaxy that is publishing. Rupert Murdoch's sprawling empire, which encompasses UK news-papers, Hollywood film studios and satellite television operations, does not have access to an internet business of any meaningful size. </p> <p>None of the huge media empires can compete with AOL's clout on the web, of course. The two other bidders in the race for the Welch book - Bertelsmann's Doubleday and Viacom's Simon &amp; Schuster - dropped out at $6.5m, but they too would not have been able to offer the same coverage. </p> <p>The deal poses the question of how the internet is going to be used by book publishers. The advantage of Time Warner's family of magazines is obvious. About 1.6m hardback copies of the book need to be sold to justify the record advance. A tie-in with business bible Fortune, general interest magazine Time or the popular People - all owned by Time Warner - will help to sell a book which the about-to-retire Welch insists will be more management manual than autobiography. </p> <p>Time Warner's publishing arm has not spelt out how it could use AOL. While much has been written about the impact of online distribution on the publishing world through websites such as Amazon.com, for example, less is known about the uses and advantages of online marketing. Advertising slots on the home page, or related chat room tie-ins? Industry insiders are keen to see whether the combined AOL-Time Warner will go beyond existing ideas. </p> <p>The issue also raises interesting competitive issues. How far can discounts for related parts of a multi-media empire go? Should Time Warner be able to pay half what its competitors have to for banner ads on AOL or a full-page in Fortune? </p> <p>These questions are likely to be discussed in Washington where the federal communications commission and the federal trade commission are considering the merger on both industry-specific and competitive grounds. </p> <p>Any discussion of competition and the new AOL-Time Warner will, of course, be seized on by Disney. The media and entertainment group, no stranger to aggressive business tactics, is urging Washington regulators to curb the power of the media alliance by actually splitting up parts of it.

      "body": "<p>There's a story about a marketing director who went to his advertising agency for a meeting. As he parked, he nosed his company Vauxhall into a space between two gleaming Aston Martins. Noticing that the rest of the car park was liberally dotted with yet more expensive motors, the marketing man's first comment to his agency that morning was: \"I think I'm paying you lot too much.\" </p> <p>The question of how much advertisers pay their agency has always been contentious. Ad agencies may be experts in creating beautiful and often very effective commercials, but they are also masters of the art of spending their clients' cash. Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO spent \u00a31m making the \"Surfer\" ad for Guinness, complete with computer-animated horses, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi famously draped an entire island in silk for the benefit of British Airways. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, clients who invest millions every year in advertising are increasingly keen to make sure they're getting their money's worth. Rising media costs - inflating at a rate of more than 10% per year - and the relative cost-effectiveness of rival media, such as the internet and direct marketing, are all putting clients under more pressure to justify their advertising expenditure. </p> <p>So there is a growing trend for companies to link agency pay to the effectiveness of their advertising. Roughly speaking, if the ads help to boost sales the agency gets more. If they don't there's a penalty. </p> <p>This harsh regime would have caused agency folk to choke on their champagne in the freewheeling 80s, when remuneration was generally linked to commission paid on media spending. Under this system, agen cies were paid a flat 15% of whatever they spent on media. They also slapped a 15% charge on to their production costs. So, the more extravagant the ads, the bigger the profit for the agency. This system didn't exactly encourage a penny-pinching culture in the streets of Soho. </p> <p>In the early 90s, some agencies tried to change things by charging clients a flat fee. This was fine, but critics argued that it didn't provide a sufficient incentive for the agency and made them feel like their services were being bought in the same way as you'd pay a plumber. Opponents of commission said it made ad agencies behave like estate agents. Each system was flawed. </p> <p>But now things are changing again. According to a new report by the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA), called Paying for Advertising, more and more companies are now paying agencies according to results. There has been a steady drift towards this system for three or so years now, but the report shows that payment by results (PBR) is fast becoming accepted practice. </p> <p>In its study of 16 of the UK's biggest advertisers - many of whom spend more than \u00a310m above-the-line per year - ISBA found that PBR now features in 34% of all agency remuneration agreements. Commission-based agreements are rapidly going out of fashion, only included in 22% of contracts, compared to 33% in 1997. Debbie Morrison, director of membership services at ISBA, says PBR is a healthier system for both client and agency. \"With commission, clients didn't know what they were buying - there was very little accountability. But PBR encourages the client and agency to have a more open dialogue and doesn't prejudice the agency towards using one type of media over another. If pay's linked to effectiveness, not media, the agency is more likely to use whatever channel gets the best results. That's better for everyone.\" </p> <p>However, the big problem with paying by results is establishing what measures to use. Procter &amp; Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, shocked adland last year when it announced it planned to link agency remuneration to global brand sales. </p> <p>As Gary Cunningham, director of public affairs and media at P&amp;G, says: \"However involved we become in the excitement of the advertising world, we need to remember that companies don't advertise for advertising's sake, no matter how great the creative work. Companies advertise to sell their products.\" </p> <p>This may sound logical but P&amp;G's is an extreme step, as even the most rigorously measured advertising is hard to link to products shifting off the shelves. You can track brand awareness and customer loyalty, but sales are a different story. </p> <p>James Best, group chairman of the ad agency BMP DDB, says: \"Brand sales are connected to a totally arbitrary range of factors which agencies can't be expected to control. Not many agencies could survive on that basis alone.\" </p> <p>Although P&amp;G blazed the PBR trail, most companies have taken a broader view of what is meant by \"results\". An increasingly common approach is to measure agency performance according to three sets of criteria. These combine hard goals such as client sales and profitability, with harder-to-measure objectives - anything from the quality of the agency's ideas to the transparency of its financial reporting. </p> <p>Although PBR will undoubtedly put the onus on agencies to prove themselves, many welcome its introduction. For some years now the industry has been working very hard to prove advertising's effectiveness. Schemes such as the effectiveness awards run by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) have helped create a new culture of accountability, encouraging agencies to demonstrate the effect of their work on clients' business performance. As long as they can do this, many agencies say PBR can only improve their lot. </p> <p>Stephen Woodford, chief executive of WCRS, argues that his agency's work for Orange has been instrumental in building the value of the company. This is an important claim, considering that France Telecom recently acquired Orange for an eye-watering \u00a331bn. </p> <p>Woodford says: \"Our ads contributed hugely to the value of the company. When Orange was sold, all the analysts said its key asset was the resonance of its brand, and we helped create that. On the whole, agencies are paid a tiny proportion of the value they help create, and PBR will hopefully bring some focus on to what we do.\" </p> <p>WCRS won an IPA advertising effectiveness award for its work for Orange in 1998. At the time, independent analysts valued Orange at \u00a36.3bn, but said that without its brand, the company would only be worth \u00a32.9bn. That was one of the key factors which won WCRS the IPA award. </p> <p>However, clients are far too smart to leave PBR agreements open-ended. The last thing they want is to owe their agency millions in bonus payments if an ad campaign works wonders for their brand. </p> <p>This is something that Bartle Bogle Hegarty may consider when it reflects on what it did for Levi's in the 80s and 90s. Its unforgettable campaign in 1985, featuring Nick Kamen stripping off in a launderette, kicked off a series of classic ads which are estimated to have boosted sales of Levi's 501s by 800%. More recently, Levi's has suffered from blue jeans falling out of fashion, but for a good 10 years BBH had Levi's surfing a wave of astonishing success. </p> <p>BBH's group managing director, Simon Sherwood, wishes PBR had been around a bit sooner. He says, wistfully: \"If we'd negotiated a dollar for every pair of 501s sold, we'd all be bobbing around in large yachts now, smoking fat cigars.\" </p> <p>In practice, PBR is a far more modest reward. In the ISBA report, an example is given of how it works for an anonymous food and drinks company with an annual advertising spend of \u00a35m. Based on a package which combines a fee-paying and PBR model, the advertiser pays the agency a flat percentage of its annual ad spend, in this case \u00a3500,000 per year. A range is then set for results, based on an upper and lower limit of 15%. This means that the agency will be rewarded or penalised, but only according to a 15% upturn or slide in the client's business. For this agency, that means its \u00a3500,000 fee will either grow or be cut by \u00a375,000. </p> <p> This is probably a good example of how the new system will work.

      "bodyText": "There's a story about a marketing director who went to his advertising agency for a meeting. As he parked, he nosed his company Vauxhall into a space between two gleaming Aston Martins. Noticing that the rest of the car park was liberally dotted with yet more expensive motors, the marketing man's first comment to his agency that morning was: \"I think I'm paying you lot too much.\" The question of how much advertisers pay their agency has always been contentious. Ad agencies may be experts in creating beautiful and often very effective commercials, but they are also masters of the art of spending their clients' cash. Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO spent \u00a31m making the \"Surfer\" ad for Guinness, complete with computer-animated horses, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi famously draped an entire island in silk for the benefit of British Airways. Not surprisingly, clients who invest millions every year in advertising are increasingly keen to make sure they're getting their money's worth. Rising media costs - inflating at a rate of more than 10% per year - and the relative cost-effectiveness of rival media, such as the internet and direct marketing, are all putting clients under more pressure to justify their advertising expenditure. So there is a growing trend for companies to link agency pay to the effectiveness of their advertising. Roughly speaking, if the ads help to boost sales the agency gets more. If they don't there's a penalty. This harsh regime would have caused agency folk to choke on their champagne in the freewheeling 80s, when remuneration was generally linked to commission paid on media spending. Under this system, agen cies were paid a flat 15% of whatever they spent on media. They also slapped a 15% charge on to their production costs. So, the more extravagant the ads, the bigger the profit for the agency. This system didn't exactly encourage a penny-pinching culture in the streets of Soho. In the early 90s, some agencies tried to change things by charging clients a flat fee. This was fine, but critics argued that it didn't provide a sufficient incentive for the agency and made them feel like their services were being bought in the same way as you'd pay a plumber. Opponents of commission said it made ad agencies behave like estate agents. Each system was flawed. But now things are changing again. According to a new report by the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers (ISBA), called Paying for Advertising, more and more companies are now paying agencies according to results. There has been a steady drift towards this system for three or so years now, but the report shows that payment by results (PBR) is fast becoming accepted practice. In its study of 16 of the UK's biggest advertisers - many of whom spend more than \u00a310m above-the-line per year - ISBA found that PBR now features in 34% of all agency remuneration agreements. Commission-based agreements are rapidly going out of fashion, only included in 22% of contracts, compared to 33% in 1997. Debbie Morrison, director of membership services at ISBA, says PBR is a healthier system for both client and agency. \"With commission, clients didn't know what they were buying - there was very little accountability. But PBR encourages the client and agency to have a more open dialogue and doesn't prejudice the agency towards using one type of media over another. If pay's linked to effectiveness, not media, the agency is more likely to use whatever channel gets the best results. That's better for everyone.\" However, the big problem with paying by results is establishing what measures to use. Procter &amp; Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, shocked adland last year when it announced it planned to link agency remuneration to global brand sales. As Gary Cunningham, director of public affairs and media at P&amp;G, says: \"However involved we become in the excitement of the advertising world, we need to remember that companies don't advertise for advertising's sake, no matter how great the creative work. Companies advertise to sell their products.\" This may sound logical but P&amp;G's is an extreme step, as even the most rigorously measured advertising is hard to link to products shifting off the shelves. You can track brand awareness and customer loyalty, but sales are a different story. James Best, group chairman of the ad agency BMP DDB, says: \"Brand sales are connected to a totally arbitrary range of factors which agencies can't be expected to control. Not many agencies could survive on that basis alone.\" Although P&amp;G blazed the PBR trail, most companies have taken a broader view of what is meant by \"results\". An increasingly common approach is to measure agency performance according to three sets of criteria. These combine hard goals such as client sales and profitability, with harder-to-measure objectives - anything from the quality of the agency's ideas to the transparency of its financial reporting. Although PBR will undoubtedly put the onus on agencies to prove themselves, many welcome its introduction. For some years now the industry has been working very hard to prove advertising's effectiveness. Schemes such as the effectiveness awards run by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) have helped create a new culture of accountability, encouraging agencies to demonstrate the effect of their work on clients' business performance.

When Orange was sold, all the analysts said its key asset was the resonance of its brand, and we helped create that. On the whole, agencies are paid a tiny proportion of the value they help create, and PBR will hopefully bring some focus on to what we do.\" WCRS won an IPA advertising effectiveness award for its work for Orange in 1998. At the time, independent analysts valued Orange at \u00a36.3bn, but said that without its brand, the company would only be worth \u00a32.9bn. That was one of the key factors which won WCRS the IPA award. However, clients are far too smart to leave PBR agreements open-ended. The last thing they want is to owe their agency millions in bonus payments if an ad campaign works wonders for their brand.

Is it because broadband - the bandwidth technology which will enable video and film to be streamed down the phone line to our PCs and mobile phones - is the new path to profitability? The word that can throw the lifeline to floundering dot.coms and launch a flotilla of new start-ups in an otherwise suicidal market?</p> <p>Surely Channel 4's E-Millionaire Show, which culminated in a spectacular dot.bomb, was proof enough of what happens when an immature industry is over-hyped and sold to the public as lottery tickets? After its growing pains, the market has matured, as has, so we are told, First Tuesday which has announced a merger with Yazam, a first-stage investor, and is preparing for a relaunch in the autumn. </p> <p>So Thursday's event in the Park Lane Hotel was not the cattle market it used to be. The \"young pretenders\" have been put through two screening tests (only the top 10% to 15% of the 300 entrepreneurs who applied were chosen) and only half of the venture capital firms who registered have been invited. </p> <p>Lines of numbered tables are laid out with refreshments in the ballroom at which the hopefuls wait attentively for the VCs to sign their \"dance cards\". They have 10 minutes to entice their dates to a further meeting before the gong is sounded and everyone moves round one place. Almost civilised. \"Thank God. I was starting to feel too old for all of that networking stuff,\" confides David Phillips, 30-something CEO of music portal iCrunch. He is about to go into the third of his 10 pitches that day. </p> <p>After introducing his team, he launches into the routine. iCrunch, which aggregates and exploits digital music rights in the alternative European market, sees \"a natural extension from dance music to dance culture and being able to go deep and vertical in terms of the music and the lifestyle\", he explains. \"We then add value to it by bundling it with editorial, content and community.\"</p> <p>Phillips, a former AOL executive, is no web wannabe. Just 16 months old, iCrunch is working with 50 music labels, and has deals with HMV and EMusic. It is talking to \"everyone\" from telecoms companies to magazine publishers, including a major music channel with whom it is discussing \"a branded channel distribution deal\".</p> <p>The pitches are slick and seamless. Phillips disarms a question about competitors by comparing Peoplesound.com to the \"meat market\" of the early First Tuesdays. \"This is a more mature, filtered environment... We are getting in the new acts, breaking in the new talent.\"</p> <p>So where are the wannabes? Sometimes you can tell them by their overly-austere suits. DataKlick online marketing research's managing director, Lisanne Davie - aged 23, with punk red hair and a chin stud but tucked into a smart outfit - and her portly director of strategy, David Liley, could fit the description. Davie approached Liley with her idea nine months ago when he was running a web design agency and she was a junior telemarketing officer. He gave up his job to join her.</p> <p>DataKlick, however, is a serious contender. Its vision for making market research \"fun\" for its \"cohort of willing consumers\" is by paying them to take part in market research surveys (from 50p to \u00a33 for a few minutes) and using broadband multimedia streaming. Their company's competitive edge, they maintain, is that it is 20% cheaper than its rivals and can get results within two hours. The second VC they met today offered to write a cheque out for several million if they fulfilled certain criteria which they believe they can meet within six months. Flushed with excitement, they don't want to count their chickens but at this rate they could be floating in 18 months. </p> <p>By far the wackiest pitch was IndiaGeek.com, a broadband channel which according to a co-founder, Farrukh Dhondy, will provide \"satirical and innovative\" programming for the Indian diaspora. Dhondy, a columnist on the Asian Age and former Channel 4 commissioning editor, formed AMI Net last year with Shekhar Kapur, director of Bandit Queen and Elizabeth, and the CEO, Mohan Chopra, backed by money from \"friends and fools\". It has offices in London and Delhi. </p> <p>\"We are building for the day when the computer becomes the TV screen. Whatever John Birt says, the TV is never going to run successful interactive shows,\" says Dhondy. Despite the postmodern name, IndiaGeek claims to be coming up from grassroots. \"There's a new consciousness. Indians are obsessed with Bollywood and yet only one in 100 films succeeds - people are looking for something new.\" The web channel will stream short films, animations, drama, comedy and \"tasteful erotica\". \"Nothing is sacred. We're going to slaughter a lot of holy cows. We are going to do revelations, to take the cover off: corruption, cruelty, slavery, oppression, wife-burning - give India its first burst of investigative and observational documentary films.\" Free from government censorship, IndiaGeek can go where the Asian networks fear to tread.</p> <p>Dhondy believes they have no competition, \"because no one knows what to do with broadband. They see it as a dumping ground for Bollywood films or old TV shows. They are not exploiting the grammar of the net.\"</p> <p>IndiaGeek is hoping to close a deal for $3m in the next few months for a spring launch. From an investors' perspective, too, the day has been fruitful. \"I've seen six companies,\" says Thomas Kenney, of Nokia Ventures, who is over from the US to \"check out the cool technologies, applications, services for 3G mobile internet - investing at an early stage\". He has arranged second meetings with four start-ups. Kenney is \"surprised\" by the 2% brokerage fee that First Tuesday has introduced. \"In the States, if a VC agency asked for that it would be 'get outa here!'.\" But in Europe, he concedes, it is a different market. </p> <p>At the end of the day, no one is exactly walking out with a deal. If they performed well, they have a handful of business cards and invitations to meet up. The next generation of net entrepreneurs crawls into the lobby, exhausted, with their mobile phones beeping, but encouraged that when it comes to broadband a bit of the old dot.com fever still exists.</p>",

Is it a sovereign nation or not?\" News Corp, which owns the Times, the Sunday Times and the Sun, has long run into regulatory problems related to its dominance of the newspaper industry in the UK. Mr Murdoch insisted that he was simply demanding a more open system, rather than addressing a particular issue. His lecture will be delivered before the deadline for contributions to the communications white paper. Chris Smith, the culture secretary, is open to consultation on questions such as regulation, cross-media ownership and consolidation. Mr Murdoch's comments come after government restrictions on the merger of the ITV companies Carlton Communications and United News and Media scuppered the deal and paved the way for a fresh shake-up of the industry. Eleven years ago, Rupert Murdoch lambasted British broadcasters for their complacency and warned that Sky, his then fledgling satellite operation, would take business away from them. The company confirmed how far it had fulfilled his prophecy last month when it secured the rights to televise Premier League football for another three years. Two years ago Elisabeth Murdoch, James's sister, heralded the onset of digital broadcasting.",

Yesterday was just one of those days when absolutely everything goes right for you. They missed the straight ones, every edge went to hand, and every catch was held. The ball did swing a little out there, which obviously helped, but I feel I bowled some good balls as well - the ball which dismissed Darren Maddy swung in late and took out his off stump. I was pleased with that.</p> <p>I didn't really think about beating my previous best bowling figures [9-45 v Cambridge University, 1988]. It wasn't something I ever expected to beat, but I suppose that when you get so close it's a shame not to improve upon them. Obviously I'd have loved to take all ten, but I'm not disappointed in any way: I'm very, very happy about the way things went today - I certainly can't complain! It was very important for us to do well against Leicestershire [County Champions in both 1996 and 1998]. </p> <p>To be honest, I try not to think about the whole Test thing - I've been so close so many times and after a while you start to think that if they haven't picked you by now, they never will. Taking 16 wickets in the match doesn't really make a lot of difference. I've been bowling as well as this all season, and I still haven't been called up. But I'm only 31, which is about the same as most of the bowlers in the Test side, and I'm going to keep on going for a good few years yet. I guess I've just got to keep performing well for Surrey and see what happens. Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh [aged 36 and 37] are the benchmark for fast bowling today: they have been bowling so well for so long, and show that fast bowlers can still be effective into their 30s. </p> <p>When I did finally break into the Test side in 1993, I got injured and missed the last Test match, and that was it. I couldn't get back into the squad again. After that I had two bad years with injuries, and ever since then I've either been written off as too old, or not fast enough to trouble Test-match batsmen - an argument I've never really understood or agreed with. It seems that I've always been in the wrong place at the wrong time, but as I say I'm happy to be performing well for Surrey. </p> <p>Surrey are in a good position for the Championship again this season - we've got five matches left and if we win them, we'll win the Championship. There's a long way to go yet, but we've got a couple of good home games coming up at The Oval, which has been turning this season, and I suppose we must be favourites. Saqlain Mushtaq has been brilliant again this season, but Surrey aren't a one-man team like people try to make out. At times this season, Ian Salisbury has bowled even better than Saqqy and Ali Brown, Ian Ward and Mark Butcher have all chipped in with some really important innings. As a team you're only as good as your weakest link and Surrey don't really have a weak link, everyone contributes. </p> <p>Martin Bicknell was speaking to Tom Bowtell.

Neither side will budge. <p>The trouble started when the council introduced wheelie bins to Fairway Crescent in the Bronte sisters' picturesque home town of Haworth. The homeowners, who had been leaving their rubbish on their doorsteps, were told to move their bins to the end of the road. They refused and the rubbish looks set to reach wuthering heights.</p> <p>The dustmen say they cannot collect from outside the houses because parked cars make it impossible for them to reverse their wagon down the crescent. They moved the wheelie bins to the end of the road and gave them \"red cards\" announcing that this was the new collection point.</p> <p>The residents are not impressed. \"I think most people in the road are just sick of doing their job for them,\" Hazel Scriven told the Keighley News.

The trouble started when the council introduced wheelie bins to Fairway Crescent in the Bronte sisters' picturesque home town of Haworth. The homeowners, who had been leaving their rubbish on their doorsteps, were told to move their bins to the end of the road. They refused and the rubbish looks set to reach wuthering heights. The dustmen say they cannot collect from outside the houses because parked cars make it impossible for them to reverse their wagon down the crescent. They moved the wheelie bins to the end of the road and gave them \"red cards\" announcing that this was the new collection point. The residents are not impressed. \"I think most people in the road are just sick of doing their job for them,\" Hazel Scriven told the Keighley News.

A crucial moment in rock history has been unearthed by Skegness News, who report that Turner performed with husband Ike at the Sands showbar under the pier in the mid 70s. According to the paper, while \"no one quite knows what happened to Tina that famous night\u0085 something in our bracing sea air must have made her rethink her destiny\".

Skeg hotelier Jo Dunsdon, who witnessed the Turners' seaside show, said: \"It was a very good night out.\" Skegness News Arson display Lincolnshire firefighters have become the latest group to bare all for a charity calendar. Civilian firemen at RAF Cranwell were persuaded to strip to raise money for charities including Great Ormond Street hospital in London, where fireman Shane Cook's daughter Emma underwent heart surgery last year. Their poses went down so well with public that the calendars are close to exhausting their 2000 initial print run but, as yet, the men have no plans to become full-time models. \"They may not have had the barefaced cheek of the Women's Institute or the pertness of a Pirelli model, but our firemen certainly proved hot stuff in front of the camera,\" a spokesman for RAF Cranwell said.

      "byline": "Giles Smith",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Say what you like about the Chrysler Neon, it's cheap. Also, for an American car, it's emphatically finless. Like so many vehicles in this rounded age - even, sad to say, ones designed and built in Illinois - the Neon has much in common with the outline of a boiled sweet. </p> <p>But mostly it's cheap. In the UK, no 2.0 litre car in its class comes cheaper. It's a big-ish four-door car with a big-ish engine that can be bought for a little under \u00a311,000, in basic form, which makes it, in its price range, the last chance saloon. </p> <p>The Neon was the first car Chrysler launched in the UK, and it seems to have done its job in, as it were, setting down a marque. In the three years since then, 10,000 people have bought one and Chrysler has further sold 12,000 of its space bus, the Voyager. Meanwhile, Chrysler Jeep products have been nudging into the Range Rover market, making the unlikely transition from all- terrain combat vehicles to posh city run-abouts. (Jeeps seem to be popular with mothers who prefer to be bullet-proof during the school-run.) </p> <p>Time, you might have thought, for Chrysler to capitalise on that performance and launch something risky and go-ahead, like a three-wheeler that uses rocket fuel or the world's first nuclear-powered convertible. </p> <p>But that's not really what the legacy of Walter Percy Chrysler demands, connecting, as it does, more obviously with American ideals of affordability and the grand democratisation of driving: cheap cars running on cheap gas. So Chrysler chose to rework the Neon instead. </p> <p>It has done this, it seems, in line with some very pertinent statistics about the 10,000 people who bought the first generation model. Apparently, the average Neon buyer to date is 53 years old, which is one of the reasons why you haven't seen the new car advertised in Loaded. </p> <p>Arrestingly, 86% of Neon owners are married and 75% fall into the demographic subgroup known movingly as \"empty-nesters\" - people whose children have left home. Here, then, is a vehicle to capture the mood and needs of people who have recently discharged their major parental duties. It's an important niche that, up to now, has been principally the job of Rover to fulfil. Or, in certain extreme cases, Ferrari. But now Chrysler is lending a willing, transatlantic hand - and becoming thoroughly middle class and English in the process. You might purchase a Neon, these figures suggest, in the same quietly celebratory spirit in which you might book a short cruise, order a conservatory or arrange to re-turf the lawn. </p> <p>Some traces of America remain. The gentle bong of the interior alarm that tells you you're not wearing your seat belt or that you are trying to leave without switching off the lights will be familiar to anyone who has hired a car in the US. Other faintly exotic foibles include the need to depress the clutch in order to get the engine to turn over and the button beside the ignition that you must push in order to remove the key. Otherwise, the Neon feels about as American as Newport Pagnell services. </p> <p>For a vehicle designed to ferry you gently into retirement, the Neon looks pretty racey from the outside. It tips forward from the back, which makes it appear keen and feline, though this is an expectation it rather disappoints when you come to drive it and realise that the 2.0 litre engine will only pull you along politely and decorously. </p> <p>First, however, on your way into the front seat, you should stop to applaud Chrysler's boldly retro persistence with a totally silent remote controlled door locking device. You press the button on the pad and nothing happens - no cocky wink from the indicators and no electronic belch, burble or yelp. It's the same when you lock up afterwards. The downside is you find yourself neurotically checking the door manually to be sure that the lock has actually engaged - which can defeat the whole remote-control idea. But your neighbours will be happier with you. </p> <p>Generally it's the function of car re-thinks to be unashamedly cosmetic - the introduction of, say, a new gear-fob or a slightly squarer cigarette lighter serving as an excuse for an advertising blitz on the same old car with knobs on. On its way to offering what the manufacturers refer to as \"a more mature overall package\", the new Neon certainly has its share of these half-hearted twists. The badge on the front, for instance, now has a pair of long, eagle-like wings, in line with the recently up-dated global Chrysler logo. Are empty-nesters in the market for additional chrome detailing? I reckon that little additional feature could drag the average age of the customer down - who knows? - maybe all the way to 51. </p> <p>But there's more room in the interior than there used to be and there are expensively researched gimmicks on board to make the car smoother than the original. The slightly more pricey LX version has part-leather seats and wood grain trim - hints of a world in which cars cost twice as much as this. These days even the personable but fundamentally tinny Ford Ka comes with power-steering, electric windows and a CD player: we are all executives now. Even so, the provision in the Neon seems bountiful. </p> <p>Today, then, the cheap car; tomorrow the cheap petrol. </p> <p> <strong> The lowdown </strong></p> <p><strong> Chrysler Neon 2.0LX Price on the road:</strong> \u00a313,495 </p> <p><strong> Top speed:</strong> 124mph </p> <p><strong> 0-62 mph:</strong> 10.8 seconds </p> <p><strong> Fuel consumption:</strong> 35.8mpg </p> <p><strong> On the stereo:</strong> Kiri Te Kanawa </p> <p><strong> At the wheel:</strong> Peter Alliss </p> <p><strong> En route for:</strong> the daughter's for Sunday lunch</p>",

      "bodyText": "Say what you like about the Chrysler Neon, it's cheap. Also, for an American car, it's emphatically finless. Like so many vehicles in this rounded age - even, sad to say, ones designed and built in Illinois - the Neon has much in common with the outline of a boiled sweet. But mostly it's cheap. In the UK, no 2.0 litre car in its class comes cheaper. It's a big-ish four-door car with a big-ish engine that can be bought for a little under \u00a311,000, in basic form, which makes it, in its price range, the last chance saloon. The Neon was the first car Chrysler launched in the UK, and it seems to have done its job in, as it were, setting down a marque. In the three years since then, 10,000 people have bought one and Chrysler has further sold 12,000 of its space bus, the Voyager. Meanwhile, Chrysler Jeep products have been nudging into the Range Rover market, making the unlikely transition from all- terrain combat vehicles to posh city run-abouts. (Jeeps seem to be popular with mothers who prefer to be bullet-proof during the school-run.) Time, you might have thought, for Chrysler to capitalise on that performance and launch something risky and go-ahead, like a three-wheeler that uses rocket fuel or the world's first nuclear-powered convertible. But that's not really what the legacy of Walter Percy Chrysler demands, connecting, as it does, more obviously with American ideals of affordability and the grand democratisation of driving: cheap cars running on cheap gas. So Chrysler chose to rework the Neon instead. It has done this, it seems, in line with some very pertinent statistics about the 10,000 people who bought the first generation model. Apparently, the average Neon buyer to date is 53 years old, which is one of the reasons why you haven't seen the new car advertised in Loaded. Arrestingly, 86% of Neon owners are married and 75% fall into the demographic subgroup known movingly as \"empty-nesters\" - people whose children have left home. Here, then, is a vehicle to capture the mood and needs of people who have recently discharged their major parental duties. It's an important niche that, up to now, has been principally the job of Rover to fulfil. Or, in certain extreme cases, Ferrari. But now Chrysler is lending a willing, transatlantic hand - and becoming thoroughly middle class and English in the process. You might purchase a Neon, these figures suggest, in the same quietly celebratory spirit in which you might book a short cruise, order a conservatory or arrange to re-turf the lawn. Some traces of America remain. The gentle bong of the interior alarm that tells you you're not wearing your seat belt or that you are trying to leave without switching off the lights will be familiar to anyone who has hired a car in the US. Other faintly exotic foibles include the need to depress the clutch in order to get the engine to turn over and the button beside the ignition that you must push in order to remove the key. Otherwise, the Neon feels about as American as Newport Pagnell services. For a vehicle designed to ferry you gently into retirement, the Neon looks pretty racey from the outside. It tips forward from the back, which makes it appear keen and feline, though this is an expectation it rather disappoints when you come to drive it and realise that the 2.0 litre engine will only pull you along politely and decorously. First, however, on your way into the front seat, you should stop to applaud Chrysler's boldly retro persistence with a totally silent remote controlled door locking device. You press the button on the pad and nothing happens - no cocky wink from the indicators and no electronic belch, burble or yelp. It's the same when you lock up afterwards. The downside is you find yourself neurotically checking the door manually to be sure that the lock has actually engaged - which can defeat the whole remote-control idea. But your neighbours will be happier with you. Generally it's the function of car re-thinks to be unashamedly cosmetic - the introduction of, say, a new gear-fob or a slightly squarer cigarette lighter serving as an excuse for an advertising blitz on the same old car with knobs on. On its way to offering what the manufacturers refer to as \"a more mature overall package\", the new Neon certainly has its share of these half-hearted twists. The badge on the front, for instance, now has a pair of long, eagle-like wings, in line with the recently up-dated global Chrysler logo. Are empty-nesters in the market for additional chrome detailing? I reckon that little additional feature could drag the average age of the customer down - who knows? - maybe all the way to 51. But there's more room in the interior than there used to be and there are expensively researched gimmicks on board to make the car smoother than the original. The slightly more pricey LX version has part-leather seats and wood grain trim - hints of a world in which cars cost twice as much as this. These days even the personable but fundamentally tinny Ford Ka comes with power-steering, electric windows and a CD player: we are all executives now. Even so, the provision in the Neon seems bountiful. Today, then, the cheap car; tomorrow the cheap petrol.

      "bodyText": "Loyalist assassin Michael Stone was among the first prisoners released this week under a scheme which will see the high security Maze prison virtually emptied. Supporters cheered him as he left the prison this morning. The Ulster Freedom Fighters member killed three people in a gun and grenade attack in a Belfast graveyard at the funeral of three IRA members killed in Gibraltar in March 1988. Some of Northern Ireland's most infamous paramilitary killers are being freed today under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. The other paramilitary prisoners set to benefit from the release scheme this week include: \u0095 James McArdle, who has served two years of a 25-year sentence for planting the London Docklands bomb which marked the ending of the IRA ceasefire in February 1996. The attack killed two people and injured 40 others. \u0095 Sean Kelly, who was part of the IRA team behind the fish shop bombing in Belfast's Shankill Road in October 1993 which killed nine Protestant civilians as well as his comrade, Thomas Begley. \u0095 Torrens Knight, who was part of a UFF hit squad who killed seven people - six Catholics and one Protestant - in the \"Trick or Treat massacre\" in the Rising Sun pub in Greysteel, County Londonderry, exactly one week after the Shankill bombing. The prisoner releases have prompted protests from Conservative and unionist critics of the Good Friday Agreement. Ulster Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson said the release of around 80 republicans and loyalists was \"deeply frustrating\" for those who had had relatives killed or maimed by the prisoners. \"People are deeply depressed and frustrated that the paramilitaries have reaped the benefits of the agreement without a single bullet or a single ounce of explosives being decommissioned,\" the Lagan Valley MP said. \"They are also concerned that the paramilitary groups are continuing to exert influence and engage in violent activities.\" Democratic Unionist Party justice spokesman Ian Paisley Junior laid the blame for the releases with Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble because of his support for the Good Friday Agreement. The North Antrim MLA said he was \"utterly disgusted that the only tangible legacy David Trimble has left Northern Ireland is the mass release of killers on to the province's streets\". The Conservatives' Northern Ireland spokesman Andrew MacKay also claimed in the absence of any decommissioning, it was wrong for the Government to go ahead with the prisoner release scheme. The shadow Northern Ireland secretary argued: \"Peter Mandelson should not release these prisoners until a credible and verifiable process of putting all illegal arms and explosives beyond use has actually begun. \"The Government was prepared to let the timetable for decommissioning slip. It should be prepared to do the same on the release of prisoners.\" However, the prisoner releases were defended by the Progressive Unionists who are the political representatives of the loyalist group, the Ulster Volunteer Force. East Belfast Assemblyman David Ervine, who was sentenced to 11 years in 1975 for transporting a loyalist bomb in a stolen car, said while he understood people's concerns, the scheme was for the greater good. The Progressive Unionist MLA told BBC1's Breakfast with Frost programme: \"There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people who are alive that might be dead were it not for changing circumstances in Northern Ireland. \"Next week for the first time in my lifetime, there will be no political prisoners in Northern Ireland. Now that has got to be a watershed.\"",

      "body": "<p>The News of the World believes it knows better than parliament, police or probation officers. In the wake of the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, it has decided to reveal the identity of all 110,000 known child sex offenders. It began yesterday with the photographs of 49 of them and the towns or districts where they are living. At that rate it will take them 40 years to reveal the identities of all existing offenders, let alone new ones. Some protection. And this ignores the awkward fact that the News of the World will not know the vast majority of offenders and would have to break the law to obtain their names. </p> <p>The tabloid tried desperately to dress this up as a child protection campaign, rather than a cheap publicity stunt to increase falling sales. It talked of the right of every parent to know where paedophiles are living. But this difficult issue was debated at length in 1997, when the paedophile register was introduced. With the consent of the police and probation services - and even hardline Michael Howard - it was agreed that disclosure should be confined to people who needed to know (headteachers, youth group organisers, community leaders) but that in exceptional circumstances the community would be warned. The reason for these restrictions was the vigilante action, which had followed earlier revelations of paedophiles' whereabouts. This had not just led to several mistaken attacks on wrongly identified suspects or homes (including an arson attack in which an innocent 14-year-old was killed), but had prompted several paedophiles to go to ground, making it much more difficult for the police to monitor and track them. Far from increasing child protection, it had made them more vulnerable. </p> <p>Lamely, having set out six stark pages of brutal mixed up facts, the tabloid urged its readers not to indulge in vigilante activity. That's as good as giving children matches, lighter fuel and tinder, but telling them not to start a fire. A better informed public would provide more protection to children, but yesterday's hysterical outpourings will only have increased public anxieties, rather than reduced them. The chances of a child being abducted and killed by a stranger are remote: about seven a year compared to the 80 killed by family members. Child sexual abuse has a similar pattern.

      "bodyText": "The News of the World believes it knows better than parliament, police or probation officers. In the wake of the murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, it has decided to reveal the identity of all 110,000 known child sex offenders. It began yesterday with the photographs of 49 of them and the towns or districts where they are living. At that rate it will take them 40 years to reveal the identities of all existing offenders, let alone new ones. Some protection. And this ignores the awkward fact that the News of the World will not know the vast majority of offenders and would have to break the law to obtain their names. The tabloid tried desperately to dress this up as a child protection campaign, rather than a cheap publicity stunt to increase falling sales. It talked of the right of every parent to know where paedophiles are living. But this difficult issue was debated at length in 1997, when the paedophile register was introduced. With the consent of the police and probation services - and even hardline Michael Howard - it was agreed that disclosure should be confined to people who needed to know (headteachers, youth group organisers, community leaders) but that in exceptional circumstances the community would be warned. The reason for these restrictions was the vigilante action, which had followed earlier revelations of paedophiles' whereabouts. This had not just led to several mistaken attacks on wrongly identified suspects or homes (including an arson attack in which an innocent 14-year-old was killed), but had prompted several paedophiles to go to ground, making it much more difficult for the police to monitor and track them. Far from increasing child protection, it had made them more vulnerable. Lamely, having set out six stark pages of brutal mixed up facts, the tabloid urged its readers not to indulge in vigilante activity. That's as good as giving children matches, lighter fuel and tinder, but telling them not to start a fire. A better informed public would provide more protection to children, but yesterday's hysterical outpourings will only have increased public anxieties, rather than reduced them. The chances of a child being abducted and killed by a stranger are remote: about seven a year compared to the 80 killed by family members. Child sexual abuse has a similar pattern. We do need to be vigilant, but the last thing we need is more vigilantes.",

Liberals and the religious right can both line up behind the project of seeking to maximise life chances, notably through education. \"For those in poverty, particularly the young, education that provides the technical and spiritual (immaterial) endowments needed for successful competition in the rapidly changing economy is a necessary condition for self-realisation.\" </p> <p>Given his record as governor of Texas, Mr Bush might well sign up for that.

In 1880, four-fifths of the time left after life's necessities of sleeping, eating etc were attended to was spent earning a living. Today the lion's share of such \"discretionary time\" is available for leisure and it is going to grow, as the chart shows. Abundant leisure time will promote the search for deeper understanding of life's meaning - fuelling the religious impulse but also freeing people for voluntary work, for example, in schools. </p> <p>That could sound panglossian.

      "body": "<p>On day 68, Laurence McKeown needed to go to the toilet. He knew immediately what it meant. His first bowel movement in eight weeks signalled that his death was at hand. He had noticed it happening with the others, and knew he had at most two days left to live.</p> <p>McKeown was 24, and had been lucky. He was 6ft 2in, but weighed less than 11 stone when he started his protest; with almost no body fat, few toxins leaked into his body to destroy his kidneys, and he relied on muscle tissue for energy. He managed to keep drinking water all the way and had remained lucid throughout.</p> <p>He had suffered none of the pain which had racked Martin Hurson, 27, who was convulsing so severely before he succumbed - after 46 days - that two men had struggled to hold him down on his hospital bed.</p> <p>McKeown's final wish was to bow out like Tom McElwee, 23, who was smoking a cigarette and chatting about inviting his Protestant neighbours to his wedding just before he passed away. He had lasted 65 days.</p> <p>Ten fellow IRA prisoners had already died, and after an hour in the toilets McKeown returned to bed, exhausted. He apologised to his mother, never a republican, and lapsed into unconsciousness.</p> <p>The IRA hunger strikes of 1981 were a turning point at the Maze - and also in the Troubles, because the story of the Maze is the story of the Irish conflict itself. Nothing was to be the same again, in any area of life in Northern Ireland. Republicans lost the battle for political status at the prison, yet were somehow to emerge even stronger.</p> <p>The Maze itself, still known among republicans and loyalists by its original name, Long Kesh, was to change radically. Gradually, terrorists won the political status they had been denied, via a combination of threats - 29 prison officers have been murdered during the Troubles - and mind games. In just four days, however, an era will draw to a close as more than 80 terrorists walk to freedom through a rickety turnstile that leads into the Maze car park. These men will include some of Northern Ireland's most notorious killers. Among them will be Sean Kelly, who murdered nine Protestants in the IRA bombing of the Shankill Road in Belfast less than seven years ago, and Torrens Knight, guilty of 11 murders, including seven in the trick-or-treat Hallowe'en shootings at the Rising Sun pub in Greysteel, County Londonderry, which were a response to the Shankill slaughter.</p> <p>Also walking out of the 130-acre jail will be three of the IRA's south Armagh sniper unit, who in February 1997 shot dead Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier murdered in Northern Ireland, in February 1997. Believed guilty of eight more murders, they smiled as they were jailed last year; they understood exactly what the early release scheme meant.</p> <p>Michael Stone, the wild-eyed loyalist, will precede them today. He was jailed in 1988 for six murders, including those of three mourners who died in his gun and grenade attack on the funerals of the trio of IRA volunteers shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar.</p> <p>And so a jail which once housed 1,700 men will on Friday be left with precisely 16 prisoners, guarded by a staff of 750 (whittled down by 300 through a voluntary redundancy package). Most of those remaining officers will pick up their goodbye cheques within two months, and then the last inmates will be transferred to nearby Maghaberry Prison.</p> <p>The men from the Maze are returning to a world transformed from the one they left. McKeown is 43 now, a father of two daughters, Caoilfhioinn, four, and one-year-old Orlaith. He is now almost twice the weight he was during his hunger strike, but is still lean. He owes his survival to his mother, Margaret, who intervened when he lapsed into unconsciousness on the 70th day of his fast. His was the second family to insist that their son was treated, and he feels no guilt.</p> <p>Jailed for life for the attempted murder of an RUC man and several bombing offences, he arrived at the Maze in 1977, just after the eight H-shaped blocks were opened, and soon after the beginning of the blanket protest (prisoners refused to wear prison clothes, covering themselves with blankets instead). The Nissen huts - \"cages\" - for internees were still in use, but political status was gone for the newly sentenced. Those involved in the blanket protest stepped up their battle for political status by smearing excrement on cell walls and refusing to wash, and this campaign evolved into the hunger strike.</p> <p>Now the IRA embarked on a completely new political strategy, an about-turn which involved working the system from the inside. The aim, though, was to collapse it from within, and - while some IRA men thought it a sell-out - the policy proved highly effective. There were stunning escape bids (in September 1983, no fewer than 38 IRA prisoners broke clear of the jail: 19 got away; two are still fighting extradition), one involving the construction of a large tunnel (the cells where the soil was dumped were never searched). Step by step, they succeeded in turning a fearsome prison regime into the most liberal in western Europe, where the prisoners effectively ran the show.</p> <p>\"I would have preferred to have grown up without having to go through prison, but it was one of the best experiences of my life,\" says McKeown now. \"Life can be an anti-climax after everything we went through.</p> <p>\"The authorities achieved the opposite of what they were trying to achieve through the five years of protests. If we had political status, we would never have developed as quickly. But we were always being challenged and we had to dig deep to find out about ourselves and to analyse. It made us continually evaluate tactics.\"</p> <p>Thomas Quigley, 44, jailed for life with a recommendation that he should serve 25 years for the Chelsea barracks bombing in London in 1982, says: \"I was in the cages, which were there before the H-Blocks, in 1972, and we had political status then. I was transferred back to Long Kesh in 1996 after 11 years in English jails and two years at Maghaberry, and the regime had come full circle.</p> <p>\"We had control of our own wings again. We had more authority than we did even in the days of the cages.\"</p> <p>Their cells were unlocked for 24 hours from 1994, allowing free association, the last of the five demands denied 13 years earlier. Each wing enjoyed high levels of autonomy, and prison officers, many disenchanted, were gradually pushed to the periphery. The regime could only operate with paramilitary assent. When journalists were allowed to visit the Maze in January 1998, on the eve of the then Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam's crucial meeting there with the leadership of the Ulster Defence Association, prisoners and management denied lurid tales of sex and drugs being freely available. But smuggling was rife, with one leading loyalist said even to have had a pet dog brought in.</p> <p>Loyalist wings were decorated with gaudy sectarian murals.

      "bodyText": "On day 68, Laurence McKeown needed to go to the toilet. He knew immediately what it meant. His first bowel movement in eight weeks signalled that his death was at hand. He had noticed it happening with the others, and knew he had at most two days left to live. McKeown was 24, and had been lucky. He was 6ft 2in, but weighed less than 11 stone when he started his protest; with almost no body fat, few toxins leaked into his body to destroy his kidneys, and he relied on muscle tissue for energy. He managed to keep drinking water all the way and had remained lucid throughout. He had suffered none of the pain which had racked Martin Hurson, 27, who was convulsing so severely before he succumbed - after 46 days - that two men had struggled to hold him down on his hospital bed. McKeown's final wish was to bow out like Tom McElwee, 23, who was smoking a cigarette and chatting about inviting his Protestant neighbours to his wedding just before he passed away. He had lasted 65 days. Ten fellow IRA prisoners had already died, and after an hour in the toilets McKeown returned to bed, exhausted. He apologised to his mother, never a republican, and lapsed into unconsciousness. The IRA hunger strikes of 1981 were a turning point at the Maze - and also in the Troubles, because the story of the Maze is the story of the Irish conflict itself. Nothing was to be the same again, in any area of life in Northern Ireland. Republicans lost the battle for political status at the prison, yet were somehow to emerge even stronger. The Maze itself, still known among republicans and loyalists by its original name, Long Kesh, was to change radically. Gradually, terrorists won the political status they had been denied, via a combination of threats - 29 prison officers have been murdered during the Troubles - and mind games. In just four days, however, an era will draw to a close as more than 80 terrorists walk to freedom through a rickety turnstile that leads into the Maze car park. These men will include some of Northern Ireland's most notorious killers. Among them will be Sean Kelly, who murdered nine Protestants in the IRA bombing of the Shankill Road in Belfast less than seven years ago, and Torrens Knight, guilty of 11 murders, including seven in the trick-or-treat Hallowe'en shootings at the Rising Sun pub in Greysteel, County Londonderry, which were a response to the Shankill slaughter. Also walking out of the 130-acre jail will be three of the IRA's south Armagh sniper unit, who in February 1997 shot dead Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier murdered in Northern Ireland, in February 1997. Believed guilty of eight more murders, they smiled as they were jailed last year; they understood exactly what the early release scheme meant. Michael Stone, the wild-eyed loyalist, will precede them today. He was jailed in 1988 for six murders, including those of three mourners who died in his gun and grenade attack on the funerals of the trio of IRA volunteers shot dead by the SAS in Gibraltar. And so a jail which once housed 1,700 men will on Friday be left with precisely 16 prisoners, guarded by a staff of 750 (whittled down by 300 through a voluntary redundancy package). Most of those remaining officers will pick up their goodbye cheques within two months, and then the last inmates will be transferred to nearby Maghaberry Prison. The men from the Maze are returning to a world transformed from the one they left. McKeown is 43 now, a father of two daughters, Caoilfhioinn, four, and one-year-old Orlaith. He is now almost twice the weight he was during his hunger strike, but is still lean. He owes his survival to his mother, Margaret, who intervened when he lapsed into unconsciousness on the 70th day of his fast. His was the second family to insist that their son was treated, and he feels no guilt. Jailed for life for the attempted murder of an RUC man and several bombing offences, he arrived at the Maze in 1977, just after the eight H-shaped blocks were opened, and soon after the beginning of the blanket protest (prisoners refused to wear prison clothes, covering themselves with blankets instead). The Nissen huts - \"cages\" - for internees were still in use, but political status was gone for the newly sentenced. Those involved in the blanket protest stepped up their battle for political status by smearing excrement on cell walls and refusing to wash, and this campaign evolved into the hunger strike. Now the IRA embarked on a completely new political strategy, an about-turn which involved working the system from the inside. The aim, though, was to collapse it from within, and - while some IRA men thought it a sell-out - the policy proved highly effective. There were stunning escape bids (in September 1983, no fewer than 38 IRA prisoners broke clear of the jail: 19 got away; two are still fighting extradition), one involving the construction of a large tunnel (the cells where the soil was dumped were never searched). Step by step, they succeeded in turning a fearsome prison regime into the most liberal in western Europe, where the prisoners effectively ran the show. \"I would have preferred to have grown up without having to go through prison, but it was one of the best experiences of my life,\" says McKeown now. \"Life can be an anti-climax after everything we went through. \"The authorities achieved the opposite of what they were trying to achieve through the five years of protests. If we had political status, we would never have developed as quickly. But we were always being challenged and we had to dig deep to find out about ourselves and to analyse. It made us continually evaluate tactics.\" Thomas Quigley, 44, jailed for life with a recommendation that he should serve 25 years for the Chelsea barracks bombing in London in 1982, says: \"I was in the cages, which were there before the H-Blocks, in 1972, and we had political status then. I was transferred back to Long Kesh in 1996 after 11 years in English jails and two years at Maghaberry, and the regime had come full circle. \"We had control of our own wings again. We had more authority than we did even in the days of the cages.\" Their cells were unlocked for 24 hours from 1994, allowing free association, the last of the five demands denied 13 years earlier. Each wing enjoyed high levels of autonomy, and prison officers, many disenchanted, were gradually pushed to the periphery. The regime could only operate with paramilitary assent. When journalists were allowed to visit the Maze in January 1998, on the eve of the then Northern Ireland secretary Mo Mowlam's crucial meeting there with the leadership of the Ulster Defence Association, prisoners and management denied lurid tales of sex and drugs being freely available. But smuggling was rife, with one leading loyalist said even to have had a pet dog brought in. Loyalist wings were decorated with gaudy sectarian murals. Feared terrorist Johnny Adair was photographed alongside one reading: \"Kill 'em all and let God sort them out.\" Republicans posters were more overtly political. They seemed to be more interested in education, formal and informal. Loyalists taking classes focused on technical subjects, and the television blared constantly. Republicans opted for social sciences, and group discussions were the usual form of entertainment. McKeown says: \"Republicans tended to be more disciplined. We saw jail as an extension of the struggle and could adapt. They saw themselves as acting in defence of the state and were locked up by that state, and that was difficult for them.\" UDA member Billy McQuiston, 43, given jail sentences totalling 21 years, says: \"Back in the 70s, it was a real spit-and-shoeshine operation, and we were regularly beaten severely. We were getting smashed around by screws who had Ulster tattoos on their arms. It was hard to understand, but they thought we were scum.\" There were, though, common goals.

      "bodyText": "At the end of a report headed Britons escape death in Indian air crash, page 11, July 20, we said that British diplomats had been told by the Foreign Office not to use Alliance Air after Rolls-Royce withdrew a service contract for its engines on safety grounds. In fact, Rolls-Royce had no contract with Alliance Air from which to withdraw. In a report headed Volatile textile workers shake the calm of a French minister's summer, page 16, July 20, we referred to the textile mill at the centre of the story as Collatex. The company's correct name is Cellatex. We said the workers there had coined a new phrase to describe themselves - \"jusq'a bout-ists\" [sic], people who would go to the very end to make their point. In fact, they have simply adopted the phrase, which the dictionary spells jusqu'au-boutiste. The picture on page 12, July 21, captioned the Al-Aqsa mosque, Jerusalem, actually showed the Dome of the Rock. It is part of the Temple Mount complex which also includes the Al-Aqsa mosque.

But Mr Clinton denied he was simply backing big business. \"The real issue is, how to get the best food to the largest number of people in the world at the lowest possible price. \" He added: \"I would never knowingly let the American people eat unsafe food.\" The G8 leaders said they supported the efforts of a food safety body \"to achieve greater global consensus on how precaution should be applied to food safety in circumstances where available scientific information is incomplete or contradictory\". A set of reports drawn up by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development at the request of last year's G8 summit aimed to set out the state of debate on all GM organisms. The OECD report's assertion that governments are confident in the safety of GM products they have already approved has proved controversial. Activists say the OECD excluded anti-GM opinion from the process while favouring the biotech industry and pro-GM scientists. Nor does the report provide definitive answers on the murkier scientific and ethical problems posed by GM food. As part of a decision by the leaders to endorse a goal of ensuring basic education to children across the globe by 2015, Mr Clinton said that he was putting $300m into a fund to provide children with free school meals as an incentive to get them into the classroom. \"That money is enough to give one good meal to 9m school children for a year in the developing world,\" he said. Jubilee 2000, the coalition of charities campaigning for debt relief, jumped on Mr Blair's remarks on Saturday, when he said he wanted to do more than simply endorse the targets set last year in Cologne. It said: \"Today he can prove it and start to make up for the failure of Okinawa. Britain collects around \u00a370m a year in debt from the poorest nations. We don't need it, and they do. Mr Blair should stop taking it now and instead ring-fence it for health and education in these countries.\"",

Reports from the summit said that both sides, accompanied by the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had used Mr Clinton's four-day absence to recuperate from their marathon bargaining sessions. The Pope yesterday called for international guarantees of religious freedom in Jerusalem as the debate about the future of the holy city intensified. In an address to pilgrims from his retreat at Castel Gondolfo, the Pope said measures were needed to assure freedom of worship for Muslims, Jews and Christians, and access to shrines inside the ancient city walls. The square kilometre of land that lies within its gates contains hallowed ground for all three faiths. The most sacred relic of Judaism, the Wailing Wall, is located there, as is the Holy Sepulchre, where Christians believe Jesus was buried, and the al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest shrine in Islam. \"The holy see continues to maintain that only a special statute, internationally guaranteed, can effectively preserve the most sacred areas of the holy city,\" the Pope said. The intervention came amid anxiety among Arab countries that Mr Arafat, will come under heavy pressure this week from Mr Clinton and Mr Barak, to give ground on Jerusalem. Mr Arafat has yet to comment on reports that Mr Barak is prepared to accept Palestinian sovereignty over some areas of east Jerusalem occupied since 1967.

      "bodyText": "Sunday Times A flotation of the mobile telephone operator, Cellnet, and a demerger of its heavily regulated British wholesale operation are being considered by BT. Experts believe that the moves could come early next year as the next stage in BT's radical restructuring by Sir Peter Bonfield, its chief executive, and his management team. The internet software company Mediasurface is set to appoint an adviser for a planned flotation that could see the company valued as much as \u00a31bn. A beauty parade of investment banks is at present being conducted with Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman Sachs and Robertson Stephens on the shortlist. Mediasurface will press ahead with plans for a dual listing in London and on the US's Nasdaq market at the end of 2000, once an adviser is selected. Sunday Telegraph Sir Ian Prosser, chairman and chief executive of Bass, the hotels and pubs group, is expected to split his boardroom roles with an official announcement possibly coming as early as the group's next annual meeting. Speculation among well-placed Bass executives is that Sir Ian will relinquish the title of chief executive as he restructures the company and focuses on hotels. The world's fifth largest brewer, Interbrew, is set to sell Scotland's biggest alcohol brand, Tennent's Lager. An auction could raise as much as \u00a3250m. The move will allow Interbrew to clear regulatory hurdles following its recent acquisition of Bass Brewers and the Whitbread Beer company. Sunday Business Anglian Water is working on a scheme to split its assets from its operating company - despite widespread opposition to the Kelda proposal to mutualise its Yorkshire Water assets. If the regulators and shareholders approve the plan, Anglian Water is expected tofollow with takeover bids that would consolidate the water industry for the first time. Jan Leschly, the former high-profile chief executive of SmithKline Beecham, is plotting a comeback to the corporate world just months after announcing his retirement. Sources in the City say that Mr Leschly, who retired from the pharmaceuticals group in April as part of the merger with Glaxo Wellcome, is planning to launch a venture capital company that will provide funding for start-up firms in the biotech and health care sectors. Britain remains a great place for Japanese companies to invest in, according to Sir Stephen Gomersall, the diplomat whose pro-euro memo this month embarrassed the government.

Who's dafter?</p> <p>The abiding charge against John Major was that he had all the platform charisma of a tranquillised sheep - but even that cuts two ways. He made many boring speeches, but he was never booed by the Women's Institute. His loathing of spin, manifest as he carted his soapbox from hustings to hustings, was both a handicap and a strength. At least he never looked cynically calculating; at least he was believed; at least he was real.</p> <p>The epitaph is simple enough. Wrecked by the bastards, wrecked by a party which couldn't be led, wrecked by the failure to give a lead on Europe. Well, we can leave the bastards and the corruption to one side. They exist willy-nilly, whatever the time, whatever the party. But can we also acknowledge that - for any British prime minister - Europe is the very devil of an issue. Is Tony Blair making a better fist of it? He doesn't - yet - have his party on his back, merely the Daily Mail. But leading? That is a sorrier story.</p> <p>As the new millennium dawned and ministers danced in the Dome, John Major wrote a telling piece in the Spectator. They're not being candid, he said. \"Tax is going up. They deny it. Transport is in a muddle. They deny it. \"Facts\" used by ministers to argue that case are often as fictional as Marley's ghost. The \"third way\" is a political South Sea Bubble.</p> <p>Who needs memos from Philip Gould or editorials in the Mail? John Major was spot on, just as he was dead right to go on to warn Hague against his loony right. The record, in practice and in courage, holds well. What should Tony Blair be doing as the going gets rough? He could do far worse, in chastened humility, than seek to remember and learn from the forgotten years.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Mr Blair wants to frogmarch drunks to the nearest cash machine; Mr Major wanted chartered citizens to call Whitehall and get cones on clogged motorways removed. Who's dafter? The abiding charge against John Major was that he had all the platform charisma of a tranquillised sheep - but even that cuts two ways. He made many boring speeches, but he was never booed by the Women's Institute. His loathing of spin, manifest as he carted his soapbox from hustings to hustings, was both a handicap and a strength. At least he never looked cynically calculating; at least he was believed; at least he was real. The epitaph is simple enough. Wrecked by the bastards, wrecked by a party which couldn't be led, wrecked by the failure to give a lead on Europe. Well, we can leave the bastards and the corruption to one side. They exist willy-nilly, whatever the time, whatever the party. But can we also acknowledge that - for any British prime minister - Europe is the very devil of an issue. Is Tony Blair making a better fist of it? He doesn't - yet - have his party on his back, merely the Daily Mail. But leading? That is a sorrier story. As the new millennium dawned and ministers danced in the Dome, John Major wrote a telling piece in the Spectator. They're not being candid, he said. \"Tax is going up. They deny it. Transport is in a muddle. They deny it. \"Facts\" used by ministers to argue that case are often as fictional as Marley's ghost. The \"third way\" is a political South Sea Bubble. Who needs memos from Philip Gould or editorials in the Mail? John Major was spot on, just as he was dead right to go on to warn Hague against his loony right. The record, in practice and in courage, holds well. What should Tony Blair be doing as the going gets rough? He could do far worse, in chastened humility, than seek to remember and learn from the forgotten years. peter.preston@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The government is to pump an emergency \u00a3600m into the Home Office so that it can make decisions on an unprecedented 150,000 asylum cases in the next eight months. The extra injection of funds will more than double the budget of the immigration and nationality directorate overnight in an attempt to kill off asylum as a politically damaging issue in the run-up to next year's general election. In his leaked memo Tony Blair identified asylum as one of two \"touchstone issues\" on which the government was seen as being \"soft\". A Home Office spokesman confirmed that the money to finance the programme, designed to bail out the asylum system by clearing a backlog of nearly 100,000 cases by next March, is part of the Treasury's comprehensive spending review. Full details of the review, which was outlined last week by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, have yet to be announced. The \u00a3600m comes on top of the \u00a3400m a year over the next three years that was announced in the comprehensive spending review. The massive scale of the rescue operation ordered by Mr Blair and Jack Straw shows the depths of the crisis facing Britain's asylum process. A botched computerisation project and an ill-timed move of the directorate's headquarters led to one of the biggest bureaucratic breakdowns in the history of Whitehall. At one point the number of decisions taken each month fell to 800 and the backlog soared from 50,960 in February 1998 to a peak of 104,000 earlier this year. At the height of the crisis rotting case files were discovered dumped in a car park underneath the Croydon headquar ters of the immigration and nationality directorate. A Home Office spokeswoman confirmed that large-scale recruitment campaigns were already under way to hire and train the extra staff needed. It is thought that the overall number of staff is to increase from about 6,500 earlier this year to more than 11,000 over the next two years. Around 9,000 staff should be in place by next March. \"This year's budget is more than doubling. It was \u00a3590m and now it is going to be \u00a31.2bn. By March 2001 we want to clear the backlog,\" she added. \"We want to make between 130,000 and 150,000 decisions in this financial year. That covers the backlog of 90,000 cases and the number of new asylum applications we expect to get.\" She said that two new targets were being set for the asylum system. The first was to ensure that by January next year that 70% of all new asylum claims had an initial decision within two months. The second was longer term and aimed for 75% of all asylum decisions to be taken within two months. A further four months is to be allowed for appeals. It currently takes 13 months on average for an asylum case to be resolved. The immigration minister, Barbara Roche, believes that the fact that new asylum applicants have gone to the back of a very long queue has been a major factor in the rise in numbers of asylum applicants to Britain and that quicker decisions will prove an effective deterrent. As the speed of asylum decision-making is stepped up, so ministers expect the number of removals of failed asylum seekers to grow as well. An extra \u00a3100m is being made available to build three new detention centres to ensure that those who face deportation do not disappear. It is planned that the 8,000 removals carried out last year will rise to 12,000 in this financial year and reach 30,000 in 2001/2002. Although stepping up the scale of removals is thought to be popular with former Tory voters, Home Office ministers are nervous that a single controversial case could suddenly undermine public support for such a programme. Nick Hardwick, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said news of the emergency money had come as a shock but he thought it could succeed. \"The reason why they could not keep up with the backlog was because the cases are particularly complex or anything but because the files were put on shelves and left there for years and years,\" he said. \"It is procedural delays and administrative chaos they have to deal with. \"It is not outside the bounds of possibility that with such an injection of finance and staff you could clear the backlog.

Only four other golfers - Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus - have achieved the feat.

      "body": "<p>Fifteen hundred small business managers are about to find themselves at the head of a campaign to drag British staff-care into line with the rest of the world. This month, they will be the first of 100,000 companies to be questioned about their ability to bring long-term sick or injured staff back into work. And it is generally expected that they will have no imaginative answers. </p> <p>People in the UK who struggle with long-term sickness are often as good as discarded, because the mechanisms for helping them back to work are patchy. Three thousand workers every week move from long-term sick leave to incapacity benefit (effectively saying they are unfit to work), and 90% will not return to their jobs. </p> <p>It's a huge drain on the country's working population - 750,000 experienced workers are already excluded from the job market. The great irony about long-term sick leave is that the three major causes of early retirement - RSI, back pain and stress - are the ones most likely to respond to well-planned rehabilitation programmes. It's just a matter of showing the will to get them back to work. </p> <p>Now the government is finally recognising that with a little effort the skills and experience of sick workers can continue to be used. Government minister Margaret Hodge will shortly introduce four pilot projects that she hopes will bring 21,000 long-term sick back to the workforce. Their absence from work, she acknowledges, is \"a needless waste of skills and experience\". </p> <p>But the TUC believes this does not go far enough. It plans to use its millennium congress in September to call on the government to introduce a statutory duty on employers to help long-term sick staff back to work. </p> <p>Many of those who leave every year because of long-term illness are women: 10m of them suffer from back pain, 80% of whom have struggled with the condition for more than a year. For too many workers, long-term pain can prompt them to take early retirement, with little support from their bosses. But these staff would be protected, the TUC believes, if employers had a rehabilitation policy, backed by support workers in every NHS region, which would allow them to spot an employee's sickness turning long-term, and put early plans in place for support and recovery. </p> <p>\"Rehabilitation\", in the TUC's view, means any method by which people disabled by sickness or injury can be returned to work - through medical treatment, retraining, or by adapting the work environment or working patterns. </p> <p>Britain has been demonstrably behind the rest of the world in understanding this. In Sweden, a worker disabled by sickness or injury has a 50-50 chance of getting back to work - here, it's 10 to one against. </p> <p>\"In some countries, occupational rehabilitation is work-directed from a very early stage,\" says Trish Thornton, senior research fellow in social policy at the University of York. Many European employers are obliged to put rehab plans into effect as soon as an employee's illness looks like being long-term - the Swedish have to do it after eight weeks, the Dutch after 12. And once that plan is in place, the worker is protected: a Swedish employee cannot be dismissed while receiving national insurance sickness benefit, and in Germany a disabled worker returning under rehabilitation cannot be dismissed without permission from the authorities. The Americans with Disabilities Act gives similar protection in the US; in Australia, a case-manager \"buddy\" is appointed, whose first loyalty is to the returning worker, not the employer. </p> <p>Although it costs an employer to keep a disabled employee's job open, Thornton has discovered several imaginative solutions. The French have devised a subsidy which reimburses supportive employers using money collected from levies on firms that have not met their quota of disabled staff. In New Zealand, the accident compensation corporation supports the wages of the returning person. The disability services in Bavaria are thinking of paying the wages of the \"buddies\". </p> <p>By contrast, British rehabilitation schemes can founder because it is not possible to claim sickness benefit and work at the same time. But armed with evidence from around the world, the TUC expects to lay into the subject in September on the theme of \"get your rehabilitation in first\". </p> <p>\"We believe employers ought to have an action plan ready, should the worst happen,\" says a spokesperson. \"All the evidence suggests that early support maximises the chances of a successful return to work.\" For employers, who are continually hunting for skilled, experienced staff, this can only be a good thing.</p>",

The great irony about long-term sick leave is that the three major causes of early retirement - RSI, back pain and stress - are the ones most likely to respond to well-planned rehabilitation programmes. It's just a matter of showing the will to get them back to work. Now the government is finally recognising that with a little effort the skills and experience of sick workers can continue to be used. Government minister Margaret Hodge will shortly introduce four pilot projects that she hopes will bring 21,000 long-term sick back to the workforce. Their absence from work, she acknowledges, is \"a needless waste of skills and experience\". But the TUC believes this does not go far enough. It plans to use its millennium congress in September to call on the government to introduce a statutory duty on employers to help long-term sick staff back to work. Many of those who leave every year because of long-term illness are women: 10m of them suffer from back pain, 80% of whom have struggled with the condition for more than a year. For too many workers, long-term pain can prompt them to take early retirement, with little support from their bosses. But these staff would be protected, the TUC believes, if employers had a rehabilitation policy, backed by support workers in every NHS region, which would allow them to spot an employee's sickness turning long-term, and put early plans in place for support and recovery. \"Rehabilitation\", in the TUC's view, means any method by which people disabled by sickness or injury can be returned to work - through medical treatment, retraining, or by adapting the work environment or working patterns. Britain has been demonstrably behind the rest of the world in understanding this. In Sweden, a worker disabled by sickness or injury has a 50-50 chance of getting back to work - here, it's 10 to one against. \"In some countries, occupational rehabilitation is work-directed from a very early stage,\" says Trish Thornton, senior research fellow in social policy at the University of York. Many European employers are obliged to put rehab plans into effect as soon as an employee's illness looks like being long-term - the Swedish have to do it after eight weeks, the Dutch after 12. And once that plan is in place, the worker is protected: a Swedish employee cannot be dismissed while receiving national insurance sickness benefit, and in Germany a disabled worker returning under rehabilitation cannot be dismissed without permission from the authorities. The Americans with Disabilities Act gives similar protection in the US; in Australia, a case-manager \"buddy\" is appointed, whose first loyalty is to the returning worker, not the employer. Although it costs an employer to keep a disabled employee's job open, Thornton has discovered several imaginative solutions. The French have devised a subsidy which reimburses supportive employers using money collected from levies on firms that have not met their quota of disabled staff. In New Zealand, the accident compensation corporation supports the wages of the returning person. The disability services in Bavaria are thinking of paying the wages of the \"buddies\". By contrast, British rehabilitation schemes can founder because it is not possible to claim sickness benefit and work at the same time. But armed with evidence from around the world, the TUC expects to lay into the subject in September on the theme of \"get your rehabilitation in first\". \"We believe employers ought to have an action plan ready, should the worst happen,\" says a spokesperson. \"All the evidence suggests that early support maximises the chances of a successful return to work.\" For employers, who are continually hunting for skilled, experienced staff, this can only be a good thing.",

      "body": "<p>Disputes between neighbours have become the stuff of light entertainment. Like quiz shows and hospitals, joy riders and vets, rows between people who live next door to each other are deemed perfect material for prime-time television.</p> <p>But such disputes can become deadly. On Wednesday it will be exactly 10 years since Tony Alliss, a father of four, was shot dead after a long dispute with neighbours over a boundary between their land. Two men, a father and son who lived next door, were accused of his murder but were acquitted after the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence.</p> <p>The Alliss family has been left feeling doubly aggrieved. As well as losing a husband at father at the age of 40, they believe that the legal system has failed them. The true facts of the case, they say, never came out at the original trial; they feel let down by the Crown Prosecution Service and their former solicitors. They have been striving for justice as they see it for 10 years and they will not rest until justice has been done.</p> <p>Having been let down by the criminal justice system, they are now bringing a civil action on behalf of Alliss's son, Leigh, who was also shot on the night his father died. They want to prove that the killing was unlawful and they are claiming aggravated damages for the physical injury Leigh suffered, the trauma of the incident itself and subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder. But it is not money the Allisses are after. They want what they say is the truth to come out, finally, in a court of law.</p> <p>In 1980 Tony Alliss bought a cottage near the village of King's Stanley in Gloucestershire, not far from where he had grown up as a child. Beechwood Cottage was beautifully situated on the south-west-facing lower slopes of the Cotswold hills. An existing kennels business was included in the deal.</p> <p>There was just one problem: although there was access on foot to the cottage, there was no access for cars - all vehicles had to be left on the side of the road and then there was an uphill walk across a field to the house. Early on, Alliss went to see his neighbour, Terence Maule, a retired merchant seaman, to ask if he would sell him a right of way across his land. Maule refused.</p> <p>Instead, Alliss, who had a smallholding and worked with heavy plant machinery, reached an agreement with the owners of an area of woodland, Penn Wood, next to his house. He would look after the day-to-day running of the forest, and in return could have the use of a track which ran through it to his cottage.</p> <p>The arrangement worked well. Then, in 1987, Alliss heard a whisper that the wood was going to be put on the market. He was worried it could mean he would lose vehicle access to his cottage again, so with the help of a friend he raised \u00a3175,000 and in 1990 bought the wood. His right of way was once again safe.</p> <p>A different dispute with Terry Maule then flared up, this time over a boundary between Maule's property and the woodland which now belonged to Alliss. According to the Alliss family, Maule had put up a fence in the woodland, claiming a chunk of land for himself.</p> <p>After the purchase, Alliss's solicitor wrote to Maule asking him to move his fence back to the true boundary. The Alliss family says Maule ignored the request and claimed the boundary had existed since he bought his property more than 20 years earlier.</p> <p>The dispute deteriorated. Alliss took the fencing down. Maule re-erected it. Alliss took it down again. There were allegations and counter-allegations. According to Maule, Alliss threatened him and his family on several occasions and once beat him up.</p> <p>On the night of July 26 1990, Terry Maule and his 19-year-old son Graig decided to guard the fence. They each went armed with a shotgun. According to interviews read out during the aborted trial at Bristol Crown Court in 1991, the Maules came across Alliss taking down the fence. Terry Maule claimed that Alliss tried to grab the gun and there was a struggle between them, during which Graig Maule was pushed to the ground. His gun went off, hitting Alliss, who staggered down the track for about 30 yards before he collapsed and died. Terry Maule ran to call for an ambulance.</p> <p>Alliss's son, Leigh, who was 14 at the time, was walking the family's dogs on land surrounding the cottage when he heard what sounded like a loud gunshot. He says he ran to the spot where he thought the sound came from and there was another bang. A single pellet clipped him on the arm, causing a minor injury. In interviews with the police read out in court, Graig Maule said he had put his gun down, and when he picked it up again it went off accidentally.</p> <p>The Maules told police they had taken the guns into the woods in self-defence. \"I wouldn't intentionally shoot anyone,\" Graig Maule told police. \"But, you know, I shot Mr Alliss because I was just frightened of him shooting my dad, and I accidentally hit this kid, and I wouldn't do that, of course I wouldn't. I'm not some sort of monster.\"</p> <p>The Maules were jointly charged with murder but the judge directed the jury to return not-guilty verdicts. Mr Justice Schiemann told the jury: \"Having considered the evidence over the course of a week or so, I am satisfied that you could not possibly properly come to the conclusion that there was evidence here which could make you sure that there was an agreement to murder Mr Alliss - which is effectively what is charged in the first count of the indictment - or that you could be sure that Graig, when discharging that firearm, was neither acting in defence of his father nor doing it by accident, or something in between.\"</p> <p>Terence Maule was also cleared of possessing a firearm with the intention of endangering life, and both were given an absolute discharge after pleading guilty to having a shotgun without a licence.</p> <p>Mr Justice Schiemann then went on to praise the way in which Graig Maule acted \"in the circumstances\". His father, said the judge, could be \"proud of him\". The Alliss family could barely believe their ears.</p> <p>Bob Alliss, Tony's brother, did not sleep for a year after his brother died. He still doesn't sleep well. He has not worked since, and has instead devoted his life to trying to achieve what the family regard as justice. He does not believe that the gun was fired in self-defence; he hopes that the civil hearing, which is listed for January, will establish with evidence from a ballistics expert that the Maules were lying in wait for his brother and that they unlawfully killed him. The Maules' solicitor declined to comment last week.</p> <p>\"For his life to be snuffed out in the way it was and for the so-called facts of his death to be presented as they were in that court was totally beyond belief,\" says Bob Alliss. His brother, he says, was grossly misrepresented in the trial. He was portrayed as an enormous, physically powerful man of 6ft 4in weighing 18-20 stone who was always fighting. In fact, according to his brother, he was a far less intimidating 5ft 11in and 14 stone, a family man described in witness statements as conscientious, honest, generous, kind and hard-working.</p> <p>\"I've gone through life without even a parking ticket, and then to be confronted with something like this is a joke,\" says Bob Alliss. \"People say, 'You've got to get on with your life.' But that was my only brother. I thought we would, with luck, get to old age together. No one can bring back life. Once life is declared extinct, that's it. But there's a need for the truth to play some part in life as a whole.\"</p> <p>Leigh Alliss, now 24, is restless, the tragic death of his father unresolved. \"Right from primary school, you get the local copper coming in and teaching you what's right and what's wrong, then something like this happens. I can't settle until it's sorted out. It's like a millstone around your neck. I feel like I'm stuck. You can't move forward. It affects everything in your life.</p> <p>\"We want the truth out. At the end of the day I can't live with this. I will never be able to live the rest of my life until it's sorted out. If we don't get to court, it will have to be sorted another way.\" Leigh Alliss has already been convicted of assaulting Terence Maule on the fourth anniversary of his father's funeral. The Allisses and the Maules are no longer neighbours, Tony Alliss is dead, but the resentments and grievances will continue until the Alliss family get what they believe is a fair hearing.</p>",

Two men, a father and son who lived next door, were accused of his murder but were acquitted after the judge ruled there was insufficient evidence. The Alliss family has been left feeling doubly aggrieved. As well as losing a husband at father at the age of 40, they believe that the legal system has failed them. The true facts of the case, they say, never came out at the original trial; they feel let down by the Crown Prosecution Service and their former solicitors. They have been striving for justice as they see it for 10 years and they will not rest until justice has been done. Having been let down by the criminal justice system, they are now bringing a civil action on behalf of Alliss's son, Leigh, who was also shot on the night his father died. They want to prove that the killing was unlawful and they are claiming aggravated damages for the physical injury Leigh suffered, the trauma of the incident itself and subsequent post-traumatic stress disorder. But it is not money the Allisses are after. They want what they say is the truth to come out, finally, in a court of law. In 1980 Tony Alliss bought a cottage near the village of King's Stanley in Gloucestershire, not far from where he had grown up as a child. Beechwood Cottage was beautifully situated on the south-west-facing lower slopes of the Cotswold hills. An existing kennels business was included in the deal. There was just one problem: although there was access on foot to the cottage, there was no access for cars - all vehicles had to be left on the side of the road and then there was an uphill walk across a field to the house. Early on, Alliss went to see his neighbour, Terence Maule, a retired merchant seaman, to ask if he would sell him a right of way across his land. Maule refused. Instead, Alliss, who had a smallholding and worked with heavy plant machinery, reached an agreement with the owners of an area of woodland, Penn Wood, next to his house. He would look after the day-to-day running of the forest, and in return could have the use of a track which ran through it to his cottage. The arrangement worked well. Then, in 1987, Alliss heard a whisper that the wood was going to be put on the market. He was worried it could mean he would lose vehicle access to his cottage again, so with the help of a friend he raised \u00a3175,000 and in 1990 bought the wood. His right of way was once again safe. A different dispute with Terry Maule then flared up, this time over a boundary between Maule's property and the woodland which now belonged to Alliss. According to the Alliss family, Maule had put up a fence in the woodland, claiming a chunk of land for himself. After the purchase, Alliss's solicitor wrote to Maule asking him to move his fence back to the true boundary. The Alliss family says Maule ignored the request and claimed the boundary had existed since he bought his property more than 20 years earlier. The dispute deteriorated. Alliss took the fencing down. Maule re-erected it. Alliss took it down again. There were allegations and counter-allegations. According to Maule, Alliss threatened him and his family on several occasions and once beat him up. On the night of July 26 1990, Terry Maule and his 19-year-old son Graig decided to guard the fence. They each went armed with a shotgun. According to interviews read out during the aborted trial at Bristol Crown Court in 1991, the Maules came across Alliss taking down the fence. Terry Maule claimed that Alliss tried to grab the gun and there was a struggle between them, during which Graig Maule was pushed to the ground. His gun went off, hitting Alliss, who staggered down the track for about 30 yards before he collapsed and died. Terry Maule ran to call for an ambulance. Alliss's son, Leigh, who was 14 at the time, was walking the family's dogs on land surrounding the cottage when he heard what sounded like a loud gunshot. He says he ran to the spot where he thought the sound came from and there was another bang. A single pellet clipped him on the arm, causing a minor injury. In interviews with the police read out in court, Graig Maule said he had put his gun down, and when he picked it up again it went off accidentally. The Maules told police they had taken the guns into the woods in self-defence. \"I wouldn't intentionally shoot anyone,\" Graig Maule told police. \"But, you know, I shot Mr Alliss because I was just frightened of him shooting my dad, and I accidentally hit this kid, and I wouldn't do that, of course I wouldn't. I'm not some sort of monster.\" The Maules were jointly charged with murder but the judge directed the jury to return not-guilty verdicts. Mr Justice Schiemann told the jury: \"Having considered the evidence over the course of a week or so, I am satisfied that you could not possibly properly come to the conclusion that there was evidence here which could make you sure that there was an agreement to murder Mr Alliss - which is effectively what is charged in the first count of the indictment - or that you could be sure that Graig, when discharging that firearm, was neither acting in defence of his father nor doing it by accident, or something in between.\" Terence Maule was also cleared of possessing a firearm with the intention of endangering life, and both were given an absolute discharge after pleading guilty to having a shotgun without a licence. Mr Justice Schiemann then went on to praise the way in which Graig Maule acted \"in the circumstances\". His father, said the judge, could be \"proud of him\". The Alliss family could barely believe their ears. Bob Alliss, Tony's brother, did not sleep for a year after his brother died. He still doesn't sleep well. He has not worked since, and has instead devoted his life to trying to achieve what the family regard as justice. He does not believe that the gun was fired in self-defence; he hopes that the civil hearing, which is listed for January, will establish with evidence from a ballistics expert that the Maules were lying in wait for his brother and that they unlawfully killed him. The Maules' solicitor declined to comment last week. \"For his life to be snuffed out in the way it was and for the so-called facts of his death to be presented as they were in that court was totally beyond belief,\" says Bob Alliss. His brother, he says, was grossly misrepresented in the trial. He was portrayed as an enormous, physically powerful man of 6ft 4in weighing 18-20 stone who was always fighting. In fact, according to his brother, he was a far less intimidating 5ft 11in and 14 stone, a family man described in witness statements as conscientious, honest, generous, kind and hard-working. \"I've gone through life without even a parking ticket, and then to be confronted with something like this is a joke,\" says Bob Alliss. \"People say, 'You've got to get on with your life.' But that was my only brother. I thought we would, with luck, get to old age together. No one can bring back life. Once life is declared extinct, that's it. But there's a need for the truth to play some part in life as a whole.\" Leigh Alliss, now 24, is restless, the tragic death of his father unresolved. \"Right from primary school, you get the local copper coming in and teaching you what's right and what's wrong, then something like this happens. I can't settle until it's sorted out. It's like a millstone around your neck. I feel like I'm stuck. You can't move forward. It affects everything in your life. \"We want the truth out. At the end of the day I can't live with this. I will never be able to live the rest of my life until it's sorted out. If we don't get to court, it will have to be sorted another way.\" Leigh Alliss has already been convicted of assaulting Terence Maule on the fourth anniversary of his father's funeral. The Allisses and the Maules are no longer neighbours, Tony Alliss is dead, but the resentments and grievances will continue until the Alliss family get what they believe is a fair hearing.",

As PA to Alexander van der Hooft, managing director of Pink Elephant UK, a company which supplies IT staff and services, she has to fend off the queries and patter of numerous salespeople and head-hunters every day. </p> <p>\"Everyone wants to speak to Alexander, and a lot will try anything to get through to him, from saying they've spoken to him the previous day, to telling me he'll be furious if I don't put them through.\" </p> <p>Gordon balances fighting off the advances of salesmen with more conventional PA duties, but her boss's busy schedule means that she often works quite autonomously. \"I screen Alexander's post and email and his calls, and try to deal with as much as possible myself. I manage his schedule and often take on larger projects, such as organising our annual international conference or sorting out the location and catering for the staff spring ball.\" </p> <p>Gordon believes that knowing how to be assertive without being aggressive is essential to her work as a PA. \"Everything to do with Alexander comes through me,\" she says, \"and I'll often get other people from within the company ringing me to see if he is available, trying to see him as soon as possible. I have to judge when is a good time and often have to be quite firm with people.\" </p> <p>But it is external calls that cause the most problem. \"I have had people hang up on me or become rude or aggressive simply because I won't put them through to Alexander. One of the best techniques is simply to keep on repeating the same phrase - I always say he is out of the office and that I can't put them through. People do tend to get quite shirty and I think its often based on snobbery - they can't believe that a PA has the authority to deal with them. But Alexander would be furious if I put cold calls through to him so I am genuinely following his wishes.\" </p> <p>Not everyone finds dealing with pushy callers so easy. \"When I first started here, there were a couple of receptionists who were quite timid,\" says Gordon. \"I'm responsible for the support staff and I decided they should undertake some training to increase their assertiveness on the telephone. If you're young and not very experienced, it can be hard to know how to deal with people who just ring up and will happily lie to get through.\" </p> <p>Having the full backing of her boss means that Gordon is confident in her role. \"Alexander will always back me up: we present a very united front,\" she says. \"It's great to have such a supportive boss and one who respects my abilities. I feel a bit like a gatekeeper because I am constantly defending him from people who want to see him and speak to him. It does give me satisfaction to get rid of cold callers and salesmen - although they probably think I'm a bit of a Rottweiler.\"</p>",

As PA to Alexander van der Hooft, managing director of Pink Elephant UK, a company which supplies IT staff and services, she has to fend off the queries and patter of numerous salespeople and head-hunters every day. \"Everyone wants to speak to Alexander, and a lot will try anything to get through to him, from saying they've spoken to him the previous day, to telling me he'll be furious if I don't put them through.\" Gordon balances fighting off the advances of salesmen with more conventional PA duties, but her boss's busy schedule means that she often works quite autonomously. \"I screen Alexander's post and email and his calls, and try to deal with as much as possible myself. I manage his schedule and often take on larger projects, such as organising our annual international conference or sorting out the location and catering for the staff spring ball.\" Gordon believes that knowing how to be assertive without being aggressive is essential to her work as a PA. \"Everything to do with Alexander comes through me,\" she says, \"and I'll often get other people from within the company ringing me to see if he is available, trying to see him as soon as possible. I have to judge when is a good time and often have to be quite firm with people.\" But it is external calls that cause the most problem. \"I have had people hang up on me or become rude or aggressive simply because I won't put them through to Alexander. One of the best techniques is simply to keep on repeating the same phrase - I always say he is out of the office and that I can't put them through. People do tend to get quite shirty and I think its often based on snobbery - they can't believe that a PA has the authority to deal with them. But Alexander would be furious if I put cold calls through to him so I am genuinely following his wishes.\" Not everyone finds dealing with pushy callers so easy. \"When I first started here, there were a couple of receptionists who were quite timid,\" says Gordon. \"I'm responsible for the support staff and I decided they should undertake some training to increase their assertiveness on the telephone. If you're young and not very experienced, it can be hard to know how to deal with people who just ring up and will happily lie to get through.\" Having the full backing of her boss means that Gordon is confident in her role. \"Alexander will always back me up: we present a very united front,\" she says. \"It's great to have such a supportive boss and one who respects my abilities. I feel a bit like a gatekeeper because I am constantly defending him from people who want to see him and speak to him. It does give me satisfaction to get rid of cold callers and salesmen - although they probably think I'm a bit of a Rottweiler.\"",

Gone are the days when grandma and a multitude of aunts and cousins lived down the road; a culture of \"presenteeism\" means that working from dawn until dusk is now considered normal; and increasingly security-conscious parents daren't risk leaving their kids alone for a minute, let alone half an hour until the childminder turns up. </p> <p>In addition, says mother-of-two Megan Stewart, a secretary at an advertising firm in Glasgow, kids are more demanding these days. \"If you don't arrange something that involves money, they're not interested.

Local authority play-schemes can cost as little as \u00a36 a day, and provide supervised activities such as sports, but they often finish at 3pm and access can be severely limited. Full-day alternatives can cost up to \u00a360 a day and even the cheapest summer camps cost around \u00a3200 per child per week. </p> <p>Tempted to despair? There are small signs of improvement.

The company's Scottish headquarters in Edinburgh has a child development centre on-site, where children are entertained and kept out of mischief, but activities have an educational slant. The scheme is open all year, closing just for a week at Christmas. </p> <p>Carole McKellar, managing director of a business resources firm, came up with her own solution to the childcare problem. \"When I was on maternity leave with my first child in 1993, I realised there were no companies that allowed working mums time off when they needed it,\" she says. \"So I set one up.\" Every contract of employment at McKellar's firm is tailored to an individual's needs, be that term-time working, flexible working, or time off for emergencies. \"In return, I get unrivalled staff motivation and loyalty, and when I need them to work extra hours, they're more than willing.\" </p> <p>Another option is that offered by some branches of Boots, Tesco and Lloyds TSB, which work in partnership with local daycare schemes to provide available and affordable (often subsidised) places for school-age children. A spokesperson for the London borough of Hounslow, which helps set up such links, explains, \"We're just one of the councils around the country working with employers to promote childcare and build links with providers.

      "body": "<p>We Brits are renowned for our love of animals - indeed it's often said that we prefer them to people. But Americans may be in danger of becoming equally besotted. As the US economy continues to boom and skilled staff become increasingly sought after, Stateside companies are having to think imaginatively about how to attract and keep the best employees. The answer for a growing number of firms is to allow staff to bring their pets into work. </p> <p>According to a poll by human resource consultants William M Mercer, 3% of IT firms now have a policy allowing pets in the workplace. It's a small percentage, but translated to the huge internet market could represent a startling number of firms. </p> <p>Such policies, says a spokesman, are seen as \"a low-cost attraction-and-retention technique that can distinguish the employer from competitors\". They hope, in other words, that you'll accept their job offer over that of another company if you can park your pooch under the photocopier while you work. And while the consultancy firm insists it's too early to draw definite conclusions from the survey, its analysis does suggest that firms with a pets' policy have a lower rate of employee turnover than those without one. A happy pet, it seems, means a happy employee. </p> <p>So why are we so keen to take our bulldog or budgie to the office? Pet-sitting issues aside, there is evidence that animals (as long as they are domesticated) can bring benefits to the workplace. If you take your dog, for instance, into work, you will occasionally have to nip outside to take it for a walk - giving an enforced break from the computer screen and a whiff of fresh air. Some companies believe that just the presence of an animal can be soothing and reduce stress levels. </p> <p>Animals can also be tremendous ice-breakers.

      "bodyText": "We Brits are renowned for our love of animals - indeed it's often said that we prefer them to people. But Americans may be in danger of becoming equally besotted. As the US economy continues to boom and skilled staff become increasingly sought after, Stateside companies are having to think imaginatively about how to attract and keep the best employees. The answer for a growing number of firms is to allow staff to bring their pets into work. According to a poll by human resource consultants William M Mercer, 3% of IT firms now have a policy allowing pets in the workplace. It's a small percentage, but translated to the huge internet market could represent a startling number of firms. Such policies, says a spokesman, are seen as \"a low-cost attraction-and-retention technique that can distinguish the employer from competitors\". They hope, in other words, that you'll accept their job offer over that of another company if you can park your pooch under the photocopier while you work. And while the consultancy firm insists it's too early to draw definite conclusions from the survey, its analysis does suggest that firms with a pets' policy have a lower rate of employee turnover than those without one. A happy pet, it seems, means a happy employee. So why are we so keen to take our bulldog or budgie to the office? Pet-sitting issues aside, there is evidence that animals (as long as they are domesticated) can bring benefits to the workplace. If you take your dog, for instance, into work, you will occasionally have to nip outside to take it for a walk - giving an enforced break from the computer screen and a whiff of fresh air. Some companies believe that just the presence of an animal can be soothing and reduce stress levels. Animals can also be tremendous ice-breakers. Carol Osborne used to work for a large publishing company and one of the directors would often bring her black labrador to the office. \"The dog was beautiful, very gentle, and everybody adored her,\" says Osborne. \"She'd lie quietly under Jane's desk and was no trouble.

Scotland Yard is still hunting the killers of William Malcolm, 47. In February he answered a knock at the door of his east London home and was shot in the head. Malcolm had been convicted twice for attacks on a six-year-old girl and her brother. He served two years in jail for assaulting the girl, and on release, his abuse resumed. Neighbours reportedly celebrated the murder of Malcolm, who was linked to a paedophile ring including the notorious child-killer Sidney Cooke. In March a 24-year-old man was abducted by vigilantes in the Midlands. They beat and tortured him for a week. The fury unleashed by the thought of paedophiles living in communities has repeatedly led to cases of innocent people suffering. Francis Duffy, 67, was beaten and severely injured by vigilantes after being mistaken for a paedophile, Brynley Dummett, who had been named by the Manchester Evening News, the Guardian's sister newspaper. In the West Midlands, a 14-year-old girl was killed when her home was firebombed in an arson attack intended for a paedophile. Some, such as Paul Webster, could not take the pressure of false accusation.

Bleach was convicted of parachuting crates of Bulgarian weapons over the eastern Indian village of Purulia in December 1995. Indian police said the arms, including 500 AK-47 rifles, 250,000 rounds of ammunition, 12 rocket launchers and 100 anti-tank grenades, were for the Hindu cult Ananda Marga.

Volunteers, all at least a stone overweight, had the patches stuck on the back of their hands. Another group had lemon-scented patches and a control group had no patches. Within a month, the vanilla group's appetite for sweet foods and drinks, particularly chocolate, had dwindled. They also lost an average of 2.2kg, while volunteers in the lemon group lost 1.4kg, and those without a patch lost 1.1kg. Catherine Collins, chief dietician at St George's, who led the study, said: \"The most interesting thing we found was that the chocolate score was halved for people wearing the vanilla patch.\" But the patches failed to affect the volunteers' appetite for savoury snacks, alcohol or boiled sweets. Ms Collins said it was possible that the scent of vanilla had altered levels of the chemical messenger serotonin in the brain. Chocolate contains a chemical that is converted to serotonin, which is thought to play a role in appetite. A serotonin deficiency can cause depression. \"These are preliminary findings. It needs further investigation,\" said Ms Collins. The results of the trial, which involved between 50 and 55 people in each group, will be presented at the International Congress of Dietetics in Edinburgh this week. The vanilla patches are due to be launched as slimming aids this year by the Aromacology Patch Company in Ilkley, West Yorkshire.",

      "body": "<p>The summer holiday should be the highlight of a gruelling year, the chance to escape humdrum life for a week or two.</p> <p>But for an increasing number of Britons, the trip is becoming the stuff of nightmares. According to the charity Prisoners Abroad, a record number of holidaymakers have found themselves in trouble with police on their travels this year, victims of naivety, stupidity, and plain villainy.</p> <p>The organisation is dealing with the cases of 1,152 Britons languishing in foreign prisons. It is estimated that another 800 Britons are in jail but have not asked for help, and several thousand are arrested and released without consular involvement. Foreign office officials made nearly 7,000 prison visits last year.</p> <p>Most of those arrested are men - 1,127, although in the Caribbean the majority of Britons detained are women. A quarter of British prisoners in South America are women.</p> <p>Nearly all have been charged with drug offences, and many claim they became unwitting \"drugs mules\" after being tricked into holiday romances.</p> <p>\"A lot of single women go to places like Jamaica, fall in love with someone they meet, and the next thing they know, they are being arrested at the airport or in a hotel accused of drug smuggling,\" said a spokeswoman for the charity.</p> <p>\"This type of incident is more and more common. It is amazing how many women get caught up in the scam. Drug offences account for 60% of the cases we deal with, but there has been a rise in violent incidents too.</p> <p>\"We now have the highest number of clients that we have ever had, and that figure will rise through the summer as more people go on their holidays.\"</p> <p>The countries where Britons regularly get arrested are the United States, France, Spain, Germany and Australia. Thailand and Morocco are also trouble zones.</p> <p>The charity says while the number of Britons travelling off the beaten track rises every year, many backpackers suffer from \"a cultural elitism\". Britons are often guilty of not researching their trips thoroughly and not respecting local customs. Carlo Laurenzi, director of Prisoners Abroad, said: \"For example, in the Yemen there are strict rules about how you can approach women. Stopping a woman in the street to ask directions could be breaking protocols.</p> <p>\"You can't have a few drinks and then start chatting up a woman. Britons tend to think 'if we do it at home, we can do it abroad'.

      "bodyText": "The summer holiday should be the highlight of a gruelling year, the chance to escape humdrum life for a week or two. But for an increasing number of Britons, the trip is becoming the stuff of nightmares. According to the charity Prisoners Abroad, a record number of holidaymakers have found themselves in trouble with police on their travels this year, victims of naivety, stupidity, and plain villainy. The organisation is dealing with the cases of 1,152 Britons languishing in foreign prisons. It is estimated that another 800 Britons are in jail but have not asked for help, and several thousand are arrested and released without consular involvement. Foreign office officials made nearly 7,000 prison visits last year. Most of those arrested are men - 1,127, although in the Caribbean the majority of Britons detained are women. A quarter of British prisoners in South America are women. Nearly all have been charged with drug offences, and many claim they became unwitting \"drugs mules\" after being tricked into holiday romances. \"A lot of single women go to places like Jamaica, fall in love with someone they meet, and the next thing they know, they are being arrested at the airport or in a hotel accused of drug smuggling,\" said a spokeswoman for the charity. \"This type of incident is more and more common. It is amazing how many women get caught up in the scam. Drug offences account for 60% of the cases we deal with, but there has been a rise in violent incidents too. \"We now have the highest number of clients that we have ever had, and that figure will rise through the summer as more people go on their holidays.\" The countries where Britons regularly get arrested are the United States, France, Spain, Germany and Australia. Thailand and Morocco are also trouble zones. The charity says while the number of Britons travelling off the beaten track rises every year, many backpackers suffer from \"a cultural elitism\". Britons are often guilty of not researching their trips thoroughly and not respecting local customs. Carlo Laurenzi, director of Prisoners Abroad, said: \"For example, in the Yemen there are strict rules about how you can approach women. Stopping a woman in the street to ask directions could be breaking protocols. \"You can't have a few drinks and then start chatting up a woman. Britons tend to think 'if we do it at home, we can do it abroad'. It gets them into all kinds of difficult positions.\" Britons also tend to be ignorant of the severity of local laws. In India, there is a mandatory 10-year prison sentence for anyone caught with more than 10 grams of cannabis. The death sentence is automatic in Thailand for drug trafficking. In Spain, anyone caught with cocaine can expect between nine and 14 years in jail. In Nepal, if your visa runs out, it is punished by a \u00a32,600 fine or 10 years in jail. Photographing shrines, temples and other places of worship is allowed in Sri Lanka with prior permission, but posing with religious statues is not . A key piece of advice for travellers who find themselves in trouble is - don't argue with the police. \"Saying you didn't realise it was illegal is no excuse,\" a charity spokeswoman said. \"It is surprising how many people say 'if only'.\" There are more than 20 countries on the Foreign Office \"don't visit at any cost\" list. It advises travellers to look at the department's website, at www.fco.gov.uk/travel. Women at risk Rachel McGee is serving a 15-year sentence in the Occident women's prison near Havana, Cuba, for drug trafficking. In October 1998 she was invited by her new boyfriend to join him on a three-week trip to Cuba. During the holiday, friends of the man were arrested and charged with attempting to smuggle 15kg of cocaine. Ms McGee, 24, was not given a separate trial, even though the co-defendants said she had nothing to do with the crime.

Both here and in other leading houses round the world, he was particularly noted for performances of Verdi.</p> <p>Quilico made his debut at Covent Garden in 1959-60, as Amonasro and Germont, and immediately impressed with his strong, forthright interpretations. He sang Demetrius in the first London performances of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream at Covent Garden, in 1961. The same year, his Amonasro, in a revival of Aida, was a virile, impassioned interpretation, praised as \"excitingly sung and acted\", and he was admired as Sharpless, in Madama Butterfly. That season he also sang Thoas, in Gluck's Iphig\u00e9nie En Tauride, a role he recorded at about the same time. He was the very epitome of the crazed, vengeful King of Scythia.</p> <p>The following year his Rigoletto combined fatherly concern with the rage of the frustrated jester to the Duke of Mantua. In other words, his firm tone was tempered by a fine sense of Verdian style. Rigoletto became his calling-card throughout the operatic world; by the end of his career he had performed the part more than 500 times. Also in 1962, at Covent Garden, he sang Father Germont to Sutherland's first Violetta, in La Traviata, when the revered critic of this newspaper, Philip Hope-Wallace, wrote that Quilico afforded \"the rarest of operatic joys, the sense of security of a voice firmly and roundly based\". That was also my experience at the time.</p> <p>Why Quilico was not immediately engaged by the then resident company at Covent Garden on a permanent basis is unclear, but it may have been because of the presence of another Australian of the same generation with the company. At any rate, Quilico went off to other pastures. Eventually, he returned, in 1975, to sing Germont, once again to Sutherland's Violetta in La Traviata. His saturnine voice and imposing presence were always an asset in other Verdian parts, such as the Count of Luna (Trovatore), Posa (Don Carlos), Iago and Falstaff.</p> <p>Quilico was born in Montreal, where his father owned the city's first bicycle shop. He studied at the Montreal Conservatoire, the Santa Cecilia Academy in Rome and the Mannes School in New York, before making his debut with the Opera Guild of Montreal. He first appeared with the New York City Opera Company in 1953, as Germont in La Traviata.</p> <p>He did not sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York until 1972, when he made a great impression as Golaud in Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande. From then on he appeared regularly with the company. He was also in demand at the Vienna State Opera, the Paris Op\u00e9ra, the Bolshoi in Moscow, the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires and throughout Italy. In his homeland, he was long a principal with the Canadian Opera Company and the Opera de Qu\u00e9bec.</p> <p>Quilico was not a subtle artist, but was always a figure to watch on stage because he had a strong sense of what would make an impression on an audience. His commitment to his roles was never in question.</p> <p>His son, Gino, followed him on to the stage, also as a baritone, but with a lighter voice than his father's. In 1988, in Canada, Gino sang Ford to his father's Falstaff, a jovial, unexaggerated portrayal, and in 1987 they performed together at the Metropolitan.

He also produced two key bibliographical works: Index Sinicus (1964) and Western Books On China Published Up To 1850 (1987). These are essential research tools, which bear his characteristic signature in their highly original subject indices and descriptions. His other works included a translation of an early 20th-century political tract, Zou Rong's Revolutionary Army, an important background document to SunYat Sen's 1911 revolution. John was brought up in a conventional Jewish family in Islington, north London.

This Thursday some of the best cricketers ever to cross a boundary rope, including Ian Botham and Sir Vivian Richards, will gather to play a match in memory of the peerless West Indian fast bowler Malcolm Marshall, who died of cancer in November last year. But as the game's greats prepare to emerge from retirement, a row over Marshall's estate threatens to overshadow the match. The proceeds of the match, which could be as much as \u00a3100,000, will go to the Mali Marshall Trust, a fund set up in the name of Marshall's seven-year-old son by his widow, Connie. Marshall, however, had two other children by different women, and the mother of Benjamin Parker-Marshall, 8, is demanding that her son be recognised as a rightful beneficiary of the match proceeds and Marshall's estate. Elizabeth Adegboyaga, a care worker who had a 10-year relationship with Marshall from 1987, was last week granted emergency legal aid to make an application for maintenance out of the estate in Barbados, Marshall's home, and the UK. While Mali and Marshall's daughter Shelley, born to a third woman, are both beneficiaries of his will, there is no provision for Benjamin. \"All I want is the best for my son, what Benjamin deserves,\" said Mrs Adegboyaga.\"I need to make sure he is financially secure, and I feel that as far as this match is concerned, Benjamin and Malcolm's daughter Shelley should be treated the same as Mali, and receive an equal share. The match has been organised by the Professional Cricketers' Association (PCA), White Sports Management (WSM) and the Bunbury Cricket Club, a charity side run by cricket enthusiast David English, which has raised \u00a315m for charity to date. Mr English said he did not know of Benjamin's existence when he decided to arrange the match. \"When Macca [Marshall] passed away, I wanted to get some finance into the family and remember a wonderful man and a great cricketer. I think it's probably up to Connie to sit down and see if she wants to make a donation to Benjamin.\" Advance ticket sales to corporate customers and the public have already brought in \u00a377,500, and more money will be raised on the day. Marshall, who was West Indies coach when he was struck down by cancer midway through the cricket World Cup last summer, married Connie six weeks before his death on November 4th. The couple had begun a relationship in the mid 1980s and Mali was born in 1993. In his will, amended eight days before he died, Marshall left his estate, worth 1,150,453 Barbadian dollars, to Connie, and bequeathed $100,000 and a life insurance policy to his daughter Shelley. Although there is no provision for Benjamin in the will, Marshall did pay \u00a3350 a month in maintenance to him under a court order until his death. Lawyers acting for Connie Marshall offered Mrs Adegboyaga a lump sum of \u00a330,000 which she did not think sufficient. That sum is equal to the proceeds of the sale of a house Marshall owned in Hampshire.",

The housing corporation, which hands out \u00a3660m a year to 2,200 housing associations, is condemned by the national audit office for failing to tackle a scandal inside Focus Housing Association - one of the biggest providers of homes for the poor in the west midlands. When the serious fraud office was finally called in, three people were charged and later jailed for between nine and 18 months for a bribery and corruption ring that involved a property dealer, Darshan Ram, and two housing association development staff, John Hartshorn and Keith Hinson. The scandal involved bribes worth \u00a322,000 being paid to the two Focus staff members by the property developer to \"oil the wheels\" of the purchase of nearly 50 overvalued homes.

The national audit office, which sought to investigate the housing corporation's failure to check the accounts, was blocked from access for six months by officials who feared they could be blamed for incompetence. Details of the scandal are published on the day Andrew Smith, chief secretary to the Treasury, proposes to reverse a Lords defeat which would allow Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, instant access to the accounts of housing associations and other large quangos.

Lucid until the end, his last article was published in the newspaper Jornal do Brasil the day he died.</p> <p>Lima was born only five years after slavery had been abolished in Brazil. It was four years since the abdication of the emperor and the proclamation of the republic. The Brazilian 20th century was one where oligarchic presidents gave way to revolutions, civil war, populism, military dictatorship and democracy. Lima played an active part in many of these episodes and, as his country entered the new millennium, he was still writing furious articles, criticising its \"government of pigmies\" for supporting privatisation, globalisation and the demands of the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>The son of a traditional family in the northeast state of Pernambuco, Lima began his career at 15, on the newspaper A Provincia, in his hometown of Recife. In 1926, he became the youngest ever president of the Brazilian Press Association (he died the oldest).</p> <p>He was initially a supporter of Getulio Vargas, who overthrew the oligarchies of Brazil's various states in 1930 to become president and then dictator. In 1938, Lima was made president of the Sugar And Alcohol Institute, where he took steps to improve the social conditions of the workers and encouraged the first successful experiments in the use of gasohol, a fuel mixture of alcohol and petrol.</p> <p>Between 1935 and 1964, he was active in party politics, and in 1948 was elected governor of Pernambuco. He also became a federal congressman for the state, although he lived most of the time in the then capital, Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>A fierce opponent of the generals who seized power in 1964, Lima - then aged 76 - stood for vice-president in the 1973 campaign of the opposition leader Ulisses Guimaraes. They knew their campaign did not stand a chance against the repression and censorship of the military, who had already chosen their next presidential general.</p> <p>When asked why he took part in a lost cause, Lima said that if anyone could prove to him that inertia was better than protest, he would give up. For him, it was important to show that the will for democracy existed, and that one day the military regime would end.</p> <p>In 1992, at the age of 95, he headed the signatures on the petition requesting the impeachment for corruption of President Fernando Collor, and was one of those who delivered it to the national congress. For many, Lima had become \"the moral reserve of the nation\", a man whose lifelong defence of democracy, press freedom and Brazil's interests was matched by his personal probity and honesty. He lived so long he seemed eternal.</p> <p>Lima was married for 67 years to Maria Jose, aged 92, who survives him, together with three children, seven grandchildren and four great grandchildren.</p> <p>\u0095 Alexandre Jose Barbosa Lima Sobrinho, journalist, born January 22 1897; died July 16 2000</p>",

Lima played an active part in many of these episodes and, as his country entered the new millennium, he was still writing furious articles, criticising its \"government of pigmies\" for supporting privatisation, globalisation and the demands of the International Monetary Fund. The son of a traditional family in the northeast state of Pernambuco, Lima began his career at 15, on the newspaper A Provincia, in his hometown of Recife. In 1926, he became the youngest ever president of the Brazilian Press Association (he died the oldest). He was initially a supporter of Getulio Vargas, who overthrew the oligarchies of Brazil's various states in 1930 to become president and then dictator. In 1938, Lima was made president of the Sugar And Alcohol Institute, where he took steps to improve the social conditions of the workers and encouraged the first successful experiments in the use of gasohol, a fuel mixture of alcohol and petrol. Between 1935 and 1964, he was active in party politics, and in 1948 was elected governor of Pernambuco. He also became a federal congressman for the state, although he lived most of the time in the then capital, Rio de Janeiro. A fierce opponent of the generals who seized power in 1964, Lima - then aged 76 - stood for vice-president in the 1973 campaign of the opposition leader Ulisses Guimaraes. They knew their campaign did not stand a chance against the repression and censorship of the military, who had already chosen their next presidential general. When asked why he took part in a lost cause, Lima said that if anyone could prove to him that inertia was better than protest, he would give up. For him, it was important to show that the will for democracy existed, and that one day the military regime would end. In 1992, at the age of 95, he headed the signatures on the petition requesting the impeachment for corruption of President Fernando Collor, and was one of those who delivered it to the national congress. For many, Lima had become \"the moral reserve of the nation\", a man whose lifelong defence of democracy, press freedom and Brazil's interests was matched by his personal probity and honesty. He lived so long he seemed eternal. Lima was married for 67 years to Maria Jose, aged 92, who survives him, together with three children, seven grandchildren and four great grandchildren. \u0095 Alexandre Jose Barbosa Lima Sobrinho, journalist, born January 22 1897; died July 16 2000",

His choice will show how big a man he is, as they like to say in Texas. Is he big enough to take on his right wing?</p> <p>He has two ways he can do that. One is to name Tom Ridge, governor of Pennsylvania. Ridge is a Vietnam war medallist and a Catholic, and he and GW are friends.

It is the state of the NHS which has the potential to warm chilled hearts to New Labour. It is the one issue over which the British public never lost faith; throughout the darkest Kinnock days, they always believed that Labour, whatever else it could or couldn't do, would do right by the NHS. </p> <p>Nothing more damages New Labour now than the ebbing of that faith. Has Milburn managed to devise a scheme to deliver tangible improvement by the next election? That is the kind of political challenge which makes fighting a war in Kosovo look easy. </p> <p>Suspicion about how this crushing political imperative will distort the national plan (which is dangerously being spun as the most radical overhaul of the NHS since Bevan) seems to be part of what lies behind healthworkers' strangely muted response to Gordon Brown's largesse last week. One would have expected more euphoria from an organisation which has suffered from chronic underfunding for two decades. Instead, there seems to be pervasive anxiety about the many strings attached to the extra billions, and more pessimism than ever about the chances of marrying the founding ideals of the NHS (free, equal healthcare) to higher standards of delivery. Morale is bumping along at rock bottom. </p> <p>Some of this Mr Milburn may dismiss as the neuroses of professionals, particularly doctors, fearful of losing their fiefdoms (the widely heralded onslaught on the consultant-is-king culture) and fearful accountability in careers built on a paternalism veering between the benign and the arrogant. But there are wider anxieties where, worryingly, Milburn appears to have got the wrong end of the stick. </p> <p>In many of the carefully placed leaks at the weekend, patients are referred to as consumers and the NHS as a \"modern service-sector industry\". The language is absurdly inappropriate. Healing cannot be industrialised. The central shibboleth of consumerism is choice; when you're ill, you don't have the strength to make complicated choices. You want a relationship of trust and mutual respect in which someone very experienced and knowledgeable helps to make you better. When I was in the agonies of childbirth, the important issue was not whether they were offering me the full range of pain relief (the excellent midwife quite rightly said no to my request for an epidural, and a few minutes later I delivered the baby) but the quality of my relationship with the midwife. </p> <p>This is not new to thousands of health workers (particularly women) who understand that the quality of relationship underpins healing. Nor is it new to the NHS patients who can gratefully recount how in their moment of vulnerability and fear, a harassed, tired nurse, doctor or ancillary found the time and generosity to attend to them as people, not just throughput statistics. </p> <p>It is those millions of acts of human kindness which are so often taken for granted or ignored while the focus is on fancy machines and ground-breaking operations. This tradition of generosity and goodwill has been dangerously corroded by Tory and now Labour's application of private-sector concepts which no doubt make sense when selling insurance policies or double glazing but when applied to healthcare, dehumanise both healer and patient. </p> <p>This is most apparent when Mr Milburn repeats his mantra that the patient must come first. A wholly admirable ideal is in danger of going adrift here. Most accept there has been a lack of accountability in the NHS: unchecked rogue doctors such as Richard Neale and Rodney Ledward are only the most egregious cases. The balance of power between patient and doctor needs to shift. </p> <p>But the idea that one or other must come first, and that their interests are in conflict isn't helpful. The job satisfaction of nurses or doctors is not in opposition to the patients but usually coincides with their interests: they want to heal you, you want to be healed. Another Milburn mantra is that the NHS must be consumer-led. But a consumer-rights culture is corrosive in healthcare; you burden staff with mounds of paperwork and bureaucracy in complaints procedures, and it costs billions to settle medical negligence cases. </p> <p>More disturbingly, many doctors justifiably suspect that the government is using what it sees as a fortuitous string of doctor scandals for its own ends. The fear is that, like the Tories, the government is undermining the power of the professionals, purportedly to empower patients, but in fact to strengthen its own centralising power. </p> <p>The oddest tendency of government policy throughout the public sector is centralisation. There's a common management blueprint being applied to teachers and police as much as healthworkers, and it is simply carrying on where the Tories left off. First, set targets; second, monitor and evaluate progress (which generates huge quantities of paperwork and bureaucracy); third, reward achievement of targets, or punish failure. What teachers, policemen and doctors hate about this is most obviously the bureaucracy, but also a) the restrictions on their autonomy, b) the implied lack of trust in which big brother at the centre has to keep looking over your shoulder to see whether you're doing your job and c) the blaming when targets are not matched. </p> <p>This theory went out of fashion in the private sector about a decade ago. Big corporations realised the heavy-handed carrot and stick approach created a culture of compliance. As Stalin and Mao Zedong discovered, this breeds a myriad of ingenious ways to cook the books. Teachers drill their pupils in Sats, doctors fiddle about with waiting lists, all so the politicians can flourish their triumphs. Companies realised in the 90s that management structures had to be flat and decentralised. What motivated people was autonomy. The management gurus sounded like 60s radicals when they talked about empowerment. It's the shape of many new dot.com companies, and it is arguably more important than the dream of stock options (which look wobbly now anyway) in attracting so much young talent. </p> <p>Already, plenty of posts can't be filled in the NHS, and as demographics make the labour market more competitive, this will get worse. Mr Milburn's plans depend on recruiting more highly motivated, dedicated staff. But it isn't just more money which will attract them - it is a rewarding job instead of the stress experienced by many in recent decades of failing to do the impossible. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto: madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "A new picture showing how Ben Needham, who went missing as a toddler, could look now is posted on a website today, the ninth anniversary of his disappearance from a Greek island. Ben, his mother and grandparents had moved from Sheffield to Kos, and he was last seen on July 24 1991 near the farmhouse which the family was renovating. No trace of him has been found since, despite a big publicity campaign. The computer-generated image has been produced using an American technique adopted for the first time by British police to help trace a missing person. It shows Ben as a smiling 10-year-old with blue eyes and blond hair cut in a fringe. It resembles a family snapshot. The picture has been posted on the UK Missing and Exploited Children web site, set up in March by police forces around the country. It is hosted by the computer company Computer Associates, and has the support of several charities. South Yorkshire police spokesman Jim Greensmith said: \"We are hoping this image might just throw up new information which will help our inquiry..\" The website can be found at www.missingkids.co.uk.",

Far-right organisations such as the National Alliance, the Liberty Lobby and League of the South, and American fans of the British National party have pledged Mr Buchanan their support at rallies and on websites. They have also held fundraising events and collected petitions for the \"gopatgo2000\" campaign, according to the Washington Post. Mr Buchanan is a practising Roman Catholic who frequently denounces homosexuals and the \"Israel lobby\". He is widely expected to beat John Hagelin, a little-known physicist, for the Reform party nomination at next month's party convention. But evidence of far-right support for Mr Buchanan is likely to worry members of the Reform party, an umbrella organisation which has largely eschewed involvement in social policy debates in order to focus on campaign-finance reform and free-trade issues. Mr Buchanan, who tried to win the Republican presidential nomination in 1992 and 1996, has already clashed with Reform party members over his stand on many social issues. He has insisted that he is neither racist nor anti-semitic. But his attacks on third-world immigration, and talk on his website of restoring \"traditional American values\" have attracted extremist support. An editorial in a newsletter of the American Friends of the British National party said that a Buchanan-led nationalist party was the closest thing America had to the BNP. \"Our type of people - nationalists - have been joining the Reform party all across America and this is going to almost guarantee that Buchanan will be its candidate in November,\" it said. \"The Reform party could soon become an American nationalist party in all but name.\" Buchanan supporters are reported to have solicited petition signatures at \"white rights\" meetings. Will Williams, a leader of the National Alliance movement, wrote in an email to a US reporter that he was \"interested in the Reform party becoming the party of the white\". Mr Williams, who has become active in the North Carolina branch of the Reform party, had rallied his alliance supporters in an earlier email, saying: \"It's our job to get out there in our areas, to raise consciousness, attract and radicalise 'those very people' - OUR people - then organise them into a majority. \"Many good people will have joined a much more radicalised, white-friendly Reform party come November...

And if any member of any such group has gravitated to our campaign, it was without our knowledge, or consent. \"But if they have, they probably did so because they came to believe the malicious lies about my brother spread by such institutions as the Washington Post.\" The Post had reported that Mr Buchanan was supported by Don Wassell, campaign manager for David Duke's far-right presidential bid in 1988 and head of the American Nationalist Union. Mr Wassell wrote in the Nationalist Times: \"It's now or never for rank-and-file conservatives to prove they are patriotic Americans first, and party supporters second. \"Pat Buchanan has methodically and effectively... taken over the Reform party with the intention of making it into a genuine America First alternative to the two-party tyranny.\"",

It is about three miles across and orbits the planet, the biggest in the solar system, at a distance of 15m miles and takes two earth years to make one round trip.",

The G8 endorsed the need for sustainable forest management when they pledged in a final communiqu\u00e9: \"We will examine how best we can combat illegal logging, including export and procurement practices.\" Environmentalists welcomed the fresh impetus for the campaign to conserve the world's ancient forests, being depleted at the rate of one football pitch every two seconds. The G8 consume 74% of the world's forestry product exports, but they have been criticised for paying too little attention to where their timber comes from. In Brazil, the government says illegal logging operations account for 80% of the trees chopped down in the Amazon rainforest. But loose regulations and poor oversight make it almost impossible to assess whether a log has been obtained from a sustainable source or from ecologically precious forests. Under a British initiative, the governments of the G8 agreed yesterday to set an example by considering ways to ensure that public purchases of timber come from approved businesses, such as those certified by the Forestry Stewardship Council. By also promising to look into export practices, the G8 took a step further on the logging issue than in previous summits. However, Canada, the main timber exporter among the group, and Japan, the main importer, remain reluctant to establish a new system of rules. Conservationists welcomed the G8 move, but they said the words would have to be backed up by actions if they were not to suffer the fate of initiatives made at the Birmingham summit two years ago, which have made little progress. \"This is a welcome shift of direction,\" said Martin Kaizer of Greenpeace. \"We are very happy that procurement practices have been mentioned, but now we must watch carefully to ensure that this plan is implemented.\" During the summit, four Greenpeace activists were arrested and the group's ship - the Rainbow Warrior - was raided by riot police after they tried to deliver eight logs to the G8 leaders.",

As long as wing development in the UK is profitable there's no need to change anything.\" </p> <p>Andreas Sperl, AIC's chief financial officer, pointed out that if AIC took away BAE's agreed workshare on wings and built them elsewhere in the group - probably in Hamburg - it would spell the end of the partnership. </p> <p>But the Eads executives made clear their determination to run AIC against BAE's assertion it is a stand-alone company. BAE gave up several key veto rights under the deal to set up Airbus as a fully-fledged plc but the UK company can still block the business plan, any new partners (such as Italy's Alenia) and any change of name. </p> <p>BAE, which has the right to exit AIC after three years, has said its share of AIC's pro forma operating profits in 1999 of \u20ac1.033bn would have been \u20ac207m for its 20% stake. It expects bigger earnings from the plans to save \u20ac350m from Airbus annual costs by 2004. </p> <p>Airbus, which aims to capture at least 50% of the global market for bigger jetliners and shove Boeing into second place after decades as world leader, is to announce at Farnborough firm orders for its planned superjumbo from Emirates, the Middle East airline, and possibly Singapore International Airlines in deals worth up to \u00a33.9bn. Emirates is set to take 10 A3XXs and SIA a further 10, with six options. </p> <p>Dr Sperl, confirming that AIC has so far 50 orders and 20 options for the A3XX, said Airbus needed to sell 230 to make the two-tier superjumbo profitable and expects to sell 780 by 2021. The first flight is due in 2004 and it enters service in October 2005. </p> <p>The $10.7bn development cost, he said, covers four versions of the A3XX, including a 656-seater and a freighter. Governments will give a third of the cost in repayable launch aid, with a further 20% coming from \"risk-sharing\" partners such as Saab and around $1bn from suppliers. The two AIC partners will contribute around 40% while Boeing is thought ready to spend up to $5bn on its stretched jumbo, the 747X. </p> <p>Adolfo Revuelta, Eads programme chief, said the A400M would enter service at the end of March next year. Orders for 220 versions of the European rival to Boeing's C17 and Lockheed Martin's C130J are due to be confirmed this week from seven governments.1919</p>",

Emirates is set to take 10 A3XXs and SIA a further 10, with six options. Dr Sperl, confirming that AIC has so far 50 orders and 20 options for the A3XX, said Airbus needed to sell 230 to make the two-tier superjumbo profitable and expects to sell 780 by 2021. The first flight is due in 2004 and it enters service in October 2005. The $10.7bn development cost, he said, covers four versions of the A3XX, including a 656-seater and a freighter. Governments will give a third of the cost in repayable launch aid, with a further 20% coming from \"risk-sharing\" partners such as Saab and around $1bn from suppliers. The two AIC partners will contribute around 40% while Boeing is thought ready to spend up to $5bn on its stretched jumbo, the 747X. Adolfo Revuelta, Eads programme chief, said the A400M would enter service at the end of March next year. Orders for 220 versions of the European rival to Boeing's C17 and Lockheed Martin's C130J are due to be confirmed this week from seven governments.1919",

After centuries of neglect, the battlefield where Robert the Bruce vanquished the army of Edward II in 1314 is under threat from encroaching industrial and housing estates on land where Scotland fought for its freedom. A 20-year structure plan approved by local councils has identified parts of the site to the east of Stirling for large scale commercial and residential expansion. There is no legislation protecting battle sites in Scotland, and while the exact parameters of Bannockburn have never been agreed, it is generally accepted that parts have already been developed.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>So you thought television had degenerated into peeling wallpaper for the comatose viewer? Then you will have adored <strong> When Will I Be Famous? </strong> (C4, Sat), in which John Dower captured a year in the life of Ashley Revell, TV wideboy and Chingford man. </p> <p>Revell's new brainchild is Flash TV, an online library of aspiring TV presenters, who hope TV companies will log on and check out their digitised video showreel. Smart idea, and one which has attracted substantial financial backing, but the interesting part was tracing the sleazy trajectory of Revell's career. Ashley is 21st Century Media personified, having kicked off his career with a stint as the News Bunny on the cretinous cable channel L!ve TV, then wallowed in notoriety as the man who supplied fake chat-show guests for Vanessa Feltz and Trisha. Ashley couldn't see anything wrong with what he'd done. \"Getting rid of Vanessa Feltz - that's worth a bloody OBE, isn't it?\" he queried. Good point, actually. </p> <p>Revell revels in the shoddy allure of television, and he had thousands of na\u00efve young hopefuls queueing round the block for auditions to join the Flash TV roster. The clips of their efforts were hilarious and squirm-inducing, and Revell's sales spiel about the wonderful service he provides for only 80 quid per successful applicant was a jewel of barrow-boy speak. Dower's hesitant but persistent interviewing and dogged pursuit of his quarry, all accomplished with a single lightweight digital camera, is the shape of TV to come. Tragic but true. </p> <p>For a programme intended to enlist support for endangered farmers in north Yorkshire, <strong> Dying Breed </strong> (C4, Sun) couldn't have started more disastrously. A farmer was seen shooting calves through the head, since they were male and had no market value. As the corpses lay twitching in front of him, he explained: \"That's the economics of farming today, I'm afraid. If these do-gooders want to come round, they can have these calves for nothing.\" There could have been no more vivid illustration of the cultural divide between town and country. Country folk are always complaining that we townies have no conception of life on the land, and mercifully they're right. This was like a trip back to the era of the Bront\u00eb sisters, when people spoke in picturesque local dialects and worked the land with primitive tools that were little changed since the War of the Roses. </p> <p>None the less, the farmers had legitimate axes to grind. Hill farmers, who were already subsisting on pitiful incomes, have seen the prices of their sheep plummeting to a catastrophic \u00a32.50 per animal. Pig farmers are infuriated that pig-meat from animals reared on European farms in conditions which would be illegal in the UK is sold over here at prices which undercut their own. Unfortunately, the farmers are unskilled in the black art of spin. When they staged a demonstration of Euro-style battery farming outside a supermarket, the shriekings of their terrified pig horrified passers-by, who angrily declared that this was no way to win public backing. There was more woe in store for the embattled government. The furious farmers want the head of agriculture minister Nick Brown, and while his shifty non-appearance in this film will have delighted the Tories, it was of no help to the pork-rearing community. </p> <p> <strong> Hollywood AD </strong> (The X Files, Sky One, Sun) was written and directed by David \"Mulder\" Duchovny, and in place of the bleak menace of yesteryear there was campness, irony and facetious Tinseltown in-jokes. The plot featured a man convinced he was Christ being murdered by America's most distinguished cardinal, with Duchovny showing his baby-boomer roots in jokes about The Beatles and the 60s counter-culture. Still, all of this was incidental to the core of the piece, the shooting of a fictional X Files movie featuring characters \"loosely based on\" Mulder and Scully. While Scully was portrayed by flyweight comedienne Tea Leoni, Mulder was farcically impersonated by Garry Shandling, the latter being thwarted in his lascivious designs on Scully by the fact that she was in love with FBI assistant director Skinner. Spoof is stranger than fiction.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So you thought television had degenerated into peeling wallpaper for the comatose viewer? Then you will have adored When Will I Be Famous? (C4, Sat), in which John Dower captured a year in the life of Ashley Revell, TV wideboy and Chingford man. Revell's new brainchild is Flash TV, an online library of aspiring TV presenters, who hope TV companies will log on and check out their digitised video showreel. Smart idea, and one which has attracted substantial financial backing, but the interesting part was tracing the sleazy trajectory of Revell's career. Ashley is 21st Century Media personified, having kicked off his career with a stint as the News Bunny on the cretinous cable channel L!ve TV, then wallowed in notoriety as the man who supplied fake chat-show guests for Vanessa Feltz and Trisha. Ashley couldn't see anything wrong with what he'd done. \"Getting rid of Vanessa Feltz - that's worth a bloody OBE, isn't it?\" he queried. Good point, actually. Revell revels in the shoddy allure of television, and he had thousands of na\u00efve young hopefuls queueing round the block for auditions to join the Flash TV roster. The clips of their efforts were hilarious and squirm-inducing, and Revell's sales spiel about the wonderful service he provides for only 80 quid per successful applicant was a jewel of barrow-boy speak. Dower's hesitant but persistent interviewing and dogged pursuit of his quarry, all accomplished with a single lightweight digital camera, is the shape of TV to come. Tragic but true. For a programme intended to enlist support for endangered farmers in north Yorkshire, Dying Breed (C4, Sun) couldn't have started more disastrously. A farmer was seen shooting calves through the head, since they were male and had no market value. As the corpses lay twitching in front of him, he explained: \"That's the economics of farming today, I'm afraid. If these do-gooders want to come round, they can have these calves for nothing.\" There could have been no more vivid illustration of the cultural divide between town and country. Country folk are always complaining that we townies have no conception of life on the land, and mercifully they're right. This was like a trip back to the era of the Bront\u00eb sisters, when people spoke in picturesque local dialects and worked the land with primitive tools that were little changed since the War of the Roses. None the less, the farmers had legitimate axes to grind. Hill farmers, who were already subsisting on pitiful incomes, have seen the prices of their sheep plummeting to a catastrophic \u00a32.50 per animal. Pig farmers are infuriated that pig-meat from animals reared on European farms in conditions which would be illegal in the UK is sold over here at prices which undercut their own. Unfortunately, the farmers are unskilled in the black art of spin. When they staged a demonstration of Euro-style battery farming outside a supermarket, the shriekings of their terrified pig horrified passers-by, who angrily declared that this was no way to win public backing. There was more woe in store for the embattled government. The furious farmers want the head of agriculture minister Nick Brown, and while his shifty non-appearance in this film will have delighted the Tories, it was of no help to the pork-rearing community. Hollywood AD (The X Files, Sky One, Sun) was written and directed by David \"Mulder\" Duchovny, and in place of the bleak menace of yesteryear there was campness, irony and facetious Tinseltown in-jokes. The plot featured a man convinced he was Christ being murdered by America's most distinguished cardinal, with Duchovny showing his baby-boomer roots in jokes about The Beatles and the 60s counter-culture. Still, all of this was incidental to the core of the piece, the shooting of a fictional X Files movie featuring characters \"loosely based on\" Mulder and Scully. While Scully was portrayed by flyweight comedienne Tea Leoni, Mulder was farcically impersonated by Garry Shandling, the latter being thwarted in his lascivious designs on Scully by the fact that she was in love with FBI assistant director Skinner. Spoof is stranger than fiction.",

The black majorities on the city councils, mostly controlled by the African National Congress, are taking the opportunity offered by the new authorities, which will be elected in November, to scrap names with colonial origins. Pretoria is to become part of a \"megacity\" called Tshwane - Sotho for \"We are the same\" - which will also include large townships such as Mamelodi and Atteridgeville. Former president Nelson Mandela has given his approval to the creation of Nelson Mandela Metropole, which will suck in the southern city of Port Elizabeth, called after the wife of a former British colonial governor who never set foot in South Africa. Further up the Indian ocean coast Durban, named in honour of a colonial governor, Sir Benjamin D'urban, has run a public competition in search of a new name. Among the favoured proposals is adopting the Zulu word iThekweni, loosely meaning \"place of the bay\". Cape Town has decided to keep its name, because it is internationally recognised. One of the hottest debates is on what to call the megacity that will incorporate Johannesburg and Soweto. Although Johannesburg is widely known outside South Africa, many black residents call it eGoli - Zulu for \"place of gold\". But while some argue that it is time to get rid of all names with colonial origins, others point out that the surrounding province has already had its name changed from Transvaal to Gauteng, which has a similar meaning in Tswana to eGoli. The chairman of Johannesburg's transformation committee, Kenny Fihla, said the old name would probably stay for now but change was likely before long. The scrapping of apartheid-era and colonial names in favour of African ones has been slow. Until now only one main town has changed: Verwoerdburg - which sits in the north-east near Johannesburg and Pretoria and was called after the most hardline of apartheid prime ministers- was renamed Centurian, to the disgust of many residents. South Africa's main airports were stripped of their old names several years ago. But many streets in areas formerly reserved for whites still recall apartheid and colonial figures.",

Yet one look at Her Majesty's face as she took a gander at the new British embassy on Berlin's Wilhelmstrasse last week made one feel that here was an unlikely soul mate. Taking a cue from her ancestor, the Queen was clearly not amused. \"I understand that some people like it,\" she said. As for the Duke, he merely snapped \"No\" when reporters asked if he would offer an opinion on the design of the building. </p> <p>Of course, there were excuses. This uncomfortable new building had to be squeezed into the suffocating corset of Berlin's old streets and planning guides. The architecture along these streets was better in the 19th and early-20th century, the days between Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Albert Speer, when architects knew how to get their buildings to stand to attention. There might be a hint of flamboyance in a doorcase or pediment but, on the whole, Prussian military manners held sway. Berlin, before Marshall Zhukov's capture in 1945, was a model of classical restraint. </p> <p>Commissions to design embassies, if this new monument to the British abroad is anything to go by, are sullied chalices. With the best will in the world, neither Michael Wilford, architect of the British embassy, Berlin, nor Ahrends Burton Koralek (ABK), architects of the recently opened British embassy in Moscow, have come up with designs that match or mirror the country of Wren, Hawksmoor, Vanbrugh, Soane and Lutyens. But then even Sir Edwin Lutyens failed to cut the mustard with his design for the British embassy in Washington DC. </p> <p>That bloodless, Neo-Georgian red-brick pile, completed in 1928, is one of the few real duds in Lutyens' portfolio. Was this wuss of a building really by the man who gave us the magnificent Viceroy's House in New Delhi, the heartwrenching war monument at Thiepval, and so many great Edwardian country houses in the home counties? It is meant to be a play on the work of Wren and the colonial homes Wren's designs influenced in Williamsburg in the days before the Revolution. It is, though, spineless, while its fey interior decoration smacks today of a \"traditional English country house-style hotel\". </p> <p>Perhaps then, as now, embassy buildings were a compromise, a polite and formal way of expressing ideas about how we British wanted to present ourselves to foreigners. What sort of Britain is being presented - a tepid, public school, pin-striped Britain? A Britain where everyone is charming, plays safe, keeps mum? Even if this is an exaggeration, it's a feeling one gets in British embassies as far afield as Cuba, Russia and Germany. </p> <p>The architecture and culture of such places are, aside from any serious, useful work carried out there, geared up to present a mythical image of Britain. Most British embassy buildings have been restrained, fey and old-fashioned. On a recent trip to Rio, I visited the city's mayor, Luiz Paulo Fernandez Conde, an architect and former dean of the university school of architecture, in his grand country house-style residence. Inside was an almost exact reproduction of the dining room and library of Kenwood House, Hampstead, built by Robert Adam in 1767-8. This, the mayor told me, was the former British ambassador's house. It was built in the 50s. </p> <p>I shouldn't have been surprised. This was just the kind of architecture diplomats must have loved then, and still do. After all, if you were going to move abroad after an upbringing of home counties house, Oxbridge college and Georgian home-of-your-own, the least you could expect when posted overseas was an Adam-style residence. Or Lutyens at his most uninspired. </p> <p>One big question remains: what is it that makes these buildings second rate? Is it the architects' failure of nerve, or the clients' desire for nothing too difficult or arty? Is it a bout of poet laureate syndrome when faced with designing for Britain? Think of John Betjeman and his dismal verses for Princess Anne's wedding, or Andrew Motion's awkward \"God bless you ma'am\" verses written on the occasion of the Queen Mum's centenary. Only Tennyson managed to get away with some memorable verse (\"Half a league, half a league,/ half a league onward,/All in the valley of Death/ rode the six hundred\"), but even the camp horror of The Charge of the Light Brigade isn't a patch on The Lotos-Eaters, The Vision of Sin or The Lady of Shalott. </p> <p>It's more likely, though, that the client body - HM government - leeches the blood from these flag-waving projects. They must, like a diplomat's speech, aim to please everyone in general and thus, by default, no one in particular. In Berlin and Moscow, Wilford and ABK have tried to inject some energy into their buildings, but to little avail. Wilford's attempt to add a splash of uncertain colour - a variation of duck-egg blue and Biba-era mauve - into the stone facade of the German embassy seems misplaced. Berlin's grey climate warrants full-blooded colour, the deep ochres, blues and gold used by Prussian architects, for better or worse, from Schinkel to Speer. In Moscow, ABK have designed an articulated, three-dimensional jigsaw of a building that might look dramatic in Gori or Riga, but is dwarfed on the banks of the Moskva River by one of Stalin's post-Great Patriotic War towers and other heroic and not-so-proletarian city blocks. In trying to make a bit of a splash, both buildings remind me of classic pin-striped City chaps sporting discreetly loud ties, or waistcoats lined in jazzy silks. </p> <p>We can rest assured, though, that other countries find the embassy lark just as difficult to transform into art as we do. The US embassy (1955-60) in London's Grosvenor Square is possibly the worst building by Eero Saarinen (1910-61), the innovative Finnish-American architect who is, rightly, much better known for his superb General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan and his TWA terminal at JFK airport, New York, shaped like a concrete bird on the wing. The lightness and adventure of Saarinen's architecture were replaced in London by a dull leaden quality, a noticeable heaviness of heart. The Danish embassy (completed in 1977) in London's Sloane Street is equally uninspired. Is this kit of mud-brown parts really by the same architect as St Catherine's College, Oxford? Arne Jacobsen (1902-71) was a refined architect and designer, but this inoffensive building is way below par. </p> <p>Embassies are meant to be good ambassadors for the countries they represent, yet as architectural ambassadors they do precious little good. Although, like the Queen, I understand that some people like them.</p>",

They must, like a diplomat's speech, aim to please everyone in general and thus, by default, no one in particular. In Berlin and Moscow, Wilford and ABK have tried to inject some energy into their buildings, but to little avail. Wilford's attempt to add a splash of uncertain colour - a variation of duck-egg blue and Biba-era mauve - into the stone facade of the German embassy seems misplaced. Berlin's grey climate warrants full-blooded colour, the deep ochres, blues and gold used by Prussian architects, for better or worse, from Schinkel to Speer. In Moscow, ABK have designed an articulated, three-dimensional jigsaw of a building that might look dramatic in Gori or Riga, but is dwarfed on the banks of the Moskva River by one of Stalin's post-Great Patriotic War towers and other heroic and not-so-proletarian city blocks. In trying to make a bit of a splash, both buildings remind me of classic pin-striped City chaps sporting discreetly loud ties, or waistcoats lined in jazzy silks. We can rest assured, though, that other countries find the embassy lark just as difficult to transform into art as we do. The US embassy (1955-60) in London's Grosvenor Square is possibly the worst building by Eero Saarinen (1910-61), the innovative Finnish-American architect who is, rightly, much better known for his superb General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan and his TWA terminal at JFK airport, New York, shaped like a concrete bird on the wing. The lightness and adventure of Saarinen's architecture were replaced in London by a dull leaden quality, a noticeable heaviness of heart. The Danish embassy (completed in 1977) in London's Sloane Street is equally uninspired. Is this kit of mud-brown parts really by the same architect as St Catherine's College, Oxford? Arne Jacobsen (1902-71) was a refined architect and designer, but this inoffensive building is way below par. Embassies are meant to be good ambassadors for the countries they represent, yet as architectural ambassadors they do precious little good. Although, like the Queen, I understand that some people like them.",

      "body": "<p>Do you know the difference between single and double damask? The correct distance between place settings at the dinner table? In the 21st century, you might imagine such questions are quaint reminders of a world in which men were men and women were clones of Martha Stewart. But you would be wrong. The housewife is on her way back, a trend confirmed by a publishing phenomenon in the US, where a modern version of Mrs Beeton is a runaway best seller. In Britain, women's magazines and weekend supplements are suddenly full of articles about the return of housework, characterising it not as the secret vice of intelligent women but something even scarier - a secret virtue.</p> <p>Investment bankers and property consultants confess, a little shame-facedly, that they long to return from the office and get on with the dusting. \"There's nothing more soothing than coming home after a day's work and doing a basket full of ironing,\" says one. Cheryl Mendelson, the American author of Home Comforts: The Art &amp; Science of Keeping House, says that for years she felt she had to conceal such cravings. Not any more: 200,000 people have already staggered out of bookshops in the States clutching her 884-page volume. Her enthusiasm for knitting and making mental lists of when the carpets are due to be shampooed is now proudly out in the open.</p> <p>It couldn't happen over here, could it? Think again. British housewives will soon be able to come out of the closet, thanks to Nigella Lawson. Already famous for her cooking and her cosmetic tips, Lawson's next book is entitled How to Be a Domestic Goddess. Her line is that you do not need to aim for perfection, and she boldly includes a photograph of a cake with a cracked top. Yes! Even beautiful columnists and food critics can make little mistakes! Indeed, for your domestic goddess, such charming home-made touches attest to her ease and confidence in the kitchen.</p> <p>Lawson's title is at least a little bit ironic, which is more than can be said for Mendelson and her intensive programme to fill women's lives with sorting laundry, mopping floors and washing cats. (It doesn't matter that they hate water. They're unhygienic, for God's sake!) It's hard to see how Mendelson's best-selling regime is going to help women who already feel stressed and exhausted by the effort of combining motherhood, a career and housework. Marjorie Garber, an American academic celebrated in the past for her wry analyses of cross-dressing and bisexuality, goes even further, suggesting in a new book that our connection to our homes is positively erotic - a subject taken up and given serious consideration over four pages in this week's New Yorker.</p> <p>So is housework the new sex, as the magazine Red asks on its cover this month? Are women getting an erotic frisson out of scrubbing sinks and spraying room freshener in newly dusted sitting rooms? Garber thinks so, suggesting that property is what the over-50s turn to when their enthusiasm for bodies becomes embarrassing. She suggests that prospective purchasers approach buying a house or apartment with a mixture of lust and shame, although this probably says more about her private insecurities than anything else. Few women have actually confessed that they get off on the scent of furniture polish instead of sweat and pheromones.</p> <p>But that is not the point. The new housewife, as we might call her, is nothing to do with real life and everything to do with fantasy. And the question that is not being addressed is: if housework really is the new sex, why are men so reluctant to do it? I don't see them clamouring to starch sheets or getting erections at the prospect of dusting lampshades. Some do admit to being turned on by the sight of Annette Bening manically vacuuming in her underwear in American Beauty. But the point of the scene is that Bening is not a housewife but an estate agent, cleaning up one of the houses on her books in the hope of cleaning up metaphorically on its sale.</p> <p>The word scrubber, which used to describe a woman performing that function, is now universally taken to mean a working-class woman who is sexually promiscuous. Another noun which derives from a domestic context, slattern, suggests a woman who does her work lazily and incompetently, as well as implying sexual availability. If there is a link between housework and sex, it involves class, disorder and sexual incontinence rather than Martha Stewart or Delia Smith in sparklingly clean kitchens.</p> <p>So what lies behind this apparently concerted attempt to make housework sexy, exciting and fulfilling? One clue is the way women are suddenly being treated as housework virgins, previously unaware that butter should be kept in the fridge or why human beings need to eat breakfast. Since most of us have been grap pling with these tricky problems since childhood, it is obvious that what we are really being offered is a fantasy about a more traditional, and inevitably more gendered, way of life. Mendelson's index includes an astonishing 56 entries for laundering and laundry, and entire chapters on ironing and vacuuming. She tells readers how to put away linen and supplies three methods (with diagrams) of folding socks.</p> <p>At first sight, it throws an ironic light on Shirley Conran's famous remark that life is too short to stuff a mushroom. But it seems unlikely that working women, already short of time, are about to squander it on cleaning ovens, washing the fridge every week, making their own clothes and learning how to turn napkins into amusing shapes. What is going on here is an outburst of nostalgia, which would be harmless enough if it did not contain subliminal messages about femininity and what women ought to be like. Less benignly, it also suggests that we live in cultures which have recognised the inefficacy of bullying women back into the kitchen and have consequently adopted a new method - seduction.</p> <p>The message to working women is that you'd like it if you only tried it - or tried more of it, for every survey ever carried out confirms that men are still not doing their share of domestic chores. Some commentators even claim that men simply aren't biologically programmed to look after homes, as though ironing and cleaning those stubborn limescale stains off the loo are natural female functions. If that is the case, then some of us clearly lack the ironing gene; when a TV crew wanted to film me at home to make some arcane point about domesticity, one of them had to go up into the loft and bring down the ironing board left behind by the previous (male) owner of my house. The novelist Alice Walker seems to have a similar problem, thanking a couple of women in the acknowledgments to one of her novels for \"representing the Goddess in my household\". This is what the rest of us call employing a cleaner; it may be the first instance, dating back to 1992, of the current trend for recasting domestic drudgery as sacred duty. And sacred duties, as we all know, are performed out of love rather than money; as Marx pointed out in the 19th century, the world depends on unpaid domestic labour, an injustice that has yet to be redressed. Housework remains a low-status, badly paid, working-class occupation, when it is remunerated at all.</p> <p>Yet the new breed of domestic goddesses and happy housewives are middle class to the core. Whether they pose fetchingly at home, surrounded by fresh herbs and bottles of balsamic vinegar, or go into rhapsodies about marketing (shopping to you), they assume they have choices. They have very little in common with mothers on council estates in Leeds or poor women in housing projects in Chicago, where Mendelson's advice to employ a \"bonded maid service\" must read like a bad joke. The truth about housework is that most of it is dull, repetitive and unrewarding: women's work, in other words. Feminism came along and said so, and many housewives gladly took the message to heart, allowing dust balls to accumulate under the beds and waiting to clean out the fridge until mould began to grow. What they discovered was that many traditional household chores are simply a way of filling up time, as well as filling up minds with trivia. No sensible human being, with an averagely interesting life, needs to sew her own napkins or dry dishes by hand.</p> <p>But some housework is unavoidable, and there's the rub. Housework can be made more palatable in two ways, either by pretending it's fun or suggesting that it's somehow more womanly. \"My own experience,\" writes Mendelson, \"convinces me that there is still no other way to make a good home than to have attitudes toward home and domesticity modelled on those of [a] traditional woman.\" So there you have it: real women love housework. Let's hope they think it's worth it when they finally expire, as a friend's mother did, stretched across the bed with a duster in her hand.</p>",

Her line is that you do not need to aim for perfection, and she boldly includes a photograph of a cake with a cracked top. Yes! Even beautiful columnists and food critics can make little mistakes! Indeed, for your domestic goddess, such charming home-made touches attest to her ease and confidence in the kitchen. Lawson's title is at least a little bit ironic, which is more than can be said for Mendelson and her intensive programme to fill women's lives with sorting laundry, mopping floors and washing cats. (It doesn't matter that they hate water. They're unhygienic, for God's sake!) It's hard to see how Mendelson's best-selling regime is going to help women who already feel stressed and exhausted by the effort of combining motherhood, a career and housework. Marjorie Garber, an American academic celebrated in the past for her wry analyses of cross-dressing and bisexuality, goes even further, suggesting in a new book that our connection to our homes is positively erotic - a subject taken up and given serious consideration over four pages in this week's New Yorker. So is housework the new sex, as the magazine Red asks on its cover this month? Are women getting an erotic frisson out of scrubbing sinks and spraying room freshener in newly dusted sitting rooms? Garber thinks so, suggesting that property is what the over-50s turn to when their enthusiasm for bodies becomes embarrassing. She suggests that prospective purchasers approach buying a house or apartment with a mixture of lust and shame, although this probably says more about her private insecurities than anything else. Few women have actually confessed that they get off on the scent of furniture polish instead of sweat and pheromones. But that is not the point. The new housewife, as we might call her, is nothing to do with real life and everything to do with fantasy. And the question that is not being addressed is: if housework really is the new sex, why are men so reluctant to do it? I don't see them clamouring to starch sheets or getting erections at the prospect of dusting lampshades. Some do admit to being turned on by the sight of Annette Bening manically vacuuming in her underwear in American Beauty. But the point of the scene is that Bening is not a housewife but an estate agent, cleaning up one of the houses on her books in the hope of cleaning up metaphorically on its sale. The word scrubber, which used to describe a woman performing that function, is now universally taken to mean a working-class woman who is sexually promiscuous. Another noun which derives from a domestic context, slattern, suggests a woman who does her work lazily and incompetently, as well as implying sexual availability. If there is a link between housework and sex, it involves class, disorder and sexual incontinence rather than Martha Stewart or Delia Smith in sparklingly clean kitchens. So what lies behind this apparently concerted attempt to make housework sexy, exciting and fulfilling? One clue is the way women are suddenly being treated as housework virgins, previously unaware that butter should be kept in the fridge or why human beings need to eat breakfast. Since most of us have been grap pling with these tricky problems since childhood, it is obvious that what we are really being offered is a fantasy about a more traditional, and inevitably more gendered, way of life. Mendelson's index includes an astonishing 56 entries for laundering and laundry, and entire chapters on ironing and vacuuming. She tells readers how to put away linen and supplies three methods (with diagrams) of folding socks. At first sight, it throws an ironic light on Shirley Conran's famous remark that life is too short to stuff a mushroom. But it seems unlikely that working women, already short of time, are about to squander it on cleaning ovens, washing the fridge every week, making their own clothes and learning how to turn napkins into amusing shapes. What is going on here is an outburst of nostalgia, which would be harmless enough if it did not contain subliminal messages about femininity and what women ought to be like. Less benignly, it also suggests that we live in cultures which have recognised the inefficacy of bullying women back into the kitchen and have consequently adopted a new method - seduction. The message to working women is that you'd like it if you only tried it - or tried more of it, for every survey ever carried out confirms that men are still not doing their share of domestic chores. Some commentators even claim that men simply aren't biologically programmed to look after homes, as though ironing and cleaning those stubborn limescale stains off the loo are natural female functions. If that is the case, then some of us clearly lack the ironing gene; when a TV crew wanted to film me at home to make some arcane point about domesticity, one of them had to go up into the loft and bring down the ironing board left behind by the previous (male) owner of my house. The novelist Alice Walker seems to have a similar problem, thanking a couple of women in the acknowledgments to one of her novels for \"representing the Goddess in my household\". This is what the rest of us call employing a cleaner; it may be the first instance, dating back to 1992, of the current trend for recasting domestic drudgery as sacred duty. And sacred duties, as we all know, are performed out of love rather than money; as Marx pointed out in the 19th century, the world depends on unpaid domestic labour, an injustice that has yet to be redressed. Housework remains a low-status, badly paid, working-class occupation, when it is remunerated at all. Yet the new breed of domestic goddesses and happy housewives are middle class to the core. Whether they pose fetchingly at home, surrounded by fresh herbs and bottles of balsamic vinegar, or go into rhapsodies about marketing (shopping to you), they assume they have choices. They have very little in common with mothers on council estates in Leeds or poor women in housing projects in Chicago, where Mendelson's advice to employ a \"bonded maid service\" must read like a bad joke. The truth about housework is that most of it is dull, repetitive and unrewarding: women's work, in other words. Feminism came along and said so, and many housewives gladly took the message to heart, allowing dust balls to accumulate under the beds and waiting to clean out the fridge until mould began to grow. What they discovered was that many traditional household chores are simply a way of filling up time, as well as filling up minds with trivia. No sensible human being, with an averagely interesting life, needs to sew her own napkins or dry dishes by hand. But some housework is unavoidable, and there's the rub. Housework can be made more palatable in two ways, either by pretending it's fun or suggesting that it's somehow more womanly. \"My own experience,\" writes Mendelson, \"convinces me that there is still no other way to make a good home than to have attitudes toward home and domesticity modelled on those of [a] traditional woman.\" So there you have it: real women love housework. Let's hope they think it's worth it when they finally expire, as a friend's mother did, stretched across the bed with a duster in her hand.",

Steinberg, the fiscal behemoth from a bygone age, a bloater in a bowtie beached in a world where the waves are made by geeks in open-necked shirts, found out just how far he has fallen at the end of last week. That's when the reservoir of cash really started to run dry; when the failure of his latest, and possibly last, deal really started to bite.</p> <p>Welcome to hard times for this character straight out of Oliver Stone's Wall Street or Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities, a corporate raider from the 80s all washed up in a dot.com decade.</p> <p>But the meaning of hard times could hardly be more subjective than in this case. If your world must fall apart, then a three-bedroom apartment in the Helmsley Carlton House in New York City is not such a bad billet from which to survey the wreckage.</p> <p>The hotel is tucked away in the most expensive neighbourhood in the US, just one block east of Central Park in Manhattan; it has Maxim's, a fine restaurant, down below; even the most modest accommodation costs $450 a night. And since it is mostly residential, with only four of the rooms on its 17 floors available for overnight rent, you are not too likely to be bothered by the riff-raff.</p> <p>But it is not Park Avenue. Nor, specifically, is it the largest apartment in Park Avenue, and indeed all of New York City. For Steinberg's previous abode was just that: 19,000 sq ft divided into 34 rooms, walls dripping with Old Masters, floors supporting marble-topped tables, velvet sofas, a 21ft mahogany dining table with 23 matching chairs, porcelain jars on stands reaching almost 5ft high. And a lot of gold. A $10m (\u00a36.3m) apartment at the Helmsley Carlton must seem like a hovel when you've just been forced to sell John D Rockefeller's old home for $37m (\u00a323m).</p> <p>If $37m sounds like lot of money, it would not have bought many of the parties Steinberg used to throw in his gilded era. Twelve years ago, the Long Island rubber-manufacturer's boy and his third wife Gayfryd commandeered the Museum of Modern Art for his daughter's marriage, a bash with 500 guests wafting among 50,000 French roses. That took care of $3m. A year later it was Steinberg's birthday and his wife, 11 years younger, chose to mark it with a do in which models were arranged to recreate 10 of his favourite paintings. Another $1m.</p> <p>Those were the days. \"They're not exactly poor but within their circle maintaining their billions is important for the ego,\" says a member of precisely that circle. Maintaining the billions has become a matter of urgency for a man who was a millionaire at 30 and a billionaire at 40.</p> <p>Indeed, the Steinbergs are not exactly poor. On top of the money for the apartment, the antiques collection fetched $12.5m at a Sotheby's auction and the Old Masters, including Titian's Salome and the Head of John the Baptist, were said to have made another $50m.</p> <p>Strange, now that Steinberg's kind has given way to infotech billionaires such as the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen - whose taste runs to monuments such as the Seattle Experience Music Project (star turn: Jimi Hendrix) - that it all started with computers.</p> <p>Fresh out of college at the end of the 1950s, Steinberg put into practice his big idea, leasing computers, and set up a firm called Leasco to do it with $25,000 borrowed from his father. Leasco was an immediate hit and its success allowed Steinberg to move in on Reliance, an insurance outfit 10 times the size of his operation, but worth more than Wall Street realised. The year was 1968 and the boy wonder - 29, actually - was a multi-millionaire.</p> <p>Pausing only to be stung by the notorious fraud Robert Maxwell, who sold him the overvalued Pergamon Press in 1969 - Steinberg pulled out in the nick of time - his progress was spectacular.</p> <p>Insurance meant ready cash, and with this he was able to terrify operations into opening their cheque books to get rid of him. Steinberg bought chunks of companies - Chemical Bank and Disney were his most celebrated victims - and then filed the forms that notified his prey that he was into them for more than 5%.</p> <p>The next step was to meet the managers and ask for a seat on the board. Once ensconced on the top floor, he would buy yet more stock and hope that he would be paid to get lost. His failure to buy Disney in 1984 was merely relative: Steinberg pocketed $60m when the Mouse persuaded him to go away. As well as bags of money, he left with a reputation as the world's foremost \"greenmailer\". He is said to have boasted: \"You watch! Like the Rockefellers, I'll own the world. I could even be the first Jewish president.\"</p> <p>Steinberg took his company public again two years later with shares priced at $10 each. They reached a high of nearly $20 two years ago, and were still at $6 in February: now they hover around the 25-cent mark.</p> <p>The fall, when it came, was swift. but it was a long time in the making. The climate was wrong for Steinberg's special skills after the crash of 1987 and in particular the collapse in the early 90s of the high-risk, high-yield junk bond market, the star of which was the crooked Michael Milken. Steinberg was a friend of Milken's and became a member of his inner circle, frequently employing junk bonds as well as less unsavoury methods to take over companies.</p> <p>In the meantime he and the glamorous Gayfryd, previously a successful businesswoman in Louisiana, made the most of the celebrity they had purchased. She was on the board of the New York Public Library, and her interest in the written word extended beyond the institutional. Allen Ginsberg, the late Beat poet, and Carl Bernstein, half of the Watergate-busting team, became dinner guests.</p> <p>At the suggestion of Norman Mailer, the couple were granted access to and became prominent sources of cash for PEN, the writers' group. Which was fine until they became a little too prominent, when the twice-divorced Gayfryd was appointed president of the organisation. Some members rebelled, and in 1990 she resigned.</p> <p>There were selfless good works, too, such as the time they financed the college educations of 40 students from the South Bronx - a neighbourhood of New York whose inhabitants had only ever seen the inside of Park Avenue homes while in servants' garb.</p> <p>Steinberg welcomed the new post-junk bond world by saying, \"My motto for the 90s is that money is for lending, not spending.\" But five years later, he had a stroke which still afflicts the left side of his body. By the end of last year the injuries to his business - underwriting property, casualty and vehicle insurance - were likewise all too apparent.</p> <p>The insurance industry was suffering generally, but Reliance had its own special woes: annual interest payments of $62m and big losses in its workers' compensation business. First to go was Steinberg's brother Bobby, the firm's president. Then Reliance reported a loss of $311m for 1999, and its credit rating tumbled. On top of that it has accrued huge debts, with $240m due to be paid next month and another $290m in November.</p> <p>Steinberg had to do something, and he did. He struck a deal that would have been a gross embarrassment to the piratical raider of Wall Street lore of the 80s. Now it was a lifeline.</p> <p>He agreed to sell the vehicle for his legend to Leucidia National, a financial services holding company, for $295m. Of that, $93m was to be Steinberg's - surely enough to sustain his recently reduced circumstances, even though it was stock for which he would have received $2bn 10 years earlier. George Baker, Reliance's chief executive officer, told a meeting of disgruntled shareholders: \"There was nothing else on the table at the time.\"</p> <p>But then Steinberg's salvation was revoked. Leucidia had reached the agreement on the basis of $2.55 for each Reliance share, more than $2 above the current price.

For Leucadia it's a matter of price.\" Steinberg has paid a price already, and there may be more to come.</p> <p>But until then, there is still the second home 140 miles away from his imploded Manhattan empire, a beachfront retreat at Quogue in the Hamptons. Were the local library not shut for renovations, the tarnished emblem of 80s excess might pull down from its shelves a rumination on hope and loss by the novelist Larry McMurtry, one of Gayfryd's sympathisers during the PEN debacle: The Last Picture Show.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A hot summer's afternoon in an orchard in the middle of Essex. There are bees in the Hollyhocks, apples in the grass. Wood pigeons coo across a distant meadow. It is as close to paradise as one can imagine within commuting distance of London, but Humphrey Spender, the artist and photographer, is, at the age of 90, in a bit of a grump.</p> <p>He is sitting under the trees in a rickety garden chair sipping a glass of ginger beer. He has already bemoaned the widespread disappearance of the puffball mushroom, the hacking down of hedgerows, the greed of modern farmers, the wastage of contemporary photographers, the indifference of local GPs. We have alighted briefly on the inefficiency of architects, including it must be said Richard Rogers, who in the 60s built Spender's orchard-house, two white boxes, rimmed with glass: \"Too hot in summer, too cold in winter.\" We have been sidetracked into his brother Stephen Spender's knighthood: \"He sent me a postcard saying 'You seem to be bemused by my acceptance.' Well, I wasn't. I disapproved.\" And we have tarried a while on the scandal of his own reputation: \"I was not 'one of the most important pre-war documentary photographers' - there were plenty of other people doing it. I've been called 'the father of documentary photography'. It's been said that I 'gave ordinary man his place in history'. Absolute rubbish.\"</p> <p>And then we arrive at the subject of his eyesight. Spender has been shortsighted all his life. Two years ago he developed a cataract and was given implanted lenses that have given him almost normal sight for the first time ever. \"And in many ways,\" he says wryly, snapping in half a biscuit, \"I'm not that pleased about it.\" It comes down to texture. Spender has always liked to look at things close up. With a Leica to his eye, in his remarkable work in the 30s as \"lensman\" for the Daily Mirror, or as a photographer for Picture Post or as a member of Mass Observation, that revolutionary exploration of \"real life\", it is the expressions on his subjects' faces - the unemployed of Tyneside, the housewives of Stepney - that tell you as much about the deprivation of their lives as the state of their clothes or houses. More recently, as an artist, he has dwelled on the texture of small things. For the prints in his current exhibition at the Mercury Gallery in Cork Street he created a method, using Plasticine and PVA, of taking rubbings from three dimensional objects - pine cones, shells, zips, key rings, nails. \"It took enormous patience,\" Spender says. \"I got very cross.\"</p> <p>One of the prints in the show is of the Tortorosaurus, a lugubrious creature with a battered shell and a hanging head. In many ways, it reminds you of its creator. You could stare at Spender's face for hours and not get bored. His lines and facial pouches seem to have a life of their own. There is an unusual purpleness to his large lips. His nose is patrician. His ear lobes are enormous. One seems to glare while the other seems to smile out quite benignly. The Tortorosaurus is both a beautiful and a comic object, and you suspect that its creator may, for all his gloominess, be laughing at you, or at himself.</p> <p>He has an extraordinary soft, clear voice. His elder brother may have been the poet, but the younger brother has a way with language too - conjuring his life in snapshots, unflinching in self-criticism, dispassionate in his observation of others. He was the youngest of four (only his sister Christine, 92, is still alive), far brighter and sportier than his brother Stephen. He spent his childhood trying to lose at battledore and shuttlecock: \"My father's attitude was based on the fact that Stephen was no good at... well anything really and I hated underlining this.\" Both parents were dead before Humphrey was 16, the mother - \"what was known as an invalid\" - finally killed by the ministrations of a drunken doctor; the father, \"who thought in dramatic cliches\", pining away, despite plentiful leeches, soon after.</p> <p>Spender trained to be an architect but his heart was never in it . Instead, he set up a photographic studio with a friend and did rather well drawing on the connections, via Stephen, with the Forsters and Isherwoods, the swinging London of the time. He and Stephen had \"all kinds of ups and downs\", but remained close, despite their differences of character. (\"I'm much more parsimonious, much more careful. The more money Stephen had the more he would spend it all.\") They grew apart a bit when Stephen went to America \"and became very VIP\" but in those days they were together a lot. He even accompanied him to Germany (Isherwood used Spender's 1933 image of Lutzowplatz as the cover for Goodbye to Berlin). \"Stephen suddenly told me for rather obscure reasons I think you can probably guess, 'What you need Humphrey is to spend three or four weeks in Berlin.\"' You mean ... \"Yes,\" says Spender drily. \"I did. And I did.\"</p> <p>And then the Mirror rang and a mission \"to make the world a better place\" began. Spender, forever carrying guilt about his privileged background, had already been photographing children in London's East End for a project about juvenile crime. \"I was very friendly with the probation officer and she was convinced that bad housing - look, see that picture there -\" He has been flicking through a book of his photographs and has stopped at a shot of crumbled sheets and bedsteads. \"Seven people slept in that bedroom and that led to incest of course, these children were being abused, raped by their fathers and uncles, and that made for crime. So I knew the inside story and I thought it was a good idea to disclose it.\"</p> <p>He doesn't think the Mass Observation project did much to disclose anything, most of his pictures sat, undeveloped in a drawer until the 70s. And he has always felt he failed in his fundamental aim to be invisible. Flicking further through the book, he intones: \"She knows. They know. She doesn't. He does. We were always saying, 'We must get into families,' but then they'd always want to clean the room, rearrange the mantelpiece, get out the best china so you arrived at an untrue statement.\" He is still passing through the pages of the book and takes a sudden intake of breath. \"Here I am - 'Tyneside, 1936, overcome by what I call the BP, the Beautiful Photograph, when what it should be is a rather dismal picture of unemployment.\" He gives a pregnant sigh. \"The BP is a danger. Don McCullin, who is wonderful, wonderful, far, far better than me, sometimes his photographs are so so beautiful. He's photographing ultimate nightmare horror and the beauty does partly disguise that I think. Very interesting that he only takes BPs now.\"</p> <p>Spender doesn't take photographs these days. He gave up after the war when the pressure to prettify got too much and became a lecturer in textile design at the RCA instead. There are too many photographs in the world he says. When he was at the RCA he would see a tourist coach stop every Friday outside the Albert Hall. \"Thirty Japanese would jump from the coach and walk 15 paces.

She turned up in the orchard 17 years ago, long bare legs on a bicycle \"and said hello\" and has been around ever since.

      "bodyText": "A hot summer's afternoon in an orchard in the middle of Essex. There are bees in the Hollyhocks, apples in the grass. Wood pigeons coo across a distant meadow. It is as close to paradise as one can imagine within commuting distance of London, but Humphrey Spender, the artist and photographer, is, at the age of 90, in a bit of a grump. He is sitting under the trees in a rickety garden chair sipping a glass of ginger beer. He has already bemoaned the widespread disappearance of the puffball mushroom, the hacking down of hedgerows, the greed of modern farmers, the wastage of contemporary photographers, the indifference of local GPs. We have alighted briefly on the inefficiency of architects, including it must be said Richard Rogers, who in the 60s built Spender's orchard-house, two white boxes, rimmed with glass: \"Too hot in summer, too cold in winter.\" We have been sidetracked into his brother Stephen Spender's knighthood: \"He sent me a postcard saying 'You seem to be bemused by my acceptance.' Well, I wasn't. I disapproved.\" And we have tarried a while on the scandal of his own reputation: \"I was not 'one of the most important pre-war documentary photographers' - there were plenty of other people doing it. I've been called 'the father of documentary photography'. It's been said that I 'gave ordinary man his place in history'. Absolute rubbish.\" And then we arrive at the subject of his eyesight. Spender has been shortsighted all his life. Two years ago he developed a cataract and was given implanted lenses that have given him almost normal sight for the first time ever. \"And in many ways,\" he says wryly, snapping in half a biscuit, \"I'm not that pleased about it.\" It comes down to texture. Spender has always liked to look at things close up. With a Leica to his eye, in his remarkable work in the 30s as \"lensman\" for the Daily Mirror, or as a photographer for Picture Post or as a member of Mass Observation, that revolutionary exploration of \"real life\", it is the expressions on his subjects' faces - the unemployed of Tyneside, the housewives of Stepney - that tell you as much about the deprivation of their lives as the state of their clothes or houses. More recently, as an artist, he has dwelled on the texture of small things. For the prints in his current exhibition at the Mercury Gallery in Cork Street he created a method, using Plasticine and PVA, of taking rubbings from three dimensional objects - pine cones, shells, zips, key rings, nails. \"It took enormous patience,\" Spender says. \"I got very cross.\" One of the prints in the show is of the Tortorosaurus, a lugubrious creature with a battered shell and a hanging head. In many ways, it reminds you of its creator. You could stare at Spender's face for hours and not get bored. His lines and facial pouches seem to have a life of their own. There is an unusual purpleness to his large lips. His nose is patrician. His ear lobes are enormous. One seems to glare while the other seems to smile out quite benignly. The Tortorosaurus is both a beautiful and a comic object, and you suspect that its creator may, for all his gloominess, be laughing at you, or at himself. He has an extraordinary soft, clear voice. His elder brother may have been the poet, but the younger brother has a way with language too - conjuring his life in snapshots, unflinching in self-criticism, dispassionate in his observation of others. He was the youngest of four (only his sister Christine, 92, is still alive), far brighter and sportier than his brother Stephen. He spent his childhood trying to lose at battledore and shuttlecock: \"My father's attitude was based on the fact that Stephen was no good at... well anything really and I hated underlining this.\" Both parents were dead before Humphrey was 16, the mother - \"what was known as an invalid\" - finally killed by the ministrations of a drunken doctor; the father, \"who thought in dramatic cliches\", pining away, despite plentiful leeches, soon after.

Other services planned include online betting. </p> <p>\"We want to out-Lillywhite Lillywhites,\" a spokesman said. </p> <p>\"The idea is that you will be watching Manchester United and can then go through to order the team's new strip.\" </p> <p>The company is keen to build on the strong brand name it has built in the sports market through its five channels and 30,000 hours of coverage each year. </p> <p>BSkyB has been ploughing significant effort into building its online services and in July, it agreed the \u00a3300m acquisition of website business Sports Internet, which is being integrated with Skysports.com. </p> <p>John Swingewood, the director of new media at BSkyB said: \"We have a very clear goal to become the UK's number one online sports e-tailer. </p> <p>\"I am very pleased to welcome on board such an experienced sports brand operator as Bob.\" </p> <p>The new online retailer will at first focus its attention on football, cricket, golf and rugby, but intends to widen its range as the service builds. </p> <p>Mr McCulloch will recruit a team of up to 60 people for the launch of the e-tailer during the autumn. </p> <p>His appointment has been bolstered by Chris Gorman who founded Reality Group, the new media arm of Great Universal Stores and Ian Grabiner, former commercial director of retail chain Sports Division. </p> <p>All three will have a minority stake in the new venture.</p>",

Bob McCulloch, 52, has been hired to build Skysportsstore.com, which will be the company's first stand alone e-commerce venture. Initially Skysportsstore.com will only be available via the internet, but BSkyB plans to make the service available through a broad base of distribution platforms. Crucially, BSkyB's recent acquisition of a majority stake in Open, the interactive channel, removed a non-compete clause which prevented the broadcaster from offering e-commerce services through its channels. Other services planned include online betting. \"We want to out-Lillywhite Lillywhites,\" a spokesman said. \"The idea is that you will be watching Manchester United and can then go through to order the team's new strip.\" The company is keen to build on the strong brand name it has built in the sports market through its five channels and 30,000 hours of coverage each year. BSkyB has been ploughing significant effort into building its online services and in July, it agreed the \u00a3300m acquisition of website business Sports Internet, which is being integrated with Skysports.com. John Swingewood, the director of new media at BSkyB said: \"We have a very clear goal to become the UK's number one online sports e-tailer. \"I am very pleased to welcome on board such an experienced sports brand operator as Bob.\" The new online retailer will at first focus its attention on football, cricket, golf and rugby, but intends to widen its range as the service builds. Mr McCulloch will recruit a team of up to 60 people for the launch of the e-tailer during the autumn. His appointment has been bolstered by Chris Gorman who founded Reality Group, the new media arm of Great Universal Stores and Ian Grabiner, former commercial director of retail chain Sports Division. All three will have a minority stake in the new venture.",

      "body": "<p>Mao Zedong used to dominate James Murdoch's office in Manhattan, until someone decided to get rid of the two portraits of the Chinese communist leader that looked down at the youngest son of one of the world's most influential capitalists. </p> <p>On his first day back in the office after his honeymoon last week, the 27-year-old son of Rupert admitted that he had no idea where the Mao posters had gone. Asked if they would reappear in Hong Kong, where he is to head Star TV, the Asian satellite television operation owned by the family's media empire, he smiled and said: \"Er, no.\" </p> <p>The baby of the Murdoch clan is likely to face more serious political and cultural challenges as the chief executive of a business that operates in 53 countries and seven languages and is at the heart of his father's digital media ambitions. His dad has famously dissed the Tibetans, the BBC and Hong Kong's last governor, Chris Patten, in comments widely seen as attempts to win the affection of the Chinese government. </p> <p>James, who joined the family firm just three years ago, is already well schooled on the difficulties of doing business in a global empire. \"We try to be very sensitive to political realities and very sensitive to cultural sensibilities in any country we're operating in - be it Australia or China.\" Or the UK, he might have added. </p> <p>James, who is almost unknown in the country of his birth (he moved to the US when he was a toddler), is likely to reveal a genetic willingness to wade into some cultural sensitivities in the UK as early as next month, when he delivers the annual Alternative MacTaggart lecture at the Guardian Edinburgh International TV Festival. His views of the tightly-regulated UK media market - he uses epithets such as \"draconian\", \"ridiculous\" and \"evil\" - mark him out as his father's son more than almost anything else. </p> <p>Yet of the three Murdoch siblings who have joined News Corporation - Elisabeth, Lachlan and James - the youngest had always seemed the least like the patriarch. Sweet-tempered, artistic James was the one who dropped out of Harvard after a year making puppet movies during his course in visual environmental studies. Before that, he had spent a year in Rome and contemplated a career as an archaeologist or an academic. </p> <p>Both brothers - close in many ways - horrified their parents with their tattoos, but at least Lachlan completed his Ivy League degree before going to work in the group's Australian heartland operations. James dyed his hair blond, pierced his ears and clashed with the teachers at his conservative boys' school before starting his own business. </p> <p>In a family renowned for high-level and heated discussions around the dinner table, sensitive James was the one who most often argued about politics with his famously libertarian father. Speaking now of his decision to join the family empire back in November 1997, he says: \"I'd never felt that I would, but then it was a great opportunity.\" </p> <p>The great opportunity was to sell Rawkus Entertainment, the fledgling music business he had started with two friends, to his father and to start News Corp's interactive publishing division in New York. College friends say they were less surprised than he was when he joined News Corp because he had always been interested in what they called the \"whole business\". </p> <p>Once installed there, his role in developing the online interests of a company increasingly seen as an ink-stained relic was instrumental in changing internal perceptions of the youngest Murdoch. </p> <p>While his official CV gives him credit for investing in several online companies as head of News Digital Media, he also sketched out last year's merger of TV Guide, the listings magazine, with Gemstar, a video technology company, on the back of a napkin. </p> <p>He is remarkably charming and friendly, with a nice line in self-deprecation. He visibly suffered when required to pose for the Guardian photographer and seemed chuffed to have been asked to speak in Edinburgh. </p> <p>\"You think people will come?\" he asks. \"It's a Sunday night.\" He is likely to hate the personal tone of this article, having said at one point in the 90-minute interview: \"Speculating about your personality seems to be a curious pastime - oh, that's journalism.\" </p> <p>When asked if he is like his father, he stutters a bit. His friends say he seems to have the same knack for creative and lateral thinking. Robert Carlock, a friend from Harvard, calls him \"intellectually omnivorous\" and says he reads widely. Another college friend, Mark Roybal, says he was so impressed by Murdoch's firm handshake and textbook-devouring energy on their first meeting that he immediately thought: \"I'm out of my league here.\" </p> <p>Joe Keiner, a colleague from Gemstar, likens him to his father: \"They are both very strategic, visionary thinkers and bold in their approach. And they both have the ability to look four steps ahead.\" </p> <p>James does not appear to share his father's love of the newspaper business but he talks about networks and interactivity with some passion. \"The thing that gets me up in the morning is the information business,\" he says. </p> <p>His political beliefs also seem to have moved towards his father's in the past few years, although he refuses to talk in terms of left or right. \"My father's politics and mine, which I think I understand better than many do, are probably reasonably close. I think he is vastly misunderstood politically.\" </p> <p>James says that in Britain his father is vilified for being driven entirely by ideology whereas everywhere else in the world he is seen as a robber baron driven purely by the profit motive. </p> <p>He says he is entirely apolitical at work but, for the record, he largely supports pro-market regimes and voted for an anti-taxation libertarian in the most recent US elections. He also calls President Bill Clinton \"an awful scumbag\" for his ability to lie and cheat. </p> <p>He is close to his father and telephones him frequently. When asked whom he will turn to for advice in running Star, he says: \"I know it sounds hokey, but I speak to my father.\" A framed picture of the two of them hangs behind his desk, above a tiny icon of Jesus. </p> <p>His new job is a challenging one. Star, which has accumulated $1bn in losses since it was bought by News Corporation in 1993, is nevertheless considered the jewel in the crown of Sky Global, the new satellite company about to be spun out of the corporate behemoth with assets including BSkyB. </p> <p>As chief executive, James is likely to negotiate a series of alliances from the Middle East to south-east Asia in order to accelerate the company's involvement in interactive television as well as the internet. He talks of Star being at the centre of a web of local operations. </p> <p>Some of the difficulties of operating in the region were demonstrated when the company, which has contracts with 6,000 cable operators in Asia, broke off its eight-month relationship with Cable and Wireless HKT last month. News Corp had grown wary of the high costs involved in the video-on-demand service planned with Hong Kong's biggest telecommunications company, but is now faced with providing interactive services on its own. James says that his new company is \"much better off\" on its own. </p> <p>As a member of the Sky Global board, James is likely to be instrumental in providing a launchpad for the interactive television services of Open, BSkyB's subsidiary. </p> <p>He is also in charge of investing in Asian internet operations. Star has already invested $150m in more than 20 web-based businesses, from Chinese language chatrooms to an Indian general interest portal. If all goes well at Star over the next few months, analysts expect Sky Global to be valued at about $50bn when it gains a stock market listing later this year. </p> <p>Having convinced his new wife, a former PR executive, to move to Hong Kong, he is looking forward to the new job. \"It's the most exciting media marketplace in the world, hands down,\" he says. \"I can't imagine a better spot to be trying to grow a business for any young executive in media.\" </p> <p>Wall Street analysts, who have occasionally raised concerns about the dangers of nepotism in a company which is 30% owned by the Murdochs, seem genuinely impressed by what James has done in New York. Jessica Reif Cohen at Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, says: \"Star needs someone who cares and he does.\" She says that she is struck by how hard both Murdoch brothers work: \"James may be young but he is really, really smart and very impressive.\" </p> <p>The corporate structure of News Corp - a company with operations ranging from newspapers, such as the Sun and the Times, to film studios and satellite technology companies - is baffling to many outsiders. \"Some people would say that we're not as well structured as we could be,\" James admits. </p> <p>He will report to Chase Carey, the new chief executive of Sky Global, in his new job but will also continue to share responsibility for the group's interactive division with Peter Chernin, his father's designated number two, for the time being. </p> <p>Showing a rare sign of overt ambition, he says that he \"hopes to stay in the loop\" when he moves to the Asian outpost of the empire. When asked the question that has dogged the company for years - what happens after his 69-year-old father goes? - James offers the standard corporate response: \"God forbid when that happens, but he [his father] has been reasonably clear that Peter [Chernin] is there. </p> <p>\"Ultimately the board will decide. We're a public company with lots of shareholders. Really, people don't believe this, but we have a board and they talk about these things.\" </p> <p>\"We're not a monolith,\" he says. \"There are so many things that happen in our company every day. It's very easy to personalise [it] but I think that's probably wrong.\" </p> <p>He cites as an example the decision by HarperCollins, the company's book arm, not to publish Chris Patten's memoirs. He doesn't think his father had anything to do with it. </p> <p>No instalment of our favourite corporate soap opera would be complete without sibling rivalry surfacing, but talking to James makes the Murdochs sound more like the Brady Bunch than the Borgias. When forced to discuss what he would do in the event of his older brother taking over, he says: \"We're pretty close. We don't have any issues.\" </p> <p>He refuses to comment on the rumour that he will soon join Lachlan on the main board (\"You're asking the wrong person\") and has given little thought to what he does next: \"I'm going to China and we'll see how we go. I'll probably be there for a little while and there's a lot of work to do. I hope I don't screw it up too bad and they keep me on for a while.\" </p> <p>Will he stay at the company for ever? \"I hope so, God willing,\" he says, before adding with a nod to those ever-vigilant shareholders, \"or the boss and the board willing.\"</p>",

He visibly suffered when required to pose for the Guardian photographer and seemed chuffed to have been asked to speak in Edinburgh. \"You think people will come?\" he asks. \"It's a Sunday night.\" He is likely to hate the personal tone of this article, having said at one point in the 90-minute interview: \"Speculating about your personality seems to be a curious pastime - oh, that's journalism.\" When asked if he is like his father, he stutters a bit. His friends say he seems to have the same knack for creative and lateral thinking. Robert Carlock, a friend from Harvard, calls him \"intellectually omnivorous\" and says he reads widely. Another college friend, Mark Roybal, says he was so impressed by Murdoch's firm handshake and textbook-devouring energy on their first meeting that he immediately thought: \"I'm out of my league here.\" Joe Keiner, a colleague from Gemstar, likens him to his father: \"They are both very strategic, visionary thinkers and bold in their approach. And they both have the ability to look four steps ahead.\" James does not appear to share his father's love of the newspaper business but he talks about networks and interactivity with some passion. \"The thing that gets me up in the morning is the information business,\" he says. His political beliefs also seem to have moved towards his father's in the past few years, although he refuses to talk in terms of left or right. \"My father's politics and mine, which I think I understand better than many do, are probably reasonably close. I think he is vastly misunderstood politically.\" James says that in Britain his father is vilified for being driven entirely by ideology whereas everywhere else in the world he is seen as a robber baron driven purely by the profit motive. He says he is entirely apolitical at work but, for the record, he largely supports pro-market regimes and voted for an anti-taxation libertarian in the most recent US elections. He also calls President Bill Clinton \"an awful scumbag\" for his ability to lie and cheat. He is close to his father and telephones him frequently. When asked whom he will turn to for advice in running Star, he says: \"I know it sounds hokey, but I speak to my father.\" A framed picture of the two of them hangs behind his desk, above a tiny icon of Jesus. His new job is a challenging one. Star, which has accumulated $1bn in losses since it was bought by News Corporation in 1993, is nevertheless considered the jewel in the crown of Sky Global, the new satellite company about to be spun out of the corporate behemoth with assets including BSkyB. As chief executive, James is likely to negotiate a series of alliances from the Middle East to south-east Asia in order to accelerate the company's involvement in interactive television as well as the internet. He talks of Star being at the centre of a web of local operations. Some of the difficulties of operating in the region were demonstrated when the company, which has contracts with 6,000 cable operators in Asia, broke off its eight-month relationship with Cable and Wireless HKT last month. News Corp had grown wary of the high costs involved in the video-on-demand service planned with Hong Kong's biggest telecommunications company, but is now faced with providing interactive services on its own. James says that his new company is \"much better off\" on its own. As a member of the Sky Global board, James is likely to be instrumental in providing a launchpad for the interactive television services of Open, BSkyB's subsidiary. He is also in charge of investing in Asian internet operations. Star has already invested $150m in more than 20 web-based businesses, from Chinese language chatrooms to an Indian general interest portal. If all goes well at Star over the next few months, analysts expect Sky Global to be valued at about $50bn when it gains a stock market listing later this year. Having convinced his new wife, a former PR executive, to move to Hong Kong, he is looking forward to the new job. \"It's the most exciting media marketplace in the world, hands down,\" he says. \"I can't imagine a better spot to be trying to grow a business for any young executive in media.\" Wall Street analysts, who have occasionally raised concerns about the dangers of nepotism in a company which is 30% owned by the Murdochs, seem genuinely impressed by what James has done in New York. Jessica Reif Cohen at Merrill Lynch, the US investment bank, says: \"Star needs someone who cares and he does.\" She says that she is struck by how hard both Murdoch brothers work: \"James may be young but he is really, really smart and very impressive.\" The corporate structure of News Corp - a company with operations ranging from newspapers, such as the Sun and the Times, to film studios and satellite technology companies - is baffling to many outsiders. \"Some people would say that we're not as well structured as we could be,\" James admits. He will report to Chase Carey, the new chief executive of Sky Global, in his new job but will also continue to share responsibility for the group's interactive division with Peter Chernin, his father's designated number two, for the time being. Showing a rare sign of overt ambition, he says that he \"hopes to stay in the loop\" when he moves to the Asian outpost of the empire. When asked the question that has dogged the company for years - what happens after his 69-year-old father goes? - James offers the standard corporate response: \"God forbid when that happens, but he [his father] has been reasonably clear that Peter [Chernin] is there. \"Ultimately the board will decide. We're a public company with lots of shareholders. Really, people don't believe this, but we have a board and they talk about these things.\" \"We're not a monolith,\" he says. \"There are so many things that happen in our company every day. It's very easy to personalise [it] but I think that's probably wrong.\" He cites as an example the decision by HarperCollins, the company's book arm, not to publish Chris Patten's memoirs. He doesn't think his father had anything to do with it. No instalment of our favourite corporate soap opera would be complete without sibling rivalry surfacing, but talking to James makes the Murdochs sound more like the Brady Bunch than the Borgias. When forced to discuss what he would do in the event of his older brother taking over, he says: \"We're pretty close. We don't have any issues.\" He refuses to comment on the rumour that he will soon join Lachlan on the main board (\"You're asking the wrong person\") and has given little thought to what he does next: \"I'm going to China and we'll see how we go. I'll probably be there for a little while and there's a lot of work to do. I hope I don't screw it up too bad and they keep me on for a while.\" Will he stay at the company for ever? \"I hope so, God willing,\" he says, before adding with a nod to those ever-vigilant shareholders, \"or the boss and the board willing.\"",
