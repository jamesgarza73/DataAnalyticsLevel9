The lighter, more expensive, and the most professional of rucksacks cost around \u00a3200, while a perfectly functional but slightly heavier version costs half that amount. </p> <p>Ideally, packs should be tried on before purchase. What looks like a fairly simple holdall is a precise piece of engineering, and many models which appear similar differ in the way in which they fit the body and distribute the weight of the contents. </p> <p>There are now several outdoor gear websites which undercut hiking and camping shops; <a href=\"http://www.WildDay.com\" target=\"_NEW\">WildDay.com</a>, a Scottish site, claims to be up to 60% cheaper than the high street, for instance. Shop via these sites and you lose the opportunity to put the pack on your back and have an expert show you how to adjust straps and make personal recommendations. Site 9feet.com gets round this by offering exchange of goods with free postage. </p> <p>The first issue to address when choosing a rucksack is size, or capacity, which is measured in litres. For travelling, standard sizes are 65 litres, moving up to 80 if it is a long trip or if you need to carry food. If you are walking, then a daysack of 25-35 litres should be sufficient. Overnighters should look at something between the two. </p> <p>Next to consider is whether to go for an adjustable back system or not. The benefits are that you can fine-tune the fit and also that more than one person can use the pack and adjust it to their body shape. It is also, according to 9feet.com, preferable if you have a short back but do not want to compromise on the amount of kit you carry. They are, however, heavier than the fixed-back versions. </p> <p>There are also different models for men and women. Mike Pleasants, a Duke of Edinburgh award leader from Bournemouth, says: \"All the ladies I know who walk use the female-specific packs. The hip belt and shoulder straps are far more comfortable.\" Backpacks for women have a flared base so they do not rub against the hip belt and the straps curve so they fit round the base rather than cutting in. If you are a small man you may also find the female versions more comfortable, and the branding is normally discreet. </p> <p>The final decision is whether to buy a top-loading pack, or a side loader, which unzips like a suitcase. \"This depends what you are using it for,\" says Mr Pleasants. \"If you are taking a lot of trains, then it may be better for you as you can carry it like a holdall. But if you are going to be outdoors, then I prefer the top-loading variety as if I need to get something out and it is muddy, I can just stand the pack on its base without getting the whole thing dirty.\" </p> <p>So which bags do the experts recommend? For travelling, Blacks, the outdoor equipment shop, predictably picks one of its own, the Blacks Governor, at \u00a389.99. Blacks' Steven Faust says that this 60-litre pack is \"a large volume multi-capacity multi-purpose travel-orientated rucksack. It has a large main section with detachable day- sack and bum bag. This is also a zip-away panel which can be pulled over the straps. It also has a top grab handle.\" </p> <p>But 9feet.com comes down in favour of Karrimor's Cougar model. The 50-70 litre L version (the extra capacity comes when all the pockets are full) is designed for women. 9feet buyer Matt Jones says: \"This is a very strong buy. It is light, has good durability of fabric and fulfils all the basic needs of the backpacker. It costs \u00a3110. WildDay carries the smaller Cougar 50 at \u00a390. </p> <p> For men, Mr Jones recommends the standard version of the Cougar 50-70 product, which costs \u00a3110 at 9feet and Blacks and just \u00a390 at WildDay. He adds that while trendy brands such as North Face and MacPac are high quality, they are overpriced. </p> <p>He also favours Karrimor for travel packs. Its range is called Global and the bags feature detachable daysacks. The top of the range version has a pull-out trolley handle. Prices range from \u00a3140-\u00a3160 at 9feet and Blacks. </p> <p>For hillwalking, a daysack should suffice. It should allow you to store additional clothing you may need, exterior pockets for a compass and water bottle, padded straps and hip belt and a mesh separating the back from the pack. Mr Pleasants favours the Regatta X-ert 35, which is generally classified as a rucksack rather than a daysack because of its size: \"It's a bit bigger than most daysacks which means I can fit in things like a first-aid pack when I am leading a group.\" This costs \u00a326.99 at Oswald Bailey and \u00a324 at WildDay. </p> <p>Mr Faust at Blacks opts for the Peter Storm Kinetic bag, at \u00a324.99. This 20-25 litre model was recently voted best buy by Country Walking magazine and features multiple compartments, a compression system to stabilise the load, an air flow mesh back, reflective trim and a pocket which will carry a cycle helmet. Mr Jones, however, prefers the Lowe Alpine Pax 25, at \u00a330 on 9feet. </p> <p>If keeping the contents of your pack dry is a priority, a new range from Craghopper is recommended by 9feet.com. \"They've had great reviews and are not much more expensive than ordinary packs,\" says Mr Jones. The Drypack 50 costs \u00a380 on 9feet.com, and \u00a387.50 on WildDay.com. It also comes in 30, 35, 45 and 65 litre varieties. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.blacks.co.uk\">www.blacks.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.9feet.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www. 9feet.com</a>.&gt;<br> <a href=\"http://www.field-trek.co.uk\">www.field-trek.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.wildday.com\">www.wildday.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.oswaldbailey.co.uk\">www.oswaldbailey.co.uk</a><br> 9feet also has a \"call an expert\" service on 0845-6011-758.</p>",

      "byline": "Rachel Spence",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Last Wednesday Delyth Morgan woke up a happy, if exhausted, woman. After 30 days of non-stop activity, the chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer could claim that October 2000 was the most successful Breast Cancer Awareness month. </p> <p>\"This year, we raised \u00a3500,000 the highest figure yet,\" she tells me proudly, citing the increased number of nationwide fund-raising initiatives, such as pink ribbon outlets and breakfasts for Breakthrough, as the key to their achievement. </p> <p>But she's just as keen to stress the importance of last week's meeting - facilitated by Breakthrough - between public health minister and unofficial \"cancer minister\", Yvette Cooper, and breast cancer charity representatives. </p> <p>\"It was our first opportunity to discuss the NHS cancer plan,\" she explains. \"This kind of interaction is essential if we're to keep the pressure on politicians to implement the policies they talk about.\" Such is her poise and confidence, it's hard to imagine Ms Morgan in any other career, yet her present role is far from the one she envisaged. \"I grew up believing I was going to be a research scientist,\" she explains. \"I'm dyslexic, so as a child I was very under-confident in every area except science.\" </p> <p>Ms Morgan gained a place at Bedford College, London to read physiology and biochemistry. \"I was very bored during my first year because we were covering work I'd done. So I got involved in the student union to give myself another interest.\" </p> <p>It proved a revelation and was, she now believes, her big break. \"I discovered a world where people really believed they could make a difference to society. It was the mid-80s, and there was so much energy. We organised campaigns on everything from equal opportunities to the miners' strike.\" </p> <p>To her amazement, Ms Morgan found herself ap pointed president of the London University student union, a full-time role which required a year's sabbatical. \"Suddenly there I was, a 21-year-old dyslexic person, representing 50,000 students with a staff of 50 and a full-time secretary. That's when I began to think, 'Maybe I can do all sorts of things I never dreamt of'.\" She suspects her dyslexia might have been an advantage at times. \"Apparently, dyslexics are good at seeing the big picture and become strong, verbal communicators, definitely strengths of mine.\" </p> <p>Graduating with a 2:1, she found herself faced with a career choice she had never expected: to remain on her original, scientific path or step sideways into charity work. \"After a wobbly moment, I went for the voluntary sector. It sounds clich\u00e9d but I really wanted to do good.\" </p> <p>Her first job was working for Shelter. After two years there, she joined childcare charity, Workplace Nurseries, as director with a handful of staff. The experience proved invaluable. \"I'm glad I've been part of the childcare debate; one of the highlights of my career was helping to persuade John Major to abolish the tax on workplace nurseries.\" </p> <p>From there, Ms Morgan moved to the National Asthma Campaign. But when, three years later, she saw a tiny Guardian advertisement for the director of a low-profile breast cancer charity, she never hesitated. \"I thought: 'That's me!' It was the right time and then breast cancer had affected my own family and I cared about it passionately.\" </p> <p>She joined Breakthrough in 1996, the year it first ran the now-famous Fashion Targets Breast Cancer campaign, in which hundreds of the fash ion industry's most celebrated bodies modelled Breakthrough T-shirts. </p> <p>Today, the charity is a nationally respected authority on a disease which affects one in 10 women. It is one of several organisations who inform the Department of Health on breast cancer issues; and this year Ms Morgan spoke at the Labour Party conference. </p> <p>Yet long before, Breakthrough had been quietly accomplishing a remarkable feat; that of raising \u00a315m to open the UK's first dedicated breast cancer research centre. The charity was started in 1991 by Bill Freedman, whose own wife died from the disease. Last December, Mr Freedman's dream was realised and the centre opened. </p> <p>\"We aim to have the biggest concentration of breast cancer scientists in the UK,\" says Ms Morgan. \"In five years, we want to point to the work of the research centre and say 'Look what we've done!' \" she says. Watch this space. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.breakthrough.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.breakthrough.org.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Last Wednesday Delyth Morgan woke up a happy, if exhausted, woman. After 30 days of non-stop activity, the chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer could claim that October 2000 was the most successful Breast Cancer Awareness month. \"This year, we raised \u00a3500,000 the highest figure yet,\" she tells me proudly, citing the increased number of nationwide fund-raising initiatives, such as pink ribbon outlets and breakfasts for Breakthrough, as the key to their achievement. But she's just as keen to stress the importance of last week's meeting - facilitated by Breakthrough - between public health minister and unofficial \"cancer minister\", Yvette Cooper, and breast cancer charity representatives. \"It was our first opportunity to discuss the NHS cancer plan,\" she explains. \"This kind of interaction is essential if we're to keep the pressure on politicians to implement the policies they talk about.\" Such is her poise and confidence, it's hard to imagine Ms Morgan in any other career, yet her present role is far from the one she envisaged. \"I grew up believing I was going to be a research scientist,\" she explains. \"I'm dyslexic, so as a child I was very under-confident in every area except science.\" Ms Morgan gained a place at Bedford College, London to read physiology and biochemistry. \"I was very bored during my first year because we were covering work I'd done. So I got involved in the student union to give myself another interest.\" It proved a revelation and was, she now believes, her big break. \"I discovered a world where people really believed they could make a difference to society. It was the mid-80s, and there was so much energy. We organised campaigns on everything from equal opportunities to the miners' strike.\" To her amazement, Ms Morgan found herself ap pointed president of the London University student union, a full-time role which required a year's sabbatical. \"Suddenly there I was, a 21-year-old dyslexic person, representing 50,000 students with a staff of 50 and a full-time secretary. That's when I began to think, 'Maybe I can do all sorts of things I never dreamt of'.\" She suspects her dyslexia might have been an advantage at times. \"Apparently, dyslexics are good at seeing the big picture and become strong, verbal communicators, definitely strengths of mine.\" Graduating with a 2:1, she found herself faced with a career choice she had never expected: to remain on her original, scientific path or step sideways into charity work. \"After a wobbly moment, I went for the voluntary sector. It sounds clich\u00e9d but I really wanted to do good.\" Her first job was working for Shelter. After two years there, she joined childcare charity, Workplace Nurseries, as director with a handful of staff. The experience proved invaluable. \"I'm glad I've been part of the childcare debate; one of the highlights of my career was helping to persuade John Major to abolish the tax on workplace nurseries.\" From there, Ms Morgan moved to the National Asthma Campaign. But when, three years later, she saw a tiny Guardian advertisement for the director of a low-profile breast cancer charity, she never hesitated. \"I thought: 'That's me!' It was the right time and then breast cancer had affected my own family and I cared about it passionately.\" She joined Breakthrough in 1996, the year it first ran the now-famous Fashion Targets Breast Cancer campaign, in which hundreds of the fash ion industry's most celebrated bodies modelled Breakthrough T-shirts. Today, the charity is a nationally respected authority on a disease which affects one in 10 women. It is one of several organisations who inform the Department of Health on breast cancer issues; and this year Ms Morgan spoke at the Labour Party conference. Yet long before, Breakthrough had been quietly accomplishing a remarkable feat; that of raising \u00a315m to open the UK's first dedicated breast cancer research centre. The charity was started in 1991 by Bill Freedman, whose own wife died from the disease. Last December, Mr Freedman's dream was realised and the centre opened. \"We aim to have the biggest concentration of breast cancer scientists in the UK,\" says Ms Morgan. \"In five years, we want to point to the work of the research centre and say 'Look what we've done!' \" she says.

      "body": "<p>Welcome to the global dance. It started in the late 1980s with Acid House - a simple, hypnotic brand of electronic dance music formed in the underground gay discos of New York, Chicago and Detroit, mixed up with trashy Euro disco on the dancefloors of Ibiza and often enjoyed alongside a new designer drug called Ecstasy. London and Manchester were the first British cities to succumb to it, but nothing this good could stay secret for long: by 1990, there was at least one big dance club in every town in the UK, and the culture was spreading all over the world. </p> <p>Once, only weird kids wanted to dress up and dance all night - now this kind of clubbing is a mainstream leisure activity everywhere: from Tokyo to Telford, Birmingham to Bali. And it shows no sign of ending. The music has evolved, adapted, spun off into endless confusing categories and sub-groups, but the basic premise stays the same: repetitive electronic beats, big smiles, and huge crowds giving it lots of hands-in-the-air abandon. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the clubs have got bigger, boasting massive sound systems and extravagant decor that will shock those of you whose last dance experience was a chrome disco with swirly carpets, a few flashing lights and a mirror ball. </p> <p>In the past decade, major British clubs such as Ministry of Sound, Cream and Gatecrasher have become international youth culture brands, big businesses selling CDs, magazines and clothes and organising parties all over the globe. Our star DJs earn more in one night than some of us do in a year, leading a life many jet-setters would envy: summers in Ibiza or Ayia Napa, winters playing clubs in Australia, South America or South Africa, and regular monthly gigs in New York clubs. </p> <p>The scene is now a huge global business with its own stars, its own social calendar with regular annual fixtures such as the gay mardi gras in Sydney, the Love Parade in Berlin, and the Miami Winter Music conference. It has also bred a whole new kind of tourism - clubbers who travel the world less to see the sights than to experience the nights. This is a guide to some of the club capitals of the world, but search in any big city and you'll find something similar. As the record says, \"Let the music take control.\" </p> <p><strong>Berlin</strong></p> <p>\"Berlin is such a great clubbing city because there has always been an interesting mix of clubbers and music since the East and West joined together\"<br><strong> DJ Paul Van Dyk</strong> </p> <p><strong> Local DJs </strong> Westbam, Sven Vath, Paul Van Dyk, Timo Maas, Jazzanova.<br><strong> UK/American DJs </strong> Carl Cox, Jeff Mills, Derrick Carter and any of the big Techno names. </p> <p><strong> Icon</strong> Cantian Strasse 15 / Mila Strasse<br>Door: Dm10, Dm20 for special events <br> Housed in a building that used to be a brewery, this is the oldest Drum 'n' Bass venue in the city and has played host to famous DJs such as Grooverider, Peshay,and Doc Scott. </p> <p><strong> Rive Gauche</strong> Friedrichstrasse 105 <br> Door: Dm 20 (weekends &amp; Special events), Dm10 (Thursdays, when they have an after-work night) <br>Mainly populated by people in advertising, party people.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to the global dance. It started in the late 1980s with Acid House - a simple, hypnotic brand of electronic dance music formed in the underground gay discos of New York, Chicago and Detroit, mixed up with trashy Euro disco on the dancefloors of Ibiza and often enjoyed alongside a new designer drug called Ecstasy. London and Manchester were the first British cities to succumb to it, but nothing this good could stay secret for long: by 1990, there was at least one big dance club in every town in the UK, and the culture was spreading all over the world. Once, only weird kids wanted to dress up and dance all night - now this kind of clubbing is a mainstream leisure activity everywhere: from Tokyo to Telford, Birmingham to Bali. And it shows no sign of ending. The music has evolved, adapted, spun off into endless confusing categories and sub-groups, but the basic premise stays the same: repetitive electronic beats, big smiles, and huge crowds giving it lots of hands-in-the-air abandon. Meanwhile, the clubs have got bigger, boasting massive sound systems and extravagant decor that will shock those of you whose last dance experience was a chrome disco with swirly carpets, a few flashing lights and a mirror ball. In the past decade, major British clubs such as Ministry of Sound, Cream and Gatecrasher have become international youth culture brands, big businesses selling CDs, magazines and clothes and organising parties all over the globe. Our star DJs earn more in one night than some of us do in a year, leading a life many jet-setters would envy: summers in Ibiza or Ayia Napa, winters playing clubs in Australia, South America or South Africa, and regular monthly gigs in New York clubs. The scene is now a huge global business with its own stars, its own social calendar with regular annual fixtures such as the gay mardi gras in Sydney, the Love Parade in Berlin, and the Miami Winter Music conference. It has also bred a whole new kind of tourism - clubbers who travel the world less to see the sights than to experience the nights. This is a guide to some of the club capitals of the world, but search in any big city and you'll find something similar. As the record says, \"Let the music take control.\" Berlin \"Berlin is such a great clubbing city because there has always been an interesting mix of clubbers and music since the East and West joined together\" DJ Paul Van Dyk Local DJs Westbam, Sven Vath, Paul Van Dyk, Timo Maas, Jazzanova.

How does it work? You fill it up with water and pump it through a filter that removes the debris. What about cleaning my teeth? I've heard you can get ill from something as simple as that? Very true, but the Combi can easily be attached to a tap for instant results. Where do I get it? Phone 01364 631270 for stockists. The Combi costs \u00a3119.95, and the Combi Plus is \u00a3139.95.",

I was all for unpacking the tents and creeping back into the woods, but my guide Colleen expected me to get onboard and start paddling, so I put on a brave face. </p> <p>It took us six and a half hours to paddle seven miles. There isn't a word to describe how scared I was. It wasn't much comfort to know I had come all this way to find the shack of a long-dead fraud, drunk and serial bigamist called Archie Belaney. </p> <p>When we finally turned into the calm, I felt as though my shoulders had converged into a painful lump at the back of my neck. But suddenly it was worth it, a true wilderness experience, and I could see what had brought Archie all the way from Hastings to northern Saskatchewan to reinvent himself as a Canadian Indian called Grey Owl. </p> <p>When he first saw Ajawaan lake, Archie knew this was the place he was looking for. Here he wrote some of the books that were to make him famous as one of the world's first conservationists. </p> <p>My journey to Ajawaan started at the village of Waskesiu, a pleasant resort with boutiques, restaurants, and one of the most beautiful golf courses in the province. But we decided to forego these pleasures and drove the 15 miles to where the road peters out. There, we parked the car, unloaded the canoe, and were on our way. </p> <p>We began very gently along a quiet little river, the Kingsmere, lined with cat-tail reeds. This peaceful introduction to paddling a canoe was perfect for a first-timer like myself, and I soon got into the rhythm of it. However, once we reached Kingsmere lake, after about a mile and half of paddling, it was a different story - now it was time for some real canoeing. </p> <p>There was also a sense of isolation, of being the only two human beings on a vast expanse of water, the horizon of our destination way out of sight. </p> <p>The lake is 11 miles long straight down the middle. But forget about the middle - the golden rule is stick to the shore line, which makes the journey longer but is much safer. These lakes can be whipped up in a matter of minutes - and you're out of luck if you are caught in the centre. </p> <p>Along the way, we saw bald eagles and kingfishers. Red squirrels scampered along the shore as we pulled in at Northend, the last campsite before reaching the cabin. </p> <p>The campsites in the park are spartan but clean - all campers carry out their own rubbish. There's a place for a fire, a toilet - usually tucked away in the trees - and a raised platform reached by a wooden ladder where food must be stashed overnight, out of reach of the black bears. They look cuddly and friendly, but they are unpredictable and physically powerful. All they think about is food: they will eat anything from a can of beans to a tube of toothpaste. Even lipstick. </p> <p>Through the open flap of my tent, I saw the great sweep of the northern lights and dozed off to the lament of loons - diver birds. Early in the morning, a plume of mist rose through the pale sunshine, rising across the lake like a white rainbow. I heard the howling of wolves in the distance and a dawn chorus of unknown songs from birds with unfamiliar names. </p> <p>We walked the remaining couple of miles to the lake. The sun shone through glades of birch and aspen and the undergrowth was full of rustlings. It was a narrow trail, soft underfoot with moss and leaves, little changed since Grey Owl hauled his canoe along here. </p> <p>The cabin stands by the edge of the lake, surrounded by thick forest. Built from rounded logs with a traditional caulking of moss, it incorporates the beaver lodge from which the building takes its name. The beavers, which often feature in Grey Owl's writings and whom he called \"the wilderness personified\", would enter the one-room cabin from the lake via an underwater entrance. </p> <p>The bed he constructed from stripped pine saplings stands against the wall, as does his blackened wood-burning stove. The cabin is unlocked and unattended, and visitors are free to enter. </p> <p>As we sat on the porch in the sun, the only sounds were the light plop of a fish in the lake, the chatter of the birds, and the scuttlings of squirrels. Up a nearby slope is the cabin built for Grey Owl's wife, Anahareo (real name Gertrude Bernard), when their daughter was born. Close by in a clearing are the gravestones marking the spot where all three are buried. </p> <p>As we set out for the return hike to the campsite, a silver fox walked across the path in front of us; we froze, and he did too, eyes and ears quickly checking us out, then calmly continued on his way, his great silver bush of a tail disappearing into the forest. </p> <p>My trip was by canoe and on foot, as this is how Grey Owl would have travelled, but you can reach the cabin entirely on foot. Park officials recommend taking at least two days to complete the 25 mile round-trip. The trail begins at the Kingsmere river and follows the east shore of Kingsmere, lake alternating between forested pathways and stretches of beach walking. The beaches are fine for sunbathing, but you need to be hardier than me to swim in these northern lakes. They are never warm enough even in the height of summer. </p> <p>About eight miles along the trail is a mineral lick, a good spot to look for signs of moose, deer, bear and wolves. </p> <p>To preserve the wilderness experience, the park has deliberately limited access to the trail. One of the three campsites, Chipewyan, contains only two berths, a double and a single. </p> <p>The Grey Owl trail is a popular attraction, but there's much more to Prince Albert National Park. It spreads over 405,000 hectares (1m acres) in the middle of Saskatchewan and sits on the southern edge of a great forest of spruce, pine, birch and aspen. There are more nesting songbirds here than anywhere else in North America - more than 230 species - elk, badger, lynx, osprey eagle, a flock of rare white pelicans and a free-roaming herd of plains bison. It is also one of the few places left in the world where timber wolves live undisturbed. </p> <p>Grey Owl would be pleased to see that his world remains largely unchanged, and, I'm sure, encouraged by its continuing ability to inspire awe in those who have chosen to follow in his footsteps. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Attenborough's film biography, Grey Owl, opened yesterday.</p> <p><strong> The practicals</strong><br> </p> <p>Canadian Airlines (0870 524 7226) flies from Heathrow to Saskatoon via Calgary for \u00a3461 return.

Take an extra electric heater for campsite use. Two years ago, just before Xmas, the temperature dropped to -28C and stayed below -8C for over a week. Make sure tyres are in good nick, and take snow chains (you may not be allowed on some roads without them).<br><strong>Patricia and Guy Featherstone</strong></p> <p><strong>Lesley Sainbury's husband comes from a large family (32 at the last count).

Try Morzine (Les Portes Soleils) with two sites, one at the end of Morzine, the other in the next viilage down the valley. You can also camp for free in the car park (near the Gendarmerie and supermarket) in the centre of Morzine. Make sure your vehicle has maximum antifreeze and is well insulated. Take an extra electric heater for campsite use. Two years ago, just before Xmas, the temperature dropped to -28C and stayed below -8C for over a week. Make sure tyres are in good nick, and take snow chains (you may not be allowed on some roads without them). Patricia and Guy Featherstone Lesley Sainbury's husband comes from a large family (32 at the last count). She wants to find suitable self-catering accommodation in the UK where they can all go on holiday together. \u0095 Plas Dolau (Lovesgrove, Aberystwyth, Ceredigion SY23 3HP, tel: 01970 617834) is a comfortable country mansion providing affordable holiday accommodation for large families. Also see the Independent Hostel Guide (Backpacker Press, 2 Rockview Cottages, Matlock Bath, Derbyshire, tel: 01629 580427) or contact Christian Camping International (tel: 024 7655 9099). Pat Twigg \u0095 Camping barns are ideal. In the Yorkshire Dales, one at Littondale sleeps 40 and one at Ingleton sleeps 48. Details from the National Park Centre (tel: 01756 752 774). Stonelands Farm Yard Cottages, Litton, N Yorks (tel: 01756 770293) is a barn conversion with 10 cottages and an indoor pool. Kathleen Vittery \u0095 The Walkers Hostel, Ulverston, Cumbria (01229 585588) provides brilliant self-catering accommodation - 30 beds in seven rooms, \u00a3300 a weekend, \u00a3720 a week. Jean Povey \u0095 We unfortunately omitted the last part of last week's letter from Gerry Bates on the subject of electronic mosquito deterrents. He said it had worked well but added that this was only \"until the controversy over the device's efficacy arose. After that, it didn't work at all.\" Rather than wishing to give an unconditional endorsement of the device, he now thinks that it only appeared to work because he believed that it did so - a placebo effect. This week's question Roy Lane wants to travel to North Korea. It it possible? How easy is it to obtain a visa? Would he have to travel with an organised group? How expensive is it? If you have questions or advice, please write to: Ask a fellow traveller, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or e-mail: ask.a.fellow.traveller@theguardian.com.",

      "body": "<p>The global superhighway is so congested that many companies are unable to register their name with the dot.com suffix. Many television companies are finding it easier to use the .tv domain. </p> <p>This may seem a million miles from the west Pacific, except that the .tv name is the property of a tiny group of Micronesian islands, Tuvalu. </p> <p>Last year, the 10,000 islanders made \u00a310.5 million from licensing their domain and look set to earn a great deal more. They have few other sources of income - the sale of fishing licenses in their extensive territorial waters raises \u00a34 million a year, but there is no industry, negligible agriculture and tourism is virtually nonexistent. </p> <p>The windfall will come in handy as the advent of global warming has brought the fear that the islands, which seldom rise more than 4m above sea level, may not be able to survive the coastal erosion. The population lives with the possibility that they may have to move within 50 years if they are not to be washed away. The scientific evidence is at present ambiguous, but the government is already moving to buy a plot of land in Fiji a quarter the land size of Tuvalu, as a precaution in case of evacuation. </p> <p>In September, Tuvalu became the 189th member of the United Nations, and the government hopes this will give it a stronger platform from which to bring its concerns about global warming to the attention of the international community. </p> <p>Wherever you are on Tuvalu's main island of Funafuti, you can hear the roar of the ocean. Pacific it may be in name, but pacific it is not in nature. On the eastern side of the narrow strip of island, the waves thunder in over the stony beach, while on the western side there is a calm lagoon suitable for swimming. The space between is, in places, barely more than the width of a motorway. Nowhere does it take more than five minutes to walk from coast to coast. </p> <p>A bumpy track runs from one end of the island to the other, a primitive thoroughfare lined by palm trees and pandanus with their decoratively-complex roots. On the lagoon side, there is a verge of just a few feet before the dip down to the beach; on the ocean side, one, or sometimes two, simple houses can fit in before the Pacific coast is reached. There are pigs, mostly confined to pens, and chickens running around, but no cattle or sheep. The soil is not rich enough to grow much beyond coconuts and bananas, but the sea produces plentiful amounts of fish. Fishermen weigh huge tuna on scales in the street; small boys carry them cradled proudly in their arms. </p> <p>The reason for Funafuti's long, thin shape is that it is part of the rim of an old submerged crater, with the circumference completed by a dotted line of uninhabited islets. Several hours by boat beyond these islets are the eight other islands of Tuvalu (which means \"eight standing\"). Only Funafuti has an airstrip, just as only Funafuti has a public electricity network. This summer, the boat that travels between the islands has been in New Zealand for repairs, and one of the country's half-dozen doctors has been stranded on an outer islands for months awaiting its return. </p> <p>Tuvalu is a haven of beauty and simplicity. You can have the beach to yourself for as far as you can see in both directions; The sun shines brightly and hotly - the country lies only 8 degrees south of the equator - and yet the sea breeze brings constant relief. Most water is good to drink because it is rainwater coming straight off the roof. Malaria is non-existent and there is comparatively little nuisance from insects other than mosquitoes. And as a former British colony (the Ellice Islands), everyone speaks English as well as Tuvaluan. </p> <p>It is not a rich island - even on Funafuti more people have fishing nets than have fridges (46% to 43%). But the culture is rich and unspoiled by tourism. Asked if they ever have tourists, the receptionist in Tuvalu's one hotel shook her head in a puzzled way, as though it were a strange idea. Rather the hotel caters for a slow trickle of technicians and government advisers. </p> <p>Yet once or twice a year tourists do arrive, in a load of a hundred or so from a cruise ship. They sleep on the ship, but by day they are all over the island, offending the locals by walking down the road \"half naked\" - that is, in bikinis. Then, after a couple of days the ship moves on and the Tuvaluans sigh with relief. </p> <p>The government takes a different attitude: it would like to promote the tourist industry for obvious financial reasons, although it believes their facilities would have to be upgraded to meet the requirements of \"fussy\" foreigners. </p> <p>The Tuvaluans are gentle, black, beautiful if a little buxom, and wear flowers in their hair. The children wave at you as you pass and cry out \"bye bye\", proud of the English they learn in school, while the adults appreciate being greeted in their own language with \"Talofa\" (\"Hello\"). </p> <p>The Tuvaluan phrase book was brought out in 1945 and includes among its useful phrases for visitors: \"This is our gift which we have brought you. It is only a trifle and not at all fitting for you, but our island has nothing of value to offer, only talo and eggs and a few fowls.\" \"Lift up the screens and let the fresh breeze fan the patient.\" \"He grabbed at the rooster and its tail feathers came out.\" \"Is the post straight or is it leaning towards the sea?\" And: \"Don't you know that the forequarters of the turtle are taboo for they are reserved for the chiefs.\" </p> <p>Christianity is very influential, and 96% of the people are Congregationalists, members of the Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu (Tuvalu Christian Church). Bells ring out every evening calling the families to prayer, and it is common to see people walking around with bibles in their hands. </p> <p>The main church on Funafuti is the largest building on the island, on Sundays filled with people sitting cross-legged on coconut matting. The women wear shimmering white dresses, and sit on the right-hand side, and the men put on their Sunday best - shirts, ties and sulus (skirts) - and sit on the left. The singing is hauntingly beautiful. </p> <p>Everyone seems to be the cousin of someone else you have met, and everything is on such a small scale that you soon feel at home. There is only one newspaper, Tuvalu Echoes, and it comes out once a month, in English and Tuvaluan. The prison has just five inmates, including the former general secretary of the Church, imprisoned for fraud. </p> <p>The governor-general's house faces the airstrip adorned with a little outside wall some six inches high. In the square by the air terminal are all the central facilities: the craft shop, bank, post office, telecom, police station, broadcasting house and the hotel. Few buildings have notices up, as the local people know which battered, unlocked door leads into which office. Two-storey buildings are rare and are treated as landmarks. </p> <p>There is only one mini-roundabout, while the pitted road destroys a vehicle's suspension in a matter of months. As a consequence, most people travel on foot, on bicycle, or motorbike. There is only one \"Stop\" sign, where the road reaches the air terminal, and it is painted by hand. </p> <p>The airstrip, built by the American forces during the second world war, is used for more purposes than landing the two scheduled flights per week. Given the state of the road, it provides a better base for parades and football, and even for sleeping out at night, the open space attracting the wind from the sea that brings relief from the oppressive heat. </p> <p>Tuvalu is a little Garden of Eden, with its long palm-lined beaches, its unspoilt culture, its colourfully dressed, flower-adorned, friendly people, and its relaxed pace of life, which makes one feel like never moving on. A US state department report last year described it as: \"egalitarian, democratic and respectful of human rights\". </p> <p>One is tempted to ask: what is the catch? Well, there are plenty of problems that sap energy and demand patience. There is insufficient capacity in the electricity network, so there are power cuts for approximately one third of the time. Another problem is that the salty sea-wind, for all its welcome breeze, spells death to machinery, for rust is endemic. Drought can also strike between April and November, when those with larger roofs to collect rainwater have to supply the smaller homes with buckets of water. </p> <p>But despite the frustrations, those who have once heard the sound of Tuvaluan children, united in song, piercing the night darkness with their vigorous harmonies, will fall in love with the islands' simplicity and beauty. They will understand the people's sense of foreboding over sea-level rise, threatening to make Tuvalu a third-world victim of first-world greed.

Mike Tomlinson, 58, the deputy head of Ofsted, has already agreed to take over the running of the inspection service for three months when Mr Woodhead effectively departs at the end of the month. One source familiar with negotiations, which continued yesterday, said Mr Tomlinson had been asked to take charge for a year, with a view to extending for a further two years beyond that. Mr Woodhead gave notice yesterday that he would become a persistent thorn in Mr Blunkett's side when he stands down to join the Daily Telegraph and Bell Pottinger Public Affairs in the spring. But he would find it much more difficult to attack the new regime at Ofsted if his old deputy and friend was at the helm. Mr Woodhead told BBC Radio 4's Today programme yesterday: \"The position I have held has meant on more than one occasion that I have had to frame my words very carefully. \"Look in three months' time when I have worked out my notice.

      "body": "<p> Floods, gales and blizzards alarm as well as harm us now because they seem to be incontrovertible proof of global warming. Even a small rise in the prevailing temperature of the world's atmosphere changes the geography and severity of weather events, increasing the risk of floods in such low-lying areas as the Ganges and Mekong deltas and some European coasts, while threatening to shift the flow of ocean currents which govern continental climates, triggering droughts elsewhere. </p> <p>Residents of countries with stable weather patterns, manifesting the same quanta of temperature in summer and winter, and with identifiable sap-ascending springtimes and leaf-descending autumns regular enough to set a watch by, once had little call to discuss the subject. It was only in places with unreliably changeable weather, like Britain, that the art of earnest and endless debate about it was fully developed. Now everywhere people squint at the sky and comment on the unusual quantity or dearth of rain, or the increased ferocity of winds and the rising height of tides. </p> <p>Small changes have big effects. Britain was once part of the European land mass, and the Thames was a tributary of the Rhine, whose mouth was the English Channel. Climate-induced changes in sea levels inundated the shallow plains once continuous between the fenlands of East Anglia and the Low Countries. For some time after the initial flooding there was a large island between Britain and continental Europe, where the Dogger Bank now lies under the North Sea's cold waters. That too sank, and historians say that the peoples of Britain, once they had been separated from their mainland brethren, lapsed two thousand years behind them in agricultural, technological and military development. There is a stern modern moral in that fact. </p> <p>Global trends in weather seem remote until unusual storms demolish our woodlands and drown our village streets. But daily weather is intimately present, affecting moods and hopes, like a member of the family. \"A cloudy day, or a little sunshine,\" remarked Addison, \"have as great an influence on many constitutions as the most real blessings or misfortunes.\" Drawing back the curtains gives a first frame to the day for people who answer Addison's description; from what they see outside they deduce their feelings. Most think that a sparkling sun in a cerulean sky is a prompt for happiness, whereas weeks of cloud make one feel trapped as if inside a Tupperware box. But Gissing's observation, in his essay on winter, can correct this view: \"For the man sound in body and serene of mind there is no such thing as bad weather; every sky has its beauty, and storms which whip the blood do but make it pulse more vigorously.\" </p> <p>The Irish call a day of cloud and drizzle a \"soft\" day; the description supports this thought that every weather is lovely in its way.

      "bodyText": "Floods, gales and blizzards alarm as well as harm us now because they seem to be incontrovertible proof of global warming. Even a small rise in the prevailing temperature of the world's atmosphere changes the geography and severity of weather events, increasing the risk of floods in such low-lying areas as the Ganges and Mekong deltas and some European coasts, while threatening to shift the flow of ocean currents which govern continental climates, triggering droughts elsewhere. Residents of countries with stable weather patterns, manifesting the same quanta of temperature in summer and winter, and with identifiable sap-ascending springtimes and leaf-descending autumns regular enough to set a watch by, once had little call to discuss the subject. It was only in places with unreliably changeable weather, like Britain, that the art of earnest and endless debate about it was fully developed. Now everywhere people squint at the sky and comment on the unusual quantity or dearth of rain, or the increased ferocity of winds and the rising height of tides. Small changes have big effects. Britain was once part of the European land mass, and the Thames was a tributary of the Rhine, whose mouth was the English Channel. Climate-induced changes in sea levels inundated the shallow plains once continuous between the fenlands of East Anglia and the Low Countries. For some time after the initial flooding there was a large island between Britain and continental Europe, where the Dogger Bank now lies under the North Sea's cold waters. That too sank, and historians say that the peoples of Britain, once they had been separated from their mainland brethren, lapsed two thousand years behind them in agricultural, technological and military development. There is a stern modern moral in that fact. Global trends in weather seem remote until unusual storms demolish our woodlands and drown our village streets. But daily weather is intimately present, affecting moods and hopes, like a member of the family. \"A cloudy day, or a little sunshine,\" remarked Addison, \"have as great an influence on many constitutions as the most real blessings or misfortunes.\" Drawing back the curtains gives a first frame to the day for people who answer Addison's description; from what they see outside they deduce their feelings. Most think that a sparkling sun in a cerulean sky is a prompt for happiness, whereas weeks of cloud make one feel trapped as if inside a Tupperware box. But Gissing's observation, in his essay on winter, can correct this view: \"For the man sound in body and serene of mind there is no such thing as bad weather; every sky has its beauty, and storms which whip the blood do but make it pulse more vigorously.\" The Irish call a day of cloud and drizzle a \"soft\" day; the description supports this thought that every weather is lovely in its way. Gissing's mention of storms reminds one that our recent misadventures are not, in fact, unusual for these islands, even though their increasing frequency suggests a sinister trend. Shakespeare gives us tremendous storms in Lear and Macbeth, and although the tempest in the Tempest is Prospero's own, and occurs in foreign parts, the idea for it was home-grown. There are storms likewise in the novels of Hardy and Dorothy L Sayers, the latter describing an actual one in the 1930s which flattened woods and decapitated houses across southern England. These events - like the Victorian earthquake that shook Suffolk - seem improbable in the usually moderate fluctuations between degrees of coolness and wetness affecting these islands, occasionally teased by glimpses of sun; until we remember the droughts of the last quarter-century, and reflect on the tornado that startled Bognor's burghers last weekend. The well-worn saying \"Every cloud has a silver lining\" is especially apt in this connection for, as EB White wrote, \"Extreme cold\" [from which generalise \"extreme weather\"] \"when it first arrives seems to generate cheerfulness and sociability. For a few hours all life's dubious problems are dropped in favour of the clear and congenial task of keeping alive.\"",

      "byline": "Peter Bradshaw",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> It was The Onion, the online satirical chronicler of America's \"dumb century\", which ran a deadpan editorial entitled \"We need more movies where monkeys give the finger\". An arguable surfeit of such movies, or a suspected cultural climate of cynicism and exhaustion in which they will be increasingly tolerated, is where the fashionable \"dumbing down\" debate applies to the cinema.</p> <p>In many ways it is obtuse to fling accusations of \"dumb\" at Hollywood or individual Hollywood products. After all, isn't film a populist art? Haven't its most glorious and compelling works derived their brilliance from their creators knowing what a mass audience wants? Doesn't the energy and exuberance of their work depend to some degree on their exclusion from the simpering civilities of high art? </p> <p>Brilliant films come off the Hollywood production line all the time. But the dangers of dumb reside not merely in the kind of movies made, but the way they have come to be distributed, exhibited, criticised and understood. Hollywood's colonisation of world markets and national cultures is now all but complete, and like all colonisation, depends on a degree of collaboration with and admiration - covert and overt - for the victor. (With some honourable exceptions, the British lottery-funded film has unfortunately become a byword for dumb, with many a substandard script taken out of the bottom drawer to take advantage of the cash bonanza, with the presiding authorities now apparently seeking to redeem the situation by aping the American industry.)</p> <p>This is not simply a naive matter of political correctness or art-buff snobbery, of believing that Hollywood is always schlock or that there is no such thing as a bad Iranian film. Some quintessentially bad films can be middlebrow art movies saturated with their own sense of superiority.</p> <p> Rather, it is a question of vitality, variety and choice. Repertory cinema, where serendipitous discoveries can be made, is disappearing in favour of multiplex conformism. Increasingly, the work of film-makers like Kiorastami, Ozu, Fellini, Bergman, Ray, Powell and Antonioni is omitted both from what we can see on the big screen and from any discussion of cinema's history.</p> <p>As far as postwar Hollywood is concerned, a distinctively political case for the prosecution on the dumbing charge focuses on the terrified response to the McCarthyite bullying of the early 50s.

      "bodyText": "It was The Onion, the online satirical chronicler of America's \"dumb century\", which ran a deadpan editorial entitled \"We need more movies where monkeys give the finger\". An arguable surfeit of such movies, or a suspected cultural climate of cynicism and exhaustion in which they will be increasingly tolerated, is where the fashionable \"dumbing down\" debate applies to the cinema. In many ways it is obtuse to fling accusations of \"dumb\" at Hollywood or individual Hollywood products. After all, isn't film a populist art? Haven't its most glorious and compelling works derived their brilliance from their creators knowing what a mass audience wants? Doesn't the energy and exuberance of their work depend to some degree on their exclusion from the simpering civilities of high art? Brilliant films come off the Hollywood production line all the time. But the dangers of dumb reside not merely in the kind of movies made, but the way they have come to be distributed, exhibited, criticised and understood. Hollywood's colonisation of world markets and national cultures is now all but complete, and like all colonisation, depends on a degree of collaboration with and admiration - covert and overt - for the victor. (With some honourable exceptions, the British lottery-funded film has unfortunately become a byword for dumb, with many a substandard script taken out of the bottom drawer to take advantage of the cash bonanza, with the presiding authorities now apparently seeking to redeem the situation by aping the American industry.) This is not simply a naive matter of political correctness or art-buff snobbery, of believing that Hollywood is always schlock or that there is no such thing as a bad Iranian film. Some quintessentially bad films can be middlebrow art movies saturated with their own sense of superiority. Rather, it is a question of vitality, variety and choice. Repertory cinema, where serendipitous discoveries can be made, is disappearing in favour of multiplex conformism. Increasingly, the work of film-makers like Kiorastami, Ozu, Fellini, Bergman, Ray, Powell and Antonioni is omitted both from what we can see on the big screen and from any discussion of cinema's history. As far as postwar Hollywood is concerned, a distinctively political case for the prosecution on the dumbing charge focuses on the terrified response to the McCarthyite bullying of the early 50s. This capacity for cowardice and self-dumbing is alleged to have resurfaced in the 70s with the Spielberg-inspired trend for \"juvenilisation\" of the movies. In the 80s, Hollywood president Ronald Reagan concealed his native shrewdness in favour of projecting a down-home, aw-shucks innocent who invoked Rambo in support of US interventionism, a Hollywood archetype who attained his apotheosis in the insidious Forrest Gump - whose moral superiority lay in his low IQ.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Jack Nicholson once described her as a cross between a fawn and a Buick. And it is true that, though petite, Jessica Lange has an unexpectedly powerful physique. She looks strong, sexy, and her skin glows with good health. She has a vibrant presence, though there is little of the glitz of Hollywood about her apart from a slightly starry self-consciousness. For Lange is the product of the landscape into which she was born and to which she has returned to raise her own family. Minnesota. A state as far north as you can go before America turns into Canada, a land of dense forests in the north and wild, bleak prairies in the south; harsh winters, a hardy population, many of whose jobs rely on the massive iron ore deposits below the surface. She has come to London to star in a West End production of the great American classic, Long Day's Journey Into Night, Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical portrait of a family in crisis. She is playing the part of Mary Tyrone, a woman in painful decline as her family disintegrates into physical and spiritual ruin around her. One of Lange's directors once observed that she is \"drawn to grief\" like a moth to a flame. O'Neill's masterpiece is, as he writes in a tender dedication to his wife Carlotta, \"a play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood\". It is perfect Lange territory, and she admits the role was irresistible.</p> <p> \"Mary . . . Mary just breaks my heart, you know? I'm always drawn to those kind of characters. I love . . . I mean, I love the sadness in her, I love the loneliness, the fear she has.\" Why should that be? \"I think mostly because they are the areas that touch me most deeply and the ones that I'm most interested in exploring, you know? That kind of shadow. The dark side of a character.</p> <p>I mean, it's always been that way and I don't know why. It's just something that, uh, interests me more than a character that doesn't have those ghosts.\"</p> <p>Lange, who has talked in the past about suffering periods of depression, once said she thought her interest in the tragic, the sad and the lonely came from growing up in the woods of Minnesota. \"Maybe growing up there instils a sense of loneliness and despair in you and conditions the things that move you. Maybe it just comes out of the earth up there. It's something that envelops you.\" Maybe they're just better roles.</p> <p> We meet to discuss her latest venture in a small Italian restaurant behind Waterloo station. It is day five of rehearsals. She met her co-stars for the first time on Monday. She is to play opposite Charles Dance who appears as James Tyrone, Mary's flawed actor husband. So far, things are going well. \"This, for me, is the most exciting part, really,\" she says in her easy drawl. \"The kind of first encounters, and listening to the other voices and trying to figure out how it's all going to kind of mesh together. I mean, we're really just in the first process of discovery. Really hearing it and trying to figure out the thought behind everything, you know? I love that part of it. So I figure this week and the next couple of weeks will be the most thrilling in a way.\" It is a welcome return to the West End for Lange. She was last here four years ago as Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, when she was given an enthusiastic reception by critics and public alike. Like Long Day's Journey Into Night, it was produced by Bill Kenwright and it restored Lange's stage reputation after a less triumphant run in the same role on Broadway in 1992, when critics commented on her \"lack of stage technique, including a voice that is not always audible\" and an \"emotional timidity\", which hardly seems credible in the context of her powerfully emotional film roles. </p> <p>Given Lange's lack of stage experience - her theatre work is limited to her very early career when she was studying acting in New York - it was a bold step to appear on Broadway, in one of the greatest plays ever written by an American. The role of Mary Tyrone is no less ambitious and there are those who are interested to see how the earthy, sexy, physically powerful Jessica Lange will fare as Mary, an ethereal, fragile character who floats in and out of the action, increasingly doped up on morphine. </p> <p>Her appearance at the Lyric Theatre is the latest in a long line of Hollywood imports to London's West End in recent years. Kathleen Turner (The Graduate), Nicole Kidman (The Blue Room), Kevin Spacey (The Ice Man Cometh) and, most recently, Daryl Hannah (The Seven Year Itch) and Macaulay Culkin (Madame Melville). It's a trend that serves a number of purposes; a big name can certainly work wonders for a show's success at the box office; equally, it can also be used to boost a flagging film career. The casting can look gimmicky, opportunistic, though not so in this case. Lange in the role of Mary Tyrone is an enticing prospect for London's theatre critics. </p> <p>She is not particularly nervous about the venture, despite her relative lack of stage experience. Does she think she's a better film actor than stage? \"I've done so much more film than theatre. I don't know,\" she says.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't know how to judge myself. I mean, after doing 22 films, you begin to understand the craft.</p> <p>\"I remember when I was working with [Jack] Nicholson years ago, I mean, it was uncanny his awareness of the camera and how everything was geared toward that, you know? I think that's what a great film actor knows how to do. Make the camera interested, make the camera want to see more. You know, really make the camera move in on you in a way, to study what it is that's going on.\"</p> <p>That surely is what Lange is so good at, too. As the murderous Cora in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), she and Nicholson battle it out for the camera's attention. It's a pretty close run thing. Or as the doomed actress Frances Farmer in Frances (1982); or the tragic country singer Patsy Cline in Sweet Dreams (1985). Lange seizes the camera's attention and holds on to it with both of her tough little hands, her teeth gritted with effort.</p> <p>These are among her best roles - no coincidence, perhaps, given her interest in the dark side of a character. Others have worked less well. On one of the dozens of Jessica Lange websites, a fan called Rebecca poses a conundrum familiar to anyone who has a passing interest in her work. \"Jessica Lange is my favourite actress,\" writes Rebecca, \"but she does seem to make movies that barely get seen or, if they do, are not very good.\" And there's something in that. Lange is revered as one of Hollywood's most talented and intelligent stars - but in among some truly memorable performances there have been some surprisingly poor choices. </p> <p>Lange's private life may now have settled (she is married to Pulitzer prize-winning writer, director and actor Sam Shepard), but professionally it never has, which is perhaps part of its fascination. There was Tootsie (1982), for which she won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as the sweeter-than-candy soap star with whom Dustin Hoffman's character falls in love. Then there was Country (1984), Sweet Dreams (1985), The Music Box (1989), Cape Fear (1991) and Blue Sky (1994), for which she won an Oscar for best actress for her role as the beleaguered military wife of Tommy Lee Jones. But along the way there have also been films ranging from the forgettable, such as Far North (1988), to the absolutely dire, such as Hush (1998). </p> <p>Jessica Lange was born in the small town of Cloquet, Minnesota, the third of four children to Al and Dorothy Lange. Al Lange was a wanderer, a drinker, a dreamer who did a variety of jobs throughout his life, everything from railroad worker to salesman, repeatedly uprooting and moving his family. He was a powerful, charismatic personality - not an easy man. His famous daughter loved him and hated him, but she always needed his approval. When she was a baby, so the story goes, he tossed her off a pier to teach her how to swim. When it came to teaching her to ride, he just put her on the back of a wild pony. </p> <p>Lange seems attracted to powerful, charismatic characters. After school, she got a scholarship to Minneapolis University to study art, where she became a hippy princess - beaded, beautiful, barefoot - but dropped out and went off to see the world with one of her teachers, a Spanish photographer and film-maker called Paco Grande, whom she married. They lived in bohemian New York, then moved to Europe, where they lived with the Gypsies in Spain, following the flamenco fairs in Seville and around Andalusia. From there they went to Amsterdam and on to Paris, where Lange studied mime and lived through the 1968 student revolution. They existed on next to nothing and travelled on a motorbike - the sort of existence most of us dream about as teenagers but few realise. </p> <p>The marriage, however, broke down. Lange returned to America, where she was signed up by Wilhemina, one of the leading model agencies of the day. She claims she was never quite tall enough or thin enough to make it on the catwalk; she did a couple of department store catalogues, but her break into films came when she was cast in the 1976 Dino de Laurentiis remake of King Kong as the ape's love interest. </p> <p>It was a disaster. Lange was lambasted and she didn't appear in a film again for three years. Her next appearance was as the angel of death in All That Jazz (1979), which was directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse, with whom she had an affair. It wasn't until 1981 that she got her big break in Bob Rafelson's The Postman Always Rings Twice, where she excelled as a duplicitous murderess. Nicholson, her co-star, idolised her. \"Few are the men who do not want to fall at the feet of Jessica Lange,\" he said. </p> <p>Her life has been as interesting off screen as on. She once said a quest for intensity had plagued her romantic life. \"It was a trap for me. As long as it was passionate - either negative or positive - then I knew it was love. As long as it was extreme. That was its validity. As soon as anything became too settled, too regular, too placid, I'd have to get in there with the Mixmaster to make sure things were still cooking.\" </p> <p>She embarked on a relationship with Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, with whom she has one daughter. Then, on the set of Frances, she met Shepard, who had a similarly colourful past and with whom she still lives. Lange is probably the better known of the two - just - but Shepard is recognised, in particular, as one of America's leading playwrights. </p> <p>Lange is notoriously reticent about their relationship as a \"movie couple\". When she picked up the best actress Oscar for Blue Sky, Shepard did not accompany her to the ceremony and she did not mention him in her acceptance speech, which provoked comment. But, as she later pointed out, award ceremonies are not his cup of tea, and her life with Shepard is separate from her professional life. Except that is, of course, when they work together. After Frances, they starred in Country and Crimes Of The Heart (1986) together. He also directed her in Far North, which he wrote, drawing on her childhood in Minnesota. She clearly enjoys working with him - they share a passion for the land and she has said that Far North and Crimes Of The Heart were among the most fun to make of all her films. </p> <p> \"As far as Sam and I are concerned, yes, we're both very private people. We just have to guard against becoming so reclusive that we end up like two old hermits living up on top of this hill,\" she was once quoted as saying.</p> <p>There does seem to be an unlikely quaintness about their relationship. Back in 1985, a journalist from the International Herald Tribune interviewing Lange described how Shepard walked in unexpectedly; Lange leaped to his side in mid-sentence as though she had not set eyes on him for weeks. She once said she had made a life-long commitment to \"taking care of Sam\". </p> <p> At 51, she is now relaxed about her career. \"I don't have a tremendous amount of ambition left.\" Was she ever that ambitious? \"Oh yeah, I think so, in the beginning. Of course, not a kind of a killer ambition by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not looking for anything that way any more, I don't think. In the beginning, you're searching for some kind of recognition. And after a certain amount of time, that's really not important any more.\"</p> <p>Her children and family life had a dramatic impact on her career - she loathes being parted from them for any length of time. She has three children; a 19-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who is known as Shura, from her seven-year relationship with Baryshnikov; and Hannah, 14, and Walker, 13, from her relationship with Shepard. All of them will be coming to London to spend varying amounts of time with her while she's doing the play. </p> <p>They will be tutored while they are here, and they will grumble and moan that they are having to leave behind their friends and their lives back home in Minnesota, but Lange has always made sure her children spend plenty of time with her when she's away on location - not just for them. When they were smaller, she says she used to be able to just pack them up and bring them away and they were barely aware of where they were. It was much easier. Now they'd prefer to be left at home, but she can't do it. Why not? \"Because I don't do well without them.\" </p> <p>Ask her what it feels like to be without them and she pauses for a second, then says: \"You know what it feels like? It feels like the end of the world. They're the only thing I think in my life that ever really anchored me, that I've ever felt cemented to. And I just enjoy them more than anyone else in the world. And I'd rather hang out with them than anyone else. I'd rather be with them than with anyone else. I find them infinitely fascinating.\" </p> <p> Lange is refreshingly independent of Hollywood. She has spoken out occasionally - challenging the absurd sums the big stars command for each performance. She has said she would never have plastic surgery - even if she did add that Sam would not approve. She's physically separate from the place - as well as ideologically - never having lived there.</p> <p>Until 1995 she lived in Charlottesville, Virginia, on a farm where Shepard bred horses and raised cattle. Then, when her widowed mother's health began to fail, she took her family back to Minnesota, so that they could grow up amid a network of cousins and second cousins, brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts, great uncles and great aunts. She wanted her children to feel haunted by a place, the way she was as a child, with a powerful sense of belonging. She once said that she would like her gravestone to be inscribed with just one word, \"Mother\".</p> <p>Seven years ago, she was one of a group who travelled to Romania to try to help free children from the nightmarish institutions of the Ceausescu regime. She brought back two children - a boy and a girl. The boy went to live with one family, the little girl stayed with Lange. When she arrived, they thought she was about two years old. It turned out she was in fact six but her muscles had atrophied to such a degree that she had not grown. She had never walked; she had never talked. \"There was this thrilling moment when she started to walk. She got strong and she got healthy,\" says Lange. She never, sadly, learned to talk.</p> <p>After 18 months the girl went to live with the family who were bringing up the Romanian boy brought out of the country at the same time. \"It was not a question of adopting her, it was a question of getting her out and finding her a home and getting her healthy before she went to live with these people. If I had the kind of stability, I would have loved to bring these children up. It was very difficult because of the way I work. I'm always travelling. I'm always going on location. These kids really needed a place where they were just at home. They had never had that.\" </p> <p>Currently, her key preoccupation is the American elections. She is watching the presidential race anxiously from afar. Before coming to London she was heavily involved in campaigning for the Democrats - because the alternative, she believes, would be so disastrous for her country, particularly on abortion rights. Bush is pro-life.</p> <p>She's also concerned about the environment. Bush's record on environmental policies in Texas, where he is governor, she says, are some of the worst in the entire country. \"We are going backward in that country at such an alarming rate, it's really scary. We have this incredible kind of, um, conservative right-wing movement, and if Bush gets elected, it's going to move so far right. I told my kids, 'Look, if Bush is elected, think of where you wanna go. [She laughs - a really funny, infectious laugh.] We'll be leaving for four years.\"</p> <p>Seriously? \"Nooooo, I can't drag my kids out of the country just because I hate the president, although I would be tempted. [She laughs again.] You know, to see his smirking little face on TV every night, and to listen to him - he's such a stupid man. </p> <p>\"They're saying this is the closest election in something like, what, 40 years? That's what's so frightening. You look at the people around you and you think, 'My God, what are you thinking about? There is no contest here. What are you thinking about?'\"</p> <p>She thinks Clinton has been \"a very successful president\", but adds, \"For a man who is so amazingly intelligent, he really has done some extraordinary things. Sometimes you just have to shake your head and think, how could he be so fucking stupid, you know? How could he have blown it like this? The whole scandals! We've been continually hounded by these scandals for the last eight years.\"</p> <p>Lange is more engaged politically than I anticipated. Hollywood has a long and enduring relationship with politics - Warren Beatty, Ronald Reagan, Clint Eastwood, Jane Fonda - but Lange is less known as an activist; someone who is private, cut off, busy living out a rural idyll, doing a bit of photography, \"taking care\" of Sam. We talk about the excitement of 1968 and I ask her what she thinks about the anti-globalism protests which have recently taken place in Prague and, before that, in Seattle. \"It interests me a great deal. I mean, I think it's very dangerous to have the World Trade Organisation making decisions. It's hard enough for people to actually get the government to do what they want. But to have something that's so outside any kind of rules and checks. That I think is very frightening.\" </p> <p> She says she was much more political in the 60s, when an entire generation was galvanised into political action by the Vietnam War, but every once in a while it rears its head again. Like when she, Sissy Spacek and Jane Fonda travelled to Washington to give evidence before something called the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Agriculture in order to highlight the plight of farmers being driven off the land. News reports from the time document that Fonda was the most professional, Spacek the most impassioned and Lange the most heartfelt. </p> <p>It is an issue about which Lange feels particularly strongly because of her own upbringing amid farmers in Minnesota. She cares about the land and those who work on it and you can see it in her work, most evidently in Country, which she produced and in which she plays a farmer's wife struggling to hold farm and family together in the face of ruinous Reaganite policies. It's there in A Thousand Acres (1997), a reworking of King Lear in which a father seeks to divide his farmland among his daughters. There's a campaigning edge to some of her work, which isn't instantly obvious.</p> <p>Would she call herself a feminist? \"No, I would never say that. No, I would never use that term. I've always done what I've wanted. I've never felt anything has stood in my way. I think I've raised my daughters that same way, that they are capable of doing anything they could possibly ever imagine.\" </p> <p>After Long Day's Journey, Lange's next leap into the dark comes when she directs for the first time. She first optioned the novel Machine Dreams, by Jayne Anne Phillips, 15 years ago, and after leaving it gathering dust for years, she returned to it last winter and wrote a draft script. \"The writing was very enjoyable,\" she says. \"There are very few things in my life which I do privately. You know what I mean? Where you are actually alone in a room and it's just you. It was very meditative, very peaceful. It was wonderful to sit on winter afternoons and try to adapt this book.\" </p> <p>Did she feel at all intimidated, tiptoeing as she was into Shepard's territory as writer? \"No, actually,\" she says breezily. \"It didn't intimidate me while I was doing it at all. When I gave him the script to read, I think I hovered nervously around the stairwell to see how he was going to react,\" she says. \"But he was really great about it.\"</p> <p>Writing is not something she finds particularly easy. \"I don't have the discipline to do it. I really don't. I have a hard time just settling in one spot for more than a few moments at a time.\" Directing, however, is another matter. She is very excited about directing. Kathy Bates and Robin Wright have already expressed an interest in the project and once she has got her next film out of the way (she is starring with Christina Ricci in Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation) she'll move to the other side of the camera. \"I'm going to ask everybody I've ever known who's directed anything at all - even traffic - I'm going to ask them how it's done, you know? I have no ego when it comes to that. I want everybody's, everybody's information.\" </p> <p>Heartfelt. Yes, that's it. Lange is someone whose politics, like her career and her private life, is heartfelt. She's driven by her heart and by her emotions; she's constantly getting out the Mixmaster to make sure things are still cooking. Which doesn't always make for sensible decisions, but it does make her daring, and a bit dangerous and at times dazzling. She might bomb, she might be brilliant, but at least she doesn't play it safe</p> <p>Long Day's Journey Into Night will be previewing at the Lyric Theatre, London, from November 6 and runs until March 3.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jack Nicholson once described her as a cross between a fawn and a Buick. And it is true that, though petite, Jessica Lange has an unexpectedly powerful physique. She looks strong, sexy, and her skin glows with good health. She has a vibrant presence, though there is little of the glitz of Hollywood about her apart from a slightly starry self-consciousness. For Lange is the product of the landscape into which she was born and to which she has returned to raise her own family. Minnesota. A state as far north as you can go before America turns into Canada, a land of dense forests in the north and wild, bleak prairies in the south; harsh winters, a hardy population, many of whose jobs rely on the massive iron ore deposits below the surface. She has come to London to star in a West End production of the great American classic, Long Day's Journey Into Night, Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical portrait of a family in crisis. She is playing the part of Mary Tyrone, a woman in painful decline as her family disintegrates into physical and spiritual ruin around her. One of Lange's directors once observed that she is \"drawn to grief\" like a moth to a flame. O'Neill's masterpiece is, as he writes in a tender dedication to his wife Carlotta, \"a play of old sorrow, written in tears and blood\". It is perfect Lange territory, and she admits the role was irresistible. \"Mary . . . Mary just breaks my heart, you know? I'm always drawn to those kind of characters. I love . . . I mean, I love the sadness in her, I love the loneliness, the fear she has.\" Why should that be? \"I think mostly because they are the areas that touch me most deeply and the ones that I'm most interested in exploring, you know? That kind of shadow. The dark side of a character. I mean, it's always been that way and I don't know why. It's just something that, uh, interests me more than a character that doesn't have those ghosts.\" Lange, who has talked in the past about suffering periods of depression, once said she thought her interest in the tragic, the sad and the lonely came from growing up in the woods of Minnesota. \"Maybe growing up there instils a sense of loneliness and despair in you and conditions the things that move you. Maybe it just comes out of the earth up there. It's something that envelops you.\" Maybe they're just better roles. We meet to discuss her latest venture in a small Italian restaurant behind Waterloo station. It is day five of rehearsals. She met her co-stars for the first time on Monday. She is to play opposite Charles Dance who appears as James Tyrone, Mary's flawed actor husband. So far, things are going well. \"This, for me, is the most exciting part, really,\" she says in her easy drawl. \"The kind of first encounters, and listening to the other voices and trying to figure out how it's all going to kind of mesh together. I mean, we're really just in the first process of discovery. Really hearing it and trying to figure out the thought behind everything, you know? I love that part of it. So I figure this week and the next couple of weeks will be the most thrilling in a way.\" It is a welcome return to the West End for Lange. She was last here four years ago as Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, when she was given an enthusiastic reception by critics and public alike. Like Long Day's Journey Into Night, it was produced by Bill Kenwright and it restored Lange's stage reputation after a less triumphant run in the same role on Broadway in 1992, when critics commented on her \"lack of stage technique, including a voice that is not always audible\" and an \"emotional timidity\", which hardly seems credible in the context of her powerfully emotional film roles. Given Lange's lack of stage experience - her theatre work is limited to her very early career when she was studying acting in New York - it was a bold step to appear on Broadway, in one of the greatest plays ever written by an American. The role of Mary Tyrone is no less ambitious and there are those who are interested to see how the earthy, sexy, physically powerful Jessica Lange will fare as Mary, an ethereal, fragile character who floats in and out of the action, increasingly doped up on morphine. Her appearance at the Lyric Theatre is the latest in a long line of Hollywood imports to London's West End in recent years. Kathleen Turner (The Graduate), Nicole Kidman (The Blue Room), Kevin Spacey (The Ice Man Cometh) and, most recently, Daryl Hannah (The Seven Year Itch) and Macaulay Culkin (Madame Melville). It's a trend that serves a number of purposes; a big name can certainly work wonders for a show's success at the box office; equally, it can also be used to boost a flagging film career. The casting can look gimmicky, opportunistic, though not so in this case. Lange in the role of Mary Tyrone is an enticing prospect for London's theatre critics. She is not particularly nervous about the venture, despite her relative lack of stage experience. Does she think she's a better film actor than stage? \"I've done so much more film than theatre. I don't know,\" she says. \"I wouldn't know how to judge myself. I mean, after doing 22 films, you begin to understand the craft. \"I remember when I was working with [Jack] Nicholson years ago, I mean, it was uncanny his awareness of the camera and how everything was geared toward that, you know? I think that's what a great film actor knows how to do. Make the camera interested, make the camera want to see more. You know, really make the camera move in on you in a way, to study what it is that's going on.\" That surely is what Lange is so good at, too. As the murderous Cora in The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), she and Nicholson battle it out for the camera's attention. It's a pretty close run thing. Or as the doomed actress Frances Farmer in Frances (1982); or the tragic country singer Patsy Cline in Sweet Dreams (1985). Lange seizes the camera's attention and holds on to it with both of her tough little hands, her teeth gritted with effort. These are among her best roles - no coincidence, perhaps, given her interest in the dark side of a character. Others have worked less well. On one of the dozens of Jessica Lange websites, a fan called Rebecca poses a conundrum familiar to anyone who has a passing interest in her work. \"Jessica Lange is my favourite actress,\" writes Rebecca, \"but she does seem to make movies that barely get seen or, if they do, are not very good.\" And there's something in that. Lange is revered as one of Hollywood's most talented and intelligent stars - but in among some truly memorable performances there have been some surprisingly poor choices. Lange's private life may now have settled (she is married to Pulitzer prize-winning writer, director and actor Sam Shepard), but professionally it never has, which is perhaps part of its fascination. There was Tootsie (1982), for which she won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her role as the sweeter-than-candy soap star with whom Dustin Hoffman's character falls in love. Then there was Country (1984), Sweet Dreams (1985), The Music Box (1989), Cape Fear (1991) and Blue Sky (1994), for which she won an Oscar for best actress for her role as the beleaguered military wife of Tommy Lee Jones. But along the way there have also been films ranging from the forgettable, such as Far North (1988), to the absolutely dire, such as Hush (1998). Jessica Lange was born in the small town of Cloquet, Minnesota, the third of four children to Al and Dorothy Lange. Al Lange was a wanderer, a drinker, a dreamer who did a variety of jobs throughout his life, everything from railroad worker to salesman, repeatedly uprooting and moving his family. He was a powerful, charismatic personality - not an easy man. His famous daughter loved him and hated him, but she always needed his approval. When she was a baby, so the story goes, he tossed her off a pier to teach her how to swim. When it came to teaching her to ride, he just put her on the back of a wild pony. Lange seems attracted to powerful, charismatic characters. After school, she got a scholarship to Minneapolis University to study art, where she became a hippy princess - beaded, beautiful, barefoot - but dropped out and went off to see the world with one of her teachers, a Spanish photographer and film-maker called Paco Grande, whom she married. They lived in bohemian New York, then moved to Europe, where they lived with the Gypsies in Spain, following the flamenco fairs in Seville and around Andalusia. From there they went to Amsterdam and on to Paris, where Lange studied mime and lived through the 1968 student revolution. They existed on next to nothing and travelled on a motorbike - the sort of existence most of us dream about as teenagers but few realise. The marriage, however, broke down. Lange returned to America, where she was signed up by Wilhemina, one of the leading model agencies of the day. She claims she was never quite tall enough or thin enough to make it on the catwalk; she did a couple of department store catalogues, but her break into films came when she was cast in the 1976 Dino de Laurentiis remake of King Kong as the ape's love interest. It was a disaster. Lange was lambasted and she didn't appear in a film again for three years. Her next appearance was as the angel of death in All That Jazz (1979), which was directed and choreographed by Bob Fosse, with whom she had an affair. It wasn't until 1981 that she got her big break in Bob Rafelson's The Postman Always Rings Twice, where she excelled as a duplicitous murderess. Nicholson, her co-star, idolised her. \"Few are the men who do not want to fall at the feet of Jessica Lange,\" he said. Her life has been as interesting off screen as on. She once said a quest for intensity had plagued her romantic life. \"It was a trap for me. As long as it was passionate - either negative or positive - then I knew it was love. As long as it was extreme. That was its validity. As soon as anything became too settled, too regular, too placid, I'd have to get in there with the Mixmaster to make sure things were still cooking.\" She embarked on a relationship with Russian dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, with whom she has one daughter. Then, on the set of Frances, she met Shepard, who had a similarly colourful past and with whom she still lives. Lange is probably the better known of the two - just - but Shepard is recognised, in particular, as one of America's leading playwrights. Lange is notoriously reticent about their relationship as a \"movie couple\". When she picked up the best actress Oscar for Blue Sky, Shepard did not accompany her to the ceremony and she did not mention him in her acceptance speech, which provoked comment. But, as she later pointed out, award ceremonies are not his cup of tea, and her life with Shepard is separate from her professional life. Except that is, of course, when they work together. After Frances, they starred in Country and Crimes Of The Heart (1986) together. He also directed her in Far North, which he wrote, drawing on her childhood in Minnesota. She clearly enjoys working with him - they share a passion for the land and she has said that Far North and Crimes Of The Heart were among the most fun to make of all her films. \"As far as Sam and I are concerned, yes, we're both very private people. We just have to guard against becoming so reclusive that we end up like two old hermits living up on top of this hill,\" she was once quoted as saying. There does seem to be an unlikely quaintness about their relationship. Back in 1985, a journalist from the International Herald Tribune interviewing Lange described how Shepard walked in unexpectedly; Lange leaped to his side in mid-sentence as though she had not set eyes on him for weeks. She once said she had made a life-long commitment to \"taking care of Sam\". At 51, she is now relaxed about her career. \"I don't have a tremendous amount of ambition left.\" Was she ever that ambitious? \"Oh yeah, I think so, in the beginning. Of course, not a kind of a killer ambition by any stretch of the imagination. But I'm not looking for anything that way any more, I don't think. In the beginning, you're searching for some kind of recognition. And after a certain amount of time, that's really not important any more.\" Her children and family life had a dramatic impact on her career - she loathes being parted from them for any length of time. She has three children; a 19-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who is known as Shura, from her seven-year relationship with Baryshnikov; and Hannah, 14, and Walker, 13, from her relationship with Shepard. All of them will be coming to London to spend varying amounts of time with her while she's doing the play. They will be tutored while they are here, and they will grumble and moan that they are having to leave behind their friends and their lives back home in Minnesota, but Lange has always made sure her children spend plenty of time with her when she's away on location - not just for them. When they were smaller, she says she used to be able to just pack them up and bring them away and they were barely aware of where they were. It was much easier. Now they'd prefer to be left at home, but she can't do it. Why not? \"Because I don't do well without them.\" Ask her what it feels like to be without them and she pauses for a second, then says: \"You know what it feels like? It feels like the end of the world. They're the only thing I think in my life that ever really anchored me, that I've ever felt cemented to. And I just enjoy them more than anyone else in the world. And I'd rather hang out with them than anyone else. I'd rather be with them than with anyone else. I find them infinitely fascinating.\" Lange is refreshingly independent of Hollywood. She has spoken out occasionally - challenging the absurd sums the big stars command for each performance. She has said she would never have plastic surgery - even if she did add that Sam would not approve. She's physically separate from the place - as well as ideologically - never having lived there. Until 1995 she lived in Charlottesville, Virginia, on a farm where Shepard bred horses and raised cattle. Then, when her widowed mother's health began to fail, she took her family back to Minnesota, so that they could grow up amid a network of cousins and second cousins, brothers and sisters, uncles, aunts, great uncles and great aunts. She wanted her children to feel haunted by a place, the way she was as a child, with a powerful sense of belonging. She once said that she would like her gravestone to be inscribed with just one word, \"Mother\". Seven years ago, she was one of a group who travelled to Romania to try to help free children from the nightmarish institutions of the Ceausescu regime. She brought back two children - a boy and a girl. The boy went to live with one family, the little girl stayed with Lange. When she arrived, they thought she was about two years old. It turned out she was in fact six but her muscles had atrophied to such a degree that she had not grown. She had never walked; she had never talked. \"There was this thrilling moment when she started to walk. She got strong and she got healthy,\" says Lange. She never, sadly, learned to talk. After 18 months the girl went to live with the family who were bringing up the Romanian boy brought out of the country at the same time. \"It was not a question of adopting her, it was a question of getting her out and finding her a home and getting her healthy before she went to live with these people. If I had the kind of stability, I would have loved to bring these children up. It was very difficult because of the way I work. I'm always travelling. I'm always going on location. These kids really needed a place where they were just at home. They had never had that.\" Currently, her key preoccupation is the American elections. She is watching the presidential race anxiously from afar. Before coming to London she was heavily involved in campaigning for the Democrats - because the alternative, she believes, would be so disastrous for her country, particularly on abortion rights. Bush is pro-life. She's also concerned about the environment. Bush's record on environmental policies in Texas, where he is governor, she says, are some of the worst in the entire country. \"We are going backward in that country at such an alarming rate, it's really scary. We have this incredible kind of, um, conservative right-wing movement, and if Bush gets elected, it's going to move so far right. I told my kids, 'Look, if Bush is elected, think of where you wanna go. [She laughs - a really funny, infectious laugh.] We'll be leaving for four years.\" Seriously? \"Nooooo, I can't drag my kids out of the country just because I hate the president, although I would be tempted. [She laughs again.] You know, to see his smirking little face on TV every night, and to listen to him - he's such a stupid man. \"They're saying this is the closest election in something like, what, 40 years? That's what's so frightening. You look at the people around you and you think, 'My God, what are you thinking about? There is no contest here. What are you thinking about?'\" She thinks Clinton has been \"a very successful president\", but adds, \"For a man who is so amazingly intelligent, he really has done some extraordinary things. Sometimes you just have to shake your head and think, how could he be so fucking stupid, you know? How could he have blown it like this? The whole scandals! We've been continually hounded by these scandals for the last eight years.\" Lange is more engaged politically than I anticipated. Hollywood has a long and enduring relationship with politics - Warren Beatty, Ronald Reagan, Clint Eastwood, Jane Fonda - but Lange is less known as an activist; someone who is private, cut off, busy living out a rural idyll, doing a bit of photography, \"taking care\" of Sam. We talk about the excitement of 1968 and I ask her what she thinks about the anti-globalism protests which have recently taken place in Prague and, before that, in Seattle. \"It interests me a great deal. I mean, I think it's very dangerous to have the World Trade Organisation making decisions. It's hard enough for people to actually get the government to do what they want. But to have something that's so outside any kind of rules and checks. That I think is very frightening.\" She says she was much more political in the 60s, when an entire generation was galvanised into political action by the Vietnam War, but every once in a while it rears its head again. Like when she, Sissy Spacek and Jane Fonda travelled to Washington to give evidence before something called the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Agriculture in order to highlight the plight of farmers being driven off the land. News reports from the time document that Fonda was the most professional, Spacek the most impassioned and Lange the most heartfelt. It is an issue about which Lange feels particularly strongly because of her own upbringing amid farmers in Minnesota. She cares about the land and those who work on it and you can see it in her work, most evidently in Country, which she produced and in which she plays a farmer's wife struggling to hold farm and family together in the face of ruinous Reaganite policies. It's there in A Thousand Acres (1997), a reworking of King Lear in which a father seeks to divide his farmland among his daughters. There's a campaigning edge to some of her work, which isn't instantly obvious. Would she call herself a feminist? \"No, I would never say that. No, I would never use that term. I've always done what I've wanted. I've never felt anything has stood in my way. I think I've raised my daughters that same way, that they are capable of doing anything they could possibly ever imagine.\" After Long Day's Journey, Lange's next leap into the dark comes when she directs for the first time. She first optioned the novel Machine Dreams, by Jayne Anne Phillips, 15 years ago, and after leaving it gathering dust for years, she returned to it last winter and wrote a draft script. \"The writing was very enjoyable,\" she says. \"There are very few things in my life which I do privately. You know what I mean? Where you are actually alone in a room and it's just you. It was very meditative, very peaceful. It was wonderful to sit on winter afternoons and try to adapt this book.\" Did she feel at all intimidated, tiptoeing as she was into Shepard's territory as writer? \"No, actually,\" she says breezily. \"It didn't intimidate me while I was doing it at all. When I gave him the script to read, I think I hovered nervously around the stairwell to see how he was going to react,\" she says. \"But he was really great about it.\" Writing is not something she finds particularly easy. \"I don't have the discipline to do it. I really don't. I have a hard time just settling in one spot for more than a few moments at a time.\" Directing, however, is another matter. She is very excited about directing. Kathy Bates and Robin Wright have already expressed an interest in the project and once she has got her next film out of the way (she is starring with Christina Ricci in Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation) she'll move to the other side of the camera. \"I'm going to ask everybody I've ever known who's directed anything at all - even traffic - I'm going to ask them how it's done, you know? I have no ego when it comes to that. I want everybody's, everybody's information.\" Heartfelt. Yes, that's it. Lange is someone whose politics, like her career and her private life, is heartfelt. She's driven by her heart and by her emotions; she's constantly getting out the Mixmaster to make sure things are still cooking. Which doesn't always make for sensible decisions, but it does make her daring, and a bit dangerous and at times dazzling. She might bomb, she might be brilliant, but at least she doesn't play it safe Long Day's Journey Into Night will be previewing at the Lyric Theatre, London, from November 6 and runs until March 3.",

      "body": "<p><strong>1950s</strong></p> <p>1950 <strong>Sunset Boulevard </strong> (High) <br>The sour underside of Hollywood's self-mythologisation, with Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond immortalising the generation of silent-film stars cast aside by the sound revolution of two decades before. Billy Wilder's acid-dipped movie was arguably the first successful essay in biting the hand that feeds, and initiated a film-about-film-making micro-genre that encompasses everything from The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) to The Player (1992).</p> <p>1952 <strong>Singin' in the Rain</strong> (Low) <br>The anti-Sunset Boulevard, if you will. Set on the cusp of the silent movie era, it's an uncomplicated celebration of the burgeoning sound film era. Hollywood inspects itself, and comes up smelling of roses.</p> <p>1955 <strong>Blackboard Jungle </strong> (Low) <br> Hollywood faced up to the sudden appearance of the teen generation (The Wild One, with Brando, was a year earlier; Rebel Without a Cause, with Dean, the same year). It reacted with admirable cynicism: Blackboard Jungle is the first proper rock'n'roll movie, packaging a series of tunes around sledgehammer attempts to connect with the teen audience. It's an approach that's barely changed since, for over the decades teens - and their likes and dislikes - have formed the movies' most crucial demographic.</p> <p>1958 <strong>A Bout de Soufle</strong> (High) <br> Landmark first entry in the French new wave - directed by Godard, story by Truffaut - whose obsessive recycling of movie iconography blazed a trail in cinema's appreciation of its own cultural influence. </p> <p><strong>1960s</strong></p> <p>1960 <strong>Psycho </strong>(High and low) <br> The hitherto genial master of suspense shocked his legions of fans when he turned thoroughly nasty, and ushered in a new form of cinematic terror. The sick-in-the-head killer has since formed one of cinema's most reliable earners, but there were risks for the film-makers too. Michael Powell's Peeping Tom was released the same year, and virtually ended his career overnight.</p> <p>1960 <strong>La Dolce Vita </strong> (High) <br> Fellini's cautionary parable of the moral emptiness at the heart of Italy's postwar economic miracle centres on the cult of celebrity and its function as an all-pervasive social lubricant. In the movie that gave us the word \"paparazzo\", gossip columnist Marcello Mastroianni is a ruthlessly etched metaphor for the parasitical habits of a society enthralled with its own media. </p> <p>1964 <strong> The Gospel According to St Matthew </strong> (Low) <br> A heartfelt rendering of the sacred text from Marxist director Pasolini, which remains one of the most accomplished extrusions into cinema of the politics of ethnography. </p> <p>1964 <strong>A Hard Day's Night </strong> (Low) <br>The teen-oriented movie took a second giant step with the Beatles' first cash cow which is something of a pop-culture masterpiece, thanks to director Richard Lester. Its mix of music and unforced self-referentiality became a template, the Spiceworld movie being its most recent manifestation.</p> <p>1967 <strong>Bonnie and Clyde </strong> (High and low) <br> Breakthrough antiheroic fable that established European new wave practice in Hollywood. As the eponymous bank-robbing partnership, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway helped explode the thematic straitjacket of mainstream cinema and pioneered the use of aestheticised violence.</p> <p> 1969 <strong>Easy Rider </strong> (Low) (pictured) <br> The underground went overground with Dennis Hopper's cheaply shot biker movie. As an ode to freedom, its cultural place became thoroughly compromised, especially as its most memorable tropes were rapidly absorbed into the music video industry.</p> <p> <strong>1970s </strong></p> <p>1970 <strong> MASH </strong> (High) <br> Elaborate response to the first war to go out live on TV, Vietnam, recast as a black comedy set in the bloodsoaked chaos of a military hospital in an earlier one, Korea. Altman's verit\u00e9 camera style echoed both documentary-film practice and the low-budget looseness of the European new wave; a conflation that would reach its height a decade later in Apocalypse Now, as camera crews are filmed filming an assault.</p> <p> 1971 <strong>A Clockwork Orange</strong> (High and low) <br> Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Burgess's parable expertly points up the symbiotic relationship between high and low culture: Malcolm McDowell is the boot boy whose depravities are inspired by, and scored to, everything from Beethoven to Arthur Freed. The response-conditioning processes of Alex's therapy are key instances of the debate over violence and its relationship to media and society.</p> <p>1972 <strong>Deep Throat </strong> (Low) <br>Possibly the grubbiest moment in the history of cinema's cultural wars - a hardcore porn movie which became a mainstream hit. </p> <p>1975 <strong>Jaws </strong> (Low) <br>As the Hollywood auteur generation began to run out of steam, one of their upstart compadres blew them all out of the water - by inventing the event movie. Hollywood was never the same again.</p> <p>1976 <strong>Network </strong> (High) <br> Bitter attack on TV's power to dilute and eviscerate, marking a shift of the movies' cultural assault from self-flagellation to a new enemy. Peter Finch is the newscaster who threatens to kill himself on air, Faye Dunaway the marketing executive who's prepared to sacrifice everything for ratings. Prefigures The Insider (1999) in its indictment of the broadcast media.</p> <p>1978 <strong>Superman </strong> (Low) <br>As cinema's financial horizons began to expand after Jaws and Star Wars, new sources for inspiration began to open up. Christopher Reeve's version of the Man of Steel hit gold, and a marriage between the movies and the most frowned-on of all literary forms - the comic - was cemented.</p> <p>1980 <strong>Star Trek: The Motion Picture </strong> (Low) <br>A new step forward in cross-media partnership. TV, as Network had demonstrated, was the movies' enemy; now it could become their friend. The first Star Trek movie, playing on the loyalties of the fans of a long-cancelled TV show, was by no means a sure-fire proposition. Its success, however, led directly to a string of sequels.</p> <p><strong> 1980s</strong></p> <p>1980 <strong> Raging Bull</strong> (High and low) <br> Martin Scorsese's ode to embittered masculinity via the psychotic nobility of Jake LaMotta was the last genuine masterwork of Hollywood's auteur generation - it exited with a precise layering of cinematic mythology and representation, as De Niro/ LaMotta invokes the ghost of Marlon Brando/Terry Malloy in a culture-conflating final scene.</p> <p>1982 <strong>First Blood </strong> (Low) <br> The first Rambo movie - the character that became the brutal exemplar of American machismo during the 80s, and in many ways defined the low culture of the era.</p> <p>1986 <strong>Top Gun <br> Low </strong> <br>Another cross-media operation: Tony Scott lifted images directly from his own car commercials to power the Tom Cruise fly-boy vehicle.</p> <p>1986 <strong>She's Gotta Have It </strong> (High) <br> The rise of African-American cinema in the 80s radically changed the movie landscape. Lee's literate, quickfire debut film specifically rebutted the hitherto unchallenged assumption that blaxploitation - low culture cinema of the most impressive kind - was the only African-American genre that could survive, and ushered in an entire generation of film-makers.</p> <p>1989 <strong>Batman<br> Low</strong> <br> Hollywood crossed a line with Batman: the first time that a movie earned more through merchandising and licensing than through box-office receipts. Hence the Hollywood conventional wisdom that films are simply loss leaders for the toys.</p> <p> <strong>1990s</strong></p> <p>1991 <strong>Reservoir Dogs<br> High and low</strong> <br> Cinema's modern obsession for recycling pop culture started here - literally in the opening scene, when a crew of stick-up artists deconstruct Madonna's Like a Virgin. Tarantino's film destroyed at a stroke the equation of genre cinema with low culture and, displaying a dizzying breadth of cinematic reference and film-making dexterity, singlehandedly proved that populist forms could be made to work in the service of the most high-minded of propositions.</p> <p>1993 <strong>Jurassic Park </strong> (Low) <br> Spielberg's warning on the dangers of reality-manipulation, accomplished, ironically, with the finest live-action CGI yet seen. </p> <p>1994 <strong>Three Colours Red </strong> (High) <br> A landmark less for its content than for its defeat at the hands of Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs follow-up Pulp Fiction for high culture cinema's most sought-after prize, the Cannes Palme d'Or. Kieslowski's last film, and the closing part of a trilogy much admired by an embattled European cinema, its failure at Cannes demonstrated the comprehensive cultural hegemony of American independent cinema in the 90s.</p> <p>1994 <strong>Dumb and Dumber </strong> (Low) <br> The film that excited cultural commentators across the globe into bringing the phrase \"dumbing down\" into general circulation.

      "bodyText": "1950s 1950 Sunset Boulevard (High) The sour underside of Hollywood's self-mythologisation, with Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond immortalising the generation of silent-film stars cast aside by the sound revolution of two decades before. Billy Wilder's acid-dipped movie was arguably the first successful essay in biting the hand that feeds, and initiated a film-about-film-making micro-genre that encompasses everything from The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) to The Player (1992). 1952 Singin' in the Rain (Low) The anti-Sunset Boulevard, if you will. Set on the cusp of the silent movie era, it's an uncomplicated celebration of the burgeoning sound film era. Hollywood inspects itself, and comes up smelling of roses. 1955 Blackboard Jungle (Low) Hollywood faced up to the sudden appearance of the teen generation (The Wild One, with Brando, was a year earlier; Rebel Without a Cause, with Dean, the same year). It reacted with admirable cynicism: Blackboard Jungle is the first proper rock'n'roll movie, packaging a series of tunes around sledgehammer attempts to connect with the teen audience. It's an approach that's barely changed since, for over the decades teens - and their likes and dislikes - have formed the movies' most crucial demographic. 1958 A Bout de Soufle (High) Landmark first entry in the French new wave - directed by Godard, story by Truffaut - whose obsessive recycling of movie iconography blazed a trail in cinema's appreciation of its own cultural influence. 1960s 1960 Psycho (High and low) The hitherto genial master of suspense shocked his legions of fans when he turned thoroughly nasty, and ushered in a new form of cinematic terror. The sick-in-the-head killer has since formed one of cinema's most reliable earners, but there were risks for the film-makers too. Michael Powell's Peeping Tom was released the same year, and virtually ended his career overnight. 1960 La Dolce Vita (High) Fellini's cautionary parable of the moral emptiness at the heart of Italy's postwar economic miracle centres on the cult of celebrity and its function as an all-pervasive social lubricant. In the movie that gave us the word \"paparazzo\", gossip columnist Marcello Mastroianni is a ruthlessly etched metaphor for the parasitical habits of a society enthralled with its own media. 1964 The Gospel According to St Matthew (Low) A heartfelt rendering of the sacred text from Marxist director Pasolini, which remains one of the most accomplished extrusions into cinema of the politics of ethnography. 1964 A Hard Day's Night (Low) The teen-oriented movie took a second giant step with the Beatles' first cash cow which is something of a pop-culture masterpiece, thanks to director Richard Lester. Its mix of music and unforced self-referentiality became a template, the Spiceworld movie being its most recent manifestation. 1967 Bonnie and Clyde (High and low) Breakthrough antiheroic fable that established European new wave practice in Hollywood. As the eponymous bank-robbing partnership, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway helped explode the thematic straitjacket of mainstream cinema and pioneered the use of aestheticised violence. 1969 Easy Rider (Low) (pictured) The underground went overground with Dennis Hopper's cheaply shot biker movie. As an ode to freedom, its cultural place became thoroughly compromised, especially as its most memorable tropes were rapidly absorbed into the music video industry. 1970s 1970 MASH (High) Elaborate response to the first war to go out live on TV, Vietnam, recast as a black comedy set in the bloodsoaked chaos of a military hospital in an earlier one, Korea. Altman's verit\u00e9 camera style echoed both documentary-film practice and the low-budget looseness of the European new wave; a conflation that would reach its height a decade later in Apocalypse Now, as camera crews are filmed filming an assault. 1971 A Clockwork Orange (High and low) Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Burgess's parable expertly points up the symbiotic relationship between high and low culture: Malcolm McDowell is the boot boy whose depravities are inspired by, and scored to, everything from Beethoven to Arthur Freed. The response-conditioning processes of Alex's therapy are key instances of the debate over violence and its relationship to media and society. 1972 Deep Throat (Low) Possibly the grubbiest moment in the history of cinema's cultural wars - a hardcore porn movie which became a mainstream hit. 1975 Jaws (Low) As the Hollywood auteur generation began to run out of steam, one of their upstart compadres blew them all out of the water - by inventing the event movie. Hollywood was never the same again. 1976 Network (High) Bitter attack on TV's power to dilute and eviscerate, marking a shift of the movies' cultural assault from self-flagellation to a new enemy. Peter Finch is the newscaster who threatens to kill himself on air, Faye Dunaway the marketing executive who's prepared to sacrifice everything for ratings. Prefigures The Insider (1999) in its indictment of the broadcast media. 1978 Superman (Low) As cinema's financial horizons began to expand after Jaws and Star Wars, new sources for inspiration began to open up. Christopher Reeve's version of the Man of Steel hit gold, and a marriage between the movies and the most frowned-on of all literary forms - the comic - was cemented. 1980 Star Trek: The Motion Picture (Low) A new step forward in cross-media partnership. TV, as Network had demonstrated, was the movies' enemy; now it could become their friend. The first Star Trek movie, playing on the loyalties of the fans of a long-cancelled TV show, was by no means a sure-fire proposition. Its success, however, led directly to a string of sequels. 1980s 1980 Raging Bull (High and low) Martin Scorsese's ode to embittered masculinity via the psychotic nobility of Jake LaMotta was the last genuine masterwork of Hollywood's auteur generation - it exited with a precise layering of cinematic mythology and representation, as De Niro/ LaMotta invokes the ghost of Marlon Brando/Terry Malloy in a culture-conflating final scene. 1982 First Blood (Low) The first Rambo movie - the character that became the brutal exemplar of American machismo during the 80s, and in many ways defined the low culture of the era. 1986 Top Gun Low Another cross-media operation: Tony Scott lifted images directly from his own car commercials to power the Tom Cruise fly-boy vehicle. 1986 She's Gotta Have It (High) The rise of African-American cinema in the 80s radically changed the movie landscape. Lee's literate, quickfire debut film specifically rebutted the hitherto unchallenged assumption that blaxploitation - low culture cinema of the most impressive kind - was the only African-American genre that could survive, and ushered in an entire generation of film-makers. 1989 Batman Low Hollywood crossed a line with Batman: the first time that a movie earned more through merchandising and licensing than through box-office receipts. Hence the Hollywood conventional wisdom that films are simply loss leaders for the toys. 1990s 1991 Reservoir Dogs High and low Cinema's modern obsession for recycling pop culture started here - literally in the opening scene, when a crew of stick-up artists deconstruct Madonna's Like a Virgin. Tarantino's film destroyed at a stroke the equation of genre cinema with low culture and, displaying a dizzying breadth of cinematic reference and film-making dexterity, singlehandedly proved that populist forms could be made to work in the service of the most high-minded of propositions. 1993 Jurassic Park (Low) Spielberg's warning on the dangers of reality-manipulation, accomplished, ironically, with the finest live-action CGI yet seen. 1994 Three Colours Red (High) A landmark less for its content than for its defeat at the hands of Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs follow-up Pulp Fiction for high culture cinema's most sought-after prize, the Cannes Palme d'Or. Kieslowski's last film, and the closing part of a trilogy much admired by an embattled European cinema, its failure at Cannes demonstrated the comprehensive cultural hegemony of American independent cinema in the 90s. 1994 Dumb and Dumber (Low) The film that excited cultural commentators across the globe into bringing the phrase \"dumbing down\" into general circulation. The Farrelly brothers' comedy, with Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels, was universally reviled on its release (most notoriously, it was savaged by a TV panel who hadn't even seen it). The Farrellys, however, had the last laugh when they hit box office (and low culture) gold with There's Something About Mary. 1995 Toy Story (High) Animation has always been Hollywood's quiet money-maker, but few Disney products achieved thematic sophistication equal to their ground-breaking computer-generated animation. Both a Hans Christian Andersen-esque fable of toys coming to life, and an elegiac tribute to the disintegration of classical cultural virtues. 1996 Scream High and low A Tarantino-esque reclamation of cinema's scuzziest genre - teen slasher movies - given a sophisticated treatment that acknowledged its unwritten rules and structural robustness. The high point of postmodern cinematic wit. 1997 Boogie Nights High and low Twenty-five years after Deep Throat, hardcore pornography became fit subject matter for one of America's cutting-edge highbrow film-makers, Paul Thomas Anderson. An ambitious, auteurist depiction of two decades of porn, Boogie Nights marked the climactic reversal of the symbiotic relationship between high and low cinema culture. 1998 Shakespeare in Love High America's cinematic Anglophilia reasserted itself as period literary films surged in popularity. Financed in the US and a multi-Oscar-winner, Shakespeare in Love harnessed the talents of stage veteran Tom Stoppard in a comic spoonful-of-sugar treatment of the literary establishment's eternal touchstone. 1998 The Truman Show (Low) Maybe the relentless upward drive was getting to Hollywood: LA's king of low-culture movies, Jim Carrey, became the conduit for an easy-access meditation on the pitfalls of a director's power. 1999 Being John Malkovich High Cult of celebrity viewed though an MTV perspective - directed by music-promo prankster Spike Jonze. With Malkovich himself in the lead, Jonze and his screenwriter Charlie Kaufman created a densely layered commentary on society and cinema's obsession with itself. 1999 Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (Low) The current champion of low-culture cinema, destroying all comers. Sitting on a franchise that has renewed itself with reissues, special editions, prequels and sequels, George Lucas is the single figure most responsible for Hollywood's current configuration. Whether that's a good or bad thing is what this debate is all about.",

      "byline": "Martin Bell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The rivalry between those who choose \"planks\" (skis) and those who prefer \"trays\" (snowboards) is well-documented. As a lifelong skier who decided to learn snowboarding 10 years ago, I feel anyone who doesn't do a bit of both is missing out. But not everyone has the time to learn both modes, so which one to go for? Here's a run through of the pros and cons. </p> <p><strong> Ease of learning</strong></p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong>The initial learning curve is pretty fast. The most natural mode of transport we ever learn, walking, involves independent leg movement. So does skiing. Once you've got the hang of the snowplough turn, usually on the first or second day, you're capable of skiing around the whole mountain, as long as it's not too steep. Even parallel turns usually come fairly quickly.But the problem with skiing is that it's too easy to get away with doing it badly. </p> <p>You can spend all your life making turns on blue and red runs by rotating your whole body, but as soon as you get on to steeper slopes, you'll get \"found out\". You will only master bumpis and off-piste with style when you learn to pivot your feet beneath you while keeping your upper body still and facing down the slope. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>Anyone who has done it will tell you that learning to snowboard is a long and bruising process at first, only to be undertaken when the snow is soft. Imagine learning to windsurf with out the water! For me it was humbling: even after three days, it took me half an hour to ride down a run that I could ski down in around two minutes. </p> <p>As a skier, I felt very constricted having both feet clamped together, but I imagine that that feels unnatural for most people. There's almost no other activity where it is necessary - even skateboarders and surfers can move their feet a bit. And in snowboarding, there are two totally different types of turn to learn: backside (edging with your heels) and frontside (edging with your toes). </p> <p>Like most skiers, I found the backside turn easier at first (at least your toes are pointing roughly where you're going), and the frontside utterly alien. But, ironically, once you've picked up the frontside turn, you'll find it's the more stable and natural movement. It has been found that some skiers learn snowboarding quicker if they are given a pair of ski poles for balance. </p> <p>Soon after learning to snowboard on piste, you can try going off-piste. It will be a revelation - you'll realise that all the pain and anguish was worth it. Snowboarding in powder is virtually easier than doing it on piste, and is one of the greatest sensations known to humankind. Young snowboarders will also soon progress to taking air in the terrain park and halfpipe. But only the most masochistic will ever try to manoeuvre a snowboard through a mogulfield. </p> <p><strong>Convenience</strong> </p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong>Of course, the worst part is walking to the lifts, clumping along with your ski boots open, dropping skis, poles, gloves and goggles as you go. You try to look cool with your skis on your shoulder, just like your instructor, but they keep slipping apart, and anyway they hurt your collarbone. But once you're on the mountain, you're in your element. Chairlifts present no problem, and once you've got the hang of T-bars and Poma lifts, they're fairly comfortable to ride. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>Walking through the car park, you're the coolest of dudes. In your comfy soft boots you can saunter past the clumping skiers, snowboard nonchalantly tucked under one arm. But on the mountain, a snowboard is not the best-thought-out method of getting around. </p> <p>To ride any lift, you have to remove your back foot. Step-in bindings have made this easier, but most of them still keep clogging up with ice. At the top of every lift you increase your risk of haemorrhoids, sitting in the snow as you struggle to strap your back foot in again. T-bars and Poma lifts are, literally, a pain in the groin. And when you encounter the dreaded flat sections, you have four options: take the back foot out and \"scoot\"; bend down and claw yourself along with your fingernails; hop like a demented frog; or beg your skiing mates for a tow. </p> <p><strong>Pose factor</strong> </p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong> At the moment, skintight suits are just not \"in\". Ski-racers need to wear them for aerodynamics, but most other young skiers have adopted fairly baggy gear. The \"New School freeriders\", acrobats who are inventing new skiing tricks based upon snowboarding, would not be seen dead in anything that isn't baggy. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>You may think those young whippersnappers in the terrain park look pretty scruffy, in their baggy, drab-coloured gear. But they have spent good money to achieve that look. The snowboards themselves should have fairly subdued, retro graphics (no palm trees, motorbikes or naked women nowadays, thank you very much). </p> <p><strong>The lingo</strong> </p> <p><strong>Skiing: </strong>Has always been a source of techno-head jargon, and you'll still encounter plenty of that, especially with the current breakneck pace of ski development: torsional rigidity, sidecut dimensions, taper angle, ramp angle, alignment, vibration dampening, multi-injection, lateral transmission, dualtec, prolink, beta profile, monocoque, energy frame. The list is endless, and that's before you've even left the shop. Once you're on the mountain, there's plenty more: initiation, angulation, anticipation, upper-lower body separation, rise line, zipper line... </p> <p>But to be fair, these terms are sometimes coined by technicians or instructors to encapsulate a complicated concept, which would otherwise require many more words to describe. </p> <p><strong>Snowboarding: </strong>Has adopted Californian surfer slang, and added a few terms of its own. If something is extremely tough, it's \"gnarly\", \"sick\", or \"rad\". To describe something especially good, the epithets \"wicked\", \"bad\", or \"dope\". </p> <p>Of course, these words may already have been superseded by even newer ones.

      "bodyText": "The rivalry between those who choose \"planks\" (skis) and those who prefer \"trays\" (snowboards) is well-documented. As a lifelong skier who decided to learn snowboarding 10 years ago, I feel anyone who doesn't do a bit of both is missing out. But not everyone has the time to learn both modes, so which one to go for? Here's a run through of the pros and cons. Ease of learning Skiing: The initial learning curve is pretty fast. The most natural mode of transport we ever learn, walking, involves independent leg movement. So does skiing. Once you've got the hang of the snowplough turn, usually on the first or second day, you're capable of skiing around the whole mountain, as long as it's not too steep. Even parallel turns usually come fairly quickly.But the problem with skiing is that it's too easy to get away with doing it badly. You can spend all your life making turns on blue and red runs by rotating your whole body, but as soon as you get on to steeper slopes, you'll get \"found out\". You will only master bumpis and off-piste with style when you learn to pivot your feet beneath you while keeping your upper body still and facing down the slope. Snowboarding: Anyone who has done it will tell you that learning to snowboard is a long and bruising process at first, only to be undertaken when the snow is soft. Imagine learning to windsurf with out the water! For me it was humbling: even after three days, it took me half an hour to ride down a run that I could ski down in around two minutes. As a skier, I felt very constricted having both feet clamped together, but I imagine that that feels unnatural for most people. There's almost no other activity where it is necessary - even skateboarders and surfers can move their feet a bit. And in snowboarding, there are two totally different types of turn to learn: backside (edging with your heels) and frontside (edging with your toes). Like most skiers, I found the backside turn easier at first (at least your toes are pointing roughly where you're going), and the frontside utterly alien. But, ironically, once you've picked up the frontside turn, you'll find it's the more stable and natural movement. It has been found that some skiers learn snowboarding quicker if they are given a pair of ski poles for balance. Soon after learning to snowboard on piste, you can try going off-piste. It will be a revelation - you'll realise that all the pain and anguish was worth it. Snowboarding in powder is virtually easier than doing it on piste, and is one of the greatest sensations known to humankind. Young snowboarders will also soon progress to taking air in the terrain park and halfpipe. But only the most masochistic will ever try to manoeuvre a snowboard through a mogulfield. Convenience Skiing: Of course, the worst part is walking to the lifts, clumping along with your ski boots open, dropping skis, poles, gloves and goggles as you go. You try to look cool with your skis on your shoulder, just like your instructor, but they keep slipping apart, and anyway they hurt your collarbone. But once you're on the mountain, you're in your element. Chairlifts present no problem, and once you've got the hang of T-bars and Poma lifts, they're fairly comfortable to ride. Snowboarding: Walking through the car park, you're the coolest of dudes. In your comfy soft boots you can saunter past the clumping skiers, snowboard nonchalantly tucked under one arm. But on the mountain, a snowboard is not the best-thought-out method of getting around. To ride any lift, you have to remove your back foot. Step-in bindings have made this easier, but most of them still keep clogging up with ice. At the top of every lift you increase your risk of haemorrhoids, sitting in the snow as you struggle to strap your back foot in again. T-bars and Poma lifts are, literally, a pain in the groin. And when you encounter the dreaded flat sections, you have four options: take the back foot out and \"scoot\"; bend down and claw yourself along with your fingernails; hop like a demented frog; or beg your skiing mates for a tow. Pose factor Skiing: At the moment, skintight suits are just not \"in\". Ski-racers need to wear them for aerodynamics, but most other young skiers have adopted fairly baggy gear. The \"New School freeriders\", acrobats who are inventing new skiing tricks based upon snowboarding, would not be seen dead in anything that isn't baggy. Snowboarding: You may think those young whippersnappers in the terrain park look pretty scruffy, in their baggy, drab-coloured gear. But they have spent good money to achieve that look. The snowboards themselves should have fairly subdued, retro graphics (no palm trees, motorbikes or naked women nowadays, thank you very much). The lingo Skiing: Has always been a source of techno-head jargon, and you'll still encounter plenty of that, especially with the current breakneck pace of ski development: torsional rigidity, sidecut dimensions, taper angle, ramp angle, alignment, vibration dampening, multi-injection, lateral transmission, dualtec, prolink, beta profile, monocoque, energy frame. The list is endless, and that's before you've even left the shop. Once you're on the mountain, there's plenty more: initiation, angulation, anticipation, upper-lower body separation, rise line, zipper line... But to be fair, these terms are sometimes coined by technicians or instructors to encapsulate a complicated concept, which would otherwise require many more words to describe. Snowboarding: Has adopted Californian surfer slang, and added a few terms of its own. If something is extremely tough, it's \"gnarly\", \"sick\", or \"rad\". To describe something especially good, the epithets \"wicked\", \"bad\", or \"dope\". Of course, these words may already have been superseded by even newer ones. But when referring to the sideways-standing sport, whatever you do, don't ever call it \"boarding\" - real snowboarders hate that word; it's either \"snowboarding\", or \"riding\". The injuries Skiing: No longer lives up to its \"break a leg\" reputation, but still keeps plenty of knee surgeons in golf-club fees, mainly due to the ubiquitous anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures. In addition, upper body and head injuries, caused by collisions with other piste users or trees, are increasing as pistes get busier and better equipment makes people ski more confidently - and faster. Snowboarding: Much safer for leg injuries, although the ankles sometimes suffer. But upper body injuries are frequent. If you stack on the frontside, you may break your wrist or collarbone. If you slam backwards, your coxyx (\"tailbone\") could snap. Avalanche danger Skiing: The media coverage of freeride events is motivating more skiers to go off-piste. Even in the (relatively) safety of North America, more skiers are choosing to exit the ski areas through the backcountry gates, and take their chances.

      "body": "<p>As seems appropriate, the new culinary millennium opened with a clash of batterie de cuisine in the daily press, with Delia Smith and Antony Worral Thompson going at it for all they're worth, which is considerable. The path to television is paved with gold as far as many cooks are concerned. Whether this public display actually is symptomatic of a dumbing down of our culinary culture is open to debate. What is beyond question is that it is indicative of massive social change.</p> <p> Look back 50 years and you find a Britain limping painfully out of the wartime economy, still shrouded in rationing, still shuddering at the memory of Woolton pie, snoek and the Monday jug. Tea rationing ended in 1952, sugar, eggs and sweets rationing in 1953, and cheese and meat rationing in 1954. Expectations were, from the perspective of today, painfully restricted. Ingredients, dishes and cooking techniques still took the prewar standards as their model. Yet the forces which were to bring about the changes in what we eat and the way we eat it were already at work.</p> <p> The war brought about the most radical democratisation of society this country has ever undergone. Granted, there is still a way to go before all sense of class is eliminated. Nevertheless, wartime experience of deprivation, diet and death encompassed all classes, and government-controlled, centralised food production and distribution meant that the nation's diet was pretty much uniform. </p> <p> The war also released women from the absolute tyranny of domestic life.

      "bodyText": "As seems appropriate, the new culinary millennium opened with a clash of batterie de cuisine in the daily press, with Delia Smith and Antony Worral Thompson going at it for all they're worth, which is considerable. The path to television is paved with gold as far as many cooks are concerned. Whether this public display actually is symptomatic of a dumbing down of our culinary culture is open to debate. What is beyond question is that it is indicative of massive social change. Look back 50 years and you find a Britain limping painfully out of the wartime economy, still shrouded in rationing, still shuddering at the memory of Woolton pie, snoek and the Monday jug. Tea rationing ended in 1952, sugar, eggs and sweets rationing in 1953, and cheese and meat rationing in 1954. Expectations were, from the perspective of today, painfully restricted. Ingredients, dishes and cooking techniques still took the prewar standards as their model. Yet the forces which were to bring about the changes in what we eat and the way we eat it were already at work. The war brought about the most radical democratisation of society this country has ever undergone. Granted, there is still a way to go before all sense of class is eliminated. Nevertheless, wartime experience of deprivation, diet and death encompassed all classes, and government-controlled, centralised food production and distribution meant that the nation's diet was pretty much uniform. The war also released women from the absolute tyranny of domestic life.

Fabulously rich and fabulously luxurious, certainly, and fabulously opulent. I have been twice, the second time for serious field work with my old friend Antrobus, an eater of the old school. We turned our backs on the set-price lunch at \u00a328 for three courses and the menu gourmand at \u00a3160, which delivers seven principal courses and any number of walk-ons for two people, to explore the full \u00e0 la carte, on which the cheapest course is \u00a322 and the most expensive is \u00a336.</p> <p>On the whole, our dishes came from the upper end of the price spectrum - supr\u00eame de pigeonneau en raviole; langoustines \u00e0 la vapeur, sauce vierge et sa petite salade de pomme de terre; queue de boeuf farci aux champignons, cr\u00e8me raifort; assiette de veau au deux saveurs; tiare marjolaine and cheese. You don't go away feeling hungry after that lot.</p> <p>The menu is a paeon of praise to the traditional values of French high culinary culture. The cooking is old fashioned, richly wrought, prodigiously upholstered. Mr Burton-Race is as unafraid of butter and cream as he is of truffles, foie gras and caviar. But there is fabulous depth to the saucing (which is not the same as sticky over-reductions), a sophisticated muscularity, precision in textures, sureness in handling these materials. Each dish is constructed on epic proportions. There's not much of this kind of thing around.</p> <p>And if you like this kind of thing, then this is the kind of thing - pigeon breast as soft as suede in the emollient embrace of foie gras and fine pasta; creamed horseradish pouring out of a delicate, hollow pastry cap down over a stupendously squidgy block of oxtail, the apotheosis of unctuous richness; a sequence of veal bits and bobs, each cooked with masterly precision and sauced separately to release wave after wave of silky flavours.</p> <p>And the cost? Well, I hoped that we might not come to that. There is a price, of course, a ridiculous price, an absurd price. Our lunch at John Burton-Race cost \u00a3274. That included \u00a3109 for non-food items, but \u00a3165 for two is very, very steep. Compare that to \u00a3124.50 all in at Foliage, which included \u00a359.50 of drinks, with the full dinner \u00e0 la carte menu offered at \u00a332.50 for three courses. Both wine lists are as absurdly overpriced as they are overblown, but at Burton-Race a glass of champagne is \u00a311, while at Foliage a mere \u00a37.50. A bottle of water will cost you \u00a33.75 at JB-R, \u00a33.50 at Foliage, and so on and so on. In terms of value for money, Foliage wins hands down. But if an out-of-wallet experience is no barrier and guilt no consideration, then feel the quality of John Burton-Race. Isn't that what indulgence is all about?</p>",

The backlash against the demonstrators appeared to grow yesterday when the Federation of Small Businesses, previously sympathetic to their demands, took the unusual step of disassociating itself from the protest leader, David Handley. Mr Handley yesterday met police in London for what he described as a friendly meeting to explain his group's protest plans, including a rally in Hyde Park, London.",

      "bodyText": "Attempts by the embattled European Central Bank to push up the value of the euro were brushed aside by the foreign exchange markets as two separate bouts of intervention failed to boost the currency. In a surprise move the ECB announced that it had taken unilateral action to sell US dollars and Japanese yen in order to prevent the weakness of the euro feeding through into higher inflation. Dealers estimated that the countries of the euro zone spent around $3bn on the operation. Although the imminence of the US presidental election ruled out participation by the Federal Reserve in the second attempt to prop up the euro in six weeks, the ECB timed its first move to come just hours before the publication of jobs data from the US pointing to a marked slowdown. Figures from the US labour department showed that non-farm payrolls increased by 137,000 - well down on the 185,000 increase predicted by market analysts, who had expected demand for workers to be stronger as companies prepared for the Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations. Although the ECB clearly hoped to catch the dollar at a weak moment, early gains were quickly reversed. Evidence that the long US boom might be coming to an end was shrugged off by dealers, forcing the ECB into a second foray into the markets during the afternoon. By the end of the day in London, the euro was trading at around 86.40 cents, the level at which the ECB first stepped in but well down on its intra-day peak of just under 88 cents. The move came some six weeks after the ECB - in concert with the Federal Reserve as well as other G7 central banks including the Bank of England - sought to a defend the euro, which has lost almost 30% of its value against the dollar since its launch at the beginning of last year. At an ECB conference of central bankers and academics on price stability, held yesterday in Frankfurt, board member Ottmar Issing said the bank had decided to intervene \"owing to its concern about the global and domestic repercussions of the exchange rate of the euro, including its impact on price stability\". \"The ECB confirms its view that the external value of the euro does not reflect the favourable conditions of the euro area.\" The ECB is concerned that the falling value of the euro is exacerbating the impact of higher oil prices, pushing inflation in euroland above the central bank's 2% ceiling. Mr Issing added that the action had been unilateral. \"We have not invited the authorities of other currencies to join the intervention.\" Other G7 central banks had been informed of the ECB's plans in advance, he said, and the move should be seen as a continuation of the coordinated action on September 22. Nick Parsons, a currency analyst at Commerzbank in London, said the intervention had been \"brilliantly timed and well executed\". \"The intervention in September was defensive, the intervention today was aggressive.The ECB is showing that it can play with the big boys, that it is one of the big boys.\" But others, such as Michael Klawitter at investment bank WestLB, were unimpressed. \"I have strong doubts whether it will work.

We could have watched Newsnight, or the Discovery Channel; tried to finish yesterday's Guardian crossword; or talked to someone. Come to think of it, about 45 million mostly did not watch.</p> <p>The enduring television debate, more than most cultural discussions, always has depended on the debaters' starting point. A short declaration, therefore, of my own baggage: 62 years old; watched the 1953 Coronation on an early-adopter neighbour's new set; tuned in full time around satire time (TW3, 1962); wrote about television, then the media at large, for this newspaper, 1970-89, and here and elsewhere since. An old fart, maybe.</p> <p>On the other hand, don't try telling me, as one bright fortyish BBC suit did recently, that John Birt's visionary espousal of the internet etc enabled the public service broadcaster to reposition itself in a way it couldn't have done under the old monopoly/cosy duopoly. Wrong. The BBC reinvented itself, highly professionally, in the face of trickier competition, in 1960, around 1970 and post-Channel 4 in the early 80s. ITV has similar watersheds. The only risk of youth is time lost reinventing the wheel.</p> <p>Anyway, even within the television empires there have always been any number of rival cultural viewpoints. Fourteen Olympiads ago, as the BBC's pioneering outside broadcast producers realised that the 1948 London games offered their first big showcase, one of their own veterans warned: \"It is clear that a large percentage of viewers still try to see all the programmes televised. It is hoped this habit will not persist during the Olympic Games, or viewers will easily be recognised in the streets of London by their pallid appearance!\"</p> <p>That summer, the 120,000-odd television-owning homes (up from 15,000 in 1946) were offered all of 17.5 hours' live Olympic coverage in one week, bringing the BBC's total transmissions to a shattering 29 hours. It took the Coronation, my neighbours and ITV to kickstart the box-buying habit: in 1955, 4.5 million homes had one; in 1960, 10.5m; in 1968 when colour launched, 15.1m; in 1975, 17.7m. Thereafter, pretty well saturation. Today, with our multi-set households, around 23 million homes contain about 55 million sets.</p> <p>So television in Britain really started toddling only in 1955, with the launch of ITV, and got sparky round about 1962, the same time as (vide Philip Larkin) sex began, the BBC reinvented satire, ITV reached Cornwall and a Midlands schoolteacher called Mary Whitehouse started twitching. Since when, it's a short history - but a rich, bumpy, edgy, money-bugged, politico-ridden, fashion-prone one - of a gadget to which most of us devote more of our attention than is strictly sensible. The question is: to what end?</p> <p>I am not a believer in golden ages. It is very easy to pick out golden moments from any of the past four decades of television programming and mourn that they don't make them like that any more. But that is to forget the great mass of schedule fodder that filled the time between the good bits.</p> <p>Yet the 70s could stake a good claim to the golden age title if we had to award one. This was the period when the takeup of colour brought both creative opportunities and the cash, from the higher licence fee and enhanced airtime rates, to enable programme makers to tilt at them. BBC2, under David Attenborough, had got into its stride. ITV emerged from the trauma of the 1969 franchise round, still without commercial competition as the fourth channel debate ground on, led by a clutch of executives who, if they didn't exactly embrace the regulation near-monopoly inflicted on them, made the most of it.</p> <p>So, through these years, both systems produced memorable and innovative work. In documentaries, the BBC continued the line it had started with Kenneth Clark's Civilisation into Jacob Bronowski's The Ascent of Man and Alistair Cooke's America, while Thames Television set a benchmark with Jeremy Isaacs' team's mammoth The World at War. The decade went out on another high: David Attenborough's Life on Earth.</p> <p>At the same time, lighter, more flexible technologies brought individuals into closer focus, as in Paul Watson's The Family or Roger Graef's The Space Between Words, and allowed the journalists of World in Action, Panorama and This Week to test new boundaries. Drama, then as now the engine of a television schedule, was no less rich, certainly in its peaks. Alongside a string of lavish costume series - Elizabeth R, War and Peace, Edward the Seventh, Upstairs Downstairs - and Granada's delicately crafted series of dramatised short stories, Country Matters, ran a continuing thread of original work, as both single plays and mini-series. From the Ken Loach/Jim Allen/Tony Garnett school of radical politics came Days of Hope and more. It was an ITV company, Thames, that backed the provocative Naked Civil Servant, and Howard Schuman's satirical musical series, Rock Follies. And it was the decade which Dennis Potter entered with Where Adam Stood and exited with the breathtaking achievement of Pennies From Heaven.</p> <p>As for comedy, just look at the BBC's repeats and a clutch of satellite channels. All that said, I dipped at random into the schedules for a day at this time of year in 1977 - roughly the midpoint in television's history post-1955. It evokes nostalgia, rather than envy, except perhaps for sports fans finding a Muhammad Ali world title fight in peak time on BBC1, rather than at a premium rate on a satellite subscription channel. The children had Val Singleton's Blue Peter Special Assignment on Brighton; the family had The Muppet Show. But the mainstream drama is routine, with Emmerdale Farm and Crossroads flanking the early evening ITV news.</p> <p>What is most striking, looking back from this era of themed evenings and greater programming focus, is the classic mixed schedule on all three channels, including BBC2 virtually running through its remit in one night, from gardening via money, music and sociology to Anna Karenina and The Book Programme - and a 12.10 am closedown.</p> <p>For alongside the feast, ran, if not famine, then significant rationing. ITV opened up daytime programming for grownups, only to dump it while an advertising blip nipped the bottom line; and even the licence fee bonanza didn't let the BBC compete for long. In 1978, when it tried to bring BBC2's 7pm opening forward two hours, the unions' protests blacked out both channels. Nor was it just the unions who might be said to have got a bit above themselves at this time. One came to hear among some broadcasters the theory of television as social cement. The fact that a high proportion of the population watched a programme, be it Coronation Street, the Morecambe and Wise Show, the Nine O'Clock News, the Cup Final, or the Queen's Christmas address, was taken as conferring some special status upon the entire medium.</p> <p>But it was, surely, a wholly artificial situation, derived from shortage of supply, much as the sales figures of newpapers in the 50s, - when paper rationing limited their size - were boosted by people buying more than one.</p> <p>Aggregate audience ratings are a convenient currency for trading commercial airtime, but even in the 70s seminal research on audience behaviour demonstrated that averages concealed comings and goings on a grand scale: of those watching a series one week, only 55% would be back the next, though the total might be the same. The arrival of Channel 4 in 1982 showed how several million people at a time were ready to decamp, given a choice. The coming of multichannel television in the 90s and now, increasingly, of the internet as an alternative way of spending time must knock the social cement concept of broadcast television definitively on the head. One can point to certain moments where the claim could be made - the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, was watched by more than half the population - but they will be increasingly rare.</p> <p>Television, in a word, looks to be moving off-centre. Students of censorship will recognise the pattern, across four centuries: be it the printing press, the theatre, the cinema or the radio, state regulation retreats as the medium's cultural centrality, and its perceived threat to the establishment, is diffused.</p> <p>Thus, the 20th century saw the evaporation of the Lord Chamberlain pawing through theatre scripts, of the Hays Office dictating celluloid etiquette (the UK's film censors are even now loosening the final apron strings), of the demand for most sorts of \"balance\" on the hundreds of radio stations which in just 30 years have overtaken the BBC's Home, Light and Third programmes.</p> <p>Perhaps the dawn of the 21st century sees television going the same way: teled\u00e4mmerung, the twilight of TV. The marginalisation of a 45-year-old medium, after all, would fit our society's wider redundancy pattern. It could be a better explanation than \"dumbing down\", too. Laud the glories of the 70s though I may, the present is undoubtedly rich in talent. It's just harder to spot it among the glut of tabloid-hyped Zo\u00ebs while 50- or 60-something directors, producers and writers, with track records to die for, have their ideas turned down by 30- or 40-something commissioning editors - \"unless you let [30-something] direct it\". That's showbusiness. Let's reinvent the wheel.</p> <p>On the other hand, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? has to be the best quiz show ever invented, the brilliant Labour-from-the-60s drama Our Friends From the North did get made by the BBC in the 90s and Melvyn Bragg, bless him, is still fighting for his pop art South Bank Show as though London Weekend/Granada was still the same company that 20-odd years ago scooped Prix Italias for films on Benjamin Britten and Stravinsky.</p> <p>So, it's not all bad. It's certainly not all dumb. It is also, quite possibly, the least Americanised television system in the Coca-Colonised world. But, like the EU, it has grown broader, not deeper.</p> <p>They are launching an electronic gizmo that will browse the schedules to find the programmes you seem to like (well, ones like the ones you have switched on before) and serve them up to you.

Whatever could have possessed the assembled judges, bishops, dons, civil servants and others to boo one of their own? The reason was his recent appointment as chairman of the Independent Television Authority - the regulator of the new commercial channel that was to bring an end to the BBC's monopoly. The clubmen were expressing their outrage that money-making should be allowed to invade a cultural domain, albeit a \"popular\" one.</p> <p>The episode is significant precisely because the medium in question was television, the greatest single transformer of cultural life since 1945. The transformation took place with remarkable speed. In 1946 there were only 15,000 TV licences, mostly in London; by 1956 there were over 5 million, and pretty much the whole country could receive transmissions; by 1960 this had doubled to 10m, and by 1969 nine out of 10 households had a television. Clark himself did not possess a television at the time. In its early days, it was understood that television was a medium principally watched by the lower orders: television, Noel Coward explained with camp magnificence, \"is for appearing on, not watching\".</p> <p>But the potential of TV quickly became clear. Indeed, Clark himself was to become one of its great beneficiaries, especially as the presenter in 1969-70 of a 13-part BBC series simply called Civilisation. Civilisation here meant the high art and music of western Europe, and Clark made clear that he thought culture in the present was going to the dogs. The barbarians were now well inside the gate in cultural terms, and as Clark crisply put it, \"popular taste is bad taste, as any honest man with experience will agree\".</p> <p>Clark's manner of social grandeur was part of his authority in this role, and in measuring the distance travelled in Britain's cultural journey over the last half-century or so, perhaps no change has been more important than the loosening of the connection between social status and cultural authority. There are, necessarily, elites who exercise disproportionate power in most areas of social and cultural life, but there are now a far greater variety of such elites than 50 years ago, and, crucially, they are much less likely to overlap, still less to form a series of concentric circles. Concomitantly, the notion of a single hierarchy of cultural forms now has to coexist with a much more pluralist acceptance of a diversity of equally legitimate cultural activities. At the beginning of the 21st century, even the distinction between \"high\" and \"low\" culture no longer works. For many people under 30 today, the ministry responsible for the most significant part of their cultural life is the Ministry of Sound.</p> <p>This expansionist narrative partly rests on a shift in the sense of \"culture\" itself. As Stuart Hall, doyen of that form of sociology-plus-street cred that has become known as \"cultural studies\", influentially put it: \"Culture not as a body of work, or particular media, or even as a set of ideal standards and rules, but rather as lived experience, the consciousness of a whole society; that peculiar order, pattern, configuration of valued experience, expressed now in imaginative art of the highest order, now in the most popular and proverbial of forms, in gesture and language, in myth and ideology, in modes of communication and in forms of social relationship and organisation.\"</p> <p>In the middle of the 20th century, Britain was, numerically speaking, still overwhelmingly working class. And it was a highly class-conscious society, with class identities recognisable at a glance and strong patterns of deference governing relations between classes. Half a century later, inequality and exploitation may be no less pervasive in British society, but an enormous rise in general prosperity and an accompanying change in social attitudes mean that the rigid pyramid of the class structure no longer corresponds to the lived experience of daily life in the way it once did.</p> <p>The seeds of this change were sown in the 40s, a decade which saw the working class register substantial gains in their standard of living and their political influence. The second world war had the greatest impact here, rescuing large swathes of the population from the long night of un- or under-employment and disturbing many of the assumptions of service and subordination on which prewar social relations had been based. But although the radicalising experience of the second world war, the confidence and bargaining power which full employment gave to the working class, and the consequent electoral triumph in 1945 challenged the established social order, it is important to remember just how little cultural radicalism there was among Labour's leaders (apparently Attlee \"suffered acutely if the port was circulated the wrong way at his dinner table\").</p> <p>Nonetheless, the social changes consequent upon greatly increased prosperity were highly visible in the ensuing decades. One of these was the rise of what was called the \"affluent worker\": a long period from the late 40s of full employment and rising real wages meant that the average manual worker and his family were enjoying a much greater level of prosperity than ever before. A second change is what was called \"the embourgeoisement of the working class\". This was not just a matter of increased prosperity, but a fundamental change of identity. It involved repudiating the old self-consciously separate, fatalistic, working-class stance, and adopting broadly middle-class attitudes and ways of life, including saving and the pursuit of upward social mobility, as well as the development of more individualistic and self-interested political allegiances.</p> <p>Contributing to this blurring of class identities, the decades of postwar prosperity brought vast new markets into existence, and the technological innovations which responded to these markets introduced a greater diversity of cultural media. The development of commercial television after 1954 is an obvious example; the multiplication of radio stations, at first in the form of \"pirates\", is another. And the phenomenon of the \"pop star\" - the new celebrities of the 50s and 60s - would have been impossible without widespread ownership of record players. What records were to music, the paperback was to books, leading to what one might call the Penguinification of British reading. Paperback publishing had been in its infancy in the 40s, but in the course of the 50s the whole commercial exploitation of this medium was transformed: from selling a few hundred thousand copies in total, Penguin's sales rocketed to the point where in 1959 alone they sold 12m paperbacks. The 60s saw an even more extraordinary expansion, and by 1968 their annual sales had risen to 29m.</p> <p>These large sales were the fruits of new marketing strategies which skilfully exploited the potential links between different media. The success of John Braine's Room at the Top illustrates this trend. It appeared as a hardback, with accompanying newspaper serialisation, in 1957; it was published as a paperback in 1959, and in the same year, crucially, it appeared as a film. A sequel and a television series came later. Critics of the expanding cultural forms complained of \"Americanisation\", as the great engine of capitalism exploited new markets, but this can also be seen in terms of a diminished deference towards Europe as the traditional home of inherited culture. Increased national self-assertion in other parts of the British Isles could be seen as loss of deference towards the internalised values of Englishness. In the spaces thus opened up for groups, most notably ethnic groups, to assert their demands for recognition and dignity, public respect for distinctive forms of cultural self-expression has partly functioned as compensation for lack of political and economic power.</p> <p>But the disorienting speed of such social and technological change generates nostalgia, and nostalgia can sometimes seem to have been the dominant ethos of British culture since the 70s. Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman and a host of costume-drama producers have fed this appetite for self-definition through loss. At its core is the self-indulgence involved in revelling in the defeat of the stylish and the graceful by the harsh realities of the functional, the effective, the modern. The result is the psychological or cultural mechanism by which sheer pastness confers a charm, the frisson of irrecoverability, the pleasures of longing. Things not in themselves particularly beautiful, things considered the height of new, functional vulgarity when they first appeared, come to seem the quintessence of a more lovable age. Think how this has happened to 19th-century terraced houses, or to 30s cinemas, or to 50s railways, and so on. Culture is regarded as something that happens elsewhere, and in England the elsewhere of choice for many people is the past.</p> <p>As a result of these complex, dislocating changes, much contemporary cultural debate consists in trying to pick one's way between, on the one hand, an embattled nostalgia expressed in ill-directed cries of \"dumbing down\" and, on the other, a knee-jerk cultural correctness that locates virtue exclusively in whatever can be claimed to have been previously neglected, marginalised or, best of all, suppressed. In this situation, bewilderment and indifference disguise themselves as relativism and tolerance. But abstaining from making cultural judgments is not necessarily the best way to show respect for other people's differences: that can be simply to hand control over our lives to the unsleeping drive of capital to maximise its returns.</p> <p>We are, by and large, very pleased with ourselves about the distance we have travelled from a world dominated by the values of the Athenaeum dining room circa 1954, and to express our self-satisfaction we rush to damn all that we suspect still belongs to that world by calling it \"elitist\". The elites represented there have indeed lost much of their prestige, but the elites gathered in boardrooms have thereby only increased their power. The complacent and intolerant attitudes on many issues of those who took their social and cultural superiority for granted half a century ago may indeed be part of a world well lost - but those muted boos were not altogether wrong in identifying the force that would transform British culture beyond the powers of even the Kenneth Clarks of this world to regulate it.</p> <p><b>Kenneth Clark on St Paul's</b><br></p> <p>\"In spite of the awkwardness of imposing a Roman elevation on to a gothic plan, [Wren] has achieved areas of such refined and inventive detail as to make St Paul's Cathedral the chief monument of English classicism.

Britain's teenagers at least are likeliest to rely for their appreciation of the Bard's dramatic genius on one Baz Luhrmann. Luhrmann's 1996 film of Romeo and Juliet, transposed to \"Verona Beach, California\", was greeted by critics as a clever updating of this classic and a jolly good thing for American teenagers. In the last four or five years, it has been the lens through which Shakespeare has been seen at secondary schools throughout the land. </p> <p>The National Curriculum has made Shakespeare inescapable for 13-year-olds in England and Wales. SATs tests in English taken at the age of 14 require comment on extracts from a Shakespeare play. Man of the Millennium for Radio 4 listeners, Shakespeare is thus also probably the only writer, perhaps the only dead person, that almost every teenager in Britain will have heard of. For the last few years, Romeo and Juliet has been the work studied by the majority of schools. For most pupils, it has been Luhrmann's film as much as Shakespeare's play. </p> <p> When, at the beginning of the film, the names of the play's characters flash up over their pictures in TV reports of recent family feuding, we might enjoy the witty anachronism. Those responsible for introducing the play to adolescents recognise a teaching aid. (Indeed, Luhrmann is himself a former teacher.) The exams for which they teach go out of their way to ask directorial questions: how should a scene be played? What instructions should actors be given? These are not really questions about staging, with the theatre an unknown place to most adolescents. Film - or rather, video of film - is their only access to Shakespeare in production. </p> <p>Teachers will report the more awkward consequences of the life of a play being so reliant on a film-maker. Examinees have to be seriously discouraged from believing that Mercutio is necessarily a black transvestite, or that his obscurely beautiful \"Queen Mab\" speech is made while taking E (a tab is placed squarely on his tongue in Luhrmann's updating). Many 14-year-olds appear to believe that Shakespeare brilliantly imagined viewing the electric first encounter between the star-crossed lovers through a huge tank of tropical fish. This has replaced the conviction (born of the Franco Zefferelli Romeo and Juliet) that the same courtship takes place to the sound of a song in an inadvertently hilarious male falsetto. </p> <p> More difficult to gauge are the effects of the much-screened \"Animated Shakespeare\" adaptations which, for some, are their only experience of an actual \"production\". These hurry their characters to eventual catastrophe or betrothal in about half-an-hour. Macbeth is a frighteningly accelerated tragedy in the original (Shakespeare's shortest) - its animated incarnation takes the viewer down to darkness at the speed of a runaway train.</p> <p>The Scottish play is clearly in the bloodstream. Was there a tabloid newspaper that did not, in its coverage of the recent Yugoslav revolution, refer to Mrs Milosevic as \"the Lady Macbeth of the Balkans\"? Perhaps it was the improbably raven-black hair that did it, but every hack seemed inescapably to recall the \"butcher and his fiend-like queen\" from distant schooldays. </p> <p> I have heard more than one report of English teachers exclaiming in the staffroom, \"If only Baz Luhrmann would do Macbeth as well.\" In the absence of such a wished-for production, Roman Polanski's sub-Rosemary's Baby film version (plenty of nakedness, plenty of witchcraft, and a new ending) still governs perceptions. Another, BBC version from 1983 is apparently rendered almost unusable by Jane Lapotaire's rendition of Lady Macbeth's infamous \"Come, you spirits/ That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here\" soliloquy. The actress appears to bring herself to orgasm by the climax of the speech (\"Hold, hold!\"), causing unmanageable embarrassment or incomprehension in the classroom. </p> <p>So Macbeth and a few million teenagers await the film-maker who wishes to reshape Shakespeare. British directors (Kenneth Branagh, Trevor Nunn) have, in recent years, seemed more concerned with their likely American audience. Their settings have been designed to satisfy American tastes for English heritage: for Hamlet, Branagh hired Blenheim Palace and pumped artificial snow over the grounds; for Twelfth Night, Nunn used exquisite Cornish National Trust properties. </p> <p>Yet, for those who would avoid English Heritage self-indulgence, Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet also contains a warning about fashion following. The film makes rather striking use of music by Prince, still on the very pulse of MTV culture while it was being made. Now, apparently, this needs as much annotation in London classrooms as any Elizabethan diction. The teachers have Prince CDs; the pupils ask \"Prince who?\" Yet, as one English teacher told me, even the most ignorant often greet Shakespeare with a kind of breezy familiarity. As Ben Jonson admitted, \"not of an age, but for all time!\"</p>",

More difficult to gauge are the effects of the much-screened \"Animated Shakespeare\" adaptations which, for some, are their only experience of an actual \"production\". These hurry their characters to eventual catastrophe or betrothal in about half-an-hour. Macbeth is a frighteningly accelerated tragedy in the original (Shakespeare's shortest) - its animated incarnation takes the viewer down to darkness at the speed of a runaway train. The Scottish play is clearly in the bloodstream. Was there a tabloid newspaper that did not, in its coverage of the recent Yugoslav revolution, refer to Mrs Milosevic as \"the Lady Macbeth of the Balkans\"? Perhaps it was the improbably raven-black hair that did it, but every hack seemed inescapably to recall the \"butcher and his fiend-like queen\" from distant schooldays. I have heard more than one report of English teachers exclaiming in the staffroom, \"If only Baz Luhrmann would do Macbeth as well.\" In the absence of such a wished-for production, Roman Polanski's sub-Rosemary's Baby film version (plenty of nakedness, plenty of witchcraft, and a new ending) still governs perceptions. Another, BBC version from 1983 is apparently rendered almost unusable by Jane Lapotaire's rendition of Lady Macbeth's infamous \"Come, you spirits/ That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here\" soliloquy. The actress appears to bring herself to orgasm by the climax of the speech (\"Hold, hold!\"), causing unmanageable embarrassment or incomprehension in the classroom. So Macbeth and a few million teenagers await the film-maker who wishes to reshape Shakespeare. British directors (Kenneth Branagh, Trevor Nunn) have, in recent years, seemed more concerned with their likely American audience. Their settings have been designed to satisfy American tastes for English heritage: for Hamlet, Branagh hired Blenheim Palace and pumped artificial snow over the grounds; for Twelfth Night, Nunn used exquisite Cornish National Trust properties. Yet, for those who would avoid English Heritage self-indulgence, Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet also contains a warning about fashion following. The film makes rather striking use of music by Prince, still on the very pulse of MTV culture while it was being made. Now, apparently, this needs as much annotation in London classrooms as any Elizabethan diction. The teachers have Prince CDs; the pupils ask \"Prince who?\" Yet, as one English teacher told me, even the most ignorant often greet Shakespeare with a kind of breezy familiarity. As Ben Jonson admitted, \"not of an age, but for all time!\"",

The feeling that they wouldn't stand a chance prevented Flora Jenkins and Chris Stevens from looking at graduate recruitment schemes with the BBC. Yet both now work there as programme developers. They got where they are by winning a competition. Although the odds against being successful were much greater than with a conventional application they, and thousands like them felt the barriers were down and it was worth having a go. Flora, an English graduate from Leeds University, was well into a range of temporary jobs that included chauffeuring and valet parking when her sister stumbled across BBC Talent and persuaded Flora to enter. \"I'd never have gone for a job with the BBC because I didn't have the right qualifications or experience, but a competition, open to everyone was different. I thought why not.\" Chris Stevens appreciated being asked about his favourite gripping TV moments (the spooky appearance of a ghost in Ghostwatch and the even spookier progress of missiles through the night time streets of Baghdad) rather than his qualifications. Now working with other successful Ideas Lab winners, he feels all their career ideas have changed dramatically. \"We're from diverse backgrounds, but none of us considered working for the BBC, not because we didn't want to, but because it seemed like an impossibility.\" That's just what Angie Stephenson, head of BBC Talent set out to achieve. \"This was an extension of what we normally do. We just decided to shout about it more loudly. Our aim was to complement normal recruitment by encouraging more people to come forward with their ideas.\" And it did. There were 46,693 entries for the seven categories. The most popular prize, a one year trainee contract with Radio 1, attracted 16,500 entries for six places.

I've had a member of my team, Jack, come and complain that someone wasn't pulling their weight on a project they had been given. When I investigated, it became clear that he had complained out of feelings of resentment that he hadn't been put onto the project himself.\" </p> <p>Particularly in the early days of management, it can be difficult to know when someone isn't giving you the whole story - but there are techniques for getting to the bottom of the situation. \"It's important to create a space for people to talk - really talk,\" believes Sandi Mann, senior lecturer in occupational psychology, \"and to do that you have to cultivate a relationship where people feel they can be honest. Make a time each week, or month, to talk to each member of your staff - if they seem to have a problem, have lunch with them or coffee in the canteen. If you're impatient or don't take time to listen, invariably you won't get an accurate impression of the situation - and in the end you'll suffer for it.\" </p> <p>\"I've also had misunderstandings with colleagues,\" says Green. \"Sometimes I may work jointly on a project with another department. We've had mix ups about completion dates, about who has what area of responsibility. It can be so frustrating. I always try to be clear about what role my department is taking - and what I expect from the other team - but somehow the message doesn't always get through.\" </p> <p>Even if you feel that you have stated your case clearly, its always worth checking that the other person has heard and understood what you have been saying. \"Think of your conversation as a two way communication between a transmitter, the person who is giving the information - and a receiver, the person who is listening,\" says Peter Honey. \"The onus really is on the transmitter to ensure their message is understood and a good way to do this is ask the receiver to summarise what you have said. In this way, any misunderstandings will become clear and can be ironed out straight away.\" </p> <p>The easiest way to avoid misunderstandings is to ask questions, but this isn't always easy. \"When I started attending planning meetings, things moved at such a pace that I wasn't always sure what I was supposed to be doing,\" says Anna-Maria Harden, an assistant producer at a regional radio station. \"But I didn't feel I could ask. I'd be told to come up with guests, or competitions or features - without any particular guidelines. A couple of times I tried to ask for a more detailed brief, and people just looked at me as if I was stupid.\" </p> <p>\"The business of testing understanding is integral to doing your job successfully,\" says Peter Honey. \"Meetings and conversations can often go on for ages and its impossible to remember everything that's been said. Its always a good idea to ask for a recap or a summary, or for a clearer explanation. Asking questions is central to human nature, but I think it gets knocked out of us in school - most of us can remember feeling foolish if we put our hand up to ask a question.' </p> <p>Harden agrees. \"At first I just tried to muddle through, doing what I thought was the right thing, but I got into some sticky situations. In the end I realised that the way to ask questions was one to one, away from the bearpit atmosphere of the meeting room. My boss is happy to explain things more fully to me if I ask. I think he realises it's going to make his life a lot simpler in the long run.\" </p> <p> If you don't remember anything else ... </p> <p>Listening to what people say doesn't necessarily mean you're hearing the truth.

One of the most senior told me that there really was no need for panic buying, whatever the protesters get up to. What everyone should do, he said, was drive around with as full a tank as possible. Since all the cars in the country have twice as much storage space between them as there is under garage forecourts, we could keep going for several days even if there were a successful blockade. Of course it won't happen because people en masse are incapable of acting rationally. It's like the situation during dry summers. As soon as someone says, \"provided we use water carefully, there will be no need for a hosepipe ban\" everyone turns on the lawn sprinkler for a couple of days, so creating the need for a hosepipe ban.

We need a source and a date for familiar phrases, such as \"where's the rest of me?\" and \"I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate,\" and \"War! Ugh! What is it good for? Absolutely nuttin'.\" But a work of reference like this also works like a commonplace book, full of lines you've never heard but are pleased to discover. For instance, did you know that, on hearing of Stanley Baldwin's death, Churchill said: \"The candle in that great turnip has gone out\"? Or that Jerry Lee Lewis remarked in 1995: \"I'm not putting Elvis down, but he was a shitass, a yellow belly, and I hated the fucker\"? Alan Clark was once asked if there were any skeletons in his cupboard, and replied: \"Dear boy, I can hardly close the door.\" I appear three times, with lines I can scarcely recall writing at all, which means that no one is likely to bother to look them up at all, though I am quite pleased to see them attributed to me.</p> <p>Here's a joke which I've been telling people. Half of them laugh uproariously and the other half look completely blank. I was told it by Alan Coren, who attributes it to Barry Cryer, and he told it to us over lunch just after the waiter had interrupted the last line of an anecdote by asking him if he'd like parmesan cheese sprinkled on whatever it was he was eating.</p> <p>A commercial traveller is driving down a country lane at night when he runs out of petrol.

The only snag is that he'll have to share a bed with the family's 17-year old daughter. She of course turns out to be a gorgeous blonde who smiles welcomingly and beckons him into the bed.

Not one.\") Anyhow, when I smoked myself - up to 60 on some working days - I resolved never to become an anti-smoking bore because I hated them so much. By and large I've stuck to that: if people ask to smoke in our house we cry gladly, 'Yes, of course! Here are ash trays, cigar clippers, pipe reamers, hookahs, oxygen masks - anything you need!\".

The other day I took my daughter to see J.B. Priestley's An Inspector Calls at the Garrick. The play is a fine old socialist rant, which I greatly enjoyed, not least because the principal villain is a dinner-jacketed northern manufacturer who says things like, 'Heh, heh, that way we can reduce wages and increase profits!\" It is staged quite brilliantly, with the most convincing rain I've ever seen indoors anywhere. But tickets, for the gods, were \u00a321 each (no cut price for children, even though it's a GCSE set text, which may account for the long run, and certainly no reduction for the fact that the whole play is just 105 minutes long), a small gin and tonic and a bottle of plain water cost \u00a34.90, and the programme, which was decked out like a sort of in-flight magazine, full of articles which had nothing to do with the play or the cast or the author or the theatre, or even the ice cream saleswoman, cost a princely \u00a32.75 (\"You don't really need to buy it,\" the attendant whispered to me.)</p> <p>I know all about the finances of the theatre, and how those who work in it believe devoutly that taxpayers should fork over huge sums to keep them going.

I know all about the finances of the theatre, and how those who work in it believe devoutly that taxpayers should fork over huge sums to keep them going. But it did cross my mind that if they made the whole experience just a tiny bit less expensive, the theatre might have been more than half full.",

The other nine were Alvah Bessie, Herbert Biberman, Lester Cole, John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel Ornitz, Adrian Scott, Dalton Trumbo and Edward Dmytryk. Only Dmytryk co-operated with the committee, and named names, including Lardner's; after serving their sentences, the other nine were blacklisted.</p> <p>Lardner had been recruited by the Communist party in Hollywood in 1937.

After his second year, he travelled to the Soviet Union - and was impressed. In 1935, he returned to New York, aged 20, where he worked as a reporter before going to Hollywood as a publicist for David O Selznick's new film company.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Selznick secretly asked Lardner and Budd Schulberg, a young man in the story department, to rewrite several scenes in William Wellman's A Star Is Born (1937). Although not credited, they are said to have come up with some of the best lines - such as the publicity agent's remark after the alcoholic actor Norman Maine (Fredric March) has drowned: \"How do you wire congratulations to the Pacific Ocean?\" Lardner also contributed - uncredited again - to the dialogue in Wellman's acerbic comedy, Nothing Sacred (1937).</p> <p>His first screen credits were as co-writer on two films in the folksy medical series, Dr Christian. But his breakthrough came with the script for George Stevens's Woman Of The Year (1942), about the love-hate marriage of a sophisticated political columnist and a gruff sportswriter, based on Lardner Sr's relationship with Dorothy Parker. The first - and one of the best - of the nine Katherine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy films, emphasised the feminist angle until the ending (rewritten by Michael Kanin), in which Hepburn's character submits to domesticity to keep the man she loves. It won Lardner (with Kanin) his first Oscar for best original screenplay.</p> <p>After wartime army service, Lardner co-wrote three po-faced anti-Nazi screenplays: The Cross Of Lorraine (1944), Tomorrow The World (1944) and Cloak And Dagger (1946).</p> <p>In 1947, Lardner signed a lucrative contract with 20th-Century Fox to write Forever Amber, from Kathleen Winsor's bodice-ripper about a poor girl (Linda Darnell) who sleeps her way to Charles II. However, due to the censorship of the time, Lardner and his co-writers had to suggest, rather than show, eroticism.</p> <p>Then came his HUAC appearance. When he was asked if he was or ever had been a communist, Lardner replied: \"I could answer the question exactly the way you want, but if I did, I would hate myself in the morning.\"</p> <p>After nine months in prison, and unable to work in Hollywood, Lardner eventually found work in London, contributing to the 1950s television series, The Adventures Of Robin Hood. Like several other blacklisted writers, he was forced to use a pseudonym to allow for American sales.

He commended the judge for making a distinction between the lack of competence of \"some people in the market and the efforts to improve regulation by Lloyd's\". Mr Prettejohn said he would consider the judge's recommendation to set up a review panel but hinted that Lloyd's might reject this and continue to pursue names for the outstanding debts.",

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office suffered a humiliating blow yesterday when the high court in London ruled that Indian Ocean islanders were unlawfully evicted 30 years ago to make way for a US air base. The islanders are now free to return. In a stunning turnaround the Foreign Office - after six hours of considering whether to appeal - caved in last night and began preparations to allow the islanders to go back. The US state department had vehemently opposed resettlement, claiming it would create a security risk to their huge air base on Diego Garcia, one of the 65 islands that make up the Chagos archipelago, a British dependency. The US leases the island from Britain. The Foreign Office, intent on ending an issue that has been a running sore, was last night working on a compromise that would see the islanders, most of whom were moved to Mauritius, return to two islands on the archipelago: Penhos Banhos and Salomon - but not Diego Garcia. The Foreign Office still faces the prospect of hefty payments in compensation to the islanders. It is thought between 400 and 4,000 islanders might want to return. Olivier Bancoult, who led the campaign on behalf of the islanders, insisted he was not interested merely in compensation but in going home: \"We want to return to our motherland as quickly as possible,\" he said outside court yesterday. The court awarded the islanders the costs. Lord Justice Laws ruled that a British ordinance of 1971 used to evict the islanders had been an \"abject legal failure\". He said the British government at the time had claimed the ordinance was to make laws for \"the peace, order and good government of the territory\". \"I cannot see how the wholesale removal of a people from the land where they belong can be said to conduce to the territory's peace, order and good government,\" he said. Hundreds of previously secret Foreign Office papers that emerged during the trial show the British and US governments cheated the islanders out of their homes with a colonial disdain more appropriate to the 19th century than the latter part of the 20th, and then lied about it in parliament and Congress for years. One British diplomat referred in a memo to the islanders as \"a few Tarzans or Men Fridays\". Mr Justice Gibbs said in the judgment: \"It is clear from some of the disclosed documents that, in some quarters, official zeal in implementing those policies went beyond any proper limits. It would be no answer to say that these documents reflected the standards of a different period. \"I venture to think that the impression on right-thinking people upon reading them would have been similar then as now.\" The court ruling was a potential embarrassment for the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who in opposition had supported the islanders but in government found himself caught between the rights of the islanders and objections to their return from the US. But Mr Cook escaped by pressing the US into accepting the compromise. He pointed out that Britain's treaty obligations covered only Diego Garcia and the US had no legal claim to the rest of the archipelago. In a statement issued last night, he said: \"I have decided to accept the court's ruling and the government will not be appealing.\" He distanced himself from previous governments, Labour as well as Tory: \"The government has not defended what was done or said 30 years ago. As Lord Justice Laws recognised, we made no attempt to conceal the gravity of what happened.\" The Foreign Office ordered a feasibility study this year into whether the islands could practically sustain repopulation. The first stage suggested they could if new infrastructure was put in place. For it to become habitable again, the islanders will need a new jetty, houses, a water purification scheme and some form of employment, either fishing or a resumption of the coconut trade. The biggest item will be a connection with the outside world.",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown will announce an increase in the basic state pension of at least twice the rate of inflation as the government seeks to repair the damage caused by last year's 75p a week increase. The Treasury refused to comment on the chancellor's plans, but speculation in Whitehall last night was that the increase could be \u00a35 a week for single pensioners and \u00a38 a week for a couple. With the Treasury feverishly attempting to massage down expectations of the size of the government's budget surplus, Mr Brown intends to concentrate on Labour's priorities rather than the demands of fuel protesters. One source said last night that Wednesday's announcement would be generous and, while increasing the basic state pension, would provide extra help for those on the lowest incomes. The increase is intended to bridge the gap until the introduction of the new pensioner tax credit in 2003, but Mr Brown will also uprate the minimum income guarantee to around \u00a390 a week for the 2m poorer pensioners. The chancellor will speak to the prime minister over the weekend to finalise plans, but he is determined to put the bulk of any extra spending into helping pensioners rather than a big cut in fuel duties. Help the Aged said a \u00a35 increase would do much to undo the damage of the 75p rise. But the National Pensioners Convention, led by Jack Jones, said it would still press for the restoration of the link with earnings. By law the basic state pension should rise in line with inflation by \u00a32.25 for single pensioners and \u00a33.60 for couples. The current pension is worth \u00a367.50 for single pensioners and \u00a3107.90 for couples. Mr Brown is also expected to produce a budget surplus projection of around \u00a310bn. Senior Treasury officials yesterday described recent City forecasts of \u00a320bn or more as \"overblown\". Mr Brown is likely to justify the lower projections by arguing receipts from corporation tax and capital gains tax will be lower than City expectations. In an extract released from a speech he is due to make to the Confederation of British Industry on Monday, Mr Brown stressed he would not repeat the \"mistakes of the past\". \"We are not going to seek easy and short term solutions, abandon the inflation target, relax our fiscal discipline or reach for quick-fix or easy solutions. We are going to stick the course,\" he is expected to say. The chancellor's cautious approach was reinforced by the prime minister yesterday when he said that he would not squander the budget surplus with unsustainable tax cuts. He said it would repeat the Tory mistakes of the 1980s if the government blew the surplus after working so hard to remove the deficit and get debt under control. He pointed that in 1998-99 the Conservative government ran a fiscal surplus of 1.4% of GDP. \"By 1992-93 that had turned into a deficit of 7.8% of GDP, a massive turnaround of almost 10% of GDP in four years.\" Apart from a drive to cut the 35% productivity gap between British and American workers, the pre-budget report will also focus on new help to revive the inner cities, including relief for regeneration in brownfield sites. The chancellor is also expected to announce details of a new community investment tax credit to encourage private investment in underinvested communities and a community development venture fund with matched funding from the government.",

The BBC announced yesterday that more than a dozen foreign broadcasters were queuing to buy it. </p> <p>Fintan Coyle, a former GP in south London, came up with the idea for The Weakest Link with his friend Cathy Dunning, a comedian who has developed a number of light entertainment programme formats. Although the show's presenter, Anne Robinson, has embarked upon a whirlwind publicity round, the creators have been kept in the background and said nothing. Dr Coyle was not at home yesterday. </p> <p>Their programme, which has evolved considerably from the original idea, has proved a remarkable hit in the early evenings on BBC2, where it appears daily. It is now enjoying a peak time \"champions' league\" run on BBC1. </p> <p>Its appeal stems from the format which demands contestants work with each other to \"bank\" as much cash as possible, but then forces them to vote out one of their number at the end of each round. The \"weakest link\" endures the sharp end of Robinson's tongue, and exits along a \"walk of shame\" to be interviewed, Big Brother-style, backstage. </p> <p>The BBC has been using the show in the ratings war against ITV. When it made its BBC1 debut earlier this week, the programme drew almost 8m viewers. On Thursday night, when it went head-to-head with Millionaire, it scored 6.3m and pulled Chris Tarrant's show back to 9.2m, its lowest rating this year. </p> <p>BBC1's controller, Lorraine Heggessey, is said to be delighted with The Weakest Link's performance. A celebrity edition and a \"losers' league\" are now being considered. </p> <p>BBC Worldwide could generate as much as \u00a330m for the corporation, with more than a dozen foreign broadcasters registering an interest in the show's format. </p> <p>Colin Jarvis, BBC Worldwide's head of programmes and operations, said foreign presenters would have to maintain the tone set by Robinson. \"Foreign broadcasters are mesmerised by Anne. They are amazed at how tough and forthright she is, and that people are willing to be put through the emotional mill - particularly the final walk of shame. They've never seen anything like it in a game show before.\" </p> <p>BBC Worldwide is in talks to sell the format of the programme with broadcasters from the US, Germany, Italy, Australia, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Israel, Turkey, Spain, Latin America, Sweden, Canada and Ireland.</p>",

Its appeal stems from the format which demands contestants work with each other to \"bank\" as much cash as possible, but then forces them to vote out one of their number at the end of each round. The \"weakest link\" endures the sharp end of Robinson's tongue, and exits along a \"walk of shame\" to be interviewed, Big Brother-style, backstage. The BBC has been using the show in the ratings war against ITV. When it made its BBC1 debut earlier this week, the programme drew almost 8m viewers. On Thursday night, when it went head-to-head with Millionaire, it scored 6.3m and pulled Chris Tarrant's show back to 9.2m, its lowest rating this year. BBC1's controller, Lorraine Heggessey, is said to be delighted with The Weakest Link's performance. A celebrity edition and a \"losers' league\" are now being considered. BBC Worldwide could generate as much as \u00a330m for the corporation, with more than a dozen foreign broadcasters registering an interest in the show's format. Colin Jarvis, BBC Worldwide's head of programmes and operations, said foreign presenters would have to maintain the tone set by Robinson. \"Foreign broadcasters are mesmerised by Anne. They are amazed at how tough and forthright she is, and that people are willing to be put through the emotional mill - particularly the final walk of shame. They've never seen anything like it in a game show before.\" BBC Worldwide is in talks to sell the format of the programme with broadcasters from the US, Germany, Italy, Australia, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Africa, Israel, Turkey, Spain, Latin America, Sweden, Canada and Ireland.",

      "body": "<p>Britain faces another battering from the elements tomorrow as a deep depression is expected to sweep in from the Atlantic bringing heavy rain and gales. </p> <p>Towns and cities in England and Wales recovering from the floods risk being deluged again, the environment agency warned last night, although today is expected to be mostly dry. </p> <p>The storm will rage on through Monday and Tuesday as it sweeps across the the country with rainfall of between one and two inches. </p> <p>Met office spokesman Colin Donnelly said: \"There is going to be another bout of gale-force winds and some heavy falls of rain, coming in to the south-west about Sunday lunchtime and gradually transferring across the rest of the country. </p> <p>\"We are looking at gales and severe gale force winds across exposed areas, as the system moves west to east across the country.\" </p> <p>Areas where severe flood warnings are in force will be \"highly vulnerable\" once again after a brief respite while calmer conditions prevail today. </p> <p>Scotland and Northern Ireland are at lower risk from the severe weather than the rest of Britain. </p> <p>An environment agency spokesman said: \"People should maintain their vigilance. People who have not yet evacuated from areas where there are severe flood warnings should prepare themselves for evacuation.\" </p> <p>The agency issued severe flood warnings on 13 areas in Britain and Wales, across seven rivers. On the River Severn, severe flood warnings remained in force last night from Bewdley through Tewkesbury to Gloucester. A further 167 flood warnings and more than 100 flood watches remain in force. Many parts of Worcestershire and Shrewsbury are already feet under water. Thousands of homes have been swamped across Britain with floods on the same scale as those in 1947, said the environment agency. </p> <p>The waters peaked at Worcester, where the racecourse and cricket ground were flooded, but it will be several days before the level drops significantly. Downstream of Worcester, levels were slowly rising. The environment agency blamed inadequate drainage systems for house floodings in Yorkshire, notably in York and Whitby. </p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, met flood defence workers yesterday when he called at the Tewkesbury base of the environment agency, where he was briefed for 40 minutes on the systems in place to deal with the crisis. </p> <p>The floods have been seized upon with delight by some watersports enthusiasts who have enjoyed canoeing and even surfing over what is usu ally dry land. But the emergency services are warning of submerged hazards such as bike-stands and kerbstones and are urging the public not to take risks. </p> <p>A suspected shoplifter who was feared to have been swept to his death in a swollen river was yesterday named as Nigel McCallion, 21, of Kings Norton, Birmingham. </p> <p>His body has yet to be found after he plunged into the fast-flowing waters of the River Tame in Birmingham. </p> <p>He either jumped or fell in after he was pursued by a security guard from a shopping centre. A widespread search of the river involved a police helicopter. </p> <p>Hundreds of bonfire night celebrations have been cancelled. </p> <p>Police are urging visitors to stay away from tonight's famous bonfire celebrations in Lewes, East Sussex, in which effigies of the Pope are traditionally burned. </p> <p>The town has not recovered from the devastating effects of recent flooding and cannot cope with a surge of daytrippers, who often swell the population by up to 50,000. </p> <p>The townspeople will still celebrate a scaled-down version of the festivities, but at least one of the bonfires has had to be scrapped because its pitch is sodden. </p> <p>Another outlandish bonfire tradition dampened by the weather is the centuries old \"burning barrel\" race in Ottery St Mary, Devon. </p> <p>As in Lewes, outside spectators have been asked not to swell the crowd watching runners carrying flaming tar-lined barrels.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain faces another battering from the elements tomorrow as a deep depression is expected to sweep in from the Atlantic bringing heavy rain and gales. Towns and cities in England and Wales recovering from the floods risk being deluged again, the environment agency warned last night, although today is expected to be mostly dry. The storm will rage on through Monday and Tuesday as it sweeps across the the country with rainfall of between one and two inches. Met office spokesman Colin Donnelly said: \"There is going to be another bout of gale-force winds and some heavy falls of rain, coming in to the south-west about Sunday lunchtime and gradually transferring across the rest of the country. \"We are looking at gales and severe gale force winds across exposed areas, as the system moves west to east across the country.\" Areas where severe flood warnings are in force will be \"highly vulnerable\" once again after a brief respite while calmer conditions prevail today. Scotland and Northern Ireland are at lower risk from the severe weather than the rest of Britain. An environment agency spokesman said: \"People should maintain their vigilance. People who have not yet evacuated from areas where there are severe flood warnings should prepare themselves for evacuation.\" The agency issued severe flood warnings on 13 areas in Britain and Wales, across seven rivers. On the River Severn, severe flood warnings remained in force last night from Bewdley through Tewkesbury to Gloucester. A further 167 flood warnings and more than 100 flood watches remain in force. Many parts of Worcestershire and Shrewsbury are already feet under water. Thousands of homes have been swamped across Britain with floods on the same scale as those in 1947, said the environment agency. The waters peaked at Worcester, where the racecourse and cricket ground were flooded, but it will be several days before the level drops significantly. Downstream of Worcester, levels were slowly rising. The environment agency blamed inadequate drainage systems for house floodings in Yorkshire, notably in York and Whitby. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, met flood defence workers yesterday when he called at the Tewkesbury base of the environment agency, where he was briefed for 40 minutes on the systems in place to deal with the crisis. The floods have been seized upon with delight by some watersports enthusiasts who have enjoyed canoeing and even surfing over what is usu ally dry land. But the emergency services are warning of submerged hazards such as bike-stands and kerbstones and are urging the public not to take risks. A suspected shoplifter who was feared to have been swept to his death in a swollen river was yesterday named as Nigel McCallion, 21, of Kings Norton, Birmingham. His body has yet to be found after he plunged into the fast-flowing waters of the River Tame in Birmingham. He either jumped or fell in after he was pursued by a security guard from a shopping centre. A widespread search of the river involved a police helicopter. Hundreds of bonfire night celebrations have been cancelled. Police are urging visitors to stay away from tonight's famous bonfire celebrations in Lewes, East Sussex, in which effigies of the Pope are traditionally burned. The town has not recovered from the devastating effects of recent flooding and cannot cope with a surge of daytrippers, who often swell the population by up to 50,000. The townspeople will still celebrate a scaled-down version of the festivities, but at least one of the bonfires has had to be scrapped because its pitch is sodden. Another outlandish bonfire tradition dampened by the weather is the centuries old \"burning barrel\" race in Ottery St Mary, Devon. As in Lewes, outside spectators have been asked not to swell the crowd watching runners carrying flaming tar-lined barrels.",

Bandese was the first person outside the Gulu area to die in the present Ebola epidemic. Sam Okware, the commissioner for health services, said international health officials were in Mbarara with their Ugandan counterparts to examine all hospital staff and people in contact with the two men.

A Scottish parliamentary committee will give its assessment of Mr McConnell's predecessor, Sam Galbraith - who has been moved to environment - later this year.</p> <p>Mr McConnell said: \"The report by Deloitte &amp; Touche paints a stark picture of an organisation with significant management weaknesses, where poor strategic and operational planning led to a data management crisis from which it could not recover in time.\"</p> <p>At the height of the fiasco, Scotland's education system appeared to be in crisis. Students were disadvantaged in applying for university places, schools claimed marking was anomalous and, as the full scale of the problem emerged, ministers said they had been kept in the dark.</p> <p>The report reveals that SQA managers failed to deploy resources properly and did not recruit enough exam markers. It also says that staff were not trained correctly and problems were not reported to the Scottish executive.</p> <p>No single problem was said to be at the root of the SQA's poor performance and, although \"data handling issues\" were a critical flaw, they were far from being the body's only deficiency. The report said: \"Rather, there were weaknesses and difficulties in a number of interlinked management, process and information systems areas which cumulatively overwhelmed the delivery [of the examinations results].\"</p> <p>Mike Russell, the Scottish National party's education spokesman, said the report revealed a complete breakdown in the board's duty of care. \"It is worthy of comment that it has taken a change of minister to produce the long overdue removal of those at the top,\" he added.</p> <p>The SQA's chief executive, Ron Tuck, resigned soon after the crisis broke and two other senior figures have since left the organisation. Mr McConnell would not rule out further departures yesterday, but he said that was a matter for the interim chief executive, Bill Morton.</p> <p>\"The remit I have given him is that his job is to put in place the systems, the people and the organisation that can deliver,\" said Mr McConnell.</p> <p>\"He can step on any toes he wants anywhere in Scotland to deliver that and he will have my backing.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chairman and entire board of Scotland's education authority resigned yesterday as a report damned its performance during this summer's exams fiasco. The clear-out of the Scottish qualifications authority was ordered by the country's education minister, Jack McConnell, after the report detailed a string of management failures which led to thousands of Scottish students being sent incomplete or inaccurate results. Mr McConnell accepted the resignation of the SQA's chairman, David Miller, but he was yesterday taking legal advice on the minimum number of members required for the board before deciding on how many of its other 23 members should go. The independent report is severely critical of the performance of the SQA, but it did not look at the actions of ministers. A Scottish parliamentary committee will give its assessment of Mr McConnell's predecessor, Sam Galbraith - who has been moved to environment - later this year. Mr McConnell said: \"The report by Deloitte &amp; Touche paints a stark picture of an organisation with significant management weaknesses, where poor strategic and operational planning led to a data management crisis from which it could not recover in time.\" At the height of the fiasco, Scotland's education system appeared to be in crisis. Students were disadvantaged in applying for university places, schools claimed marking was anomalous and, as the full scale of the problem emerged, ministers said they had been kept in the dark. The report reveals that SQA managers failed to deploy resources properly and did not recruit enough exam markers. It also says that staff were not trained correctly and problems were not reported to the Scottish executive. No single problem was said to be at the root of the SQA's poor performance and, although \"data handling issues\" were a critical flaw, they were far from being the body's only deficiency. The report said: \"Rather, there were weaknesses and difficulties in a number of interlinked management, process and information systems areas which cumulatively overwhelmed the delivery [of the examinations results].\" Mike Russell, the Scottish National party's education spokesman, said the report revealed a complete breakdown in the board's duty of care. \"It is worthy of comment that it has taken a change of minister to produce the long overdue removal of those at the top,\" he added. The SQA's chief executive, Ron Tuck, resigned soon after the crisis broke and two other senior figures have since left the organisation. Mr McConnell would not rule out further departures yesterday, but he said that was a matter for the interim chief executive, Bill Morton. \"The remit I have given him is that his job is to put in place the systems, the people and the organisation that can deliver,\" said Mr McConnell. \"He can step on any toes he wants anywhere in Scotland to deliver that and he will have my backing.\"",

The film industry is locked into a similar court battle with hackers who have created a code that cracks the digital video disk format, allowing anyone who has access to the code to make copies of DVD movies and exchange them free of charge. More than 300,000 movie downloads are taking place each day and observers expect the number of downloads to reach a million or more copies per day by the end of the year. There may be little the film industry can do to stem the tide. In the long run, film companies are likely to follow the lead of the music industry and make their peace with the net by setting up their own sites and providing access to films by turning users into paid subscribers and members. While there has been a great deal of angst over how to protect copyright, little attention has been paid to where the whole network process and access relationships is leading society. Short-term access between servers and clients operating in networks is going to redefine our social dynamics. Today, the Napster- Bertelsmann way of doing business is an oddity. In the future, it will be the norm. Jeremy Rifkin is the author of The Age of Access: How the Shift From Ownership to Access is Transforming Capitalism (Penguin Books, 2000)",

There is also an awful lot of talk about guns. In the white working-class neighbourhoods of Detroit and other industrial centres, the unions are performing their traditional election task of mobilising the Democratic party's core supporters - calling workers to remind them to vote, distributing pamphlets and driving people to the polling station on election day. This year, more than ever before, their adversary in this street-level battle of brawn is the National Rifle Association (NRA), the gun lobby. The NRA is providing committed activists to man the banks of Republican phones, and even more importantly, it is spearheading an assault on one of the Democrats' exposed flanks, the white working class, which in states such as Michigan includes large numbers of fanatical hunters. When Charlton Heston, the NRA's figurehead, came to Michigan to declare the election \"the most important since the Civil War\", half the people at his rallies were wearing union jackets. An advertisement, funded by the gun manufacturers, running in Michigan in recent days shows an anonymous man in white shirt and tie dismembering the American flag with a scalpel. The message is clear: once the liberal elite take away the Second Amendment, which arguably guarantees the right to bear arms, there will be no stopping it. Tim Hillebrand is your Democratic nightmare - a working-class Democrat born and bred, who has this year turned NRA organiser in Motor City. \"I've been a union member since I was a teenager. I've never voted Republican before in my life,\" said Mr Hillebrand, an assistant nurse in a psychiatric hospital. But now he feels his right to own a gun is under greater threat than ever, with a series of control measures, (to close loopholes in the background checking, for example) awaiting congressional approval \"There has never been such a fierce, anti-gun energy in this country,\" he said, pointing to some proposals which would require gun-owners to carry a licence bearing a photograph. \"It's like having to have a licence to write a book or to go to church.

Many Democrats wanted Al Gore to make more of George W Bush's gun record - he backed a bill in Texas making it permissible to carry concealed weapons in public buildings including churches and schools. But he soft-pedalled on the subject, aware that a strong anti-gun message would weaken the bedrock of his working-class support. While Bill Clinton focused on winning voters in the centre, Al Gore's campaign has reflected a return to the Democratic fold, with a populist message delivered in class terms. The principal influences behind this approach have been the Democratic pollster, Stan Greenberg, who was banished from the Clinton court but who is now back in favour, and America's Forgotten Majority, a book published earlier this year and taken very seriously by Democratic strategists. The authors, Joel Rogers and Ruy Teixeira, argued that the white working class had not disappeared, as the Clintonites appeared to assume, but was \"the key to the 21st century politics\", accounting for 55% of the voting population. Only half of this bloc hold blue-collar jobs, but the book makes the case that the rest, in low-paid clerical and service jobs, have working class incomes and lifestyles, and have seen their living standards stagnate and even decline during the \"Clinton boom\". \"These people are the real swing voters in American politics. Their loyalties shift the most from election to election and, in so doing, determine the winners in American politics,\" Rogers and Teixeira said.

      "body": "<p><strong>BT on the cusp</strong><br></p> <p>British Telecom reports second quarter results on Thursday and, according to Mike Williams, telecoms analyst at Deutsche Bank, the figures will mark a pivotal moment in the group's history. </p> <p>Although news on the dividend is likely to grab the headlines - Mr Williams feels there is a 30% chance that BT will signal plans to reduce the payment - it will be the conclusions of the long-awaited strategic review that will determine the direction of BT's shares. </p> <p>Mr Williams reckons BT will reveal plans to sell a number of non-core assets (non-core being classified as anything outside Japan and Europe). High on the hit list is LG in Korea and Binariang in Malaysia. Alongside the disposals he says there will be strategic initiatives including a demerger of domestic retail and wholesale operations and a commitment to float BT Cellnet. </p> <p>BT shares closed 12p weaker at 750p last night.<br> </p> <p><strong>Market forces</strong><br></p> <p>Shareholders in oil exploration group <strong>Lasmo</strong> know all about false dawns. They have heard all about the asset sales which are supposed to shore up its sagging share price. And over the years they have been treated to more half-baked bid stories than is good for the health of any investor. </p> <p>Nevertheless yesterday's flurry in the stock price was being taken very seriously by some of the Square Mile's more educated operators. Apparently Lasmo will at some point next week be on the receiving end of a 175p-a-share bid from a foreign predator. The hot money was yesterday favouring Italian group ENI though Amerada Hess was not being ruled out. </p> <p>If recent reports are to be believed Amerada has already carried out due diligence on parts of Lasmo's asset portfolio, specifically its Dacion field in Venezuela. Whatever the true extent of Amerada's interest, Lasmo's larger shareholders - frustrated by the company's inability to reflect the buoyant oil price - are, it is said, ready to sign up to a bid. Lasmo shares ended 3.25p higher at 141p on on exceptionally heavy turnover of 21.3m. </p> <p>The market as a whole was not short of takeover inspired movements yesterday. Ports operator <strong>Powell Duffryn</strong> advanced 35.5p to 640.5p after accepting a 650p-a-share bid from Prestige Acquisitions, a buyout vehicle backed by Japanese financial institution Nikko. </p> <p><strong>Arriva</strong> jumped to third position in the FTSE 250 top performers' table - albeit on weak volume - on word that a private equity group is giving the vehicle dealership the once over. The stock closed 21p, or 8.97%, higher at at 255p. </p> <p>But there was no doubting the takeover tale of the day. <strong>Abbey National</strong> shares leapt 71p to \u00a310.40 after it effectively put itself up for sale by admitting that it had approached <strong>Bank of Scotland</strong>, up 14p to 690p, with a merger proposition.

      "bodyText": "BT on the cusp British Telecom reports second quarter results on Thursday and, according to Mike Williams, telecoms analyst at Deutsche Bank, the figures will mark a pivotal moment in the group's history. Although news on the dividend is likely to grab the headlines - Mr Williams feels there is a 30% chance that BT will signal plans to reduce the payment - it will be the conclusions of the long-awaited strategic review that will determine the direction of BT's shares. Mr Williams reckons BT will reveal plans to sell a number of non-core assets (non-core being classified as anything outside Japan and Europe). High on the hit list is LG in Korea and Binariang in Malaysia. Alongside the disposals he says there will be strategic initiatives including a demerger of domestic retail and wholesale operations and a commitment to float BT Cellnet. BT shares closed 12p weaker at 750p last night. Market forces Shareholders in oil exploration group Lasmo know all about false dawns. They have heard all about the asset sales which are supposed to shore up its sagging share price. And over the years they have been treated to more half-baked bid stories than is good for the health of any investor. Nevertheless yesterday's flurry in the stock price was being taken very seriously by some of the Square Mile's more educated operators. Apparently Lasmo will at some point next week be on the receiving end of a 175p-a-share bid from a foreign predator. The hot money was yesterday favouring Italian group ENI though Amerada Hess was not being ruled out. If recent reports are to be believed Amerada has already carried out due diligence on parts of Lasmo's asset portfolio, specifically its Dacion field in Venezuela. Whatever the true extent of Amerada's interest, Lasmo's larger shareholders - frustrated by the company's inability to reflect the buoyant oil price - are, it is said, ready to sign up to a bid. Lasmo shares ended 3.25p higher at 141p on on exceptionally heavy turnover of 21.3m. The market as a whole was not short of takeover inspired movements yesterday. Ports operator Powell Duffryn advanced 35.5p to 640.5p after accepting a 650p-a-share bid from Prestige Acquisitions, a buyout vehicle backed by Japanese financial institution Nikko. Arriva jumped to third position in the FTSE 250 top performers' table - albeit on weak volume - on word that a private equity group is giving the vehicle dealership the once over. The stock closed 21p, or 8.97%, higher at at 255p. But there was no doubting the takeover tale of the day. Abbey National shares leapt 71p to \u00a310.40 after it effectively put itself up for sale by admitting that it had approached Bank of Scotland, up 14p to 690p, with a merger proposition. With Bank of Scotland pouring cold water all over the approach (it said a deal was unlikely), brokers were left trying to predict which bank would come in with an offer now Abbey had admitted it was too small to go it alone. The market's favourite was Lloyds TSB, which interestingly enough finished the day 4.5p weaker at 713.5p, indicating that the City at least expects it to make a bid. According to the gossip flying around yesterday afternoon, Lloyds - which has lost its position as the doyen of the banking scene to Royal Bank of Scotland, off 49p to \u00a315.62, could comfortably afford to pay \u00a312 a share for Abbey. All the takeover gossip could not save leading shares from ending lower for the second consecutive session with weakness in the oil sector offsetting strength in the financials. At the close of play the FTSE 100 was down just 6.6 points at 6,385.4. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 rose 36.5 to 6,749.2 and the TechMark added 55.47 to 3,499.38. Semiconductor stocks were hot on the back of Thursday's upbeat forecasts from the world's leading chip maker Intel. ARM Holdings improved 49p to 754p, while Bookham Technology progressed 163p to \u00a324.00p. Elsewhere, chemicals outfit ICI, up 22.5p to 449.5p, continued to prosper on the back of Thursday's third quarter figures while BSkyB put on 47p to \u00a310.51 after an impressive set of results. In the first quarter of the current fiscal year BSkyB signed up 210,00 new subscribers, which means it well ahead of the targeted 5m for the year end. On the downside, support services group Hays dropped 24p to 353p after house broker UBS Warburg took the red pen to forecasts, apparently citing fuel prices. In the smaller company universe, Action Computer Supplies fell 9.5p to 47.5p after unveiling a \u00a36.7m year loss and admitting conditions in the current year would be difficult. But biotech group SR Pharma rose 51p to 391p on hopes that it might soon strike a licensing deal for its lung cancer drug.",

      "bodyText": "Tibetan nomads are flocking for help from a bank they know won't fleece them - a fund set up by Buddhists in Australia to buy sheep and goats from the rich and lend them without interest to the poor. So far families comprising about 50 nomad herders have been lent 150 sheep and 50 goats. The bank was set up by Bodhi, which stands for the Benevolent Organisation for Development, Health and Insight, and means \"enlightenment\" in Sanskrit, which was created in 1989 with the Dalai Lama as its founding patron. Bodhi's director, Colin Butler, said: \"The idea is to give the nomads an economic base to feed their families and to reduce the in-equality between nomads\". The fund bought its first stock from rich nomads for \u00a312.80 a head and lent them to four poor nomadic families, who are breeding from them. They are allowed to keep all the milk, wool and progeny they produce. With 30 ewes producing at least 25 lambs a year, each family should have increased its flock by about 100 after four years. It is then required to repay the fund over a period of two years with animals of the same age and sex as those it borrowed. Suggested by an American anthropologist and authority on Tibetan history and culture, Melvyn Goldstein, the bank is based in Tasmania. In Tibet its work is administered by a retired nomad schoolteacher and local officials. \"We loved the idea and thought we'd try and raise some money for it,\" Dr Butler said. \"We've only raised about a tenth of our target budget of $100,000, but it's enough to make a start. We hope it will grow.\" He added: \"We're surrounded by sheep in Tasmania, so the scheme certainly resonated with us. \"Some of the most expensive wool in the world is made just down the road, and that farm has recently been taken over by a Japanese millionaire, so we thought he might be interested. \"We're searching for corporate shepherds.\"",

In a panel headed Reforming the RUC, page 12, yesterday, under the sub-heading Force's name, we should have said that what Chris Patten had recommended was that the RUC \"should not be disbanded, but that it should henceforth be named the Northern Ireland Police Service\", and not that \"the RUC should remain\" etc. The police bill says \"The body of constables known as the RUC shall continue in being as the Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the RUC).\" In our piece about the Guardian First Book prize, page 6, yesterday, we should have said that the US author, Dave Eggers has been shortlisted for A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius (Picador). Our report, Mrs Murdoch deals with it, page 19, yesterday, should have carried a credit to the Wall Street Journal, for some of the information incorporated in it. The chimpanzees on the front of Science, November 2, were orang-utans. The person who chairs I'm Sorry, I Haven't a Clue on Radio 4, Sketch, page 2, yesterday, is Humphrey Lyttelton (not Lyttleton).

On the shelf below it is a model of its modern counterpart, a Royal Mail train. </p> <p>Mr Roberts, a history graduate, is proud of the Post Office's past. But the train makes the point that the Post Office is \"a business looking forward\". It is also a reminder of one of the more immediate problems awaiting his attention: what to do about the mail which is being delayed by Railtrack's decision to impose speed restrictions in parts of its network. </p> <p>About 25% of mail is transported by train. \"We are very dependent upon the railways and on running times. When moving mail from one end of the country to the other, an extra half hour makes a great difference to us. We will have to look at whether we have to transport more mail by road, which is not something we would not want to do.\" </p> <p>The danger is that late trains will lead to late deliveries, which will damage the Post Office's reputation as it is enters a new age of competition. </p> <p>Mr Roberts, 56, believes his lifetime career at the Post Office has prepared him well for the new age. He entered the civil service as a high flyer under the university entrant scheme. He was then offered two jobs, one in the Post Office and the other in the Ministry of Agriculture. If he went to the Post Office, he was told, his civil service career would be short-lived because the organisation was about to become a public corporation. </p> <p>He was not deterred. He joined the Post Office, where his father, a career civil servant, had worked as a middle manager for six years. During his early days Mr Roberts worked for the chairman, Sir William Ryland, who was overseeing the change in its status to public corporation. </p> <p><strong> 'How far we could push'</strong><br> </p> <p>He also worked for Sir William's successor, Sir William Barlow, who had been brought in from heading the ball-bearings group Ransome Hoffman and Pollard. \"This exposed me to the ways of private sector business,\" Mr Roberts said. \"At the time we were preparing to split the Post Office from British Telecom. </p> <p>\"I was influenced by the private sector non-executive directors. We were trying to be as commercial as we could. We were seeing how far we could push the Post Office towards being a fully commercial organisation without actually being one.\" </p> <p>When he took over as managing director of group services in 1993, Mr Roberts had specific responsibility to privatise the Post Office - a plan which collapsed largely as a result of public opposition. </p> <p>\"The 1990s were wasted years for the Post Office because of the privatisation debate. But now we have greater commercial freedom. We have been able to invest about \u00a3500m in companies, mainly in Europe. That has been a fundamental change which none of us would have foreseen.\" </p> <p>The Post Office's immediate future, and its relationship with the government - its shareholder - has been set out formally in the Postal Services Act 2000. The Post Office gets greater commercial freedom and protection from cash-grabbing raids by the Treasury. But the price has been the appointment of a postal regulator.The government has departed from the usual model where the regulatory power is invested in an individual and set up a commission with a chairman, chief executive and five independent members. </p> <p>Postal regulation is unknown ground and the commission is expected to flex its considerable powers, creating extra work for Post Office executives. </p> <p>Yet Mr Roberts hopes he will be able to maintain his routine of starting work at 8am and finishing by 6pm. \"I think it is very important to have a balance between what I do here and what I do outside. It is important for the family. </p> <p>\"I used to be told I was very competitive. I would hope to do a few more years here to see the Post Office through some of the changes we are going through. But there may well come a time when the Post Office needs a different kind of chief executive from a different background.\" </p> <p>One ambition is to \"really understand computers\". He added:\"I use the computer on my desk, especially for email, and I have a computer at home. Like many people in their 50s with a family, you get browbeaten into it.\" </p> <p>He believes the Post Office will have a growing internet-linked business. For example, it wants to be the delivery channel of choice for e-tailers. But, he says, of all the Post Office's businesses, e-commerce is the hardest to predict. \"Five years hence we will still see the mail business generating the bulk of the business, although somewhat reduced from today. The package business will have increased and counters will be holding its own. </p> <p>\"It is important to remember that only 0.6% of retail sales are via e-commerce. I think it will grow rapidly, but 100% of 0.6% is not a lot and we must not get carried away by the hype.\" </p> <p>He is confident he can steer the Post Office through the most radical change in its history. The European commission is threatening to wipe out the bulk of its postal monopoly. The economic viability of its 18,500 outlets is threatened by the government's decision to pay benefits direct to bank accounts from 2003. </p> <p>It is fighting to establish a universal bank for the financially excluded in a move which would replace some of the business lost by the benefits decision. But the big banks have been reluctant to become involved for fear they will end up footing the bill for what is, in effect, a piece of social policy. The British Bankers Association has said it would be shunned because it would have the \"stigma\" of being a poor people's bank. </p> <p>Mr Roberts rejects that argument. \"We have never seen this as a stigma. We have seen it as a service. We have always made people in the Post Office able to deal with every part of society. Our customer base mirrors the UK as a whole.\" </p> <p>The recent Postal Services Act set in law that universal service obligation: to deliver mail to all the country's 27m addresses at a uniform and affordable price. </p> <p>The legislation stipulates that big takeovers, which Mr Roberts feels may soon be necessary, must be cleared by government first. But the Post office has already embarked on new ventures, most notably the acquisition of foreign parcel companies such as German Parcels, and it is offering call centre and internet services to meet new demands. </p> <p><strong> 'Impact on social mail'</strong><br> </p> <p>The changes have not all been welcomed by the workforce. \"We have too much unofficial industrial action and that knocks on into our service.\" </p> <p>Mr Roberts admits to writing fewer personal letters than he used to. \"I think it started 20 years ago when the phone started to be the way for families to communicate. The mobile phone is now having the biggest impact on social mail.\" On the other hand, his business correspondence has gone up by leaps and bounds. </p> <p>A framed set of stamps sit on a book shelf in his office, a present from an American postal organisation. \"Postal executives who travel abroad frequently exchange stamps. I have a bookcase full of stamp albums at home.\" </p> <p>The boy stamp collector has come a long way.</p>",

Unlike Mr Bush, he will protect a woman's right to abortion and is clearly determined to uphold the legal rights of minority and disadvantaged citizens. Unlike Mr Bush, the Democrat will try to persuade Congress to enact tougher gun-control laws. When it comes to the key issues of social security provision, prescription medicines and health insurance for young and old alike, Mr Gore's proposals are both more equitable and workable than his opponent's. The Democrat acknowledges that campaign finance reform is essential if America's democracy is not to be further debased; yet despite the strong case for such reform made by John McCain, his main party rival, Mr Bush does not. Mr Gore acknowledges the need for more effective workplace regulation and tougher environmental standards; Mr Bush, the complete corporate candidate, does not. Mr Gore firmly believes that there is a legitimate role for government in a free market society, lest capitalism's excesses overwhelm the less fortunate; Mr Bush does not really. The Democrat refuses to squander the record budget surplus on massive, regressive tax cuts, preferring instead to invest some of that money in education, public services and debt reduction. Mr Bush, at his most irresponsible on this question, espouses reckless, inflationary tax giveaways that could stop the American economic miracle in its tracks and ultimately trigger a worldwide recession.</p> <p>In terms of foreign policy, Mr Bush (to the uncertain extent that he understands the issues at all) is the embodiment of all that is negative and ugly in post-cold war American thinking. He is the child of rightwing congressional and thinktank unilateralists, or neo-isolationists, who undermine the UN, ridicule concepts of nation-building, cut the foreign aid budget, wage trade wars and block or emasculate international treaties. Like them, Mr Bush supports US military disengagement in the Balkans and perhaps elsewhere, persists in regarding China and Russia as potential enemies, believes it right to besiege and bully out-of-favour countries with sanctions and threats, and complains that European allies are not pulling their weight. Yet like the hawks, the Republican simultaneously undermines Nato and global arms control by insisting on a national missile defence system for Fortress America.</p> <p>Mr Bush seems to know little, and care less, about non-military global threats like climate change, desertification, Aids, population growth and developing world poverty, debt and educational under-attainment. His is the exceptionalist mentality of the America Firster who views the outside world as strange and threatening. While this is hardly surprising in a man who has travelled beyond the US on only three occasions in his adult life (excluding visits to Mexico), it is hardly acceptable in a man who aspires to world leadership. His worst know-nothing instincts would probably be tempered by more seasoned advisers. But his is a strikingly narrower outlook than that of Mr Gore who, while hardly faultless on these many issues, would at least try to to maintain the limited, albeit self-serving, internationalism of the Clinton years.</p> <p>The manner in which this year's presidential campaign has been fought leaves much to be desired. Too often it has appeared as a mere beauty contest between two not particularly beautiful men. More than ever before, money, the media and pollsters have set the agenda, particularly through TV ads and chat shows that emphasised the personal and the trivial over the substantive and serious. One consequence is likely to be another disappointing voter turnout, at around 50%. The televised debates would have been more illuminating had the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, been allowed to participate. Despite this, Mr Nader has waged a valuable and stimulating campaign. The Democrats would do well to give careful consideration to some of his proposed reforms.</p> <p>But after all is said and done, the marginalised Mr Nader cannot win and the lightweight Mr Bush should not be allowed to. When Joseph Lieberman, Mr Gore's running mate, said the Texas governor was not yet ready for the presidency, he was too kind. On this year's showing, Mr Bush is unlikely ever to be worthy of the job. Mr Gore, in contrast, the son of a Tennessee politician, a long-time senator, and vice-president for eight years, is tailor-made for it. It is true he sometimes seems doomed to be the ultimate man in a suit. Exciting he ain't. A visionary he is not. But he is the safe, wise choice - for them and us. So, on Tuesday: Go, Al, go!</p>",

But his is a strikingly narrower outlook than that of Mr Gore who, while hardly faultless on these many issues, would at least try to to maintain the limited, albeit self-serving, internationalism of the Clinton years. The manner in which this year's presidential campaign has been fought leaves much to be desired. Too often it has appeared as a mere beauty contest between two not particularly beautiful men. More than ever before, money, the media and pollsters have set the agenda, particularly through TV ads and chat shows that emphasised the personal and the trivial over the substantive and serious. One consequence is likely to be another disappointing voter turnout, at around 50%. The televised debates would have been more illuminating had the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, been allowed to participate. Despite this, Mr Nader has waged a valuable and stimulating campaign. The Democrats would do well to give careful consideration to some of his proposed reforms. But after all is said and done, the marginalised Mr Nader cannot win and the lightweight Mr Bush should not be allowed to. When Joseph Lieberman, Mr Gore's running mate, said the Texas governor was not yet ready for the presidency, he was too kind. On this year's showing, Mr Bush is unlikely ever to be worthy of the job. Mr Gore, in contrast, the son of a Tennessee politician, a long-time senator, and vice-president for eight years, is tailor-made for it. It is true he sometimes seems doomed to be the ultimate man in a suit. Exciting he ain't. A visionary he is not. But he is the safe, wise choice - for them and us. So, on Tuesday: Go, Al, go!",

Great North Eastern Railway was \"strongly advising\" passengers not to use its London-Scotland service yesterday or over the weekend. The company apologised for the longer journeys, busier trains and a significantly reduced service, and said it was grateful for \"continuing patience and understanding\" from passengers. Flooding in the Midlands and the west of England, with Railtrack speed restrictions, halved some services with companies warning that journeys could take much longer. Direct London-Scotland services were not running north of York due to lineside flood ing at Kelton, and Railtrack was relaying seven miles of track between Darlington and Durham. Railtrack took over responsibility for issuing weekend warning notices from the train operating companies after they complained that they were badly informed of where the restrictions were being imposed. Great Western will only run half the normal number of trains today. The line between Tiverton and Exeter is closed because of flooding. Passengers travelling south from Scotland were advised to use the west coast main line because of flooding in Yorkshire.

In a public relations coup for nationalists, Sinn Fein's health minister Bairbre de Brun and her southern Irish counterpart Micheal Martin unveiled a three-point plan that would have been blocked if a unionist ban on republicans had prevailed. Demonstrating their resolve to step up cross-border cooperation in the face of unionist opposition, the two ministers announced at a meeting in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh, that they had commissioned new research into cross-border health care. This will cover: \u0095Renal care and radiotherapy; \u0095Assessment of new medical technologies; \u0095Planning of capital projects, such as building hospitals. The joint announcement was a calculated snub to Mr Trimble, who had attempted to block Sinn Fein from attending meetings of the north south ministerial council as a punishment for the IRA's \"failure\" to disarm. His action meant that yesterday's talks could not be a formal meeting of the council, a technicality that was overcome by Sinn Fein and the Irish government who held bilateral talks instead. Mr Martin delivered a powerful rebuke to Mr Trimble when he remarked pointedly that it would be difficult for the UUP leader to quibble with the health announcements because they were designed to \"save lives\". His remarks came after Mr Trimble's aides dismissed yesterday's meeting as \"pantomime politics\".

Mr Quintavalle was refused permission to appeal against Dame Elizabeth's ruling, leaving him without any further legal options. If the television deal with Granada is concluded, it will be conducted by Martin Bashir, who interviewed the Princess of Wales for the BBC's Panorama programme. To avoid accusations of favouritism, the family will make a transcript of the programme available to all newspapers in advance of the show's transmission on ITV.

      "bodyText": "A confessed serial rapist and double murderer yesterday described how he and his former boyhood friend terrorised more than a dozen women in a series of rapes in the 1980s. John Duffy made the accusations from the witness stand at the Old Bailey trial of David Mulcahy, 41, who denies the rape and murder of three women, seven further rapes and five counts of conspiracy to rape. Duffy, 41, who received a series of life sentences in 1988 and was told he has no prospect of release, told the court that Mulcahy joined him in a string of attacks on women across London over a four year period. The prosecution alleges that the pair formed a \"unique but wicked bond\" to hunt down women between 1982 and 1986. It was put to Duffy that he had committed 25 offences between 1975 and 1986 including 22 attacks on women. Asked if he had an accomplice in these attacks and who that was he said: \"It was David Mulcahy.\" Mulcahy, 41, a builder, of Chalk Farm, north London, interrupted Duffy's evidence, shouting: \"Why don't you just tell the truth?\" Duffy told the court that he and Mulcahy met on his first day at secondary school when he was 11, and were in the same class. \"We became very good friends. We struck up a friendship on the first day. We used to look after each other,\" said Duffy. Over time a bond developed between the pair through their shared interest in motorbikes and martial arts, he said. As teenagers the pair planned unsuccessful burglaries during which they had planned to rape women. Later, despite both being married, they would go on what Duffy called \"hunting\" expeditions, driving around London looking for victims. Duffy added that there had been so many victims he sometimes got muddled about details. \"To begin with it was in areas we knew well. We would plan it quite meticulously. We would have balaclavas and knives,\" he told the court. \"We used to call it hunting. We did it as a bit of a joke, a bit of a game. It added to the excitement. \"We were feeding off each other's emotions and excitement. We never thought we would get caught.\" Duffy described in detail a number of rapes he said the pair carried out. The first was of a young woman walking home after a party clutching a teddy bear in 1982. Duffy's wife was away at the time and the pair had decided to kidnap a girl and take her back to his flat but in the event they panicked and raped her in turn in a garden off Kilburn High Road. Duffy said the pair used to take it in turns to rape their victims and would argue about who went first. On one occasion they raped a woman in West Hampstead and left her walking along the train tracks. Later they saw her walking down Finchley Road and Mulcahy suggested stopping to give her a lift, \"because she wouldn't recognise us\", said Duffy. \"It was excitable in the car, although I felt a bit guilty about that one as the girl actually reminded me of my wife.\" Duffy described a dozen separate rapes or attempted rapes he said the pair had carried out. He said that on more than one occasion he had pretended to Mulcahy that there were witnesses or police nearby because he feared Mulcahy \"had more than rape on his mind\". The trial was adjourned until Monday when Duffy will continue to give evidence.",

But now a different kind of light is being shone on this meeting four years ago of the young gangsters of Los Angeles, and it has exposed another slice of the biggest police corruption scandal in the city's history.</p> <p>This week four LAPD officers have been standing trial in what could be the first of many such cases. And the outcome will have huge political, social and cultural ramifications.</p> <p>Stymie is Anthony Adams, a member of the Temple Street gang who had killed Lizard, a leading member of the Mexican Mafia - a fearsome prison based gang strong enough to order killings from behind bars.</p> <p>Lizard had been collecting \"taxes\" on his gang's behalf and Stymie had shot him \"as a 'we're not going to pay' kind of thing\". The MM could not let this go unpunished and had demanded thousands of dollars as a \"fine\" before removing the \"green light\".</p> <p>The meeting that was due to take place at the corner of Temple Street and Coronado, a patch known to the police as the Snakepit, was for gang members to discuss how they were going to pay this fine. The police planned to be there, too, and pick up Stymie and his pals.</p> <p>The person explaining all this to fascinated jurors in the city's courtroom 109 is Brian Liddy, one of the accused. He looks like a bull in a sports jacket and is sitting in the witness box on this balmy November day being questioned by his attorney, Paul DePasquale.</p> <p>What happened after Liddy and his colleagues arrived at the Snakepit that night is what the jurors have to decide.</p> <p>Did he and his fellow officer, Michael Buchanan, really get hit by a pick-up truck driven by a getaway gangster or did they make the whole thing up, and frame and beat up the gang member? And are the officers part of a vast scandal that has led to killings, beatings, framings and drug dealing - all carried out by the men who should be enforcing the law?</p> <p>That story starts with Rafael Perez, a policeman caught stealing 2.7kg (6lb) of cocaine from a police locker room in 1998. In a plea bargain deal, he was given a five-year jail sentence in exchange for information about corruption among his fellow officers.</p> <p>What Perez told investigators has now led to more than 100 people having their convictions overturned and left the city facing bills for an estimated $135m (\u00a393m) in law suits from ex-gang members who were framed, beaten and, in one case, paralysed. One victim will not be suing personally: Juan Saldana, 21, was shot and left to bleed to death with a gun planted beside him.</p> <p>Every week over recent months it has seemed that a gang member, usually Latino, has emerged from prison with tales of beatings and plantings.</p> <p>One of the very worst cases was that of Javier Ovando, who was allegedly shot and paralysed by Perez and his fellow officer, Nino Durden. The officers then accused Ovando of attempted murder and he was jailed for 23 years, with the judge chiding him for his lack of remorse. Ovando is out now and will be compensated but will not walk again.</p> <p>The police union, the Police Protection League, has claimed that Perez was a rogue cop and was only implicating his colleagues to save his own skin. But morale among officers has slumped. They say they are now so concerned about being accused of framing or beating gang members that they spend their hours on duty avoiding trouble. This may be the reason for the recent rise in gang shootings, and the renewed activity among the more than 400 gangs and 60,000 gang members in the city.</p> <p>There is a heavy political undertow in LA to accusations that the police have abused their power. In 1992, 54 people died after the riots that followed the acquittal of officers caught on video beating Rodney King. In 1965, in the Watts section of LA, it was police action against an alleged drink driver that led to the riots in which 34 died. This time the city wants to show that it is acting properly, and hence the Los Angeles district attorney, Gil Garcetti, has initiated the prosecutions.</p> <p>Liddy, Buchanan and two other officers, Paul Harper and Edward Ortiz, accused of conspiring to pervert or obstruct justice, are the first fruits of Mr Garcetti's labours. And as their trial comes to its conclusion, there is a political dimension: Mr Garcetti is running for re-election next Tuesday. A conviction would help his credibility and an acquittal would pose questions about his judgment.</p> <p>This week has come a new twist: Perez is not giving evidence as planned because his ex-girlfriend has now claimed that he and a fellow rogue officer, David Mack, had killed a drug dealer and his mother and had buried their bodies in a rubbish tip in Tijuana, Mexico. The Mexican police found no remains.</p> <p>Perez is duly \"pleading the fifth\" - refusing to give evidence in case he incriminates himself in a double murder. But whatever happens in this case, the ramifications are already being felt throughout the city.</p> <p>A few miles from the downtown courthouse, in Boyle Heights in the Latino area of the city, sits Frank, as he suggests we call him. Frank, a good-looking, shaven-headed 20-year-old in a Nike jacket and jeans, has cut his teeth with the Playboys gang. He says that the framing of young gang members is routine and is himself suing the LAPD for planting marijuana and crack on him, which led him to a year in jail.</p> <p><b> Different rules</b><br></p> <p>\"Rafael Perez was known to us more as a businessman than a policeman. He was one of the big dealers. Have things changed because of what happened? The police just play by different rules now.\"</p> <p>He said that instead of planting drugs on gang members, the police now arrest them for petty offences. \"They do it with righteous excuses now but they're still there.\"</p> <p>Frank is sitting in a room at the back of the centre where Father Greg Boyle - \"G-Dog\" as the young gang members call him - runs a programme that helps them find work and tries to get them out of the gang cycle.</p> <p>Father Greg, who probably knows as many gang members as anyone in California, has noticed a dramatic change in policing since the scandal broke, but it is not a change he welcomes.</p> <p>\"What we have now is police abuse that takes the form of absence,\" he says. \"There is an over-cautious tentativeness, a reluctance to stop the people that they should. They want to get to the ends of their shift not just without being shot but without having a grievance filed or a complaint levelled. Either they're violating human rights in the name of law enforcement or they have a hands-off policy. Both are wrong and both are not helpful.</p> <p>\"I buried my 85th and 86th kids last week,\" says Father Greg. \"One was a 19-year-old gang member and one was a 10-year-old girl caught in the crossfire. A lot of that comes from the tension that kept mounting that could have been largely remedied by a police presence but because we didn't have any, that [the shootings] became an inevitability.\"</p> <p>Back in court, the two young prosecuting attorneys, Laura Laesecke and Anne Ingalls, cross-examine other officers. Without Perez their case is weak. It is further weakened by the reluctance of the police witnesses to remember too clearly what happened on key nights.

The jury decided that former Salvadorean defence minister Jose Guillermo Garcia and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, former head of the National Guard, were not responsible. AP, West Palm Beach, Florida 'War suspects still hold office' Many Bosnian Serbs linked to war crimes during the Bosnian war still hold public office, the International Crisis Committee says. The 75-strong list includes mayors, police and members of the Bosnian Serb parliament, the report says. AP, Sarajevo Swiss-Germans back English A dozen German-speaking regions upset Switzerland's linguistic balance yesterday by opting for English, not French, as the main \"foreign\" language to be taught in primary schools. The call fuelled fears that minority languages, French, Italian and a Swiss-German dialect, will be eroded. Peter Capella, Montreux Bishop blesses divorce service Protestant bishop Margot K\u00e4ssmann, from Hanover, suggested yesterday that churches hold an end-of-marriage ceremony to help deal with divorce. She told Bild newspaper that the whole family could meet in church to renounce the wedding vows.

      "bodyText": "The net closed in on Peru's notorious former spy chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, yesterday after Swiss authorities froze around \u00a335m in three bank accounts he controls in Zurich, on suspicion that they contained profits from money laundering. Switzerland's federal justice office informed Peru that it had discovered the large deposits and invited Lima to present a request for legalhelp, effectively prodding Peru to open its own case against Mr Montesinos. The Swiss criminal investigation into suspected money laundering began on October 5, after Mr Montesinos had fled Peru for Panama in the middle of a corruption scandal and rumours that military chiefs loyal to him were threatening a coup. In September, Alberto Fujimori cut short his presidential term and called new elections for April after a leaked video filmed at intelligence service headquarters showed Mr Montesinos, his righthand man, handing over an apparent bribe of \u00a310,000 to a congressman. Mr Montesinos unexpectedly returned to Peru from Panama on October 23, triggering a new political crisis. In a telephone interview with a radio station, he said he had feared for his life in Panama. After flying into a military airport in a private jet, he went to ground. His whereabouts is still not known, even though President Fujimori personally led police jeeps and sniffer dogs on a showy manhunt for his former adviser. Military analysts say they believe that generals loyal to Mr Montesinos are protecting him and that Mr Fujimori knows where he is but is stymied by the fugitive's influence over his spies, generals, judges and politicians. Through years of telephone tapping and clandestine filming, Mr Montesinos is believed to have collected damning information about scores of top Peruvians. No arrest order has been issued against Mr Montesinos, who was cleared in a five-day inquiry into the \"bribery\" video when the prosecutor said he had committed no crime. Mr Montesinos has been investigated by Peru's judiciary twice on suspicion of corruption and illegal enrichment, but prosecutors have never found a case to answer. The Peruvian justice minister, Alberto Bustamante, said yesterday that the government had appointed an ad-hoc prosecutor, Jose Ugaz, to investigate the allegations of money laundering. Mr Ugaz is well known for his independence, raising expectations that this investigation will get further. Swiss authorities have invited other banks to declare if they have more Montesinos accounts. Media reports have alleged that the ex-spy chief has accounts and investments in Panama and that the \u00a335m in Zurich may be only part of his fortune. In the last decade Mr Montesinos has been accused of running paramilitary death squads, involvement in drugs trafficking, extortion, arms smuggling to Colombian rebels and corruption.",

Whereas a real book is a glorious pustule of pain and pleasure, bursting forth with a life of it's own, an UnBook is nothing more than an extended magazine article, plumped up and puffed out by publisher and hack in cahoots to part the punter from his money.</p> <p>Mind you, there's an exception to every rule, and one of my prized possessions is The Complete Naff Guide, published by Arrow Books in 1983. Comprising hundreds of hilarious lists of all things naff, one of my favourites is the following, which I've edited for reasons of space:</p> <p><strong>NAFF PARASEXUAL ACTIVITY</strong></p> <p>Riding.<br> Watching wrestling on TV.<br> Dancing on own in self-adoring way in discotheque.<br> Walking around in the nude.<br> Walking in Wales.<br> Climbing mountains.<br> Playing squash.<br> Being a schoolmaster.<br> Having a massage in the afternoon from a tattooed Turk.</p> <p>See anything missing there? How about cooking, decorating and gardening? Of course, this was the innocent 80s, when we were all sure - from my thoroughly respectable working-class parents to my profoundly reprobate media mates - that leisure time was solely designed for the extreme usage of sex and alcohol. If you'd have told us that within 10 years British people would be working longer hours with less job security than anyone else in Europe, yet still the minute they walked in the front door would not reach for the Scotch bottle but for the secateurs, stencils or saffron, we'd have - well, we wouldn't have said anything, because we'd have been in a sex-and-drink stupor.</p> <p>The New Domesticity - is it parasexual, or what? Cooking - all that kneading and whipping and rising. Gardening - all that poking and prodding and planting seeds down on your knees. And as for decorating - sweating and sawing and pushing things in where they've no chance of fitting, splashing paint and paste all over the show. If they still made Carry On films, they wouldn't be set in holiday camps and hospitals, as they used to be, but in TV studios concerned with the making of cooking, gardening and decorating programmes.

Whereas a real book is a glorious pustule of pain and pleasure, bursting forth with a life of it's own, an UnBook is nothing more than an extended magazine article, plumped up and puffed out by publisher and hack in cahoots to part the punter from his money. Mind you, there's an exception to every rule, and one of my prized possessions is The Complete Naff Guide, published by Arrow Books in 1983. Comprising hundreds of hilarious lists of all things naff, one of my favourites is the following, which I've edited for reasons of space: NAFF PARASEXUAL ACTIVITY Riding. Watching wrestling on TV. Dancing on own in self-adoring way in discotheque. Walking around in the nude. Walking in Wales. Climbing mountains. Playing squash. Being a schoolmaster. Having a massage in the afternoon from a tattooed Turk. See anything missing there? How about cooking, decorating and gardening? Of course, this was the innocent 80s, when we were all sure - from my thoroughly respectable working-class parents to my profoundly reprobate media mates - that leisure time was solely designed for the extreme usage of sex and alcohol. If you'd have told us that within 10 years British people would be working longer hours with less job security than anyone else in Europe, yet still the minute they walked in the front door would not reach for the Scotch bottle but for the secateurs, stencils or saffron, we'd have - well, we wouldn't have said anything, because we'd have been in a sex-and-drink stupor. The New Domesticity - is it parasexual, or what? Cooking - all that kneading and whipping and rising. Gardening - all that poking and prodding and planting seeds down on your knees. And as for decorating - sweating and sawing and pushing things in where they've no chance of fitting, splashing paint and paste all over the show. If they still made Carry On films, they wouldn't be set in holiday camps and hospitals, as they used to be, but in TV studios concerned with the making of cooking, gardening and decorating programmes.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On the night of August 9, 1969, on the leafy streets of West Hollywood, the Manson \"family\" carried out the ritual murders of five people, including the actress Sharon Tate. The killings spread fear and revulsion across the Hollywood Hills and beyond, signalling both the end of the hippy dream and the beginning of a collective psychic unease. Back then, riven by a foreign war and a cauldron of domestic unrest, America found in Charles Manson - who was a hippy and a psychopath - the bogeyman it needed.</p> <p>Now, more than 30 years later, West Hollywood is home to a rock star whose celebrity arguably outstrips even that of the killer whose surname he has adopted - whether in homage or as provocation it's hard to tell. Marilyn Manson, at 30, inhabits a complex role: the pop star as scapegoat.</p> <p>In the past few years, he has been accused by politicians, church leaders and concerned parents, of corrupting and depraving America's young - nothing new here in rock'n'roll terms. What took the collective fury to a new plane was the shootings at Columbine high school in Colorado last year, when two boys killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher.</p> <p>In the media-fuelled hysteria that followed, Manson was held responsible: the boys were followers of his, so the accusations went (wrongly as it turned out), and his music was an incitement to murder.</p> <p>He has, in short, become a focus for the anger, disgust and helplessness that America feels when confronted with irrefutable evidence of its own fallibility. Though obviously shaken by the intensity of the post-Columbine media witch-hunt, the role of contemporary American scapegoat is one Marilyn Manson revels in, and exploits for maximum melodrama.</p> <p>The release of his new album, Holy Wood (In the Shadow Of The Valley Of Death), is timed to coincide with the climax of the presidential election campaign, which should be doubly interesting because the Democratic candidate for vice-president, senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, is one of Manson's most consistent, and loudest, critics, famously describing the group as \"perhaps the sickest act ever promoted by a mainstream record company\".</p> <p>Manson's position as rock's reigning controversialist will be reinforced. \"Oh, it's sure to start again as soon as I put my head above the parapet,\" he chuckles, obviously relishing the notion, \"simply because I don't think the people I am attacking will ever understand the satire or the irony in my work.</p> <p>\"They will react to the surface in the same old knee-jerk way and hate me, and probably want to kill me again. And that really does fuel my fire. See, I guess I need them like they need me. They don't have a living, breathing devil and I am more than happy to play that role.\"</p> <p>Since the extraordinary success of his cross-over album, 1996's Antichrist Superstar, which entered the US charts at number three and has since sold several million copies, and at a time when rock music seems a hopelessly outmoded medium for rebellion and dissent, he has been an inspired provocateur and a lightning rod for controversy; someone who effortlessly inflames the right and doggedly tests the tolerance of liberal America.</p> <p>Today, though, his etiolated frame stretched out on a sofa in the dimly-lit interior of his manager's chic, minimalist office, Marilyn Manson comes across as the antithesis of his reputation. He immediately apologises for his lateness, which, by celebrity standards, is not really late at all. His responses are measured, thoughtful, often incisive. He is dressed head-to-toe in black, a pair of designer wraparound shades completing an ensemble that looks more Gucci than goth.</p> <p>His stick-thin frame is topped with an androgynous face whose pallor is emphasised by the shock of lank black hair that falls to his shoulders. In this light, he could pass for Nick Cave's slightly camp, even ganglier, younger brother. His voice is low, his enunciation slow and slightly drawled as seems to be the vogue among America's current arbiters of unease.</p> <p>He does not, though, seem pharmaceutically dislocated in the manner of say, Harmony Korine, the young auteur of trailer-park America, whom Manson considers one of his few creative compatriots. One senses this is someone who takes himself, his music, and his role as America's reigning rock seer and self-styled spawn of Satan utterly seriously. \"I consider myself an artist,\" he says at one point. \"I like to think I'm more Oscar Wilde than Ozzy Osbourne\".</p> <p>It is difficult to imagine what Wilde would make of a song such as Scabs, Guns &amp; Peanut Butter, whose title alone gives fair indication of the singer's abiding obsessions. His imminent album consists of a fresh slew of songs such as Disposable Teens, Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis) and A Place In The Dirt; songs about guns and religion, mass media and martyrdom, alienation and death.</p> <p>These are the constants of Marilyn Manson's work, articulated in his trademark angsty, screechy voice against a backdrop of loud, brutal, riff-leaden goth-metal. It is an acquired taste: readers of Kerrang! will be on relatively safe ground; anyone who prefers music that can be described in terms of \"nuance\" or even \"melody\" would be well advised to look elsewhere. On The Death Song, he howls a not untypical refrain: \"We are on a bullet and we're headed straight into God\". Subtlety, as one glance at his wardrobe will attest, is not Manson's strong point.</p> <p>Then again, subtlety would probably be lost both on his target audience, the hordes of alienated American adolescents who lap up this stuff, and on his myriad opponents, who view him as a threat, not just to the minds of their impressionable sons and daughters, but to the American way of life itself.</p> <p>\"I actually think I'm engaged in a revolution,\" he tells me, without a trace of irony, \"in a fight worth fighting. Our generation don't have a war. This is our fight, and it is against conservatism and ignorance, whether in American politics or American Christianity.\"</p> <p>Born and raised plain Brian Warner in the town of Canton, Ohio, Manson is the son of a nurse and a furniture salesman who served as a helicopter mechanic in Vietnam. His childhood was certainly strange: he underwent regular physical and psychological studies conducted by a government agency in order to determine whether his health had been affected by his father's possible contact with Agent Orange, the highly toxic pesticide dumped over Vietnam by American forces.</p> <p>He was, he has said, the only one in these groups of the offspring of Vietnam vets who was not physically deformed, and retains to this day an attraction to what he calls, \"physical otherness\". In the first chapter of his by turns hilarious and disgusting biography, The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, he describes in lingering detail an interlude when he spied on his grandfather masturbating in a room full of toy trains. Sickness and sexual perversion, usually sadistic, retain an abiding fascination for the adult Warner, whose stock-in-trade is shock, self-abasement and transgression.</p> <p>It is possible that Brian Warner might never have metamorphosed into Marilyn Manson had his parents not sent him to the Heritage Christian School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1974, where he learned that albums by WASP, Judas Priest and Queen were conduits for the teachings of Satan.</p> <p>Inspired, he made his first recordings there, taping and selling his own songs about sexual perversion, masturbation and farting. Like Korine, or Trey Parker, co-creator of South Park, he was a regular middle-class, middle-American heavy metal kid, and also a budding capitalist. \"I'd buy a WASP record for seven bucks and then sell it to some kid whose parents wouldn't allow him to go to the store,\" he told Rolling Stone magazine in 1996, \"then later in the day I'd go steal the album back and keep it for myself. I didn't realise it at the time but there's always been this underlying theme in the stuff that I do: it's teaching people not to be stupid.\"</p> <p>By the late 80s, the teenaged Brian Warner was writing prose - \"horror stories mostly\" - for Night Terror magazine and contributing features and interviews to a rock magazine, The 25th Parallel, for which he interviewed Trent Reznor, lead singer of industrial goth-metal group, Nine Inch Nails.</p> <p>Soon after, Warner formed his first group, Marilyn Manson &amp; The Spooky Kids. \"I wanted a name that said it all, almost a brand name. I took a celebrity martyr and a celebrity killer and put them together. If you want to understand America, you have to look at the celebrity process. It's sick and its utterly revealing about our need to celebrate even the worst aspects of our culture.\"</p> <p>In 1993, Marilyn Manson signed to Reznor's Nothing label, releasing Portrait Of An American Family, produced by Reznor in his own home - the house where Sharon Tate was murdered. The album was a cult success, the subsequent tour, a sign of what was to come: Manson was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, for \"violation of the Adult Entertainment Code\" for allegedly exposing himself and simulating sex on stage.</p> <p>The following year, an EP entitled Smells Like Children appeared, and the group hit pay dirt with an inspired reading of the Eurythmics' typically anodyne Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), which suddenly seems loaded with all manner of murky undertones.</p> <p>Fuelled by some Herculean multi-drug use, the 1995 American tour descended into a marathon orgy of self-abuse and attendant controversy that culminated, in true Spinal Tap fashion, with Manson sacking drummer Sara Lee Lucas by setting fire to his drum kit midway through a show. (Odd, sexually contrary pseudonyms seem to be a prerequisite for the group, which currently includes Madonna Wayne Gacy and Manson's longtime associate, Twiggy Ramirez.) Among the backstage diversions was an on-camera confession booth designed supposedly to \"suck sins\" from fans and groupies.</p> <p>In The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, one chapter details the torture and sexual degradation of willing, usually female, fans, many of whom have carved his name on their chests as an act of homage. In places, I tell him, the book reeked of old school rock'n'roll misogyny, in others, it suggests a warped imagination addicted to wilful exaggeration.</p> <p>He seems to interpret this as a compliment. \"Well, I do have a gift for hyperbole,\" he drawls. \"But, often, the things that seem the most exaggerated can be the most true. I'll leave it to the discerning reader to make up their own mind.\" Did he, I wonder, regret some of the depths that he has plumbed in the past: the humiliation of already damaged individuals who seem drawn to Manson and his music in order to vindicate their dysfunctionalism rather than to find redemption.</p> <p>There is a thoughtful pause. \"Well, I don't see it that way. Regret is a negative emotion, like guilt. Plus, I attract outsiders and misfits because I am one. I think I voice a lot of their alienation because for a long time I felt it. Still do, to a degree. That said, there is evolution and character growth in everyone, and things I did even a year ago, or five years ago, I wouldn't do now. It was, how shall I put it, a voyage of discovery. I had to go out there and experience it all.\"</p> <p>Although Manson ended up in hospital from his spiralling drug habit during the making of 1996's Antichrist Superstar, the difficult birth produced a record that propelled him into the mainstream. An impossibly convoluted goth-metal concept album about personal and global apocalypse, Antichrist Superstar remains Marilyn Manson's defining statement.</p> <p>Though it sounded neither new nor particularly inspired, it was perfectly timed: a big, doomy, histrionic, end-of-the-millennium howl of anger and anguish. Plus, Manson looked weird, otherworldly even, and, like David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust before him, paraded his polysexuality almost as a badge of identity.</p> <p>From this side of the Atlantic, it is difficult to make sense of Manson's celebrity infamy and the hysteria he provokes, not least because his music has never brought him any critical credibility. Although the genre was invented in the UK by groups such as The Cure, The Mission and Sisters Of Mercy, goth is seen here as the music of the terminally adolescent and unapologetically pretentious: a soundtrack for those who spend their lives in black-painted bedrooms convinced that moroseness is an aesthetic end in itself.</p> <p>In America, though, most notably on the sunny, unreal West Coast, goth, whether old school (The Cure, The Cult), industrial (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails), or arty (The Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson), equals cool. In the land of sun-tanned, health-obsessed body fascism, a penchant for black eyeliner, pale skin and layers of greying lace and velvet signifies otherness, outsiderdom, and remains a sure-fire way to shock and outrage parents, politicians and society at large. What is dismissed here as adolescent pantomime posturing, more Addams family than Manson family, is often seen over there as the first step on the slippery slope to eternal damnation.</p> <p>Manson's now infamous 1996/7 Dead To The World tour was a triumph of spectacle and puerility. The provocations included wilful obscenity: mock copulation, onanism and flagellation; and even more wilful blasphemy: a pulpit draped in pseudo-fascist banners from which he ripped up copies of the Bible, and led the audience in chants of \"kill God\". Needless to say, the Christian right responded vigorously, picketing gigs and lobbying the Senate and state authorities in (sometimes successful) attempts to have shows banned. Things reached an absurd pitch when, in Texas, a fan was arrested on his way to a gig for wearing a Marilyn Manson T-shirt.</p> <p>Manson fuelled anger and opprobrium, as well as obsessive devotion, across America, in much the same way that the Sex Pistols did in Britain in 1977. But, whereas Johnny Rotten and his cohorts homed in on the Queen as the symbol of all things moribund and hypocritical about Great Britain, Manson chose God - or, to be more precise, contemporary Christianity - as the symbol of everything in mainstream America he held in contempt.</p> <p>He aroused an almost primordial fear in the hearts of his enemies by declaring in interviews that he was a Satanist. In his biography, he writes, \"The devil doesn't exist. Satanism is about worshipping yourself, because you are responsible for your own good and evil ... I'm not, and never have been, a spokesperson for Satanism. It's simply part of what I believe in, along with Dr Seuss, Dr Hook, Nietzsche and the Bible ... \"</p> <p>Again, the irony, as well as the veiled retraction, was lost on the American religious right. There are currently countless Christian and/or concerned parents' anti-Marilyn Manson internet sites. The Dayton Family Network, for instance, prints Manson's song lyrics preceded by the following warning: \"Please proceed only if you are prepared to confront Satan himself\". A show in Orlando, Florida, in 1999, was picketed by Christian groups who distributed a protest prayer, which, in its apocalyptic poetry, gives some indication of the kind of mind-set Manson has chosen, in his singular way, to do battle with. It reads:</p> <p>O foul and evil spirits who have brought</p> <p>The music group Marilyn Manson into Orlando,</p> <p>And have consumed and possessed the bodies and minds</p> <p>Of all who are part of the group or an aid to their movements,</p> <p>By the power given us by Jesus Christ, and in his holy name,</p> <p>We hereby bind the buses and trucks that will bring</p> <p>Marilyn Manson and their music into our community,</p> <p>We bind the engine that makes the car run,</p> <p>And the fuel that makes the engine run,</p> <p>We bind the lights and the amplifiers,</p> <p>The microphones and the musical equipment</p> <p>Needed for their vile and blasphemous</p> <p>performance. We bind the mouth and hands and feet</p> <p>Of the members of Marilyn Manson</p> <p>So that they cannot sow lies</p> <p>And spread discontent among our youth ...</p> <p>Needless to say, the show went ahead. \"That kind of reaction is kinda boring now,\" Manson sighs, drawing bony fingers through his hair. \"It's, like, so preprogrammed and one dimensional and dumb in a particularly American way. The thing that bugs me most about Christians is their assumption they have a monopoly on morality; the premise they start from is that they have a literally God-given right to impose their belief systems on everyone else.</p> <p>\"It's like, those people in Africa are heathens, we need to convert them to God. I mean, c'mon, in this day and age. It's almost too easy to get them going but, in a way, it needs to be done because they do have real power, and they'd like to be able to silence anyone who differs.

I plead the First Amendment every time.\"</p> <p>If 1998's Mechanical Animals, which added glam-rock signatures to the goth-metal formula, suggested that Manson had mellowed, the events of April 20, 1999, suddenly sealed his reputation as the man America loved to hate.

The way I see it, the mass psychology is - as long as America can find a bad guy, everyone can feel safe. It's that simple.\"</p> <p>In the end, finding that \"in the business, suddenly all these doors were shutting in my face\", Manson wrote an impassioned and articulate response in Rolling Stone magazine. \"I was approached by every media outlet in America, but I refused to be part of the charade.

      "bodyText": "On the night of August 9, 1969, on the leafy streets of West Hollywood, the Manson \"family\" carried out the ritual murders of five people, including the actress Sharon Tate. The killings spread fear and revulsion across the Hollywood Hills and beyond, signalling both the end of the hippy dream and the beginning of a collective psychic unease. Back then, riven by a foreign war and a cauldron of domestic unrest, America found in Charles Manson - who was a hippy and a psychopath - the bogeyman it needed. Now, more than 30 years later, West Hollywood is home to a rock star whose celebrity arguably outstrips even that of the killer whose surname he has adopted - whether in homage or as provocation it's hard to tell. Marilyn Manson, at 30, inhabits a complex role: the pop star as scapegoat. In the past few years, he has been accused by politicians, church leaders and concerned parents, of corrupting and depraving America's young - nothing new here in rock'n'roll terms. What took the collective fury to a new plane was the shootings at Columbine high school in Colorado last year, when two boys killed 12 of their classmates and a teacher. In the media-fuelled hysteria that followed, Manson was held responsible: the boys were followers of his, so the accusations went (wrongly as it turned out), and his music was an incitement to murder. He has, in short, become a focus for the anger, disgust and helplessness that America feels when confronted with irrefutable evidence of its own fallibility. Though obviously shaken by the intensity of the post-Columbine media witch-hunt, the role of contemporary American scapegoat is one Marilyn Manson revels in, and exploits for maximum melodrama. The release of his new album, Holy Wood (In the Shadow Of The Valley Of Death), is timed to coincide with the climax of the presidential election campaign, which should be doubly interesting because the Democratic candidate for vice-president, senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, is one of Manson's most consistent, and loudest, critics, famously describing the group as \"perhaps the sickest act ever promoted by a mainstream record company\". Manson's position as rock's reigning controversialist will be reinforced. \"Oh, it's sure to start again as soon as I put my head above the parapet,\" he chuckles, obviously relishing the notion, \"simply because I don't think the people I am attacking will ever understand the satire or the irony in my work. \"They will react to the surface in the same old knee-jerk way and hate me, and probably want to kill me again. And that really does fuel my fire. See, I guess I need them like they need me. They don't have a living, breathing devil and I am more than happy to play that role.\" Since the extraordinary success of his cross-over album, 1996's Antichrist Superstar, which entered the US charts at number three and has since sold several million copies, and at a time when rock music seems a hopelessly outmoded medium for rebellion and dissent, he has been an inspired provocateur and a lightning rod for controversy; someone who effortlessly inflames the right and doggedly tests the tolerance of liberal America. Today, though, his etiolated frame stretched out on a sofa in the dimly-lit interior of his manager's chic, minimalist office, Marilyn Manson comes across as the antithesis of his reputation. He immediately apologises for his lateness, which, by celebrity standards, is not really late at all. His responses are measured, thoughtful, often incisive. He is dressed head-to-toe in black, a pair of designer wraparound shades completing an ensemble that looks more Gucci than goth. His stick-thin frame is topped with an androgynous face whose pallor is emphasised by the shock of lank black hair that falls to his shoulders. In this light, he could pass for Nick Cave's slightly camp, even ganglier, younger brother. His voice is low, his enunciation slow and slightly drawled as seems to be the vogue among America's current arbiters of unease. He does not, though, seem pharmaceutically dislocated in the manner of say, Harmony Korine, the young auteur of trailer-park America, whom Manson considers one of his few creative compatriots. One senses this is someone who takes himself, his music, and his role as America's reigning rock seer and self-styled spawn of Satan utterly seriously. \"I consider myself an artist,\" he says at one point. \"I like to think I'm more Oscar Wilde than Ozzy Osbourne\". It is difficult to imagine what Wilde would make of a song such as Scabs, Guns &amp; Peanut Butter, whose title alone gives fair indication of the singer's abiding obsessions. His imminent album consists of a fresh slew of songs such as Disposable Teens, Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis) and A Place In The Dirt; songs about guns and religion, mass media and martyrdom, alienation and death. These are the constants of Marilyn Manson's work, articulated in his trademark angsty, screechy voice against a backdrop of loud, brutal, riff-leaden goth-metal. It is an acquired taste: readers of Kerrang! will be on relatively safe ground; anyone who prefers music that can be described in terms of \"nuance\" or even \"melody\" would be well advised to look elsewhere. On The Death Song, he howls a not untypical refrain: \"We are on a bullet and we're headed straight into God\". Subtlety, as one glance at his wardrobe will attest, is not Manson's strong point. Then again, subtlety would probably be lost both on his target audience, the hordes of alienated American adolescents who lap up this stuff, and on his myriad opponents, who view him as a threat, not just to the minds of their impressionable sons and daughters, but to the American way of life itself. \"I actually think I'm engaged in a revolution,\" he tells me, without a trace of irony, \"in a fight worth fighting. Our generation don't have a war. This is our fight, and it is against conservatism and ignorance, whether in American politics or American Christianity.\" Born and raised plain Brian Warner in the town of Canton, Ohio, Manson is the son of a nurse and a furniture salesman who served as a helicopter mechanic in Vietnam. His childhood was certainly strange: he underwent regular physical and psychological studies conducted by a government agency in order to determine whether his health had been affected by his father's possible contact with Agent Orange, the highly toxic pesticide dumped over Vietnam by American forces. He was, he has said, the only one in these groups of the offspring of Vietnam vets who was not physically deformed, and retains to this day an attraction to what he calls, \"physical otherness\". In the first chapter of his by turns hilarious and disgusting biography, The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, he describes in lingering detail an interlude when he spied on his grandfather masturbating in a room full of toy trains. Sickness and sexual perversion, usually sadistic, retain an abiding fascination for the adult Warner, whose stock-in-trade is shock, self-abasement and transgression. It is possible that Brian Warner might never have metamorphosed into Marilyn Manson had his parents not sent him to the Heritage Christian School in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1974, where he learned that albums by WASP, Judas Priest and Queen were conduits for the teachings of Satan. Inspired, he made his first recordings there, taping and selling his own songs about sexual perversion, masturbation and farting. Like Korine, or Trey Parker, co-creator of South Park, he was a regular middle-class, middle-American heavy metal kid, and also a budding capitalist. \"I'd buy a WASP record for seven bucks and then sell it to some kid whose parents wouldn't allow him to go to the store,\" he told Rolling Stone magazine in 1996, \"then later in the day I'd go steal the album back and keep it for myself. I didn't realise it at the time but there's always been this underlying theme in the stuff that I do: it's teaching people not to be stupid.\" By the late 80s, the teenaged Brian Warner was writing prose - \"horror stories mostly\" - for Night Terror magazine and contributing features and interviews to a rock magazine, The 25th Parallel, for which he interviewed Trent Reznor, lead singer of industrial goth-metal group, Nine Inch Nails. Soon after, Warner formed his first group, Marilyn Manson &amp; The Spooky Kids. \"I wanted a name that said it all, almost a brand name. I took a celebrity martyr and a celebrity killer and put them together. If you want to understand America, you have to look at the celebrity process. It's sick and its utterly revealing about our need to celebrate even the worst aspects of our culture.\" In 1993, Marilyn Manson signed to Reznor's Nothing label, releasing Portrait Of An American Family, produced by Reznor in his own home - the house where Sharon Tate was murdered. The album was a cult success, the subsequent tour, a sign of what was to come: Manson was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, for \"violation of the Adult Entertainment Code\" for allegedly exposing himself and simulating sex on stage. The following year, an EP entitled Smells Like Children appeared, and the group hit pay dirt with an inspired reading of the Eurythmics' typically anodyne Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This), which suddenly seems loaded with all manner of murky undertones. Fuelled by some Herculean multi-drug use, the 1995 American tour descended into a marathon orgy of self-abuse and attendant controversy that culminated, in true Spinal Tap fashion, with Manson sacking drummer Sara Lee Lucas by setting fire to his drum kit midway through a show. (Odd, sexually contrary pseudonyms seem to be a prerequisite for the group, which currently includes Madonna Wayne Gacy and Manson's longtime associate, Twiggy Ramirez.) Among the backstage diversions was an on-camera confession booth designed supposedly to \"suck sins\" from fans and groupies. In The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell, one chapter details the torture and sexual degradation of willing, usually female, fans, many of whom have carved his name on their chests as an act of homage. In places, I tell him, the book reeked of old school rock'n'roll misogyny, in others, it suggests a warped imagination addicted to wilful exaggeration. He seems to interpret this as a compliment. \"Well, I do have a gift for hyperbole,\" he drawls. \"But, often, the things that seem the most exaggerated can be the most true. I'll leave it to the discerning reader to make up their own mind.\" Did he, I wonder, regret some of the depths that he has plumbed in the past: the humiliation of already damaged individuals who seem drawn to Manson and his music in order to vindicate their dysfunctionalism rather than to find redemption. There is a thoughtful pause. \"Well, I don't see it that way. Regret is a negative emotion, like guilt. Plus, I attract outsiders and misfits because I am one. I think I voice a lot of their alienation because for a long time I felt it. Still do, to a degree. That said, there is evolution and character growth in everyone, and things I did even a year ago, or five years ago, I wouldn't do now. It was, how shall I put it, a voyage of discovery. I had to go out there and experience it all.\" Although Manson ended up in hospital from his spiralling drug habit during the making of 1996's Antichrist Superstar, the difficult birth produced a record that propelled him into the mainstream. An impossibly convoluted goth-metal concept album about personal and global apocalypse, Antichrist Superstar remains Marilyn Manson's defining statement. Though it sounded neither new nor particularly inspired, it was perfectly timed: a big, doomy, histrionic, end-of-the-millennium howl of anger and anguish. Plus, Manson looked weird, otherworldly even, and, like David Bowie as Ziggy Stardust before him, paraded his polysexuality almost as a badge of identity. From this side of the Atlantic, it is difficult to make sense of Manson's celebrity infamy and the hysteria he provokes, not least because his music has never brought him any critical credibility. Although the genre was invented in the UK by groups such as The Cure, The Mission and Sisters Of Mercy, goth is seen here as the music of the terminally adolescent and unapologetically pretentious: a soundtrack for those who spend their lives in black-painted bedrooms convinced that moroseness is an aesthetic end in itself. In America, though, most notably on the sunny, unreal West Coast, goth, whether old school (The Cure, The Cult), industrial (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails), or arty (The Smashing Pumpkins, Marilyn Manson), equals cool. In the land of sun-tanned, health-obsessed body fascism, a penchant for black eyeliner, pale skin and layers of greying lace and velvet signifies otherness, outsiderdom, and remains a sure-fire way to shock and outrage parents, politicians and society at large. What is dismissed here as adolescent pantomime posturing, more Addams family than Manson family, is often seen over there as the first step on the slippery slope to eternal damnation. Manson's now infamous 1996/7 Dead To The World tour was a triumph of spectacle and puerility. The provocations included wilful obscenity: mock copulation, onanism and flagellation; and even more wilful blasphemy: a pulpit draped in pseudo-fascist banners from which he ripped up copies of the Bible, and led the audience in chants of \"kill God\". Needless to say, the Christian right responded vigorously, picketing gigs and lobbying the Senate and state authorities in (sometimes successful) attempts to have shows banned. Things reached an absurd pitch when, in Texas, a fan was arrested on his way to a gig for wearing a Marilyn Manson T-shirt. Manson fuelled anger and opprobrium, as well as obsessive devotion, across America, in much the same way that the Sex Pistols did in Britain in 1977. But, whereas Johnny Rotten and his cohorts homed in on the Queen as the symbol of all things moribund and hypocritical about Great Britain, Manson chose God - or, to be more precise, contemporary Christianity - as the symbol of everything in mainstream America he held in contempt. He aroused an almost primordial fear in the hearts of his enemies by declaring in interviews that he was a Satanist. In his biography, he writes, \"The devil doesn't exist. Satanism is about worshipping yourself, because you are responsible for your own good and evil ... I'm not, and never have been, a spokesperson for Satanism. It's simply part of what I believe in, along with Dr Seuss, Dr Hook, Nietzsche and the Bible ... \" Again, the irony, as well as the veiled retraction, was lost on the American religious right. There are currently countless Christian and/or concerned parents' anti-Marilyn Manson internet sites. The Dayton Family Network, for instance, prints Manson's song lyrics preceded by the following warning: \"Please proceed only if you are prepared to confront Satan himself\". A show in Orlando, Florida, in 1999, was picketed by Christian groups who distributed a protest prayer, which, in its apocalyptic poetry, gives some indication of the kind of mind-set Manson has chosen, in his singular way, to do battle with. It reads: O foul and evil spirits who have brought The music group Marilyn Manson into Orlando, And have consumed and possessed the bodies and minds Of all who are part of the group or an aid to their movements, By the power given us by Jesus Christ, and in his holy name, We hereby bind the buses and trucks that will bring Marilyn Manson and their music into our community, We bind the engine that makes the car run, And the fuel that makes the engine run, We bind the lights and the amplifiers, The microphones and the musical equipment Needed for their vile and blasphemous performance. We bind the mouth and hands and feet Of the members of Marilyn Manson So that they cannot sow lies And spread discontent among our youth ... Needless to say, the show went ahead. \"That kind of reaction is kinda boring now,\" Manson sighs, drawing bony fingers through his hair. \"It's, like, so preprogrammed and one dimensional and dumb in a particularly American way. The thing that bugs me most about Christians is their assumption they have a monopoly on morality; the premise they start from is that they have a literally God-given right to impose their belief systems on everyone else. \"It's like, those people in Africa are heathens, we need to convert them to God. I mean, c'mon, in this day and age. It's almost too easy to get them going but, in a way, it needs to be done because they do have real power, and they'd like to be able to silence anyone who differs. Religion is big business in America and it's not taxed. How morally wrong is that? I kinda see myself, among other things, as a fighter for freedom of speech. I plead the First Amendment every time.\" If 1998's Mechanical Animals, which added glam-rock signatures to the goth-metal formula, suggested that Manson had mellowed, the events of April 20, 1999, suddenly sealed his reputation as the man America loved to hate. And blame. On that day, two high school students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, both members of a loosely-knit teenage cabal who shared a Hitler fixation, and called themselves the Trenchcoat Mafia, walked into Columbine high school in Littleton, Colorado, and killed 13 people. The apparently motiveless massacre sent America into a frenzy of recrimination, which centred not on obvious contributing factors such as the easy availability of guns nor the dysfunctional family backgrounds of the two protagonists, but on the search for a scapegoat. Rock's sexually indeterminate, self-confessed Satanist was the figure they chose to blame. KILLERS WORSHIPPED ROCK FREAK MANSON, howled the Sun, aping the headlines across the Atlantic, before adding to the mountain of misinformation and exaggeration that now clung to his name: \"The reviled rock star's live shows feature routines such as smoking dried excrement, performing depraved sex acts and torturing animals.\" In America, the anti-Marilyn Manson frenzy reached such intensity that he was forced to cut short his tour amid fears of reprisals on the band and road crew. \"I saw it happen live on TV and I said immediately, 'They're going to blame me for this.' Five minutes later, I heard the reporter say, 'The killers were wearing white make-up and Marilyn Manson T-shirts.' All completely untrue, as it turned out. I mean, they didn't even like me. I looked into it after it happened: they weren't wearing make-up, they weren't goth kids. \"These were white, urban kids, pretty well-off, with no apparent reason to go on a killing spree.

It raised some hard questions about our society but, of course, the knee-jerk response prevailed - 'Who's to blame? Let's get the weirdo.' The way I see it, the mass psychology is - as long as America can find a bad guy, everyone can feel safe. It's that simple.\" In the end, finding that \"in the business, suddenly all these doors were shutting in my face\", Manson wrote an impassioned and articulate response in Rolling Stone magazine. \"I was approached by every media outlet in America, but I refused to be part of the charade. Then, when things died down a bit, I thought, I have to respond to this. I mean, I was upset like everyone else by what happened. I'm not some emotionless creature.

He stays indoors a lot when he is not on the road, holed up in his Hollywood Hills mansion, once owned by Harry Houdini, another master of illusion and self-mythology. His tabloid-documented romance with actress Rose McGowan seems to have stabilised him somewhat, psychologically as well as creatively. The new album, though still histrionic and angst-ridden, seems somehow less self-obsessed, more concerned with the bigger picture: a nation's need for bad guys, demons, scapegoats whom it can vilify and simultaneously canonise. But Manson's music is still one long howl against: against the mainstream, against his detractors, but mainly against the America that made him. \"I'm still angry,\" he admits, \"but I'm happy too.

      "body": "<p>The latest edition of the American Esquire magazine publishes a long \"exit interview\" with Bill Clinton about his eight years in the White House. How had the presidency changed him, he was asked; and he said it had changed him for the better. \"Because I laboured from the first day I was in office, and even in the campaign, under a virtually unprecedented barrage of attack, both political and personal, it helped me to develop a certain discipline and a certain humility . . .it made me sort of get up and go to work every day, no matter what else was going on. And so I think that it helped me personally to be a better person, to be constantly judged and condemned and torn apart, then to have to confess error and be publicly humiliated and all that. . .it really helped me a lot, because I think that one of the greatest sins of character almost everybody is vulnerable to is pride.\"</p> <p>It is known that Clinton managed to put in an extraordinary amount of government work throughout the Monica Lewinsky scandal and his consequent impeachment by Congress, and he now credits this for his continuing popularity as he prepares to leave office next January. The American people realise that he has been working for them, for the good of the United States, he said, while his opponents - the politicians who tried to bring him down - have just been working for themselves and their own narrow political interests. The Republicans, he said, have failed to make his character an issue against Al Gore in the current presidential campaign for two reasons: \"One is, unlike them, I have apologised for what I did wrong, and most Americans think I paid a pretty high price. Most people make a personal mistake, but they're not publicly humiliated and strip-searched. But everybody pays a personal price, and most Americans know that the family price is the highest price. So most people are not like politicians and pundits who only keep score in terms of whether you got hurt politically. Most people got this, and they know that I didn't get out of this for free.\"</p> <p>Clinton didn't, of course, say what this \"family price\" has been. Does Hillary hate him now, or at any rate hate him any more than she did before the scandal? Has divorce been considered? Has their daughter Chelsea taken against him? There is no way of knowing. But Clinton said in the same interview that what he would really like to do after leaving the White House would be to take them both on a holiday around the world (if Hillary's election to the Senate does not preclude it). And in his final summing up, he said that his time as President has been \"a wonderful, wonderful time\" not just for him, but \"a fabulous experience for my family - my wife and daughter\".</p> <p>That sounds extraordinary after what they've been through, but it could very well be the case. In her new book about Jackie Kennedy, America's Queen, Sarah Bradford describes the shaky state of her marriage to her adulterous husband, Jack Kennedy, as he was preparing for the presidential campaign of 1960. Jackie was very worried about the effects the campaign would have on their family life and asked an old friend, the columnist Joe Alsop, for his opinion. \"It's the only game that's worth the candle,\" he told her. Bradford writes that these were \"words she thought about again and again\" and that \"gradually she had come round to his point of view and begun to feel happy about the situation\".</p> <p>Jack's adultery continued, even got worse, while he was president, but their marriage got stronger because of the burden they shared and his growing appreciation of her supportive role. Then he was murdered in Dallas in 1963, and we will never know what would have become of them as a couple if he had lived. They would doubtless have soldiered on together so long as they were still in the White House - divorce would have been inconceivable in those circumstances - but it is much less certain that their marriage would have survived their departure from it.</p> <p>If Al Gore loses the presidential election next week, I suspect it will be because of one grave political mistake - his decision that Clinton was an electoral liability from whom he should dissociate himself during the campaign. Hillary, being his wife, has hardly been able to do that in her campaign for the Senate. And the electorate's continuing love of her husband (who would have sailed back to the White House if he had been permitted to run again) has turned out to be one of her main electoral assets. But maybe she doesn't really want the Senate job for its own sake. Maybe she is going for it just to keep their marriage together, for without the bond of politics and power, it is difficult to see how it could survive.</p>",

He promises to send me his play about Kublai Khan. Or was it Ayub? </p> <p>Harris, along with her sister Sophie and Elizabeth Montgomery - together known as Motley - dominated British theatre design for many years. She is a sprightly 95 and, like all lively old people, full of moving stories. She talks, among other things, about Gielgud's generosity, about cutting away the \"fuss\" from the stage, and about the abstract being incompatible with theatre - you're always stuck on stage with the irreducibility of human beings. </p> <p>To the National Theatre to interview Tom Stoppard. I feel very dislocated, doing something unfamiliar in a wholly familiar place. But, as a professional necessity, theatre does not condone nostalgia: when a show is over, it's over, and a new show places demands on your attention and your affections. Tom and I talk, among other things, about whether buildings outlast the expansionist impulse to create them, looking around at the cathedral of the NT, a monument to the 1960s. We wander into the bookshop. They don't have my book on display, but they do have a shelf of Tom's work. \"You've written more than Proust,\" I say to Tom. \"More jokes, too,\" he says. We walk through the rain for the camera. I'm holding an umbrella, which turns inside out. The director chastises me for stopping instead of keeping going. It pours down; there are buckets in the foyer. </p> <p><strong> October 7</strong> </p> <p>Drive to Stratford-on-Avon. It feels like an island resort: Shakespeare-on-Sea. The theatre always has the air of the end of a pier, and cutting-edge Shakespeare productions sit uneasily beside the heritage relics and the National Trustery. It's pouring with rain. I meet the cast of Othello, who we're going to film in a backstage sequence in Newcastle. I explain to the actors what we're up to, and say that among other things I'm interested in Shakespeare's take on the world - the point of view of an actor and producer, sceptical of authority. Shakespeare writes brilliantly about soldiers (the profession of most of his protagonists), and the actors sit there - as actors often do - patient as crack troops being briefed for a suicide mission. </p> <p>I watch the matinee of Othello. The play more often than not fails to work its magic, but this is a clear production with a moving performance from Ray Fearon as Othello - a rarity. Othello is usually trampled underfoot by Iago. I've been thinking a lot about Shakespeare's originality: above all it's in his characterisation, which is universally detailed without a hierarchy of detail. \"That William Shakespeare, he certainly knew how to write,\" said cockney comic actor Arthur Mullard when he was offered a part in Twelfth Night. In the circle and balcony the audience are young and attentive; in the stalls I'm the youngest by a few years. In the bar of my hotel I listen to an aged couple discussing whether to go to a friend's funeral as if they were talking about a trip to the theatre. </p> <p><strong> October 8</strong> </p> <p>I do a piece to camera on a motorboat, passing under a bridge as I refer to \"entering a time warp\". By take five we've achieved the desired combination of position of boat, presenter, Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, swans, ducks and dialogue. This is acting, trying to appear spontaneous and facing the actor's perennial paradox: how to tread the line between being conscious of your self and being self-conscious. The rest of the day I wander pensively for the camera and sit on a tour bus which takes me round the various Shakespeare shrines. I learn nothing except the meaning of pin money and a \"Roker\" (a form of cow), and how rich Shakespeare became. That's one of the dark secrets of the theatre: successful playwrights do very nicely, thank you. </p> <p><strong> October 12</strong> </p> <p>\"Success smells of Brighton,\" said Laurence Olivier, which is why I'm going there on a train. As I settle in my seat, a woman asks me if she can have the jobs supplement of my Guardian. \"You don't look as if you need it,\" she says. Mmmm... For me, Brighton always smells of sauciness rather than success. In the mid-60s my sister's best friend asked me if I would help her with her divorce: I had to be photographed by a private detective, semi-naked and engaging in simulated sex in a Brighton hotel room, to provide evidence for her husband to cite me as co-respondent. I can't think why I refused. But here I am being photographed fully clothed, talking about Olivier, saying that Brighton has the characteristics of his acting: raffish, cocky, sexy, and a bit flash. Ray, the keeper of the whelk stall that we have commandeered, seems to think it's true - of Brighton, at least. </p> <p>We've been told that Olivier had a beach hut, so we find ourselves outside a row of concrete boxes - 1, Madeira Drive - as unglamorous as lock-up garages on a council estate. They are deserted but for the occupant of number two, who tells us, \"It's a very thespian town - Laurence Olivier, Max Miller, Terence Rattigan and Dora what's-her-name.\" </p> <p>We end the day on Brighton Pier, which is celebrating its centenary. There's another BBC film crew there, for a children's programme; all three of the presenters are young enough to be my grandchildren. I do a piece to camera about the decline of heroic acting as nature provides a perfect picture- postcard Technicolor sunset. \"Larry would have loved it,\" says Robin, the researcher. </p> <p><strong> October 14</strong> </p> <p>National Theatre. Spend the day feeling like a returned exile, hugging, greeting, explaining what I'm doing and increasingly feeling that I've abandoned my profession. I'm like a seeded Wimbledon player who's unaccountably become an umpire. I interview Trevor Nunn in his office (my old office). He's touchingly nervous. He's thought hard about my questions and is very cogent. We talk about the difficulty of large theatres. He tells me that he's just had a letter from Denys Lasdun [architect of the National Theatre] congratulating him on using the Olivier \"properly\" for his production of Summerfolk. Trevor says he should write back saying, \"Thank you. I had to raise the stage by 3ft, move it downstage by 17ft, and cover most of the walls of the auditorium with black drapes. Apart from that, everything was as you designed it.\" Roger, the director, remarks on how similar the NT is to the BBC - ie a maze of departments and not much apparent contact between them. </p> <p><strong> November 18</strong> </p> <p>To the Globe Theatre to interview Mark Rylance, actor-manager-director, who is dressed piratically in a bandanna under a pork-pie hat, large gold earring, tartan jacket and bow tie. I'm not sure about the synthetic Elizabethanism of the Globe, but Mark makes a passionate defence of it. His evangelical zeal and his protean gifts as an actor have carried many sceptics away. To be among an audience who are unquestionably moved by the sight, and above all, the sound of a Shakespeare play in broad daylight is to be obliged to recognise that it's folly to be proscriptive about the experience of theatre. And his theatre is full; he made a small surplus this year without any subsidy.</p>",

I've been thinking a lot about Shakespeare's originality: above all it's in his characterisation, which is universally detailed without a hierarchy of detail. \"That William Shakespeare, he certainly knew how to write,\" said cockney comic actor Arthur Mullard when he was offered a part in Twelfth Night. In the circle and balcony the audience are young and attentive; in the stalls I'm the youngest by a few years. In the bar of my hotel I listen to an aged couple discussing whether to go to a friend's funeral as if they were talking about a trip to the theatre. October 8 I do a piece to camera on a motorboat, passing under a bridge as I refer to \"entering a time warp\". By take five we've achieved the desired combination of position of boat, presenter, Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, swans, ducks and dialogue. This is acting, trying to appear spontaneous and facing the actor's perennial paradox: how to tread the line between being conscious of your self and being self-conscious. The rest of the day I wander pensively for the camera and sit on a tour bus which takes me round the various Shakespeare shrines. I learn nothing except the meaning of pin money and a \"Roker\" (a form of cow), and how rich Shakespeare became. That's one of the dark secrets of the theatre: successful playwrights do very nicely, thank you. October 12 \"Success smells of Brighton,\" said Laurence Olivier, which is why I'm going there on a train. As I settle in my seat, a woman asks me if she can have the jobs supplement of my Guardian. \"You don't look as if you need it,\" she says. Mmmm... For me, Brighton always smells of sauciness rather than success. In the mid-60s my sister's best friend asked me if I would help her with her divorce: I had to be photographed by a private detective, semi-naked and engaging in simulated sex in a Brighton hotel room, to provide evidence for her husband to cite me as co-respondent. I can't think why I refused. But here I am being photographed fully clothed, talking about Olivier, saying that Brighton has the characteristics of his acting: raffish, cocky, sexy, and a bit flash. Ray, the keeper of the whelk stall that we have commandeered, seems to think it's true - of Brighton, at least. We've been told that Olivier had a beach hut, so we find ourselves outside a row of concrete boxes - 1, Madeira Drive - as unglamorous as lock-up garages on a council estate. They are deserted but for the occupant of number two, who tells us, \"It's a very thespian town - Laurence Olivier, Max Miller, Terence Rattigan and Dora what's-her-name.\" We end the day on Brighton Pier, which is celebrating its centenary. There's another BBC film crew there, for a children's programme; all three of the presenters are young enough to be my grandchildren. I do a piece to camera about the decline of heroic acting as nature provides a perfect picture- postcard Technicolor sunset. \"Larry would have loved it,\" says Robin, the researcher. October 14 National Theatre. Spend the day feeling like a returned exile, hugging, greeting, explaining what I'm doing and increasingly feeling that I've abandoned my profession. I'm like a seeded Wimbledon player who's unaccountably become an umpire. I interview Trevor Nunn in his office (my old office). He's touchingly nervous. He's thought hard about my questions and is very cogent. We talk about the difficulty of large theatres. He tells me that he's just had a letter from Denys Lasdun [architect of the National Theatre] congratulating him on using the Olivier \"properly\" for his production of Summerfolk. Trevor says he should write back saying, \"Thank you. I had to raise the stage by 3ft, move it downstage by 17ft, and cover most of the walls of the auditorium with black drapes. Apart from that, everything was as you designed it.\" Roger, the director, remarks on how similar the NT is to the BBC - ie a maze of departments and not much apparent contact between them. November 18 To the Globe Theatre to interview Mark Rylance, actor-manager-director, who is dressed piratically in a bandanna under a pork-pie hat, large gold earring, tartan jacket and bow tie. I'm not sure about the synthetic Elizabethanism of the Globe, but Mark makes a passionate defence of it. His evangelical zeal and his protean gifts as an actor have carried many sceptics away. To be among an audience who are unquestionably moved by the sight, and above all, the sound of a Shakespeare play in broad daylight is to be obliged to recognise that it's folly to be proscriptive about the experience of theatre. And his theatre is full; he made a small surplus this year without any subsidy.",

      "body": "<p>Listen with Mother presenter Julia Lang once confessed that the main qualification for her job was having no fear \"of making a fool of oneself\". For Julia, the tomfoolery amounted to little more than a quick burst of song, perhaps Mitten the Kitten. Now, in the brash world of children's presenting, such gentility is hardly a prerequisite (though looking like a model is). It's especially not needed on radio since the bizarre decision, in 1998, to end bespoke children's shows on Radio 4. There is no audience, the justification ran - evil television has triumphed. </p> <p>Ignoring the fact that children listen to a huge amount of radio, much of it music-based commercial radio, the powers that be made pretty sure there would be no under-12s audience for non-pop driven radio by cancelling all output. Sense is now returning. A new Radio 4 show for children will be launched in spring, and there are plans for a BBC digital radio channel for the same audience. There are other signs of youthful life, too, including Radio 3's sweet new series, Making Tracks, 20 minutes of music (everything but pop) smartly scheduled at 3.40pm, perfect for the journey home from school. </p> <p>It has an endearing sticky-back plastic Blue Peter squareness to it - which is no coincidence, as the presenters, Simon Thomas and Matt Baker, are from Blue Peter, as is its theme tune. The emphasis is on a non-egghead air when classical tracks are played so they are emphatically demystified. </p> <p>So, before the William Tell Overture, a few words of explanation (\"William Tell was the guy who...\"); before Prokofiev, a neat summary of what mood to expect (\"circuses, clowns, that type of thing\"). Composers' names are enunciated clearly and slowly; jazz, folk and world music are mixed with classical; and the show's website is full of further information for inquisitive little treasures (swots). </p> <p>Best of all is a regular spot for cartoon theme tunes. \"One of my favourite things, cartoons,\" Matt enthused. \"More cartoon themes to come,\" he enthused again later. I think Radio 3 think they've cracked this yoof thing - why did no one think to play music from The Little Mermaid before? </p> <p>Another way to find and keep a young audience is to target specific groups, and this is what the fantabulous Barbie FM did. I say did , for this was but a short-lived burst of fluffy pink power on the airwaves. A digital station available online, it was the brainchild of Amy (eight) and Hattie (six), daughters of TV presenter David Freeman. Radio by girls for girls, it mixed pop (Destiny's Child, Billie, Steps) with chat about the burning issues of the day such as: \"What makes a good sleepover?\" </p> <p>Only on- ir for two days, it was nonetheless a sign of how radio scheduling will change in the digital age. If that means Patsy Kensit (who made her radio presenting debut on Barbie, cooing \"We all love Barbie!\") and interviews with authors who have won Smarties Awards, I'm all for it. If I was in its target age group, I'd love this sickly sweet confection of a station (I quite love it even though I'm not). And I would have my first crush on a sensitive boy who listens to Making Tracks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Listen with Mother presenter Julia Lang once confessed that the main qualification for her job was having no fear \"of making a fool of oneself\". For Julia, the tomfoolery amounted to little more than a quick burst of song, perhaps Mitten the Kitten. Now, in the brash world of children's presenting, such gentility is hardly a prerequisite (though looking like a model is). It's especially not needed on radio since the bizarre decision, in 1998, to end bespoke children's shows on Radio 4. There is no audience, the justification ran - evil television has triumphed. Ignoring the fact that children listen to a huge amount of radio, much of it music-based commercial radio, the powers that be made pretty sure there would be no under-12s audience for non-pop driven radio by cancelling all output. Sense is now returning. A new Radio 4 show for children will be launched in spring, and there are plans for a BBC digital radio channel for the same audience. There are other signs of youthful life, too, including Radio 3's sweet new series, Making Tracks, 20 minutes of music (everything but pop) smartly scheduled at 3.40pm, perfect for the journey home from school. It has an endearing sticky-back plastic Blue Peter squareness to it - which is no coincidence, as the presenters, Simon Thomas and Matt Baker, are from Blue Peter, as is its theme tune. The emphasis is on a non-egghead air when classical tracks are played so they are emphatically demystified. So, before the William Tell Overture, a few words of explanation (\"William Tell was the guy who...\"); before Prokofiev, a neat summary of what mood to expect (\"circuses, clowns, that type of thing\"). Composers' names are enunciated clearly and slowly; jazz, folk and world music are mixed with classical; and the show's website is full of further information for inquisitive little treasures (swots). Best of all is a regular spot for cartoon theme tunes. \"One of my favourite things, cartoons,\" Matt enthused. \"More cartoon themes to come,\" he enthused again later. I think Radio 3 think they've cracked this yoof thing - why did no one think to play music from The Little Mermaid before? Another way to find and keep a young audience is to target specific groups, and this is what the fantabulous Barbie FM did. I say did , for this was but a short-lived burst of fluffy pink power on the airwaves. A digital station available online, it was the brainchild of Amy (eight) and Hattie (six), daughters of TV presenter David Freeman. Radio by girls for girls, it mixed pop (Destiny's Child, Billie, Steps) with chat about the burning issues of the day such as: \"What makes a good sleepover?\" Only on- ir for two days, it was nonetheless a sign of how radio scheduling will change in the digital age. If that means Patsy Kensit (who made her radio presenting debut on Barbie, cooing \"We all love Barbie!\") and interviews with authors who have won Smarties Awards, I'm all for it. If I was in its target age group, I'd love this sickly sweet confection of a station (I quite love it even though I'm not). And I would have my first crush on a sensitive boy who listens to Making Tracks.",

      "body": "<p>In the spring of 1998, I decided I'd like to write a book about the 1925 Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial, the celebrated trial of a schoolteacher accused of teaching evolution in defiance of Tennessee law. This was not an arbitrary choice. My great-great-grandfather was Charles Darwin - something I had given little thought to as an adult until I came to live in America and discovered that his theories were still rabidly contested here. A US Gallup poll taken last year found that 40% of those surveyed favoured teaching creationism instead of evolution in public schools. That same year, the Kansas Board of Education voted to delete virtually every mention of evolution from the state's science curriculum. </p> <p>In early childhood I was told how Darwin's theory of evolution had demolished the biblical story of creation. And if the very first chapter of the Good Book was nonsensical and untrue, why should the rest be any more credible or useful? My parents made an attempt to raise me as a Christian, but ultimately lacked the conviction to boost me over the numerous improbabilities. </p> <p>Most modern scientists - perhaps 99% - believe the world is about 4bn years old. Professor Kurt Wise, associate professor of science and director of origins research at Bryan College in Dayton, Tennessee, puts its age at somewhere around 6,000 years. Kurt teaches his course in two parts: the first from the perspective of theistic evolution - that is, the idea that God used evolution over long periods of time to create the universe. The second half of the course is where he teaches what he really believes: that the \"six days of creation\" were in fact regular \"earth rotation days\" because the same word for \"day\" is used in the Ten Commandments when we are instructed to work six days and rest on the seventh. </p> <p>Kurt is taking a group of Bryan College summer students on a cave geology tour and he invites me along. Several white vans, replete with Christian youth, are parked outside the college. I find one with an empty seat at the back, clamber past a group of clean-cut types of both sexes, and settle in for the ride. \"I hear, like, intellectuals, a lot of them commit suicide?\" squeaks a zit-encrusted teenage boy. \"'Cause they believe what they're taught, evolution an' all, so they got nothing to live for?\" And now he fixes me with a mordant look, like maybe I'm one of them. \"That's true, statistically true,\" says another young man. \"They don't have God in their lives, they don't have Jesus as their personal saviour.\" \"Amen,\" says one of the girls. </p> <p>We've been driving for half an hour before they ask me why I'm here. I keep it simple: a book on the Scopes trial. Most of them are from rural states: South and North Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Minnesota. Many have been taught at home; most are pleasant but uninteresting, the weird similarity of their views making it hard to distinguish one from another. After about an hour, we arrive at Grassy Cove, a pastoral valley between faint blue mountains, and turn off the main road on to a dirt track. There must be at least 50 of us tramping along in the heat. The entrance to the cave is a ragged horizontal slit, like a mouth clumsily hacked into a Halloween pumpkin. Even more alarming, it's at ground level. Doughty Christians insert themselves into it with difficulty, slither down in steep descent and disappear. Kurt has divided us into small groups, which depart at intervals of five or 10 minutes. </p> <p>Flashlight-less, intensely dubious, I squeeze through the hole. The downward skid is actually quite short. I find myself muddy but uninjured. As Kurt cannot be at every \"point of interest\", he has stationed older students at each, all holding a piece of paper on which is typed what Kurt would have said had he been there: \"The Flood Did It.\" That's the basic message. What the majority of geologists believe took millions of years, Kurt and his fellow creationists believe was done a few thousand years ago in a matter of months, when Noah was forced to sea with all the animals on earth, including his family but excluding the fish. </p> <p>We're asked by the first of Kurt's surrogates, a young woman, to observe a well-preserved fossilised brachiopod in limestone. A brachiopod is a kind of shellfish. We are 1,000ft above current sea level and you can find fossils like this all across America at similar elevations. If brachiopods decay or if they get moved any distance, the muscle that holds the shells together fails, and the shells separate. Modern brachiopods, if they're found whole at all, we're told, are usually found with the shell open and the opening facing upward. This fossilised brachiopod appears to be complete, has its shell closed, and it's on the tilt. To Kurt, this suggests that \"the critter\" was still alive when it was deposited, which suggests it was buried rapidly, which suggests, as Kurt puts it, \"a global diluvial catastrophe\". </p> <p>The student, reading Kurt's words, goes on to talk about the stalagmites near the entrance. Kurt argues that, as these stalagmites, though large, occupy less than 1% of the available space in the cave, they may not be as old as other geologists think; if they were, they would have filled the place up and we wouldn't be here. The cave is so grotesquely dramatic, so tortured, that Kurt's theory - suggesting an upheaval as violent as one's own alarm - does have emotional resonance. Certainly I can imagine a roiling wall of grey mud and rock roaring and cascading into the cave and carving out this infernal canyon. But Kurt seems to want to have his cave and eat it too: this deluge was so fantastically fierce that it burrowed this vast warren out of solid rock in under a year, yet not so fierce as to pulverise the delicate, twin-shelled brachiopod. </p> <p>Inside the next room lurks our new guide, a smiling, sanctimonious young man. When we are all gathered inside, he tells us to sit down and switch off our flashlights. Then, out of the blackness, comes his pious young voice: \"Why don't you lead off, Brittany?\" \"My God is an awesome God!\" sings Brittany in a sweet, high voice, and then the rest join in. \"Be praised!\" Then they all sing together: \"My God is an awesome God! Be praised!\" The room sounds like a small cathedral, more bass, less echo, but it is, I have to admit, pretty awesome, particularly in the darkness. </p> <p>Then we wander off toward the final and most horrific room of all: a vast, meandering, asymmetrical cavern. The ceiling is only 2-3ft from the floor and appears to be supported only by occasional rough columns formed by stalactites and stalagmites fusing together, each column tapering in the middle like some weirdly guttered candle. On top of this massive slab there's a billion tons of mountain and some loony creationist is asking you to crawl into this awful, ill-supported geological death-gap, which, if it collapsed, would leave you flatter than a dime, all so he can expound, through delegates, some nutty theory which every reasonable man on earth knows is utter hogwash. Only a fool would enter. In I crawl. </p> <p>We reach a central column, and slump down to listen to a lecture. I remember none of it. Finally, we're backing out. The mood lightens immediately, suggesting that perhaps I was not alone in my claustrophobic terror. The girls become chatty. I ask what the rules are. Most of them are obvious: no drugs, no cigarettes, no alcohol. A girl fills me in on the dress code. \"No tank tops, no tube tops, no halter tops, no spaghetti straps, no short shorts, and you have to have a one-piece bathing suit.\" As we wind our way up towards daylight, the girls become almost evanescent. One of them asks if I'm a believer. I guess they've rumbled me. </p> <p>\"You should come and sit in on some of our classes,\" she says. \"It would be really helpful.\" The atmosphere on the drive back toward Bryan College is friendlier than it was on the way here. They know who I am, they've absorbed it, and are willing to talk freely about themselves and their beliefs. Their religion, they tell me, is the only true religion, unique because Jesus Christ, the son of God, set foot on earth. No other religion can make that claim. </p> <p>The girls state that they would not marry a non-believer. In fact, they wouldn't even marry a Catholic unless he was born again because it would be hard to live with someone whom you knew was going to hell. Of all their beliefs, I tell them, this born-again-or-go-to-hell thing is the one I find hardest to take. If God is so perfect, why would he care whether you believed in him or not? It seems so petty. Believing in a literal hell, an inferno of unimaginable suffering, they accept with equanimity that seven-eighths of the world, including me, will end up in it. For ever. </p> <p>I am glad to arrive back at the college to be offered hotdogs from a barbecue grill. (The flames! The flames!) I take my food over to a patch of grass and sit down next to a couple of fellow cave-survivors. Exhausted and vaguely depressed, I find Kurt, thank him, and leave. </p> <p>If I went down to Dayton an atheist, I came back an agnostic, refusing to share the arrogance of any conviction in a matter so clearly unprovable either way. In his autobiography, Darwin, who also called himself an agnostic, wrote that the magnificence of the universe almost forces one to conclude that God exists. However, he continued, \"Can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animal, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?\" He goes on to say that the problem is compounded by \"the probability that the constant inculcation in a belief in God on the minds of children has produced so strong and perhaps inherited effect on their brains, that it may now be as difficult for them to throw off their belief in God as for a monkey to throw off its instinctive fear of a snake\". For this monkey at least, my great-great-grandfather was right. </p> <p>\u0095 This extract is adapted from Trials of the Monkey: An Accidental Memoir, by Matthew Chapman, which is published by Duck Editions on November 16 2000, price \u00a314.99.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It sounds like a joke, and not a very tasteful one at that. The European Centre for Yiddish Culture, which is being built in Strasbourg, is the idea of a former member of the Hitler Youth - albeit an involuntary one. </p> <p>Tomi Ungerer sits back and enjoys the paradox. \"Yes, it was my idea. And yes, I was in the Hitler Youth - we were conscripted. But I wasn't enthusiastic - just young and ignorant.\" </p> <p>He recalls that during the war in occupied Alsace, he and his classmates were compelled to say, \"Heil Hitler\" at school every morning. But instead, they would say, \"Ein Liter\" (a drunk), and get away with it because the lip movements were the same. </p> <p>Ungerer, the Strasbourg-born writer, painter, sculptor, designer, illustrator of children's books, cartoonist, member of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur and now Council of Europe ambassador for childhood and education, says that he and many of his gentile friends developed a close attachment to Yiddish in the Alsatian capital as a counterweight to the barbarism of the Nazi occupation. </p> <p>\"I have been exposed to Yiddish since I was a kid. I used to hear it all the time as I grew up. And as I grew up my love of this human and humanising culture grew and grew.\" </p> <p>That humanising culture will be showcased at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg during the first Yiddish Summit, which starts tonight and runs for a week. It has been partly organised by Ungerer, but also, like the centre, by the Jewish community of the city, and supported by Jewish groups around the world. There will be a concert of Yiddish music - deemed by the Nazis to be \"degenerate\" - along with poetry readings, klezmer music and stand-up comedy. </p> <p>All strands of the Yiddish-speaking diaspora will be represented. There will be samba in Yiddish, and even a performance of Yiddish rap. More seriously, there will be a symposium on the future of Yiddish. In 1978, Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Nobel literature prize winner, who wrote many of his novels in Yiddish, said in his acceptance speech: \"Yiddish is not a dead language yet.\" </p> <p>This summit, which will become an annual event, will have the primary task of proving that point - a difficult task, as Ungerer recognises: \"The Germans burned out all the libraries of Yiddish in Europe. It's the cultural equivalent of 1870, when they burned the great library in Strasbourg. The Nazis tried to destroy a whole culture.\" </p> <p>It is impossible to guess now how many people still speak Yiddish. But does it matter if Yiddish dies out? Ungerer looks scandalised. \"There has to be a place in Europe that shelters this way of life and, in a sense, what better place than Strasbourg? It is the capital of Europe.\" </p> <p>He argues that Yiddish suffered one of its greatest setbacks when the state of Israel chose Hebrew as its official language. \"Perhaps Yiddish was too symbolic of misery. It was the language of the poor Jews, almost a secret way of talking. Of course, for us Alsatians it wasn't secret because we knew what they were talking about.\" It was there, in the Rhine valley, that the Yiddish language was first spoken, in the ninth century. \"It's the language of an ambulant culture. That's what makes it more precious. </p> <p>\"I admire the Jews. They were dispersed all over the world but maintained their identity for over 2,000 years. What a lesson for us Alsatians, who have only had to put up with the Germans and the French trampling over us every so often. The Jews have been oppressed by everybody.\" </p> <p>But why should an Alsatian gentile want to get a European Centre for Yiddish Culture off the ground? \"I knew something had to be done to make sure that the language is taught and that the culture thrives. But I only had the idea. Lots of other people have been involved in making it reality.\" </p> <p>For Ungerer it is important to keep a thriving Yiddish culture because it is a culture \"where sadness replaces anger. There's a warmth without grudges. Those people suffered so much you would think that they would be hateful in their song. But instead there is an innocence that gives their songs a joy and purity.\" </p> <p>Before the French Revolution, 70% of French Jews lived in Alsace. Even now, 10% of Strasbourg's population is Jewish, and it is home to eight synagogues. The Marx brothers came from an Alsatian-Jewish family and the French mime Marcel Marceau was a Jew from Alsace. </p> <p>Perhaps it is also important that the centre is in France, not least because, at 600,000, the French Jewish population is the biggest in Europe.

      "bodyText": "It sounds like a joke, and not a very tasteful one at that. The European Centre for Yiddish Culture, which is being built in Strasbourg, is the idea of a former member of the Hitler Youth - albeit an involuntary one. Tomi Ungerer sits back and enjoys the paradox. \"Yes, it was my idea. And yes, I was in the Hitler Youth - we were conscripted. But I wasn't enthusiastic - just young and ignorant.\" He recalls that during the war in occupied Alsace, he and his classmates were compelled to say, \"Heil Hitler\" at school every morning. But instead, they would say, \"Ein Liter\" (a drunk), and get away with it because the lip movements were the same. Ungerer, the Strasbourg-born writer, painter, sculptor, designer, illustrator of children's books, cartoonist, member of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur and now Council of Europe ambassador for childhood and education, says that he and many of his gentile friends developed a close attachment to Yiddish in the Alsatian capital as a counterweight to the barbarism of the Nazi occupation. \"I have been exposed to Yiddish since I was a kid. I used to hear it all the time as I grew up. And as I grew up my love of this human and humanising culture grew and grew.\" That humanising culture will be showcased at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg during the first Yiddish Summit, which starts tonight and runs for a week. It has been partly organised by Ungerer, but also, like the centre, by the Jewish community of the city, and supported by Jewish groups around the world. There will be a concert of Yiddish music - deemed by the Nazis to be \"degenerate\" - along with poetry readings, klezmer music and stand-up comedy. All strands of the Yiddish-speaking diaspora will be represented. There will be samba in Yiddish, and even a performance of Yiddish rap. More seriously, there will be a symposium on the future of Yiddish. In 1978, Isaac Bashevis Singer, the Nobel literature prize winner, who wrote many of his novels in Yiddish, said in his acceptance speech: \"Yiddish is not a dead language yet.\" This summit, which will become an annual event, will have the primary task of proving that point - a difficult task, as Ungerer recognises: \"The Germans burned out all the libraries of Yiddish in Europe. It's the cultural equivalent of 1870, when they burned the great library in Strasbourg. The Nazis tried to destroy a whole culture.\" It is impossible to guess now how many people still speak Yiddish. But does it matter if Yiddish dies out? Ungerer looks scandalised. \"There has to be a place in Europe that shelters this way of life and, in a sense, what better place than Strasbourg? It is the capital of Europe.\" He argues that Yiddish suffered one of its greatest setbacks when the state of Israel chose Hebrew as its official language. \"Perhaps Yiddish was too symbolic of misery. It was the language of the poor Jews, almost a secret way of talking. Of course, for us Alsatians it wasn't secret because we knew what they were talking about.\" It was there, in the Rhine valley, that the Yiddish language was first spoken, in the ninth century. \"It's the language of an ambulant culture. That's what makes it more precious. \"I admire the Jews. They were dispersed all over the world but maintained their identity for over 2,000 years. What a lesson for us Alsatians, who have only had to put up with the Germans and the French trampling over us every so often. The Jews have been oppressed by everybody.\" But why should an Alsatian gentile want to get a European Centre for Yiddish Culture off the ground? \"I knew something had to be done to make sure that the language is taught and that the culture thrives. But I only had the idea. Lots of other people have been involved in making it reality.\" For Ungerer it is important to keep a thriving Yiddish culture because it is a culture \"where sadness replaces anger. There's a warmth without grudges. Those people suffered so much you would think that they would be hateful in their song. But instead there is an innocence that gives their songs a joy and purity.\" Before the French Revolution, 70% of French Jews lived in Alsace. Even now, 10% of Strasbourg's population is Jewish, and it is home to eight synagogues. The Marx brothers came from an Alsatian-Jewish family and the French mime Marcel Marceau was a Jew from Alsace. Perhaps it is also important that the centre is in France, not least because, at 600,000, the French Jewish population is the biggest in Europe. That said, the French nation has a shameful history of anti-semitism. During the Nazi occupation, some of the French carried out their own vendettas against Jews, and few did much to prevent 76,000 French Jews being deported to the death camps. During the war in Alsace, all Alsatian Jews were arrested by French police and then handed over to the Nazis. And even in recent months there have been attacks on synagogues across France, prompting calls from Jewish leaders for the government to supply armed guards. But there is another, more practical reason why the Centre for Yiddish Culture will be in Strasbourg: money.

In daring to tackle a subject that had defeated both Verdi and Britten, he produced a work that was widely performed across Europe following its premiere in 1978. There have been three more stage works since, all demonstrating Reimann's belief that great literature can produce viable librettos. The Ghost Sonata, based on Strindberg's play, appeared in 1984 (Opera Factory staged it in London five years later), Troades (after Euripedes' The Trojan Women) in 1986, and The Castle (from Kafka's unfinished novel) in 1992. </p> <p>Now he has turned his attention to Lorca, compiling the libretto for his latest opera from a German translation of The House of Bernarda Alba, the Spanish poet's last play. Bernarda Albas Haus, as it becomes, was commissioned jointly by the Komische Oper in Berlin and the Bavarian State Opera, which gave the first performance in Munich on Monday. </p> <p>While musically and dramatically first class, the work shows, however, that there are some subjects a composer - even one with Reimann's chutzpah - should leave alone. Lorca's drama, about a matriarch whose repressive control over her household and five daughters has tragic consequences, is so powerful and bleak that it is hard to see what any music could add to its intensity, let alone a score like Reimann's, whose musical language, stemming from Berg and Webern, is better at defining extremes of emotion than more subtle nuances. </p> <p>What theatrical power there is in Bernarda Albas Haus derives entirely from the raw bones of Lorca's dramaturgy; at least half of the text is spoken, either unaccompanied or given a febrile orchestral backdrop, while the rest is pushed into jagged vocal lines of great swoops and leaps. For Reimann, at least, expressionism is alive and well. It all makes for tough going through the two-hour, three-act span of the work, and the most operatically effective passages are those where Reimann does least to compromise the directness of the drama. Two scenes carry real punch: the confrontation between Bernarda and her housekeeper, La Poncia, which is played out over a bare cello line; and the monologue of the deranged grandmother Maria Josefa (a spoken role anyway), underpinned by a mesh of string chords. But it is Lorca delivering the punch, not the composer. </p> <p>Each of the characters in the all-female cast is given her own sound world. Bernarda is defined by the 12 cellos in the orchestra, and even though much of the orchestral writing is redundant, its gestures can be bold and imaginative. There are four pianos in the pit, two with sheets of paper laid across the strings to produce dull percussive sounds. With a contrabass clarinet, they add a baleful presence to the widely spaced textures in which Reimann exploits the extremities of the instruments' ranges. </p> <p>Thematically and structurally the score is rigorous, but it does nothing to enhance what is already there in the words and action. At its best the effect is like film music; at its worst it seems distracting. It never threatens to become essential. </p> <p>In terms of production and performance, though, the Bavarian State Opera has undoubtedly done their commission proud. The conductor Zubin Mehta ensures that all the effects in the score come across with maximum intensity, while Harry Kupfer stages it in a ravishing set by Frank Philipp Schlossmann: a white box festooned with chairs on every surface, which takes on innumerable hues under Max Keller's lighting. </p> <p>Kupfer obtains performances of visceral power and physicality. Vocally it is equally remarkable. Just as Reimann tailored the title role in Lear for Dietrich Fischer- Dieskau, so the part of Bernarda Alba was designed for another great singer, Helga Dernesch. This great Wagnerian may be at the end of her career but she makes the most of everything she has left and physically dominates the stage too, epitomising the cruel presence around whom the household is spinning into chaos. </p> <p>There are superb performances from Isolde Elchlepp as La Poncia and Anne Pellekoorne, Jennifer Trost, Margarita De Arellano, Claudia Barainsky and Anna Korondi as the daughters. They deliver Reimann's demanding writing with immense care, getting every word across, though it is sad to discover even Munich has succumbed to the tyranny of surtitles - despite the libretto being in German.

      "body": "<p>Fresh from his triumph in forecasting that the England managership was certain to go to a man called Sven Goran, Smallweed this week trains his matchless predictive powers on an even more closely fought contest: that for the editorship of the Spectator, in succession to Boris Johnson, the present incumbent, and his predecessor Frank Johnson. Various so-called short lists are appearing in rival papers, featuring folk such as Matthew d'Ancona of the Sunday Telegraph, Sarah Sands of the Daily Telegraph and Simon Heffer of the Mail. </p> <p>Disregard the lot of them. The only contender so far named who has any chance at all is the Daily Telegraph columnist Alice Thomson, since she is the only one whose surname sounds even remotely like Johnson. So here, for the first time in print anywhere, is the short list supplied to Smallweed by a fitfully reliable source: </p> <p>- Rachel Johnson, occasional Spectator columnist, sister of Boris; </p> <p>- Paul Johnson, once controversial Spectator columnist, now writing mainly about 18th-century painters, beautiful sunsets and how well his gardenias are doing; </p> <p>- the Spectator's crossword editor, who in January revealed that he is a Johnson too; </p> <p>- Charles Bronson, longstanding Hollywood actor; </p> <p>- Gerald Ronson, tycoon; </p> <p>- EW (Gloria) Swanson, deceased cricket correspondent; </p> <p>- Sven Goran Johnsson, 1970s Malmo midfielder. </p> <p>Please don't waste your hard-earned money backing anyone else. </p> <p> Now for my weekly dose of the dedicated socialist, hunting enthusiast, general bon vivant and Philip Gould insultee John Mortimer, whose \"embonpoint\", an Evening Standard interviewer revealed this week, is \"a synecdoche for champagne socialism\". Let us plumb these wise words in the hope of netting a meaning. Though nowadays the concept appears in newspapers almost exclusively in the context of Melinda Messenger, embonpoint is not, as any pedant will inform you, a mere synonym for a bosom (or as people says nowadays, bosoms). All it implies is stoutness. Synecdoche, though, gave me a moment of pause. Was this perhaps the name of a girl I once went out with in Oxford? Happily, no. A synecdoche is a figure of speech in which a part is substituted for a whole, or a whole for a part. The Collins dictionary gives the examples of \"50 head of cattle\" meaning \"50 cows\", or more controversially, \"the army\" instead of \"a soldier\". We old Leeds United supporters prefer the version in Longmans, one of whose sample synecdoches is \"Leeds beat Stoke\" - always good news. </p> <p>Let us draw these strands together. Mortimer's embonpoint - his stoutness, perhaps his stomach - is some kind of symbolic embodiment, we are asked to believe, of the world of champagne socialism. Alternatively, champagne socialism is some kind of representative symbol for Mortimer's stomach. </p> <p> <strong>In Smallweed next week: </strong> Would you buy a used zeugma from Michael Portillo? </p> <p> The agony aunt Claire Rayner, I see, has applied to the Patent Office to register her catchphrase, \"Will you do that for me, luvvie?\" What kind of nonsense is this? Suppose her catchphrase had been \"Please pass the marmalade\" or \"My goodness, is that the time?\" Would that formulation henceforth belong to her rather than us? This is not the only such case. A reader wrote to me some time ago asking how it was that the Abbey National could claim as its trademark the catchphrase \"Because life's complicated enough\". This kind of privatised raid on the English language seems to Smallweed a case of brass neck, or even brass embonpoint, unparalleled in the annals of champagne synecdoche. </p> <p> And which composer is this, from Slonimsky's Lexicon? \"You know his musical system. There has not yet been an Italian composer more incapable of producing what is commonly called a melody\" (Gazette Musicale de Paris). \"The unfortunate man is incapable of real melody - his airs are such as a man born deaf would compose by calculation of the distances of musical notes and the intervals between them\" (the diaries of George Templeton Strong). \"In England and France, the operas of Signor X only pass because there is nothing else_ the first more elegant and gracious Italian composer who arrives can sweep them away to the limbo of forgotten frenzies\" (the Athenaeum magazine, London). Here is a clue: this limbo would include such works as Aida, Falstaff, Otello and Nabucco. </p> <p> M y near neighbour the profile page carried a fascinating account last week of the philosopher Roger Scruton's conversion to conservatism. He was in the Latin quarter during the 1968 \u00e9v\u00e9nements, watching from his window as his student friends tore up paving stones, overturned cars, built barricades, and hailed the arrival of revolution. \"I suddenly realised that I was on the other side,\" he told Nicholas Wroe. \"What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans.

      "bodyText": "Fresh from his triumph in forecasting that the England managership was certain to go to a man called Sven Goran, Smallweed this week trains his matchless predictive powers on an even more closely fought contest: that for the editorship of the Spectator, in succession to Boris Johnson, the present incumbent, and his predecessor Frank Johnson. Various so-called short lists are appearing in rival papers, featuring folk such as Matthew d'Ancona of the Sunday Telegraph, Sarah Sands of the Daily Telegraph and Simon Heffer of the Mail. Disregard the lot of them. The only contender so far named who has any chance at all is the Daily Telegraph columnist Alice Thomson, since she is the only one whose surname sounds even remotely like Johnson. So here, for the first time in print anywhere, is the short list supplied to Smallweed by a fitfully reliable source: - Rachel Johnson, occasional Spectator columnist, sister of Boris; - Paul Johnson, once controversial Spectator columnist, now writing mainly about 18th-century painters, beautiful sunsets and how well his gardenias are doing; - the Spectator's crossword editor, who in January revealed that he is a Johnson too; - Charles Bronson, longstanding Hollywood actor; - Gerald Ronson, tycoon; - EW (Gloria) Swanson, deceased cricket correspondent; - Sven Goran Johnsson, 1970s Malmo midfielder. Please don't waste your hard-earned money backing anyone else. Now for my weekly dose of the dedicated socialist, hunting enthusiast, general bon vivant and Philip Gould insultee John Mortimer, whose \"embonpoint\", an Evening Standard interviewer revealed this week, is \"a synecdoche for champagne socialism\". Let us plumb these wise words in the hope of netting a meaning. Though nowadays the concept appears in newspapers almost exclusively in the context of Melinda Messenger, embonpoint is not, as any pedant will inform you, a mere synonym for a bosom (or as people says nowadays, bosoms). All it implies is stoutness. Synecdoche, though, gave me a moment of pause. Was this perhaps the name of a girl I once went out with in Oxford? Happily, no. A synecdoche is a figure of speech in which a part is substituted for a whole, or a whole for a part. The Collins dictionary gives the examples of \"50 head of cattle\" meaning \"50 cows\", or more controversially, \"the army\" instead of \"a soldier\". We old Leeds United supporters prefer the version in Longmans, one of whose sample synecdoches is \"Leeds beat Stoke\" - always good news. Let us draw these strands together. Mortimer's embonpoint - his stoutness, perhaps his stomach - is some kind of symbolic embodiment, we are asked to believe, of the world of champagne socialism. Alternatively, champagne socialism is some kind of representative symbol for Mortimer's stomach. In Smallweed next week: Would you buy a used zeugma from Michael Portillo? The agony aunt Claire Rayner, I see, has applied to the Patent Office to register her catchphrase, \"Will you do that for me, luvvie?\" What kind of nonsense is this? Suppose her catchphrase had been \"Please pass the marmalade\" or \"My goodness, is that the time?\" Would that formulation henceforth belong to her rather than us? This is not the only such case. A reader wrote to me some time ago asking how it was that the Abbey National could claim as its trademark the catchphrase \"Because life's complicated enough\". This kind of privatised raid on the English language seems to Smallweed a case of brass neck, or even brass embonpoint, unparalleled in the annals of champagne synecdoche. And which composer is this, from Slonimsky's Lexicon? \"You know his musical system. There has not yet been an Italian composer more incapable of producing what is commonly called a melody\" (Gazette Musicale de Paris). \"The unfortunate man is incapable of real melody - his airs are such as a man born deaf would compose by calculation of the distances of musical notes and the intervals between them\" (the diaries of George Templeton Strong). \"In England and France, the operas of Signor X only pass because there is nothing else_ the first more elegant and gracious Italian composer who arrives can sweep them away to the limbo of forgotten frenzies\" (the Athenaeum magazine, London). Here is a clue: this limbo would include such works as Aida, Falstaff, Otello and Nabucco. M y near neighbour the profile page carried a fascinating account last week of the philosopher Roger Scruton's conversion to conservatism. He was in the Latin quarter during the 1968 \u00e9v\u00e9nements, watching from his window as his student friends tore up paving stones, overturned cars, built barricades, and hailed the arrival of revolution. \"I suddenly realised that I was on the other side,\" he told Nicholas Wroe. \"What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous Marxist gobbledegook. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilisation against these things. That's when I became a conservative.\" This account of the dawning of truth bears an uncanny resemblance to a chapter in a long-ago book called Conviction, in which the writer and journalist Paul Johnson describes his conversion to socialism. He too was looking out of a window in Paris during a student riot when he saw a flic bashing a student over the head with a truncheon.

Yet Paul, as we know, had a further road-to-Damascus experience on his way to middle age, and ended up a Thatcherite.

      "body": "<p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) was set up by the government after the BSE debacle to \"protect our right to expect food that is safe and of a high quality\". And after the publication of the Phillips Inquiry into BSE, the promises made by government for the FSA seem even more pertinent. It was to be independent, open and \"run by people with expertise in food safety and without any hidden agenda\". It has now been in operation for eight months, and already disillusionment is rife. Eyebrows were first raised when its government-appointed boss, Sir John Krebs, appeared on Newsnight shortly after coming into the job. Sir John is a distinguished zoologist and authority on badger culling, with no particular \"expertise\" in food. Nevertheless, after being grilled by Jeremy Paxman, it was apparent that he had quite firm opinions that were supportive of genetically modified food, and was critically unconvinced of the benefits of organics. </p> <p> In February, he again demonstrated his interest in biotechnology by chairing an Organisation For Economic Co-operation And Development (OECD) conference on GM food in Edinburgh. Then, last month, Sir John made a surprise attack on organics: \"[People are] not getting value for money . . . if they think they're buying extra nutritional quality or extra safety [when they buy organic food], because we don't have the evidence to support these claims.\" The Soil Association, which campaigns for organic farming, was somewhat miffed. Its policy director, Patrick Holden, says, \"Sir John has been badly advised. There are some 150 studies that demonstrate significant qualitative nutritional differences between organic and conventional food, and we have asked the FSA to fund more research into this area. Sir John is displaying bias by rubbishing the only system that is actually addressing consumer concerns.\" </p> <p>On the enhanced safety of organic food, the Soil Association is happy to give chapter and verse - for example, that 43% of conventional fruit and vegetables contain pesticide residues, whereas the organic equivalents do not. But one fact is particularly persuasive: no fully organic cattle have contracted BSE, while 177,263 conventional ones have. At the Food Commission, an independent food watchdog that welcomed the setting up of the FSA, concern is now mounting over the FSA's handling of BSE. \"We were looking for an agency that would be more open than MAFF [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food] and make fewer blunders,\" says the commission's Dr Tim Lobstein. \"What we've got is an agency that is a bit more open, but is still making blunders. About half the representation at its BSE 'stakeholder' meetings has come from the meat industry. As a result, the agency was actually considering lifting the ban that prevents cattle over 30 months going into the food chain. Following research showing how the disease could be transmitted through blood transfusion and the increase in human deaths from vCJD [variant CJD], it had to drop the idea.\" </p> <p> On its ability to combat food poisoning, the FSA is also found wanting. \"The FSA is a complete charade,\" says Dr Richard North, food poisoning authority and research director for Europe of Democracies and Diversities. \"The FSA has been sidelined by the European Commission, which has quietly taken over control of food safety policy and enforcement. Sir John is effectively the head of a branch office of the new European Food Authority, and is left playing around with trivia in areas not covered by the commission's initiatives.\" For an illustration of this point, look no further than the FSA's recent revelations that 30% of frozen chickens contain more water than is legal. It is an old food scam that has been exposed repeatedly over the years by independent organisations such as the Consumers' Association and Food Commission, and numerous trading standards departments. It is politically safe territory, though - unlike the contamination of farmers' conventional seed with GM seed, urgent information that the FSA sat on for five whole weeks. So, the question now needs to be asked, is the old Machiavellian MAFF culture that brought us BSE in the first place now reasserting itself in the FSA?</p> <p> \"So many of the civil servants are ex-MAFF or Department of Health, and the board is loaded with people without a relevant background in food policy,\" says Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley University. North agrees: \"Sir John is coming like a baby to an intensely political subject and being made to stick to the old MAFF orthodoxy by civil service minders.\" And Dr Lobstein goes even further: \"Sir John's lack of experience in food leaves him open to manipulation by civil servants and the food industry.\" The FSA, meanwhile, denies that any of this is the case: \"Sir John is coming from a position of independent, objective scientific assessment with no predisposition to one view or another,\" a spokesperson says. But if the FSA is to be anything more than a useless and expensive clone of MAFF, it needs to represent informed consumer opinion. Post-BSE, consumers have shown very clearly what kind of food they trust: it's no coincidence, after all, that our supermarkets are now brimming with organic food, while GM food is being forced off the shelves. Yet the FSA seems to be pursuing a curiously contrary agenda with its annual budget of \u00a3140 million, most of which is financed from the public purse. What's the point of a consumer watchdog that's totally out of step with what consumers want? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk\"> www.greenpeace.org.uk</a> has a guide on GM supermarket foods.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Food Standards Agency (FSA) was set up by the government after the BSE debacle to \"protect our right to expect food that is safe and of a high quality\". And after the publication of the Phillips Inquiry into BSE, the promises made by government for the FSA seem even more pertinent. It was to be independent, open and \"run by people with expertise in food safety and without any hidden agenda\". It has now been in operation for eight months, and already disillusionment is rife. Eyebrows were first raised when its government-appointed boss, Sir John Krebs, appeared on Newsnight shortly after coming into the job. Sir John is a distinguished zoologist and authority on badger culling, with no particular \"expertise\" in food. Nevertheless, after being grilled by Jeremy Paxman, it was apparent that he had quite firm opinions that were supportive of genetically modified food, and was critically unconvinced of the benefits of organics. In February, he again demonstrated his interest in biotechnology by chairing an Organisation For Economic Co-operation And Development (OECD) conference on GM food in Edinburgh. Then, last month, Sir John made a surprise attack on organics: \"[People are] not getting value for money . . . if they think they're buying extra nutritional quality or extra safety [when they buy organic food], because we don't have the evidence to support these claims.\" The Soil Association, which campaigns for organic farming, was somewhat miffed. Its policy director, Patrick Holden, says, \"Sir John has been badly advised. There are some 150 studies that demonstrate significant qualitative nutritional differences between organic and conventional food, and we have asked the FSA to fund more research into this area. Sir John is displaying bias by rubbishing the only system that is actually addressing consumer concerns.\" On the enhanced safety of organic food, the Soil Association is happy to give chapter and verse - for example, that 43% of conventional fruit and vegetables contain pesticide residues, whereas the organic equivalents do not. But one fact is particularly persuasive: no fully organic cattle have contracted BSE, while 177,263 conventional ones have. At the Food Commission, an independent food watchdog that welcomed the setting up of the FSA, concern is now mounting over the FSA's handling of BSE. \"We were looking for an agency that would be more open than MAFF [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food] and make fewer blunders,\" says the commission's Dr Tim Lobstein. \"What we've got is an agency that is a bit more open, but is still making blunders. About half the representation at its BSE 'stakeholder' meetings has come from the meat industry. As a result, the agency was actually considering lifting the ban that prevents cattle over 30 months going into the food chain. Following research showing how the disease could be transmitted through blood transfusion and the increase in human deaths from vCJD [variant CJD], it had to drop the idea.\" On its ability to combat food poisoning, the FSA is also found wanting. \"The FSA is a complete charade,\" says Dr Richard North, food poisoning authority and research director for Europe of Democracies and Diversities. \"The FSA has been sidelined by the European Commission, which has quietly taken over control of food safety policy and enforcement. Sir John is effectively the head of a branch office of the new European Food Authority, and is left playing around with trivia in areas not covered by the commission's initiatives.\" For an illustration of this point, look no further than the FSA's recent revelations that 30% of frozen chickens contain more water than is legal. It is an old food scam that has been exposed repeatedly over the years by independent organisations such as the Consumers' Association and Food Commission, and numerous trading standards departments. It is politically safe territory, though - unlike the contamination of farmers' conventional seed with GM seed, urgent information that the FSA sat on for five whole weeks. So, the question now needs to be asked, is the old Machiavellian MAFF culture that brought us BSE in the first place now reasserting itself in the FSA? \"So many of the civil servants are ex-MAFF or Department of Health, and the board is loaded with people without a relevant background in food policy,\" says Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley University. North agrees: \"Sir John is coming like a baby to an intensely political subject and being made to stick to the old MAFF orthodoxy by civil service minders.\" And Dr Lobstein goes even further: \"Sir John's lack of experience in food leaves him open to manipulation by civil servants and the food industry.\" The FSA, meanwhile, denies that any of this is the case: \"Sir John is coming from a position of independent, objective scientific assessment with no predisposition to one view or another,\" a spokesperson says. But if the FSA is to be anything more than a useless and expensive clone of MAFF, it needs to represent informed consumer opinion. Post-BSE, consumers have shown very clearly what kind of food they trust: it's no coincidence, after all, that our supermarkets are now brimming with organic food, while GM food is being forced off the shelves. Yet the FSA seems to be pursuing a curiously contrary agenda with its annual budget of \u00a3140 million, most of which is financed from the public purse. What's the point of a consumer watchdog that's totally out of step with what consumers want? www.greenpeace.org.uk has a guide on GM supermarket foods.",

      "body": "<p>Why don't more people live in radical, experimental, cutting-edge, call-them-what-you-will ultra-modern houses? Answer: Ask a five-year- old child to draw a house. Whether from a rich or poor background, whether born in a council flat in Glasgow or a mock Tudor mansion in Weybridge, the result will almost always be the same. A funny little box-like house with a pitched roof, smoking chimney, centrally placed door, a window on either side downstairs and two windows more or less symmetrically arranged above them. Quite often there will be a big sun shining above the roof and in the green crayon strip of garden below a stick mummy, a stick daddy and perhaps a cartoon-like cat. </p> <p> I was gently challenged on this very subject a few months ago by fellow journalist John McCarthy, when he was making a BBC radio series on the nature of house and home. Even if they lived in a flat, he asked? Even if they were from single-parent families? Yes. McCarthy checked up on the theory by visiting an inner-city school and asking a class of children to draw a house. The theory did indeed hold up. McCarthy was astonished - but only until he had thought the notion through with me and other people for whom the history of house and home (not the same thing) are compelling subjects. </p> <p> What the children are drawing, more or less, is a portrait of the human face. The first thing a child sees, or tries to focus on when born, is its mother's face. Well, breast maybe, but the mother spends a lot of time looking into her baby's face. When a young child draws a house, it puts a door where the mouth or nose is on its parent's face and windows for eyes. In the child's mind's eye, the house is home, a kind of anthropomorphic building-being, a sanctuary that is (or should be) as cosy and as reassuring as its mother's arms. </p> <p> Home, then, is a notion as old as the human species. It is hardly surprising that the vast majority of people - whether they live in caves, as many still do in Guadix and Cappadocia; in mud, stone or straw huts; or in flats or houses - experience the home as a kind of replacement for the womb. Most like it to be a fixed point in their lives both emotionally and physically: old- fashioned, comforting, familiar. In Britain, although we like the idea of a groovy, modern studio-type apartment in a city centre, many people still share a dream of coming back, somehow, to the equivalent of a cosy cottage with perhaps a walled garden - a thing of inglenooks and log fires, of dogs damp after a long walk, of roast Sunday lunches and nips of sloe-gin in winter. Human beings tucked up as snug as bugs in rugs in the brick-and-stone arms of a friendly building-being. </p> <p> Nicolas Pople, an architect and senior lecturer at London's South Bank University, has published a book called Experimental Houses, about buildings that are as far removed as can be imagined from the ones that children draw. Why? Because, as Pople says in his introduction, \"experimentation is an inherently conscious act and is never innocent. The gesture of the experimental is expansive, moving beyond the known and immediately comprehensible, but with a clear set of objectives in view\". </p> <p> One of the new experimental homes in the book, an elegant concrete, aluminium and glass affair near Bordeaux, is designed by the influential architect Rem Koolhaas. As self-conscious as a Hollywood starlet, this is the house as box of tectonic tricks - a whole room acts as an elevator, linking all three floors - a clever game for fashionable architects to play as they get to grips with the ambitions and vanity of the wealthy, artistic bourgeoisie - and fail to respond to those for whom such a house is a magazine dream. </p> <p> In terms of making nice images in hard-to-read architecture and la-la design magazines, Koolhaas's decidedly cool house has been a winner on the grandest scale. Unlike the traditional home represented guilelessly in children's drawings, this place is as much public relations exercise as experiment, a clever concatentation of forms designed to excite those brought up in a world of architecture refracted in the lenses of cameras or shone through slide projectors in design schools. </p> <p> It is a house that seems to follow you around the globe: here it is, in model form, in an exhibition on modern homes in New York; here again in another handsome book touching down among a library of others on my desk, at least four of which show pictures of this very same building. If home is where we return for shelter and solace, to hide away from the uncertainties of the everyday world, to close the door and soak in the bath a million miles from the public stage where our hair is brushed and faces painted, then Koolhaas's creation is the opposite of home. It is a glamorous film set playing all the latest architectural games. It would be great fun for a holiday or a surprise weekend away, but, like so many experimental houses, not a place most people would consider living in. </p> <p> I hate to sound conservative or as if I am putting the dampers on architectural experimentation, for the story of architecture at its best has been one of adventure and game-playing. Often this has been no more than the equivalent of rearranging deckchairs on an ocean liner, but there have been revolutions, both aesthetic and technological. These have pushed both the design of homes and the ways we experience them into futures that on the one hand have given us the flushing lavatory, and on the other the Rem Koolhaas dwelling near Bordeaux. </p> <p> Intriguingly, most of the major revolutions came very early on. Recently I stayed in a beautiful courtyard house, rebuilt countless times since it was first raised by Spanish Moors in the 14th century. Its design - solid walls keeping the world beyond at bay, colonnaded courtyards, an ancient underfloor central heating system and a wind tower for distributing cool air during the hottest Mediterranean months - dates back way beyond the arrival of the Arabs in Spain in the eighth century, back beyond the Romans who gave us their \"hypocausts\" (underfloor central heating), to the beginnings of civilised housing. This house - television, fridge and other mod cons aside - would be familiar to the residents of Ur, capital of Sumerian civilisation, between five and six thousand years ago. This is a sophisticated house - more complex than a child's drawing - yet it embodies nearly everything that we could possibly want in a city home. </p> <p>Short of technology, then, have all the experiments in rural and urban housing since Ur and Sumerian civilisation been no more than architectural conceits and the vanity of riches? </p> <p> To an extent, yes. Most of the types of homes we live in were invented a long time ago. Even the high-rise apartment block that we tend to think of a post-second world war horror (for the poor if not for the rich who have taken to it in Manhattan, as in Manila, as eagles to their mountain eyries), was a Roman invention. At its crowded, intensely noisy height in about 200AD, the centre of imperial Rome was ringed around with five- and even eight-storey apartment blocks (insulae).</p> <p> These tended to be shoddily built and many deaths were caused by the Roman equivalent of chip-pan fires, but you would find yourself more at home here than you might imagine. The smartest Roman homes, for instance, as in homes from earlier Mediterranean and Mesopotamian civilisations, boasted various forms of lavatory that would be acceptable to most of us today.</p> <p> Air-conditioning? It gets hot in Rome, doesn't it? Yes, but responsibly and sensually designed homes throughout the world have never needed refrigerating; instead, the best have made use of wind as well as deep eaves, fountains, colonnades, shutters and other simple architectural devices to keep extreme heat at bay. In any case, Arab domestic architecture featured effective air-conditioning centuries ago. In the heart of medieval Cairo, you can visit old merchant houses cooled by air that is caught by funnels rising like those of ships above the dense roofscape. </p> <p> Double-glazing, then? Again, that goes back a very long way, too. Open-plan living? Didn't that come in just about a century ago with Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago? Well, yes, but it was also a feature of cave dwellings, of the grass skerms of Kung Bushmen, of the Inuit igloo, of the great communal dwellings of the Yanomamo Indians of the Orinoco river basin, of Arab tents, Kazakh yurts . . . of the beautiful cluster dwellings of the Awuna people of Ghana or the sophisticated multi-cylinder homes of the Mesakin Quisar people of Sudan. </p> <p> Alright, clever clogs, what about the mass-produced modular house invented by Le Corbusier (1887-1965) and made possible by 20th-century war-time and Fordian conveyor belt technology? I'm sorry. Try going back to Kahun, the 20-acre, 27th-century (BC) new town built to house the workers engaged on building the Illahun pyramid for Sesostris II. Here, rows of mass-produced worker's homes sharing near identical plans have been identified. In some ways, these fast-track dwellings were more sophisticated than their 20th-century counterparts, because internal walls were clearly arranged, or perhaps even moved, as and when a particular family needed more or fewer rooms. This 5,000-year-old idea was to be one of the revolutionary selling points of the Millennium Village currently being built on the North Greenwich peninsula, London, in the long shadow of the Dome. The ancient Egyptian workers' dwellings also featured roof terraces and were built of 100% recyclable materials. </p> <p> Even so, few architects have proved to be as adventurous as the imaginations of, say, Marco Polo (Travels) or Italo Calvino (Invisible Cities), both of whom have created gloriously experimental houses in their respective mind's eye. Nicolas Pople quotes Polo's compelling description of Kublai Khan's pavilion: \"let me tell you how these two halls and the chamber are constructed. Each hall has columns of spicewood very skilfully carved. On the outside they are all covered with lion-skins of great beauty, striped with black and white and orange. They are so well designed that neither wind nor rain can harm them or do any mischief. Inside, they are all of ermine and sable which are the two finest and costliest furs there are... and the chamber where the Khan sleeps... is also of lion-skins without and ermine and sable within, magnificent in workmanship and design.\" </p> <p> Today, few of us wish to kill such rare and magnificent animals for their skins, yet Polo captures for us a dreamy and sensual home - an experiment in imaginative living - that few radical modern architects with their clumping concrete, insistent brick and deterministic steel can hope to match in the wonder stakes. Although modern architecture has become fashionable over the past 20 years, few architects have been able to shake the vast majority of people from their simple and possibly innate dream of a house that looks like a child's drawing and which, for better or worse, was invented with humankind </p> <p>\u0095 Experimental Houses, by Nicolas Pople, is published by Lawrence King at \u00a345.

Indeed, the ugliest wine I have ever tasted in my entire life was Cretan (ahead of the red from Crimea, which smelt of Domestos and the white from the Czech Republic which tasted as if chrysanthemums had been raised in it).

Treacherous instinct to deny Umbrian fling with Fred, but more urgent need to lie about the envelope, which contains a cheque made out to me from Aunt Elspeth. I have reason to believe it might be big bucks, though what exactly big bucks means to a Scottish Presbyterian remains a mystery. Possibly venison.</p> <p>Unfortunately, by blushing and acting suspiciously, I have interested ex-spouse in the envelope much more than if I'd just said, \"Well, it is a letter from Fred, actually. Excuse me while I lock myself in the bathroom and devour every passionate page.\" All this blushing is exhausting. I'm going to need more blood now that I'm a secret heiress.</p> <p>\"It's a quotation for a conservatory, if you really must know,\" I snap, resorting to ludicrous lie. Wonder what the gunpowder plotters came up with when caught rolling barrels about in cellars: \"Er, they're going for an atrium and deck ... it's okay. It's one of Grinling Gibbons' makeovers.\" Hold on tight to my envelope. It can't be very much. Aunt's already sunk \u00a350,000 in this house. Try hard to think in hundreds. Meet aunt in doorway.</p> <p>\"Dulcie's thinking of having a conservatory!\" Ex-spouse announces. A sweet smile lights up her face.</p> <p>\"Well, if that would give you pleasurrre, why not, dearrr?\" she pats my arm affectionately. Hey! If she thinks I can suddenly afford a conservatory, it must be thousands. \"They do say, though, that burrrglarrrs like conserrrvatorrries.\"</p> <p>\"It's all right, Auntie, I don't want one.\"</p> <p>\"Yes she does!\" persists ex-spouse. \"She's got a quotation and everything.\" The big issue, though, is not whether I am going to have a conservatory. It's whether ex-spouse will get half the dosh. After all, he is her flesh and blood, and he does take her to Scotland occasionally. Should I ask her, in private? Should I just give him half? Could I get away with keeping it all myself? Oh God! I'm deeply corrupted already and I haven't even opened the envelope! If he finds out I've got the lot, there will be fireworks. On the other hand, he did leave me and beget anew. And I'm the one who deals with the aunt's old Damart undies.</p> <p>\"Dulcie, dearrr, I want a worrrd with you.\" Aunt looks meaningfully at me. Ex-spouse recoils. Usually her private words and meaningful looks revolve around indelicate ailments. \"Fine, let's go to your room, then,\" I smile, hustling her into her tartan den.</p> <p>\"I don't quite know what to do about Gorrrdon, dearrr. Arrre you and he, well, are you togetherrr?\"</p> <p>Huge blush pours down out of my hair, leaving my brain pale and struggling. Are we together? Except as co-parasites of hers? But never mind the truth - what does the aunt regard as desirable? Whatever she wants, I'll do it with him. No, wait! I draw the line at renewing vows. I don't think we ever did vows in the first place, actually. It was a register office affair in the early 70s. Not so much Forsaking All Other as Open Marriage please apply in triplicate. Although we didn't have many takers.</p> <p>\"I don't know where I am with him, Auntie.\" Shrug in what I hope is a heroic and picturesque fashion.</p> <p>\"The thing is, dearrr, I wouldn't mind Gorrrdon having a bit of my money, and I wouldn't even mind Elaine, but that horrrrrrid plumberrr chap she's living with now - what was his name?\" \"Tom.\" With this practice, I could blush for England.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't want him to get his hands on it. Between you and me, I didn't like the way he was always hanging rrround you. Oh dearrr! Wasn't he awful?\" Aunt shudders at the thought of the one person who did adore me, once.</p> <p>Dimly aware of a phone ringing and ex-spouse answering it. Then there's a knock on aunt's door. \"Dulcie! Phone! It's the demon lover!\"</p> <p>\"Which one?\" I quip uneasily. Aunt does not smile. Jest was a damp squib. She is obviously considering giving me a rocket. I'm already knee deep in treason and plot. It can only be a matter of time before the lot goes up.</p>",

A sweet smile lights up her face. \"Well, if that would give you pleasurrre, why not, dearrr?\" she pats my arm affectionately. Hey! If she thinks I can suddenly afford a conservatory, it must be thousands. \"They do say, though, that burrrglarrrs like conserrrvatorrries.\" \"It's all right, Auntie, I don't want one.\" \"Yes she does!\" persists ex-spouse. \"She's got a quotation and everything.\" The big issue, though, is not whether I am going to have a conservatory. It's whether ex-spouse will get half the dosh. After all, he is her flesh and blood, and he does take her to Scotland occasionally. Should I ask her, in private? Should I just give him half? Could I get away with keeping it all myself? Oh God! I'm deeply corrupted already and I haven't even opened the envelope! If he finds out I've got the lot, there will be fireworks. On the other hand, he did leave me and beget anew. And I'm the one who deals with the aunt's old Damart undies. \"Dulcie, dearrr, I want a worrrd with you.\" Aunt looks meaningfully at me. Ex-spouse recoils. Usually her private words and meaningful looks revolve around indelicate ailments. \"Fine, let's go to your room, then,\" I smile, hustling her into her tartan den. \"I don't quite know what to do about Gorrrdon, dearrr. Arrre you and he, well, are you togetherrr?\" Huge blush pours down out of my hair, leaving my brain pale and struggling. Are we together? Except as co-parasites of hers? But never mind the truth - what does the aunt regard as desirable? Whatever she wants, I'll do it with him. No, wait! I draw the line at renewing vows. I don't think we ever did vows in the first place, actually. It was a register office affair in the early 70s. Not so much Forsaking All Other as Open Marriage please apply in triplicate. Although we didn't have many takers. \"I don't know where I am with him, Auntie.\" Shrug in what I hope is a heroic and picturesque fashion. \"The thing is, dearrr, I wouldn't mind Gorrrdon having a bit of my money, and I wouldn't even mind Elaine, but that horrrrrrid plumberrr chap she's living with now - what was his name?\" \"Tom.\" With this practice, I could blush for England. \"I wouldn't want him to get his hands on it. Between you and me, I didn't like the way he was always hanging rrround you. Oh dearrr! Wasn't he awful?\" Aunt shudders at the thought of the one person who did adore me, once. Dimly aware of a phone ringing and ex-spouse answering it. Then there's a knock on aunt's door. \"Dulcie! Phone! It's the demon lover!\" \"Which one?\" I quip uneasily. Aunt does not smile. Jest was a damp squib. She is obviously considering giving me a rocket. I'm already knee deep in treason and plot. It can only be a matter of time before the lot goes up.",

      "body": "<p>December 25, 1989. We sat on tall stools at a bar with no name, \"Bruno's local\", downstairs from his studio on the corner of calle Reina Amalia in Barcelona's Barrio Chino, the red-light district. Along with everyone else in the place - a handful of souls brought together by their loose-endedness that Christmas Day - Bruno and I stared up at the wall-mounted black-and-white TV, riveted by an incredible transmission: the execution of Elena and Nicolae Ceausescu, here played out to the surreally corny soundtrack of Feliz Navidad, sung by children and blaring from some scratchy PA system in the street.</p> <p>The bar is now closed - indeed, it has been walled up with cement blocks. Gone too, of course, is the incandescent pulse of possibility belonging to those amazing days of upheaval. But for Bruno and for me - both of us in every sense far from the action of our peers in Eastern Europe - something of that possibility remained, and propelled each of us into our own discoveries.</p> <p>It doesn't seem even vaguely surprising that most of the moments in my life that have emerged as \"significant\" were witnessed, influenced, or even engineered by Bruno Fonseca, my older brother. For me, those days in Barcelona turned out to be the beginning of a five-year journey among the Gypsies of Eastern Europe (and by the end of that five-year journey Bruno would be dead). But Bruno had more to do with my launch than did the Ceausescus or the students of Bucharest's University Square. I'd long wanted to quit my job and travel to convulsing Eastern Europe (from which during earlier convulsions, some of our family had emigrated). But I was scared. I was interested in Gypsies and fluent on such topics as minorities and democracies, exclusion and deracination; the uses of exoticism; the outsider in the European imagination . . . But Bruno was more fluent. \"If you're interested in Gypsies,\" he put to me that night, \"don't you think we'd better go and meet some?\"</p> <p>And so we did. Somehow (and somehow of course) Bruno knew about a group of Gitnos camped at Gava Playa, a beach just outside of Barcelona's city limits. We set out for the camp one evening, just a few days after the executions. For that night on the beach, I would have worn something \"neutral\", that is something \"poor\". But Bruno, with his superior instincts, chose his most elegant garment (his only elegant garment), an enormous dark blue cashmere overcoat and he wore it loose, hanging from his broad coathanger shoulders. Down in the street he bought and stashed under his arms a couple of bottles of Ballantine whisky and a carton of cigarettes. He also happened to have in his inner pocket a deck of cards, but our most important provision was the ready supply of Bruno's emollient, inimitably casual charm, the perfect antidote to my own rather worried and earnest presence.</p> <p>Bruno had a belief that you had to \"walk into your fears\". (As a teenager his unfortunate motto was \"Try anything at least once\".) Walk into your fears: now this was hard to do. Not for the usual reasons but, at least for his little sister, because it was just impossible to be afraid in his company. Fear didn't come up. Ethical considerations, yes, always: Should we be even doing this? What is our real motive? If anything Bruno was unduly freighted with such concerns (often working them out, pros and cons, in endless lists). But he rarely paused over his own safety. Here again his instincts were uncommon and, at least this time, they were also right. We spent most of the night with those Gypsies by their fire. Though wary at first, they very soon took their cue from us: the tone was good, the night was fine, the mood was gay. Over the next five years I went on my own to dozens of Gypsy camps, many much rougher than the one at Gava Playa. But after that night, and I believe, because of it, I never again was distracted by considerations of fear - nor did I ever meet with any real danger. To many of his admirers, Bruno seemed a heroic example of the Greek idea that character is fate - a picture complicated, we must admit (and struggle to comprehend), by his early death which was such an affront to his virtue.</p> <p>Yes, virtue. After Bruno's death I received one particularly encouraging letter of condolence, from the poet Hugo Williams. \"Death can be useful,\" he wrote, \"because we inherit the virtues of those we love.\" Despite Bruno's obvious handicaps (severe dyslexia, staggering disorganisation) he had more than his share of virtues. Prominent among these were his hopeful instincts and his irresistible good influence, including his generosity. He was generous with his money and his time. But Bruno also had a more unusual virtue, that of full empathy. Even as an adolescent, when most of us are particularly, even rightfully solipsistic, Bruno was able to step into your shoes with your feet - that is, to imagine not what was right for you but what was right from your point of view (seldom the same thing).</p> <p>Imaginative sympathy continued to be his first reaction to any difficulty. The difficulty, say, of beginning a life with someone when you are dying (Shakespeare might have written for Bruno the sonnet which reminds us that \"love is not love which alters when it alteration finds\"). Five weeks before he died, Bruno was due to marry his beloved Anke, the young German painter who was herself a kind of pupil of Bruno's and his last companion.</p> <p>A chapel in downtown New York had been booked - Anke had always wanted a church wedding - but as the day approached it was clear that Bruno was too sick to move. So the wedding was to be held in the East 10th Street loft of our brother, Caio (the betrothed were living in an apartment upstairs).</p> <p>On the day, Bruno was unable to stand. With what must have been a tremendous effort, as he entered in a wheelchair to greet the crowd of friends and relations, he was smiling, gracious and seemingly light-hearted. When the minister began the service, the hot sunshine was interrupted by a storm of cracking New York thunder and lightning. Through the pounding, a woman in black sang a plangent Ave Maria; Anke's father read out Corinthians 13, and more in German. The bride wore grey - which sounds almost comical, but she looked wonderful and simple, and solemn in a childlike way. A wedding should be solemn, I think; certainly for all the intensity of feeling, for all the tears that flowed from each distinct tear group - tears of joy, grief, and love - this was a wedding that obviated the need for a funeral.</p> <p>At long last, the minister pronounced Bruno and Anke man and wife, and at that moment a bolt of lightning exploded in a deafening clap; the storm ended and the sun came out again. Bruno's cool comment as he turned his face to his bride was, \"I had a word with Zeus.\" And then, as everyone was laughing and moving in to congratulate, Bruno nodded in my direction. I wheeled him behind a borrowed screen where he vomited on to a paper plate and wiped his face with a champagne-moistened paper napkin before going back out to his guests.</p> <p>Bruno was not, in fact, an easygoing person - he worked and he worried very hard - but the characteristic, apparently effortless approach prevailed in his work. There, too, it represented some degree of suppression, even triumph over real difficulties. Our mother claims that, as a young child, Bruno was not a \"natural\", that of her four children he was the least fluent with a crayon. But he pushed himself. For example, over many winter weekends in Connecticut, Bruno aged, 14 or 15, would stay in his room painstakingly copying the drawings of Michelangelo while the rest of us went skiing. Later on, he was not fazed by the hundreds of little decisions each painting demands of the painter. He trusted his talent. And his personality allowed him to take risks. Indeed from early on, Bruno demanded it of himself.</p> <p>As a painter he was most interested in formal problems, but he instinctively understood that every painting must begin with an emotion, that the work would be cold without a true and personal investment. If this end of being an artist or just of being Bruno was all pretty exhausting and time-consuming for him it wasn't easy for onlookers either. You had to worry about Bruno. But like many others I was in awe not only of his famous \"eye\" - Bruno missed nothing - but of his truly open mind.</p> <p>On Bruno's famous eye: he was an unbelievably successful street scavenger, dragging home in the daylight or the dark any likely specimen for his lab of possibilities. It was in the course of this secondary pursuit that he hit on the ultimate, foolproof method for determining just how good a modern painting is: if you found it in the street, would you drag it home? And then, having dragged it home, would you hang it up? Or paint over it? But Bruno also had an educated eye for objects, for form, for the authentic. From the antiquities to kitsch, his loose collection of found and bought and bargained-for things was vast and original. He shared with our father a passion for the Egyptian, the pre-Columbian, the Greek and (perhaps especially) the \"provenance unknown\". He was the only collector among the children - of Roman coins, of small Mayan ceramic figures and heads. He and Papa would spend hours discussing the possible origin of some found piece, researching through Papa's library guessing at stylistic affinities.</p> <p>Still, Bruno was not interested in \"fine things\", or indeed in aesthetics per se - you could even accuse him of a slightly perverse anti-taste for exquisite goods and \"luxuries\" of all kinds. This meant he might not bother to get his heating fixed, but also that he preferred old objects, old clothes and old junk, as well as the sorts of places you were likely to find such things and the slightly foxed people who traded in them. Despite his own almost excessive good looks, he was at ease, seemingly for the first time in his life, in the Barcelona he found when he arrived in 1976 - a city full of people with one eye or a club foot, where little old black-clad Catholic ladies and flamboyant transvestites shared the same raffish boulevard, the Ramblas. A year after the death of Franco, Barcelona was unusually buoyant. Bruno trusted his talent as a painter, but also as a person on the street - everyone loved Bruno, especially the little old black-clad Catholic ladies. He was almost anachronistically gallant, the prince who danced with the wallflowers. But if his elaborate good manners and, above all, his openness - to ideas, to experience - meant that he struggled constantly against distraction, there was not much he could do about it. This is just the way he always was - long before the arrival of self-consciousness.</p> <p>Covered every summer, year after year and from head to toe (even between his fingers, I seem to remember, even around his mouth) in putty-pink calamine lotion for all his intimate adventures with poison ivy, scarred at the knees as from an awful initiation, both for his amazed siblings and his anxious parents, Bruno was a child to watch. Bruno would walk into the sea and just keep going. Bruno would climb a tree always with the aim of getting to the highest branch.</p> <p>When we played with blocks (and it does seem to be what we mainly did), my sister, Quina, and I, would, I'm afraid, lay out a perimeter of domestic spaces in which to enact our familial fantasies: Caio would build solid fortresses with thick ramparts; and inevitably Bruno would be standing on a chair, at work on a tower. Down it would tumble and he would start again. And again and again and again. Caio remembers Bruno's persistent attempts to construct an \"upside-down Empire State Building\".</p> <p>Once, on a trip to the tropics with our grandparents, Bruno saved my life. I had drifted out to sea, and as the tide receded, I was being thrashed between two volcanic boulders, trapped and gulping seawater. I can still remember the sprung silhouettes of my grandmother and the babysitter frozen on the shore. And then there was Bruno, sprinting across the shallows, a 100-yard dash over a field of sea urchins, plucking me up and carrying me back. That evening, still on the beach, in yellow candlelight and a held-in-breath silence, local fishermen worked to burn the five o'clock shadow from the soles of Bruno's feet - the deeply embedded spines of dozens of sea urchins. What seemed like hours passed and Bruno didn't make a sound. He was 11 years old.</p> <p>For Bruno the liberation of 1989 did not come in the form of communal enterprise but of a gathering in, a consolidation of many of his preoccupations, both painterly and personal. It was partly the events themselves - universal, we all love to imagine: David and Goliath, live in Eastern Europe - but it was also the immediacy and seeming intimacy with which they were brought to our attention, primarily by CNN. This dimension of participant observation, the way we were all somehow implicated - literally witnesses at an execution - interested Bruno as a painter. He found it allowed him a fresh way into the kind of great narrative painting he'd always loved: Paolo Uccello, Piero della Francesca, Tintoretto, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - paintings but also recordings, also news. For Bruno, this kind of storytelling was utterly vivid. He had no difficulty, never did have any difficulty, with a translation of sensibilities between the centuries.</p> <p>The War Murals - Bruno's four larger narrative paintings inspired by the anti-communist upheavals - represent his greatest synthesis of abstract and representational painting, something he had struggled for throughout his working life. And he put everything in. As a painter, as a witness, as a boulevardier (or Ramblista); as the boy who had endlessly copied versions of Christ's descent from the cross, as a young man under the shadow of a terminal disease; as a lifelong reader of Homer and Gibbon (and Nabokov and Camus); and as a passionate admirer of womankind. Visual inspiration also included photographs from other wars - boy soldiers torn from the pages of the International Herald Tribune (Sudan? Sierra Leone?) and tacked around the studio. These were selected for their universal theme but also for their hints about composition, their plastic qualities, their paintability.</p> <p>When I say he put it all in I don't mean he didn't know what to leave out. Bruno put in all that was essential - as Einstein said, \"Things should be as simple as possible but not any simpler\" - and that is what gives this series its particular humanity and universality. To those who knew Bruno his achievement is the more impressive for seeming so unlikely - though not because of doubt about his talent. In contrast to the spectacular chaos of his days - the cluttered studio, the piled knots of his clothes, the troubled emotions, the ambitious, still-formulating ideas, the dozens of competing projects and demanding friends, the collective, haphazard approach to the treatment of his disease - despite all this, Bruno was an unusually direct and meticulous worker. Unlike my other painter brother, for example, whose patches of paint on ankle, wrist, hand and toe have become, indelibly, a part of his skin, Bruno was a clean painter. On Bruno a white shirt stayed white.</p> <p>I said it doesn't surprise me that Bruno was importantly present at all the significant turns in my life. Perhaps this is the reason: he was uncommonly able to suppress the general chaos in favour of immediate concerns, whether of a friend in need or of a critical moment in a painting. He couldn't deal with airlines, fax machines or banks but, finally, he didn't need to. Unexpected only because of his legendary impracticality, his was a practical, and enviable, solution to the ever more pressing demands of life and work in the middle of our lives, at the end of our century.</p> <p>The War Murals are important not just for their significance to Bruno's oeuvre. I think his intense preoccupation with these works over several years (and no other among his paintings had so protracted a parturition) gave him added impetus to fight the disease that was not only killing him but was also annoying and boring him almost beyond his ability to cope with it. Bruno had little talent as a patient; he had no knack for taking care of himself. He'd never had to. Always outrageously strong and healthy, muscled and lean and unacquainted with anything like an exercise regime, Bruno was a natural athlete who didn't need to train, the high school track star who only did it once a year, on field day. He should have died several times before he did. For example, over Christmas in Germany in 1992, when he had pneumonia and, though perhaps the most vulnerable person in all Schleswig-Holstein, he was kept in the infection ward of a small provincial hospital on the Baltic coast. He should have died there - not because he was the first Aids patient the hospital had ever seen and the first patient of any kind for the newly certified doctor who alone was willing to treat him (by correspondence with a hospital in Hamburg). Bruno should have died that Christmas in Germany because in those early days, as Aids became a reality for Bruno and Anke, the terrified twosome refused all medication (\"There is no guarantee,\" a panicky Anke reasoned, that the antibiotics for the pneumonia wouldn't have \"side effects\").</p> <p>Eventually Caio and I and then, crucially, our mother flew to Germany to bring Bruno home. But we couldn't bring him home. For several days Bruno did not even allow us to visit him (there was, indeed, \"no guarantee\" that we didn't want to brainwash him with \"Western medical propaganda\"). And so we waited in the hospital cafeteria with its tilting artificial Christmas tree and its slow-flickering multicoloured Christmas lights and listened to the booming artillery fire which signalled the start of New Year celebrations. When Mom joined us and went in to see Bruno, I stood in the doorway behind her. The look on Bruno's face - a look of fear and bewilderment subsiding into exhausted relief - is one that I have seen again only on the face of my own child, on being gathered up from a nightmare. But even our mother was subjected to the fearful exclusionary policy of Bruno and Anke. And so we all waited.</p> <p>Mom filled the time trying to find acceptable ways to make Bruno more comfortable. For example, she decided Bruno should have apple sauce; Bruno loved apple sauce. But the stuff we found had to be doctored: we had to get some cinnamon. The three of us went around that hateful harbour town in the dead of winter, bent in hysterical, tearful laughter, trying with our nonexistent German to extract cinnamon from stout kiosk vendors. Caio came up with \"braun Pulver, gut mit Apfelmus\", and after he'd said this all three of us would start chanting all the other words for cinnamon we could think of: \"canelle, canella, scortisoara, cinnamon, cinnamon, CINNAMON\". \"Zimt?\" one appalled kiosk lady replied. \"Yah, Zimt,\" we figured. And so Bruno got his Apfelmus mit Zimt. But mostly we sat in the cafeteria, watching his window across the frozen courtyard, waiting for a sign.</p> <p>And finally, on one of those days of mainly silent waiting (the happiest moment of my life, I sometimes think), Bruno himself appeared in the cafeteria, an apparition in a huge blue overcoat. He looked almost fine. The gesture (or did I dream it?) cost him a few extra days in bed, but as it happened there were no beds free in New York City. And so we waited some more. There were no beds and there were no seats, not for someone as sick as Bruno. Lufthansa wouldn't fly him. Or not until our mother \"explained\", in the tone of the mother of a very sick child (an international language): \"My son will not die in Germany!\"</p> <p>Eventually Bruno did fly home with Jost, the young doctor, by his side as well as Anke (preoccupied that her entire suitcase of homeopathetic unguents and oils had lost all their \"information\" when airport security insisted that she put them through the X-ray machine). And he got better, and he went back to work. The War Murals were executed mainly in the period that followed this episode.</p> <p>Over the next two years, in different hospitals and under different doctors, there were similar crises and reprieves, with the expectation of death at any time. Despite the general hopelessness, we felt incredibly lucky to have found Dr Joseph Sonnabend, a pioneering research doctor who understood Bruno, who seemed more like a sculptor than a doctor, and who became and remained a friend of the whole family, including Anke, with whom he could play Bach duets - his piano to her flute: the best medicine for his reluctant patient.</p> <p>Bruno was rightly sceptical of the treatments then on offer (much of what he was fed would be unthinkable now) but he, at least, was never fatalistic. In his final push to fight the disease - which at that point, in late 1993, was represented by an egg-size brain tumour pressing excruciatingly against his skull - there was defeat in the air, at home, on the wards. Bruno was \"failing\" and it seemed far from clear even to Sonnabend that the violent treatment was worth any brief reprieve. But Bruno again submitted, trudging down the street each day for six weeks from the house where we grew up to St Vincent's Hospital and what he called his \"X-ray class\" - the radiation treatment for the tumour. He got better - the egg became an acorn, and he went back to Barcelona and said goodbye to his life there. Above all, he put back on the agenda an exhibition of The War Murals in New York.</p> <p>Early in 1994, these four pictures were at the centre of a show that launched the John McEnroe Gallery in Soho. It was the first time the paintings had been publicly displayed, and no one was more excited than Gonzalo Fonseca, Papa. Most people, when posed the idle question of what death they would have - Mack truck or slow, disfiguring disease? - perfunctorily go for the Mack truck. But in addition to the rapprochement of father and first son, Bruno's drawn-out death involved our family in an extraordinary drama of compressed living.</p> <p>I have already said that one of Bruno's gifts was his irresistible good influence, and it is the best possible light you can put on his awful death that again he pulled us together as a family and at the same time brought out the best in each of us.</p> <p>During his final five weeks we were all together for the last time as a family. Together again in the childhood place, in the house called The Big House, the house that had belonged to our grandparents, beloved and now both dead, too. There, in the tight formation of our relatively small family (without the additional childhood voices of many cousins and aunts and uncles and friends), we fell into what felt like our natural roles. Bruno was installed in a downstairs bedroom off the dining room - gloomy, shuttered, wood-panelled, library-like - with the bed facing a big fireplace over which hung, a strange, primitive painting on wood of an aerial view, or plan, of Dartmoor Prison. Tacked on the wall above his bed (who put it there?) was a postcard of Donatello's exquisite wooden John the Baptist whom Bruno, with his sallow skin and his beautiful bald head, now closely resembled. Papa sat through each day, cross-legged or cross-ankled, keeping a vigil by Bruno's bed or sometimes outside his door, reading the New York Times, the entire section neatly folded down to one fourth or even one eighth of the broadsheet whole. Our stepfather, Dick Cornuelle, showed his solidarity mainly by hanging back, even though he was in many ways closer to Bruno, and to all of us, than our real father. When she wasn't preparing yet another delicious meal (\"It's just as easy to cook a good dinner as a bad one,\" she protested when we protested), my mother was usually at Bruno's bedside as well, drawing. Her sketches of her dying boy are among the most moving and perceptive portraits I've ever seen. Caio, the brother who more than anyone had shared Bruno's whole life: their room with its stacked beds, their life together as students in Spain and later as colleagues bound, and isolated, by their unique training - Caio stood by, mostly speechless. Speechless, particularly after Bruno lost the ability to speak. But their communication didn't depend on words.</p> <p>Quina and I fell into an easy division of nursely duties - washing and changing and rolling over our heavy brother; soothing and smoothing and rearranging his pillows, protecting him against too many visitors, or visitors staying too long. Quina constantly reset the whirring pump that kept Bruno hydrated, manned the tubes, and cleaned inflamed punctures in his arm. I found, when Bruno started having seizures, that I could unsqueamishly give him shots of phenobarbital in the buttocks (Dr Sonnabend told me where and how over the phone) and, later, doses of morphine. I read a lot to Bruno, as did others. Kafka's A Hunger Artist was good almost too good - or, along with The Metamorphosis, too apposite. We got through most of Mary Renault's Persian Boy, which was terrible, but perfect in the way it transported Bruno, who was only intermittently listening anyway, back into the world of the ancients.</p> <p>Anke was just there, which, as Bruno's yellow-haired muse, was precisely her job and she became closer to me, which I think Bruno noticed and which would have pleased him. And, as one treatment after another failed, as we realised that no one had the information that could save Bruno, we all moved closer to Anke. Bruno's last words to me came about a week before he died, while she and I sat on his bed. \"You look so much alike,\" he said. We don't, but perhaps what he saw was what a long way we had come from that German Christmas of \"no guarantee\" to our sharing of my grandmother's huge double bed, listening through the night to Bruno's breathing on the baby monitor. This was the last time in that place of the calamine lotion and the Big Lawn and the enormous trees - copper beech and elm, each with its one, famous \"highest branch\". This was the last time our family sat down together at that 15ft dark wood table in the brilliant blue dining room, and we were all painfully, unhungrily conscious of the confinement, a testing mix of nostalgia and claustrophobia. One morning, Papa tried to escape to the city and came back by bus the very same day.</p> <p>The last night, when Bruno was clearly dying - his skin colour and skin smell changed as his organs began to fail; his breathing had begun to climb in slow crescendos - we were all hovering in his room. And then, for no particular reason, everyone filed out. Everyone except Papa. And that is when Bruno died.</p> <p>Days later, the funeral parlour returned his ashes, or \"cremains\", as they insisted on calling them. They arrived in a shiny little shopping bag, as if from a smart shoe store. Inside was a small parcel, about the size of a five-pound bag of flour and just as densely packed, wrapped in newspaper (the funnies, no less). For the hell of it we put it, or him, on the kitchen scales: six pounds four ounces, his birth weight exactly.</p> <p>In a pink twilight we scattered his ashes from the jetty of what we called the Pink Beach. It was the same beach where, as children, we had laboured passionately under our father's expert command; ferrying buckets of water and wet sand, carefully cutting crusty sand slabs, we built with him the most fantastic, sepulchral sandcastles, in the mood and (we imagined) on the scale of the Egyptians. It was the last time for us as that family in that house. The Big House is now the regional headquarters of the Nature Conservancy in the South Fork.</p> <p>Six months or so after Bruno's death, Mom and I returned to his vast studio in Barcelona to begin, with Anke, to go through his things and specifically to identify whatever work we might find: paintings, sculpture, notebooks, drawings, wooden pieces, models for monuments. We didn't necessarily want to take it away (take, it where?). We didn't really want to touch his world. We might have left it as a kind of diorama of a vanished life. But we also wanted to climb into the display (which extended to Bruno's immediate neighbourhood), to be with him, to be with all the him there was ever going to be.</p> <p>Around that time our mother decided, comically, that Bruno was not dead after all. \"He's just in Barcelona.\" She would say. \"I never saw him anyway. He's just in Barcelona.\" Like everyone else in the family, Bruno was a hoarder. Whatever hadn't been lost in the street would be here, five floors up a steeply coiled staircase, many of the treads completely worn away to reveal the vertigo-inducing caracole elevation below. One category of Brunoiana that I had expected to find, and did find in wholesale quantities, was his letters: written in a romantic, looping, leaning, hard-to-read 19th-century hand, each one customised (and therefore made uniformly, unmistakably, instantly recognisable as his product) with endless figures and doodles in the margins. Most were unfinished and without any apparent intention of being sent to the addressee. These letters were really a place to try out ideas, to weigh the escapades of the heart, no different from letters written to oneself (indeed there are some in Bruno's notebooks frankly addressed, \"Dear Notebook\" or \"Dear Letter\").</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,392422,00.html\">Read the second part of Dear Brother here</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "December 25, 1989. We sat on tall stools at a bar with no name, \"Bruno's local\", downstairs from his studio on the corner of calle Reina Amalia in Barcelona's Barrio Chino, the red-light district. Along with everyone else in the place - a handful of souls brought together by their loose-endedness that Christmas Day - Bruno and I stared up at the wall-mounted black-and-white TV, riveted by an incredible transmission: the execution of Elena and Nicolae Ceausescu, here played out to the surreally corny soundtrack of Feliz Navidad, sung by children and blaring from some scratchy PA system in the street. The bar is now closed - indeed, it has been walled up with cement blocks. Gone too, of course, is the incandescent pulse of possibility belonging to those amazing days of upheaval. But for Bruno and for me - both of us in every sense far from the action of our peers in Eastern Europe - something of that possibility remained, and propelled each of us into our own discoveries. It doesn't seem even vaguely surprising that most of the moments in my life that have emerged as \"significant\" were witnessed, influenced, or even engineered by Bruno Fonseca, my older brother. For me, those days in Barcelona turned out to be the beginning of a five-year journey among the Gypsies of Eastern Europe (and by the end of that five-year journey Bruno would be dead). But Bruno had more to do with my launch than did the Ceausescus or the students of Bucharest's University Square. I'd long wanted to quit my job and travel to convulsing Eastern Europe (from which during earlier convulsions, some of our family had emigrated). But I was scared. I was interested in Gypsies and fluent on such topics as minorities and democracies, exclusion and deracination; the uses of exoticism; the outsider in the European imagination . . . But Bruno was more fluent. \"If you're interested in Gypsies,\" he put to me that night, \"don't you think we'd better go and meet some?\" And so we did. Somehow (and somehow of course) Bruno knew about a group of Gitnos camped at Gava Playa, a beach just outside of Barcelona's city limits. We set out for the camp one evening, just a few days after the executions. For that night on the beach, I would have worn something \"neutral\", that is something \"poor\". But Bruno, with his superior instincts, chose his most elegant garment (his only elegant garment), an enormous dark blue cashmere overcoat and he wore it loose, hanging from his broad coathanger shoulders. Down in the street he bought and stashed under his arms a couple of bottles of Ballantine whisky and a carton of cigarettes. He also happened to have in his inner pocket a deck of cards, but our most important provision was the ready supply of Bruno's emollient, inimitably casual charm, the perfect antidote to my own rather worried and earnest presence. Bruno had a belief that you had to \"walk into your fears\". (As a teenager his unfortunate motto was \"Try anything at least once\".) Walk into your fears: now this was hard to do. Not for the usual reasons but, at least for his little sister, because it was just impossible to be afraid in his company. Fear didn't come up. Ethical considerations, yes, always: Should we be even doing this? What is our real motive? If anything Bruno was unduly freighted with such concerns (often working them out, pros and cons, in endless lists). But he rarely paused over his own safety. Here again his instincts were uncommon and, at least this time, they were also right. We spent most of the night with those Gypsies by their fire. Though wary at first, they very soon took their cue from us: the tone was good, the night was fine, the mood was gay. Over the next five years I went on my own to dozens of Gypsy camps, many much rougher than the one at Gava Playa. But after that night, and I believe, because of it, I never again was distracted by considerations of fear - nor did I ever meet with any real danger. To many of his admirers, Bruno seemed a heroic example of the Greek idea that character is fate - a picture complicated, we must admit (and struggle to comprehend), by his early death which was such an affront to his virtue. Yes, virtue. After Bruno's death I received one particularly encouraging letter of condolence, from the poet Hugo Williams. \"Death can be useful,\" he wrote, \"because we inherit the virtues of those we love.\" Despite Bruno's obvious handicaps (severe dyslexia, staggering disorganisation) he had more than his share of virtues. Prominent among these were his hopeful instincts and his irresistible good influence, including his generosity. He was generous with his money and his time. But Bruno also had a more unusual virtue, that of full empathy. Even as an adolescent, when most of us are particularly, even rightfully solipsistic, Bruno was able to step into your shoes with your feet - that is, to imagine not what was right for you but what was right from your point of view (seldom the same thing). Imaginative sympathy continued to be his first reaction to any difficulty. The difficulty, say, of beginning a life with someone when you are dying (Shakespeare might have written for Bruno the sonnet which reminds us that \"love is not love which alters when it alteration finds\"). Five weeks before he died, Bruno was due to marry his beloved Anke, the young German painter who was herself a kind of pupil of Bruno's and his last companion. A chapel in downtown New York had been booked - Anke had always wanted a church wedding - but as the day approached it was clear that Bruno was too sick to move. So the wedding was to be held in the East 10th Street loft of our brother, Caio (the betrothed were living in an apartment upstairs). On the day, Bruno was unable to stand. With what must have been a tremendous effort, as he entered in a wheelchair to greet the crowd of friends and relations, he was smiling, gracious and seemingly light-hearted. When the minister began the service, the hot sunshine was interrupted by a storm of cracking New York thunder and lightning. Through the pounding, a woman in black sang a plangent Ave Maria; Anke's father read out Corinthians 13, and more in German. The bride wore grey - which sounds almost comical, but she looked wonderful and simple, and solemn in a childlike way. A wedding should be solemn, I think; certainly for all the intensity of feeling, for all the tears that flowed from each distinct tear group - tears of joy, grief, and love - this was a wedding that obviated the need for a funeral. At long last, the minister pronounced Bruno and Anke man and wife, and at that moment a bolt of lightning exploded in a deafening clap; the storm ended and the sun came out again. Bruno's cool comment as he turned his face to his bride was, \"I had a word with Zeus.\" And then, as everyone was laughing and moving in to congratulate, Bruno nodded in my direction. I wheeled him behind a borrowed screen where he vomited on to a paper plate and wiped his face with a champagne-moistened paper napkin before going back out to his guests. Bruno was not, in fact, an easygoing person - he worked and he worried very hard - but the characteristic, apparently effortless approach prevailed in his work. There, too, it represented some degree of suppression, even triumph over real difficulties. Our mother claims that, as a young child, Bruno was not a \"natural\", that of her four children he was the least fluent with a crayon. But he pushed himself. For example, over many winter weekends in Connecticut, Bruno aged, 14 or 15, would stay in his room painstakingly copying the drawings of Michelangelo while the rest of us went skiing. Later on, he was not fazed by the hundreds of little decisions each painting demands of the painter. He trusted his talent. And his personality allowed him to take risks. Indeed from early on, Bruno demanded it of himself. As a painter he was most interested in formal problems, but he instinctively understood that every painting must begin with an emotion, that the work would be cold without a true and personal investment. If this end of being an artist or just of being Bruno was all pretty exhausting and time-consuming for him it wasn't easy for onlookers either. You had to worry about Bruno. But like many others I was in awe not only of his famous \"eye\" - Bruno missed nothing - but of his truly open mind. On Bruno's famous eye: he was an unbelievably successful street scavenger, dragging home in the daylight or the dark any likely specimen for his lab of possibilities. It was in the course of this secondary pursuit that he hit on the ultimate, foolproof method for determining just how good a modern painting is: if you found it in the street, would you drag it home? And then, having dragged it home, would you hang it up? Or paint over it? But Bruno also had an educated eye for objects, for form, for the authentic. From the antiquities to kitsch, his loose collection of found and bought and bargained-for things was vast and original. He shared with our father a passion for the Egyptian, the pre-Columbian, the Greek and (perhaps especially) the \"provenance unknown\". He was the only collector among the children - of Roman coins, of small Mayan ceramic figures and heads. He and Papa would spend hours discussing the possible origin of some found piece, researching through Papa's library guessing at stylistic affinities. Still, Bruno was not interested in \"fine things\", or indeed in aesthetics per se - you could even accuse him of a slightly perverse anti-taste for exquisite goods and \"luxuries\" of all kinds. This meant he might not bother to get his heating fixed, but also that he preferred old objects, old clothes and old junk, as well as the sorts of places you were likely to find such things and the slightly foxed people who traded in them. Despite his own almost excessive good looks, he was at ease, seemingly for the first time in his life, in the Barcelona he found when he arrived in 1976 - a city full of people with one eye or a club foot, where little old black-clad Catholic ladies and flamboyant transvestites shared the same raffish boulevard, the Ramblas. A year after the death of Franco, Barcelona was unusually buoyant. Bruno trusted his talent as a painter, but also as a person on the street - everyone loved Bruno, especially the little old black-clad Catholic ladies. He was almost anachronistically gallant, the prince who danced with the wallflowers. But if his elaborate good manners and, above all, his openness - to ideas, to experience - meant that he struggled constantly against distraction, there was not much he could do about it. This is just the way he always was - long before the arrival of self-consciousness. Covered every summer, year after year and from head to toe (even between his fingers, I seem to remember, even around his mouth) in putty-pink calamine lotion for all his intimate adventures with poison ivy, scarred at the knees as from an awful initiation, both for his amazed siblings and his anxious parents, Bruno was a child to watch. Bruno would walk into the sea and just keep going. Bruno would climb a tree always with the aim of getting to the highest branch. When we played with blocks (and it does seem to be what we mainly did), my sister, Quina, and I, would, I'm afraid, lay out a perimeter of domestic spaces in which to enact our familial fantasies: Caio would build solid fortresses with thick ramparts; and inevitably Bruno would be standing on a chair, at work on a tower. Down it would tumble and he would start again. And again and again and again. Caio remembers Bruno's persistent attempts to construct an \"upside-down Empire State Building\". Once, on a trip to the tropics with our grandparents, Bruno saved my life. I had drifted out to sea, and as the tide receded, I was being thrashed between two volcanic boulders, trapped and gulping seawater. I can still remember the sprung silhouettes of my grandmother and the babysitter frozen on the shore. And then there was Bruno, sprinting across the shallows, a 100-yard dash over a field of sea urchins, plucking me up and carrying me back. That evening, still on the beach, in yellow candlelight and a held-in-breath silence, local fishermen worked to burn the five o'clock shadow from the soles of Bruno's feet - the deeply embedded spines of dozens of sea urchins. What seemed like hours passed and Bruno didn't make a sound. He was 11 years old. For Bruno the liberation of 1989 did not come in the form of communal enterprise but of a gathering in, a consolidation of many of his preoccupations, both painterly and personal. It was partly the events themselves - universal, we all love to imagine: David and Goliath, live in Eastern Europe - but it was also the immediacy and seeming intimacy with which they were brought to our attention, primarily by CNN. This dimension of participant observation, the way we were all somehow implicated - literally witnesses at an execution - interested Bruno as a painter. He found it allowed him a fresh way into the kind of great narrative painting he'd always loved: Paolo Uccello, Piero della Francesca, Tintoretto, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - paintings but also recordings, also news. For Bruno, this kind of storytelling was utterly vivid. He had no difficulty, never did have any difficulty, with a translation of sensibilities between the centuries. The War Murals - Bruno's four larger narrative paintings inspired by the anti-communist upheavals - represent his greatest synthesis of abstract and representational painting, something he had struggled for throughout his working life. And he put everything in. As a painter, as a witness, as a boulevardier (or Ramblista); as the boy who had endlessly copied versions of Christ's descent from the cross, as a young man under the shadow of a terminal disease; as a lifelong reader of Homer and Gibbon (and Nabokov and Camus); and as a passionate admirer of womankind. Visual inspiration also included photographs from other wars - boy soldiers torn from the pages of the International Herald Tribune (Sudan? Sierra Leone?) and tacked around the studio. These were selected for their universal theme but also for their hints about composition, their plastic qualities, their paintability. When I say he put it all in I don't mean he didn't know what to leave out. Bruno put in all that was essential - as Einstein said, \"Things should be as simple as possible but not any simpler\" - and that is what gives this series its particular humanity and universality. To those who knew Bruno his achievement is the more impressive for seeming so unlikely - though not because of doubt about his talent. In contrast to the spectacular chaos of his days - the cluttered studio, the piled knots of his clothes, the troubled emotions, the ambitious, still-formulating ideas, the dozens of competing projects and demanding friends, the collective, haphazard approach to the treatment of his disease - despite all this, Bruno was an unusually direct and meticulous worker. Unlike my other painter brother, for example, whose patches of paint on ankle, wrist, hand and toe have become, indelibly, a part of his skin, Bruno was a clean painter. On Bruno a white shirt stayed white. I said it doesn't surprise me that Bruno was importantly present at all the significant turns in my life. Perhaps this is the reason: he was uncommonly able to suppress the general chaos in favour of immediate concerns, whether of a friend in need or of a critical moment in a painting. He couldn't deal with airlines, fax machines or banks but, finally, he didn't need to. Unexpected only because of his legendary impracticality, his was a practical, and enviable, solution to the ever more pressing demands of life and work in the middle of our lives, at the end of our century. The War Murals are important not just for their significance to Bruno's oeuvre. I think his intense preoccupation with these works over several years (and no other among his paintings had so protracted a parturition) gave him added impetus to fight the disease that was not only killing him but was also annoying and boring him almost beyond his ability to cope with it. Bruno had little talent as a patient; he had no knack for taking care of himself. He'd never had to. Always outrageously strong and healthy, muscled and lean and unacquainted with anything like an exercise regime, Bruno was a natural athlete who didn't need to train, the high school track star who only did it once a year, on field day. He should have died several times before he did. For example, over Christmas in Germany in 1992, when he had pneumonia and, though perhaps the most vulnerable person in all Schleswig-Holstein, he was kept in the infection ward of a small provincial hospital on the Baltic coast. He should have died there - not because he was the first Aids patient the hospital had ever seen and the first patient of any kind for the newly certified doctor who alone was willing to treat him (by correspondence with a hospital in Hamburg). Bruno should have died that Christmas in Germany because in those early days, as Aids became a reality for Bruno and Anke, the terrified twosome refused all medication (\"There is no guarantee,\" a panicky Anke reasoned, that the antibiotics for the pneumonia wouldn't have \"side effects\"). Eventually Caio and I and then, crucially, our mother flew to Germany to bring Bruno home. But we couldn't bring him home. For several days Bruno did not even allow us to visit him (there was, indeed, \"no guarantee\" that we didn't want to brainwash him with \"Western medical propaganda\"). And so we waited in the hospital cafeteria with its tilting artificial Christmas tree and its slow-flickering multicoloured Christmas lights and listened to the booming artillery fire which signalled the start of New Year celebrations. When Mom joined us and went in to see Bruno, I stood in the doorway behind her. The look on Bruno's face - a look of fear and bewilderment subsiding into exhausted relief - is one that I have seen again only on the face of my own child, on being gathered up from a nightmare. But even our mother was subjected to the fearful exclusionary policy of Bruno and Anke. And so we all waited. Mom filled the time trying to find acceptable ways to make Bruno more comfortable. For example, she decided Bruno should have apple sauce; Bruno loved apple sauce. But the stuff we found had to be doctored: we had to get some cinnamon. The three of us went around that hateful harbour town in the dead of winter, bent in hysterical, tearful laughter, trying with our nonexistent German to extract cinnamon from stout kiosk vendors. Caio came up with \"braun Pulver, gut mit Apfelmus\", and after he'd said this all three of us would start chanting all the other words for cinnamon we could think of: \"canelle, canella, scortisoara, cinnamon, cinnamon, CINNAMON\". \"Zimt?\" one appalled kiosk lady replied. \"Yah, Zimt,\" we figured. And so Bruno got his Apfelmus mit Zimt. But mostly we sat in the cafeteria, watching his window across the frozen courtyard, waiting for a sign. And finally, on one of those days of mainly silent waiting (the happiest moment of my life, I sometimes think), Bruno himself appeared in the cafeteria, an apparition in a huge blue overcoat. He looked almost fine. The gesture (or did I dream it?) cost him a few extra days in bed, but as it happened there were no beds free in New York City. And so we waited some more. There were no beds and there were no seats, not for someone as sick as Bruno. Lufthansa wouldn't fly him. Or not until our mother \"explained\", in the tone of the mother of a very sick child (an international language): \"My son will not die in Germany!\" Eventually Bruno did fly home with Jost, the young doctor, by his side as well as Anke (preoccupied that her entire suitcase of homeopathetic unguents and oils had lost all their \"information\" when airport security insisted that she put them through the X-ray machine). And he got better, and he went back to work. The War Murals were executed mainly in the period that followed this episode. Over the next two years, in different hospitals and under different doctors, there were similar crises and reprieves, with the expectation of death at any time. Despite the general hopelessness, we felt incredibly lucky to have found Dr Joseph Sonnabend, a pioneering research doctor who understood Bruno, who seemed more like a sculptor than a doctor, and who became and remained a friend of the whole family, including Anke, with whom he could play Bach duets - his piano to her flute: the best medicine for his reluctant patient. Bruno was rightly sceptical of the treatments then on offer (much of what he was fed would be unthinkable now) but he, at least, was never fatalistic. In his final push to fight the disease - which at that point, in late 1993, was represented by an egg-size brain tumour pressing excruciatingly against his skull - there was defeat in the air, at home, on the wards. Bruno was \"failing\" and it seemed far from clear even to Sonnabend that the violent treatment was worth any brief reprieve. But Bruno again submitted, trudging down the street each day for six weeks from the house where we grew up to St Vincent's Hospital and what he called his \"X-ray class\" - the radiation treatment for the tumour. He got better - the egg became an acorn, and he went back to Barcelona and said goodbye to his life there. Above all, he put back on the agenda an exhibition of The War Murals in New York. Early in 1994, these four pictures were at the centre of a show that launched the John McEnroe Gallery in Soho. It was the first time the paintings had been publicly displayed, and no one was more excited than Gonzalo Fonseca, Papa. Most people, when posed the idle question of what death they would have - Mack truck or slow, disfiguring disease? - perfunctorily go for the Mack truck. But in addition to the rapprochement of father and first son, Bruno's drawn-out death involved our family in an extraordinary drama of compressed living. I have already said that one of Bruno's gifts was his irresistible good influence, and it is the best possible light you can put on his awful death that again he pulled us together as a family and at the same time brought out the best in each of us. During his final five weeks we were all together for the last time as a family. Together again in the childhood place, in the house called The Big House, the house that had belonged to our grandparents, beloved and now both dead, too. There, in the tight formation of our relatively small family (without the additional childhood voices of many cousins and aunts and uncles and friends), we fell into what felt like our natural roles. Bruno was installed in a downstairs bedroom off the dining room - gloomy, shuttered, wood-panelled, library-like - with the bed facing a big fireplace over which hung, a strange, primitive painting on wood of an aerial view, or plan, of Dartmoor Prison. Tacked on the wall above his bed (who put it there?) was a postcard of Donatello's exquisite wooden John the Baptist whom Bruno, with his sallow skin and his beautiful bald head, now closely resembled. Papa sat through each day, cross-legged or cross-ankled, keeping a vigil by Bruno's bed or sometimes outside his door, reading the New York Times, the entire section neatly folded down to one fourth or even one eighth of the broadsheet whole. Our stepfather, Dick Cornuelle, showed his solidarity mainly by hanging back, even though he was in many ways closer to Bruno, and to all of us, than our real father. When she wasn't preparing yet another delicious meal (\"It's just as easy to cook a good dinner as a bad one,\" she protested when we protested), my mother was usually at Bruno's bedside as well, drawing. Her sketches of her dying boy are among the most moving and perceptive portraits I've ever seen. Caio, the brother who more than anyone had shared Bruno's whole life: their room with its stacked beds, their life together as students in Spain and later as colleagues bound, and isolated, by their unique training - Caio stood by, mostly speechless. Speechless, particularly after Bruno lost the ability to speak. But their communication didn't depend on words. Quina and I fell into an easy division of nursely duties - washing and changing and rolling over our heavy brother; soothing and smoothing and rearranging his pillows, protecting him against too many visitors, or visitors staying too long. Quina constantly reset the whirring pump that kept Bruno hydrated, manned the tubes, and cleaned inflamed punctures in his arm. I found, when Bruno started having seizures, that I could unsqueamishly give him shots of phenobarbital in the buttocks (Dr Sonnabend told me where and how over the phone) and, later, doses of morphine. I read a lot to Bruno, as did others. Kafka's A Hunger Artist was good almost too good - or, along with The Metamorphosis, too apposite. We got through most of Mary Renault's Persian Boy, which was terrible, but perfect in the way it transported Bruno, who was only intermittently listening anyway, back into the world of the ancients. Anke was just there, which, as Bruno's yellow-haired muse, was precisely her job and she became closer to me, which I think Bruno noticed and which would have pleased him. And, as one treatment after another failed, as we realised that no one had the information that could save Bruno, we all moved closer to Anke. Bruno's last words to me came about a week before he died, while she and I sat on his bed. \"You look so much alike,\" he said. We don't, but perhaps what he saw was what a long way we had come from that German Christmas of \"no guarantee\" to our sharing of my grandmother's huge double bed, listening through the night to Bruno's breathing on the baby monitor. This was the last time in that place of the calamine lotion and the Big Lawn and the enormous trees - copper beech and elm, each with its one, famous \"highest branch\". This was the last time our family sat down together at that 15ft dark wood table in the brilliant blue dining room, and we were all painfully, unhungrily conscious of the confinement, a testing mix of nostalgia and claustrophobia. One morning, Papa tried to escape to the city and came back by bus the very same day. The last night, when Bruno was clearly dying - his skin colour and skin smell changed as his organs began to fail; his breathing had begun to climb in slow crescendos - we were all hovering in his room. And then, for no particular reason, everyone filed out. Everyone except Papa. And that is when Bruno died. Days later, the funeral parlour returned his ashes, or \"cremains\", as they insisted on calling them. They arrived in a shiny little shopping bag, as if from a smart shoe store. Inside was a small parcel, about the size of a five-pound bag of flour and just as densely packed, wrapped in newspaper (the funnies, no less). For the hell of it we put it, or him, on the kitchen scales: six pounds four ounces, his birth weight exactly. In a pink twilight we scattered his ashes from the jetty of what we called the Pink Beach. It was the same beach where, as children, we had laboured passionately under our father's expert command; ferrying buckets of water and wet sand, carefully cutting crusty sand slabs, we built with him the most fantastic, sepulchral sandcastles, in the mood and (we imagined) on the scale of the Egyptians. It was the last time for us as that family in that house. The Big House is now the regional headquarters of the Nature Conservancy in the South Fork. Six months or so after Bruno's death, Mom and I returned to his vast studio in Barcelona to begin, with Anke, to go through his things and specifically to identify whatever work we might find: paintings, sculpture, notebooks, drawings, wooden pieces, models for monuments. We didn't necessarily want to take it away (take, it where?). We didn't really want to touch his world. We might have left it as a kind of diorama of a vanished life. But we also wanted to climb into the display (which extended to Bruno's immediate neighbourhood), to be with him, to be with all the him there was ever going to be. Around that time our mother decided, comically, that Bruno was not dead after all. \"He's just in Barcelona.\" She would say. \"I never saw him anyway. He's just in Barcelona.\" Like everyone else in the family, Bruno was a hoarder. Whatever hadn't been lost in the street would be here, five floors up a steeply coiled staircase, many of the treads completely worn away to reveal the vertigo-inducing caracole elevation below. One category of Brunoiana that I had expected to find, and did find in wholesale quantities, was his letters: written in a romantic, looping, leaning, hard-to-read 19th-century hand, each one customised (and therefore made uniformly, unmistakably, instantly recognisable as his product) with endless figures and doodles in the margins. Most were unfinished and without any apparent intention of being sent to the addressee. These letters were really a place to try out ideas, to weigh the escapades of the heart, no different from letters written to oneself (indeed there are some in Bruno's notebooks frankly addressed, \"Dear Notebook\" or \"Dear Letter\").

I looked at the small typed lines of information above the pictures, and sure enough these slides were not of Bruno but of one Jose Lopez Merino. So who was he? Or who is he? Is he dead or alive? Did he have Aids, too? Or were his negatives negative? Was he a friend of Bruno's? An important friend? Does he have a message for me?

No one knew - certainly he had no idea. Bruno was always so fretful about not working, so ready to be distracted, maybe already down at the cafe, working on his second cafe con leche, bien caliente. Bruno always carried a notebook (tucked into the waistband of his trousers at the back) and he left them everywhere. He must have lost hundreds, and still we found over a hundred. Rolls and rolls of paintings. Racks and racks of paintings (as well as paintings caught under boxes, stuffed behind doors, squashed into cupboards).

Despite the diagnosis, he was of course only ever looking forward. It was impossible to do otherwise. Except for little stabs at it in his letters to himself, there had been no taking stock, no serious making of inventories, no retrospectives - though Bruno always seemed convinced he had achieved nothing. Work was unquestionably the thing that mattered most to Bruno, and he was ambitious enough to think mainly in terms of immortality, that is, of the pantheon of true colleagues, beyond the transient cafe of his peer group. But if he didn't realise how much work he had done, and much more importantly, how very good it mostly was, how well did he know himself? This is the central sadness of an early death: not just the time lost to make, but the time lost to acknowledge, to grasp that making.</p> <p>I think the dead would want us <br> To weep for what they have lost. <br>I think our luck in continuing <br>Is what would affect them most. <br>But time would find them generous <br> And less self-engrossed. <br>And time would find them generous <br>As they used to be <br>And what else would they want from us <br>But an honoured place in our memory, <br>A favourite room, a hallowed chair, <br>Privilege and celebrity? <br>And so the dead might cease to grieve <br>And we might make amends <br>And there might be a pact between <br>Dead friends and living friends. <br>What our dead friends would want from us <br>Would be such living friends.</p> <p><b>James Fenton, from For Andrew Wood</b></p> <p>I have taped to the large glass doors of the room where I work, some of the actual MRIs of Bruno's head, taken at the time of his brain tumour. They are familiar and strange. They are medical. Some of the black-and-white negatives are of the skull seen from above: the generic; neatly bifurcated walnut-shaped brain-squiggly white stuff encased in a bone egg. Others are taken in profile and evenly sliced in all directions. I would recognise that silhouette if I saw it for a split second on an escalator passing in the opposite direction. I know his head as I know my child's, I know it better than I know my own.</p> <p>But I don't know what those slices mean. I don't really know about the shadows and the cartoon concavities, about the Spiderman eye sockets with their thick perimeter of white (what is that? Is it normal?). You can really see the whitish smudge of the tumour, but what is all that grey matter we talk about it as if it were fabric, like the material of Anke's wedding dress, something we can see and describe and have a sense of, an opinion about either way. What is all that stuff beneath the familiar lip of his brow, a brow just like my own? Looking now at these MRIs, thinking back on that revelational first sampling of those stacks and stacks of paintings in Barcelona, I can't help thinking, who was he? He was the closest person to me and how well did I know him?</p> <p>This is of course the recognition that the work is not the same as the person, which sounds obvious but feels startling. We went to Barcelona because we wanted to be with all the Bruno there was ever going to be. It took me the next five years to accept that this was in fact another, and more awesome, him altogether. A second recognition came a little quicker: that the work was also the best of Bruno, the most \"him\" of him. This is true for every artist. It is this discovery that now accompanies Bruno, or rather his work, out into the world. Which is also to say that nothing of his biography matters at all. When after several years of agony and illness and the unwelcome and exhausting reckonings that were the bitterest of the many pills he had to swallow, Bruno died, my first thought was (as no doubt it was for so many others in the mythical support group), \"He's free.\" The same now seems freshly and unequivocally true of his work, separated, finally from its maker</p> <p><b> Extracted from Bruno Fonesca: The Secret Life of Painting by Alan Jenkins, Karen Wilkin and Isabel Fonseca. </b></p> <p>\u0095 To be published by Abbeville Press / John Murray Publishers on 9 November 2000 priced \u00a360 hardback, \u00a325 paperback. <br>Artwork \u00a9 2000 Estate of Bruno Fonseca <br>Dear Letter \u00a9 2000 Isabel Fonseca.</p>",

This is the central sadness of an early death: not just the time lost to make, but the time lost to acknowledge, to grasp that making. I think the dead would want us To weep for what they have lost. I think our luck in continuing Is what would affect them most. But time would find them generous And less self-engrossed. And time would find them generous As they used to be And what else would they want from us But an honoured place in our memory, A favourite room, a hallowed chair, Privilege and celebrity? And so the dead might cease to grieve And we might make amends And there might be a pact between Dead friends and living friends. What our dead friends would want from us Would be such living friends. James Fenton, from For Andrew Wood I have taped to the large glass doors of the room where I work, some of the actual MRIs of Bruno's head, taken at the time of his brain tumour. They are familiar and strange. They are medical. Some of the black-and-white negatives are of the skull seen from above: the generic; neatly bifurcated walnut-shaped brain-squiggly white stuff encased in a bone egg. Others are taken in profile and evenly sliced in all directions. I would recognise that silhouette if I saw it for a split second on an escalator passing in the opposite direction. I know his head as I know my child's, I know it better than I know my own. But I don't know what those slices mean. I don't really know about the shadows and the cartoon concavities, about the Spiderman eye sockets with their thick perimeter of white (what is that? Is it normal?). You can really see the whitish smudge of the tumour, but what is all that grey matter we talk about it as if it were fabric, like the material of Anke's wedding dress, something we can see and describe and have a sense of, an opinion about either way. What is all that stuff beneath the familiar lip of his brow, a brow just like my own? Looking now at these MRIs, thinking back on that revelational first sampling of those stacks and stacks of paintings in Barcelona, I can't help thinking, who was he? He was the closest person to me and how well did I know him? This is of course the recognition that the work is not the same as the person, which sounds obvious but feels startling. We went to Barcelona because we wanted to be with all the Bruno there was ever going to be. It took me the next five years to accept that this was in fact another, and more awesome, him altogether. A second recognition came a little quicker: that the work was also the best of Bruno, the most \"him\" of him. This is true for every artist. It is this discovery that now accompanies Bruno, or rather his work, out into the world. Which is also to say that nothing of his biography matters at all. When after several years of agony and illness and the unwelcome and exhausting reckonings that were the bitterest of the many pills he had to swallow, Bruno died, my first thought was (as no doubt it was for so many others in the mythical support group), \"He's free.\" The same now seems freshly and unequivocally true of his work, separated, finally from its maker Extracted from Bruno Fonesca: The Secret Life of Painting by Alan Jenkins, Karen Wilkin and Isabel Fonseca. \u0095 To be published by Abbeville Press / John Murray Publishers on 9 November 2000 priced \u00a360 hardback, \u00a325 paperback.

      "body": "<p>In the 16th century the Alps were as distant from the normal world as was the moon. To many they represented hell, combing the freezing conditions of a Nordic Niflheim , the Nordic mythological underworld, with, in summer, the roasting inferno of Christianity. Here was a realm whose upper reaches were, by all accounts, home to a race of malformed and malevolent sub-humans. The peaks above were inhabited by demons and witches were well attested. It was an undisputed fact that dragons lived in Alpine caves, ready to incinerate any who set foot above the snowline. By the late 18th century, however, scientific gentlemen began to turn their minds to these high places. What would the peaks tell us about the atmosphere, about weather, about glaciers? </p> <p>In the 19th century the British came on the scene, full of imperial confidence and set out to plant their flag on every peak in the Alps. The Matterhorn disaster of 1865 was one of those tragic events of which the Victorians were so fond and to which they were so prone. It ranked in popular imagination alongside Franklin's disappearance in the Arctic andLivingstone's death in Africa. It shaped the childhood perceptions of millions and it had, uniquely, a survivor who could describe it at first hand. Edward Whymper, who was only in his mid-20s at the time of the disaster, was bedevilled by it for the rest of his life </p> <p>On July 12 1865 Whymper, a printer and Alpinist, was in the small village of Breuil at the foot of the unconquered Matterhorn. He was woken with the news that an Italian party - led by the guide Jean-Antoine Carrel, whom Whymper thought he had hired to climb the mountain - had begun an ascent. </p> <p>Whymper was furious. He had been \"bamboozled and humbugged\". He snatched a telescope and peered through it. Yes, there was Carrel and his party, making their way up the lower slopes. But his group was large and unwieldy. It would take them three days to reach a position from which they could tackle the summit. If he moved fast, Whymper could be in Zermatt inside a day and, conditions willing, could be on the summit two days later. But he had no guide. Miraculously, Whymper was saved by the arrival of Lord Francis Douglas, an \"exceedingly amiable and talented\" 18-year-old whose brother, the Marquess of Queensberry, would later instigate the Oscar Wilde trial. </p> <p>Douglas was no stranger to daring exploits: he had scaled the walls of Edinburgh castle aged 14, and had swum the Hellespont aged 16. Although not an experienced mountaineer, he had done some fine climbing that season and had in tow Young Peter Taugwalder, namesake and son of Old Peter Taugwalder from Zermatt. </p> <p>Father and son had carved themselves a reputation for leading tourists up the easier slopes. Old Peter had reconnoitred the north-east ridge of the Matterhorn and was convinced, like Whymper, that it was surmountable. Whymper was immediately interested. Did Douglas truly want to climb the Matterhorn from Zermatt? Yes. Could Young Taugwalder carry their gear there? Douglas agreed and the next day the two Englishmen went down to the Monte Rosa hotel in Zermatt, where they instructed Old Peter Taugwalder to prepare for an immediate attack on the Matterhorn. </p> <p>The Rev Charles Hudson, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Douglas Hadow, were also staying in the Monte Rosa and were also planning to climb the Matterhorn. Whymper and Hudson agreed that it would be wasteful for two separate teams to go up the Matterhorn. Hudson, vicar of Skillington in Lincolnshire, was the glamorous face of British mountaineering. He was a handsome, cheerful man. Young women stuck his photograph in their albums, from where it smiled out romantically above a dashing signature. But at the same time he was entirely self-effacing. \"Although he had done the greatest mountaineering feats which have been done, he was the last to speak of his own doings.\" Hadow was a different proposition. He was 19, and it was his first season in the Alps. In such a large expedition, the group was dependent on its weakest member. Hadow was indisputably the weakest member. </p> <p>For Hudson and Whymper, the Matterhorn was so much easier than they had expected that, on the morning of July 13, they led the way, taking turns to hack steps in the ice while the guides hung back. When they made camp on a ledge at 11,000 feet they were almost delirious. Croz, an experienced guide, and Young Peter Taugwalder scouted ahead and returned with the news that there was \"not a difficulty, not a single difficulty!... We could have gone to the summit and returned today easily!\" Everybody went to bed in good spirits. The next day Whymper handed the lead to Croz. The rocks were testing in places, and extremely exposed, but Whymper thought it a lot easier than other climbs. He was worried, however, by Hadow, who \"was not accustomed to this kind of work and required continual assistance\". </p> <p>They went up and up, crossing 400 feet horizontally here, ascending 60 feet vertically there, then doubling back to a convenient ridge when their way was blocked. There was an awkward corner and finally they were there, separated from the summit by 200 feet of snow. \"The last doubt vanished!\" Whymper wrote, \"The Matterhorn was ours!\" Whymper ran along the ridge. Peering over the edge, he saw his Italian rivals some 1,250 feet below, crawling like ants up the hillside. He and Croz yelled and waved their arms, to no apparent effect. \"We must make them hear us; they shall hear us,\" Whymper cried. He seized a block of stone and hurled it down. Croz joined him and together they wrestled lumps of crag down the cliff. Whymper crowed: \"The Italians turned and fled.\" </p> <p>Then came the flag-planting. One of the tent poles had been removed that morning - against Whymper's protestation that they were tempting providence - and it was now embedded on the northern end of the ridge with Croz's shirt tied to it as a flag. It was visible from all directions. </p> <p>Down in Breuil, convinced that their group had succeeded, the inhabitants came out en fete, toasting Carrel, Italy and the Matterhorn. It was only when the dejected team arrived home that they learned their mistake. \"It is true,\" said the Italians. \"We saw them ourselves - they hurled stones at us! The old traditions are true - there are spirits on the top of the Matterhorn!\" </p> <p> Around 3pm on July 14, Hudson and Whymper agreed on their order of descent. While they were roping up, Whymper spent a last few minutes sketching the summit and then, darting back up to put their names in a bottle, he took his place in the chain. The adrenalin which had carried them to the top was gone, leaving them shaky-legged and exhausted. They took exaggerated care on the rocks they had bounded up so eagerly that morning. Hadow, who was the weariest of them all, had his feet guided into position by Croz. Their precautions were standard practice for any well guided party coming home after a new conquest, save for one important difference - although the leaders were tied to one of the stronger ropes, Old Peter and Douglas were linked by the weakest of the lot. </p> <p>Croz put his axe to one side so that he could assist Hadow on a tricky slope. What occurred next could only be guessed at. Whymper's theory was that Croz had helped Hadow into a safe position and had then turned round to pick up his ice axe. As he did so, Hadow slipped and knocked Croz over. Whymper did not see it happen, his view being blocked momentarily by a rock, but he witnessed every moment of the subsequent tragedy. </p> <p>\"I heard one startled exclamation from Croz, then saw him and Mr Hadow flying downwards; in another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps, and Lord F Douglas immediately after him. All this was the work of a moment. Immediately we heard Croz's exclamation, Old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit: the rope was taut between us and the jerk came on us both as one man. We held; but the rope broke midway between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. For a few seconds, we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downwards on their backs, and spread ing out their hands, endeavouring to save themselves. They passed from our sight uninjured, disappeared one by one, and fell from precipice to precipice on to the Matterhorngletscher below, a distance of nearly 4,000 feet. From the moment the rope broke, it was impossible to help them.\" </p> <p>Whymper and the two Taugwalders did not move for half an hour. Old Peter burst into tears. Young Peter cried, \"We are lost! We are lost!\" With difficulty Whymper persuaded Young Peter to leave his perch - they were still roped together and unless he moved they were stuck - then guided father and son back to Zermatt. They went down slowly and carefully, searching for their companions' bodies as they went, sometimes calling out in the vain hope that one of them might have survived. Whymper later wrote to a friend. \"For two hours after the accident I thought every moment that the next would be my last... the two guides were unnerved to such an extent that I suspected every minute one or the other would have slipped, and then it would have been all over.\" </p> <p>At 9.30pm, Whymper chose \"a wretched slab, barely large enough to hold the three\", on which to spend the night. Six hours later there was enough moonlight for them to continue the descent. They went down in silence, met the first chalets, and then ran all the way to Zermatt. Whymper burst into the Monte Rosa hotel and made for his room, pursued by an inquisitive landlord. As he closed the door he announced \"The Taugwalders and I have returned.\" </p> <p>The landlord roused the village and 20 men went on their way to the base of the north face. When they reached the scene they found Croz and Hadow lying next to each other on the snow, with Hudson some 50 yards distant. The bodies had been stripped almost naked during the fall and were so battered that they were barely recognisable - Croz was missing the top half of his head and was identified only by his beard and by a rosary cross. Of Douglas there was no trace, save a pair of gloves, a belt and a boot. His body had either caught on a ledge or had been shredded as it bounced from rock to rock. Apart from a single coat sleeve, nothing more was ever found of him. </p> <p>The news broke slowly, inaccurately and piecemeal. Whymper wrote a description of the tragedy in the visitors' book of the Monte Rosa, which was stolen almost immediately, but it was August 8 before he published a definitive account in the Times. Until then, wild rumours circulated that made Zermatt, briefly, the most famous place in Europe. Climbers from every nation rushed to the village, impelled by the desire to help, to offer condolences or simply to gawp. </p> <p>On July 19, the British consul in Geneva sent his chaplain to conduct a private inquiry and on July 21, Zermatt opened its own inquest. Midway through its deliberations, a wrenchingly ignorant telegram arrived from Douglas's mother, Lady Queensbury: \"Is it not possible to seek in the rocks above or to let down food?\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Whymper was giving his deposition to the local court. He told everything as it had happened and blamed the fall entirely on the use of the weak rope. Looking at the piece he had retained as evidence, the officials accepted his deposition without question. It was flimsy beyond belief and had clearly snapped. (Sections of all three ropes are preserved in Zermatt's Alpine museum. The one that broke is little thicker than a washing line.) The verdict was accidental death. </p> <p> What was not explained (or asked), however, was why the weak rope had been used in the first place. Whymper threw out diversionary leads, blaming Hudson for having allowed Hadow to be a member of the party and hinting at a conspiracy within Zermatt's judicial system. Hadow's father thought Whymper had gone too far in abrogating all responsibility. \"We have been greatly distressed at Mr Whymper's letter in the Times and the leading article which I was sure would follow,\" he wrote on August 10. \"He might have spared those unnecessary remarks about poor Hudson, which have brought blame on him for want of prudence and caution.\" Emily Hudson, Charles Hudson's wife, felt the same. Lurid reports were already circulating and she was angry that Whymper should have cast her husband as the wrongdoer. \"I cannot tell you how it has distressed me,\" she wrote. \"I am very much surprised that Mr Whymper should have been a party to it. Of course one knows the craving there is in the public mind for the sensational, in any form; but it really makes me sick to think of such a subject being used to gratify their tastes.\" </p> <p>Whymper was released from the inquest on July 22 1865 and came home to find himself the most talked-about person in London. A fellow Alpine club member wrote that he was \"most truly to be pitied, for his name is so connected with the Matterhorn, and rather wild designs upon it, that people are sure to blame him for the accident\". </p> <p>Until that year, fatalities in the Alps had been relatively rare, something for the exploring community to remark upon; after that date they became commonplace. In 1870 an entire party of 11, led by a Scot, the Rev G MacCorkendale, got lost in a blizzard and perished on Mont Blanc. The bodies of six of the climbers were never found. As the fatalities increased, Queen Victoria's private secretary wrote to prime minister Gladstone, \"The Queen commands me to ask you if you think she can say anything to mark her disapproval of the dangerous Alpine excursions which... have occasioned so much loss of life.\" </p> <p>The Matterhorn disaster shaped the remainder of Whymper's life. Never very sociable, he withdrew still further. According to his sister, \"his unfortunate habit of sleeplessness had become fixed, and he practically turned night into day\". His main preoccupation was writing up his journals for publication. But he did not stop exploring: he made two expeditions to Greenland, he climbed new peaks in the Andes and the Rockies and, his funds having been exhausted by these forays, wrote guidebooks to Zermatt and Chamonix. He received the Royal Geographical Society's gold medal and was proposed for - but was not granted - membership of the Royal Society. The disaster was a topic he returned to again and again in lecture halls, magazine articles and private correspondence for the 46 years until his death, but he seemed interested only in proving that he was not to blame. </p> <p>Whymper's relations with women had not been successful, but in 1899 he fell in love with Charlotte Hanbury, one of the few women climbers active in the Alps. She was 10 years his senior and died unexpectedly the following October. The news reached him just as he was starting a lecture tour in America. \"My beloved friend gone!\" he wrote to his sister. \"I hardly know how to carry on.\" </p> <p> His health began to deteriorate and he became prone to unexpected collapses that left him in a state of semi-consciousness. In 1905 a fall on a mountain path damaged several ribs; he received a severe blow to the head in a railway accident. \"My present condition is deplorable,\" he wrote in October. \"My memory has gone !... [I am] a Wreck without Brains.\" His memory returned but he was concerned that he was losing fitness and, when he visited Zermatt a few weeks after the crash, it appeared that he was losing his fame as well. It was freezing, nobody was there to greet him and the hotels were full: he drew together two station benches and slept on them under a rug. </p> <p>The next year, at the age of 66, he married Edith Mary Lewin of Forest Gate, London. She was 45 years younger than him. The wedding was a grisly occasion, conducted in great secrecy. At the wedding breakfast it took half an hour's persuasion before Whymper could be dragged out of his bedroom. McCormick, the presiding vicar, gave a leery address about the difference in their ages. When the wedding was over, Whymper told his nephew, the only member of his family invited to the ceremony, to search the guests in case they had stolen the silver. </p> <p>The union did not last. The couple had a daughter and divorced in 1910. The separation was bitter. \"Her sole aim is money,\" he wrote to his sister. He sold his house, his books and even his climbing equipment to stay financially afloat. The following year he visited Zermatt, from where he went to Geneva and then up to Chamonix. It was to be his last Alpine scramble, and perhaps he knew it. </p> <p>At Chamonix he checked into a hotel where the staff were accustomed to his preference for being left alone. He visited a few bookshops and made arrangements to help find the corpses from the 1870 Mont Blanc disaster which were expected soon to emerge from the glacier. Then, suddenly, went back to his hotel and locked himself into his room. During the next two days, Whymper died. The whole village turned out to watch his funeral. </p> <p>All the great mountains were subsequently conquered one by one, by insouciant public schoolboys and dogged tradesmen alike. By the end of the second world war the Alps had changed irrevocably. Ski resorts proliferated as entrepreneurs devoured the empty spaces. </p> <p>Gradients were bulldozed and forests were cut down to create pistes. Ropes were pinned to the Matterhorn to make life easier for those wishing to conquer the Big Rock. This well-groomed wilderness was no place for dragons. Yet its upper levels retained a strange fascination. Climbers still strode across passes, clambered over glaciers and struggled with dangerous new routes. Far fewer in number than the thousands who rushed to the Alps every winter, they preserved a glimmer of the old romance. Like their predecessors, they were trespassers in a hostile environment; they were adventurers in an old tradition. </p> <p>\u0095 Adapted from Killing Dragons: the Conquest of the Alps by Fergus Fleming (Granta, \u00a320).

It ranked in popular imagination alongside Franklin's disappearance in the Arctic andLivingstone's death in Africa. It shaped the childhood perceptions of millions and it had, uniquely, a survivor who could describe it at first hand. Edward Whymper, who was only in his mid-20s at the time of the disaster, was bedevilled by it for the rest of his life On July 12 1865 Whymper, a printer and Alpinist, was in the small village of Breuil at the foot of the unconquered Matterhorn. He was woken with the news that an Italian party - led by the guide Jean-Antoine Carrel, whom Whymper thought he had hired to climb the mountain - had begun an ascent. Whymper was furious. He had been \"bamboozled and humbugged\". He snatched a telescope and peered through it. Yes, there was Carrel and his party, making their way up the lower slopes. But his group was large and unwieldy. It would take them three days to reach a position from which they could tackle the summit. If he moved fast, Whymper could be in Zermatt inside a day and, conditions willing, could be on the summit two days later. But he had no guide. Miraculously, Whymper was saved by the arrival of Lord Francis Douglas, an \"exceedingly amiable and talented\" 18-year-old whose brother, the Marquess of Queensberry, would later instigate the Oscar Wilde trial. Douglas was no stranger to daring exploits: he had scaled the walls of Edinburgh castle aged 14, and had swum the Hellespont aged 16. Although not an experienced mountaineer, he had done some fine climbing that season and had in tow Young Peter Taugwalder, namesake and son of Old Peter Taugwalder from Zermatt. Father and son had carved themselves a reputation for leading tourists up the easier slopes. Old Peter had reconnoitred the north-east ridge of the Matterhorn and was convinced, like Whymper, that it was surmountable. Whymper was immediately interested. Did Douglas truly want to climb the Matterhorn from Zermatt? Yes. Could Young Taugwalder carry their gear there? Douglas agreed and the next day the two Englishmen went down to the Monte Rosa hotel in Zermatt, where they instructed Old Peter Taugwalder to prepare for an immediate attack on the Matterhorn. The Rev Charles Hudson, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Douglas Hadow, were also staying in the Monte Rosa and were also planning to climb the Matterhorn. Whymper and Hudson agreed that it would be wasteful for two separate teams to go up the Matterhorn. Hudson, vicar of Skillington in Lincolnshire, was the glamorous face of British mountaineering. He was a handsome, cheerful man. Young women stuck his photograph in their albums, from where it smiled out romantically above a dashing signature. But at the same time he was entirely self-effacing. \"Although he had done the greatest mountaineering feats which have been done, he was the last to speak of his own doings.\" Hadow was a different proposition. He was 19, and it was his first season in the Alps. In such a large expedition, the group was dependent on its weakest member. Hadow was indisputably the weakest member. For Hudson and Whymper, the Matterhorn was so much easier than they had expected that, on the morning of July 13, they led the way, taking turns to hack steps in the ice while the guides hung back. When they made camp on a ledge at 11,000 feet they were almost delirious. Croz, an experienced guide, and Young Peter Taugwalder scouted ahead and returned with the news that there was \"not a difficulty, not a single difficulty!... We could have gone to the summit and returned today easily!\" Everybody went to bed in good spirits. The next day Whymper handed the lead to Croz. The rocks were testing in places, and extremely exposed, but Whymper thought it a lot easier than other climbs. He was worried, however, by Hadow, who \"was not accustomed to this kind of work and required continual assistance\". They went up and up, crossing 400 feet horizontally here, ascending 60 feet vertically there, then doubling back to a convenient ridge when their way was blocked. There was an awkward corner and finally they were there, separated from the summit by 200 feet of snow. \"The last doubt vanished!\" Whymper wrote, \"The Matterhorn was ours!\" Whymper ran along the ridge. Peering over the edge, he saw his Italian rivals some 1,250 feet below, crawling like ants up the hillside. He and Croz yelled and waved their arms, to no apparent effect. \"We must make them hear us; they shall hear us,\" Whymper cried. He seized a block of stone and hurled it down. Croz joined him and together they wrestled lumps of crag down the cliff. Whymper crowed: \"The Italians turned and fled.\" Then came the flag-planting. One of the tent poles had been removed that morning - against Whymper's protestation that they were tempting providence - and it was now embedded on the northern end of the ridge with Croz's shirt tied to it as a flag. It was visible from all directions. Down in Breuil, convinced that their group had succeeded, the inhabitants came out en fete, toasting Carrel, Italy and the Matterhorn. It was only when the dejected team arrived home that they learned their mistake. \"It is true,\" said the Italians. \"We saw them ourselves - they hurled stones at us! The old traditions are true - there are spirits on the top of the Matterhorn!\" Around 3pm on July 14, Hudson and Whymper agreed on their order of descent. While they were roping up, Whymper spent a last few minutes sketching the summit and then, darting back up to put their names in a bottle, he took his place in the chain. The adrenalin which had carried them to the top was gone, leaving them shaky-legged and exhausted. They took exaggerated care on the rocks they had bounded up so eagerly that morning. Hadow, who was the weariest of them all, had his feet guided into position by Croz. Their precautions were standard practice for any well guided party coming home after a new conquest, save for one important difference - although the leaders were tied to one of the stronger ropes, Old Peter and Douglas were linked by the weakest of the lot. Croz put his axe to one side so that he could assist Hadow on a tricky slope. What occurred next could only be guessed at. Whymper's theory was that Croz had helped Hadow into a safe position and had then turned round to pick up his ice axe. As he did so, Hadow slipped and knocked Croz over. Whymper did not see it happen, his view being blocked momentarily by a rock, but he witnessed every moment of the subsequent tragedy. \"I heard one startled exclamation from Croz, then saw him and Mr Hadow flying downwards; in another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps, and Lord F Douglas immediately after him. All this was the work of a moment. Immediately we heard Croz's exclamation, Old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit: the rope was taut between us and the jerk came on us both as one man. We held; but the rope broke midway between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. For a few seconds, we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downwards on their backs, and spread ing out their hands, endeavouring to save themselves. They passed from our sight uninjured, disappeared one by one, and fell from precipice to precipice on to the Matterhorngletscher below, a distance of nearly 4,000 feet. From the moment the rope broke, it was impossible to help them.\" Whymper and the two Taugwalders did not move for half an hour. Old Peter burst into tears. Young Peter cried, \"We are lost! We are lost!\" With difficulty Whymper persuaded Young Peter to leave his perch - they were still roped together and unless he moved they were stuck - then guided father and son back to Zermatt. They went down slowly and carefully, searching for their companions' bodies as they went, sometimes calling out in the vain hope that one of them might have survived. Whymper later wrote to a friend. \"For two hours after the accident I thought every moment that the next would be my last... the two guides were unnerved to such an extent that I suspected every minute one or the other would have slipped, and then it would have been all over.\" At 9.30pm, Whymper chose \"a wretched slab, barely large enough to hold the three\", on which to spend the night. Six hours later there was enough moonlight for them to continue the descent. They went down in silence, met the first chalets, and then ran all the way to Zermatt. Whymper burst into the Monte Rosa hotel and made for his room, pursued by an inquisitive landlord. As he closed the door he announced \"The Taugwalders and I have returned.\" The landlord roused the village and 20 men went on their way to the base of the north face. When they reached the scene they found Croz and Hadow lying next to each other on the snow, with Hudson some 50 yards distant. The bodies had been stripped almost naked during the fall and were so battered that they were barely recognisable - Croz was missing the top half of his head and was identified only by his beard and by a rosary cross. Of Douglas there was no trace, save a pair of gloves, a belt and a boot. His body had either caught on a ledge or had been shredded as it bounced from rock to rock. Apart from a single coat sleeve, nothing more was ever found of him. The news broke slowly, inaccurately and piecemeal. Whymper wrote a description of the tragedy in the visitors' book of the Monte Rosa, which was stolen almost immediately, but it was August 8 before he published a definitive account in the Times. Until then, wild rumours circulated that made Zermatt, briefly, the most famous place in Europe. Climbers from every nation rushed to the village, impelled by the desire to help, to offer condolences or simply to gawp. On July 19, the British consul in Geneva sent his chaplain to conduct a private inquiry and on July 21, Zermatt opened its own inquest. Midway through its deliberations, a wrenchingly ignorant telegram arrived from Douglas's mother, Lady Queensbury: \"Is it not possible to seek in the rocks above or to let down food?\" Meanwhile, Whymper was giving his deposition to the local court. He told everything as it had happened and blamed the fall entirely on the use of the weak rope. Looking at the piece he had retained as evidence, the officials accepted his deposition without question. It was flimsy beyond belief and had clearly snapped. (Sections of all three ropes are preserved in Zermatt's Alpine museum. The one that broke is little thicker than a washing line.) The verdict was accidental death. What was not explained (or asked), however, was why the weak rope had been used in the first place. Whymper threw out diversionary leads, blaming Hudson for having allowed Hadow to be a member of the party and hinting at a conspiracy within Zermatt's judicial system. Hadow's father thought Whymper had gone too far in abrogating all responsibility. \"We have been greatly distressed at Mr Whymper's letter in the Times and the leading article which I was sure would follow,\" he wrote on August 10. \"He might have spared those unnecessary remarks about poor Hudson, which have brought blame on him for want of prudence and caution.\" Emily Hudson, Charles Hudson's wife, felt the same. Lurid reports were already circulating and she was angry that Whymper should have cast her husband as the wrongdoer. \"I cannot tell you how it has distressed me,\" she wrote. \"I am very much surprised that Mr Whymper should have been a party to it. Of course one knows the craving there is in the public mind for the sensational, in any form; but it really makes me sick to think of such a subject being used to gratify their tastes.\" Whymper was released from the inquest on July 22 1865 and came home to find himself the most talked-about person in London. A fellow Alpine club member wrote that he was \"most truly to be pitied, for his name is so connected with the Matterhorn, and rather wild designs upon it, that people are sure to blame him for the accident\". Until that year, fatalities in the Alps had been relatively rare, something for the exploring community to remark upon; after that date they became commonplace. In 1870 an entire party of 11, led by a Scot, the Rev G MacCorkendale, got lost in a blizzard and perished on Mont Blanc. The bodies of six of the climbers were never found. As the fatalities increased, Queen Victoria's private secretary wrote to prime minister Gladstone, \"The Queen commands me to ask you if you think she can say anything to mark her disapproval of the dangerous Alpine excursions which... have occasioned so much loss of life.\" The Matterhorn disaster shaped the remainder of Whymper's life. Never very sociable, he withdrew still further. According to his sister, \"his unfortunate habit of sleeplessness had become fixed, and he practically turned night into day\". His main preoccupation was writing up his journals for publication. But he did not stop exploring: he made two expeditions to Greenland, he climbed new peaks in the Andes and the Rockies and, his funds having been exhausted by these forays, wrote guidebooks to Zermatt and Chamonix. He received the Royal Geographical Society's gold medal and was proposed for - but was not granted - membership of the Royal Society. The disaster was a topic he returned to again and again in lecture halls, magazine articles and private correspondence for the 46 years until his death, but he seemed interested only in proving that he was not to blame. Whymper's relations with women had not been successful, but in 1899 he fell in love with Charlotte Hanbury, one of the few women climbers active in the Alps. She was 10 years his senior and died unexpectedly the following October. The news reached him just as he was starting a lecture tour in America. \"My beloved friend gone!\" he wrote to his sister. \"I hardly know how to carry on.\" His health began to deteriorate and he became prone to unexpected collapses that left him in a state of semi-consciousness. In 1905 a fall on a mountain path damaged several ribs; he received a severe blow to the head in a railway accident. \"My present condition is deplorable,\" he wrote in October. \"My memory has gone !... [I am] a Wreck without Brains.\" His memory returned but he was concerned that he was losing fitness and, when he visited Zermatt a few weeks after the crash, it appeared that he was losing his fame as well. It was freezing, nobody was there to greet him and the hotels were full: he drew together two station benches and slept on them under a rug. The next year, at the age of 66, he married Edith Mary Lewin of Forest Gate, London. She was 45 years younger than him. The wedding was a grisly occasion, conducted in great secrecy. At the wedding breakfast it took half an hour's persuasion before Whymper could be dragged out of his bedroom. McCormick, the presiding vicar, gave a leery address about the difference in their ages. When the wedding was over, Whymper told his nephew, the only member of his family invited to the ceremony, to search the guests in case they had stolen the silver. The union did not last. The couple had a daughter and divorced in 1910. The separation was bitter. \"Her sole aim is money,\" he wrote to his sister. He sold his house, his books and even his climbing equipment to stay financially afloat. The following year he visited Zermatt, from where he went to Geneva and then up to Chamonix. It was to be his last Alpine scramble, and perhaps he knew it. At Chamonix he checked into a hotel where the staff were accustomed to his preference for being left alone. He visited a few bookshops and made arrangements to help find the corpses from the 1870 Mont Blanc disaster which were expected soon to emerge from the glacier. Then, suddenly, went back to his hotel and locked himself into his room. During the next two days, Whymper died. The whole village turned out to watch his funeral. All the great mountains were subsequently conquered one by one, by insouciant public schoolboys and dogged tradesmen alike. By the end of the second world war the Alps had changed irrevocably. Ski resorts proliferated as entrepreneurs devoured the empty spaces. Gradients were bulldozed and forests were cut down to create pistes. Ropes were pinned to the Matterhorn to make life easier for those wishing to conquer the Big Rock. This well-groomed wilderness was no place for dragons. Yet its upper levels retained a strange fascination. Climbers still strode across passes, clambered over glaciers and struggled with dangerous new routes. Far fewer in number than the thousands who rushed to the Alps every winter, they preserved a glimmer of the old romance. Like their predecessors, they were trespassers in a hostile environment; they were adventurers in an old tradition. \u0095 Adapted from Killing Dragons: the Conquest of the Alps by Fergus Fleming (Granta, \u00a320).

While it appears under an academic imprint, it seems as though the author is not exactly following the brief that his discipline would suggest. Herzog teaches law and political philosophy at the University of Michigan; but he appears to have written a book about British politics, prejudices and manners between 1790 and 1830. Moreover, he has done so with a scholarly thoroughness that one would not have suspected from someone writing, so to speak, left-handedly. </p> <p>But an air of carnival infects his book. His subject may seem dry, but he handles it with almost mischievous \u00e9lan. And this subject? Largely, the beginnings of modern conservatism; and particularly as it manifests itself in reaction to the French Revolution. We have a parade of all the gargoyles of the day getting themselves into a lather about the number and influence of new-fangled newspapers; the inadvisability of people from the working classes discussing politics in coffeehouses and (worse) alehouses; the question of whether Jews, blacks and women were to be admitted into the thinking classes, or indeed even the human classes. </p> <p>Herzog reminds us of some uncomfortable facts. Cobbett, the radical, was offensively anti-negro, even by the standards of the day; whereas Johnson, the Tory, could see no justification for discrimination on the basis of skin colour. Byron was disgustingly anti-semitic, as was, indeed, the whole culture: \"Eager vocalists turning to The Universal Songster could learn the words to some fifty songs featuring Jews, among them the ever memorable ... 'The Jew Pedlar Selling a Pig, 'Jabesh Ham; or, the Catastrophe of a Pork-Chop Dinner', and 'De Chinkling of de Cash'. Somehow these aren't the sort of deep sea treasures that surface when social historians want to wax romantic about popular culture.\" This is not cut-and-dried partisan history. Look at the swipe he gives EP Thompson, for instance. </p> <p>Herzog's tone is sceptical, constructively flippant, mordant - and, above all, readable. He is even more fun to read than our own Roy Porter, a social historian who has crossed over into a relatively widespread readership. Herzog deserves the same, and if he is a bit too fond of the word \"squelched\", as in what usually happens to human rights, we can forgive him that in the wider scheme of things. </p> <p>What makes this book truly special is the way that you can start thinking \"that reminds me of something ...\" without Herzog's having had to spell it out at all, or even hint at it. The patrician concern about the proliferation of newspapers is echoed in today's reactions to the internet; the justifications for state secrecy and misinformation are as alive now, with the persecution of David Shayler and others, as they were then; and stirring up the mob for illiberal, if not sinister, purposes, is something that we should research with the impending fuel blockade in mind. </p> <p>That Herzog allows these connections to form without the slightest nudge on his part is something almost magical. I know that many people out there would rather eat one of their own feet than read a supposedly academic work like this; but do give it a go. You'll find it's worth it.</p>",

Herzog teaches law and political philosophy at the University of Michigan; but he appears to have written a book about British politics, prejudices and manners between 1790 and 1830. Moreover, he has done so with a scholarly thoroughness that one would not have suspected from someone writing, so to speak, left-handedly. But an air of carnival infects his book. His subject may seem dry, but he handles it with almost mischievous \u00e9lan. And this subject? Largely, the beginnings of modern conservatism; and particularly as it manifests itself in reaction to the French Revolution. We have a parade of all the gargoyles of the day getting themselves into a lather about the number and influence of new-fangled newspapers; the inadvisability of people from the working classes discussing politics in coffeehouses and (worse) alehouses; the question of whether Jews, blacks and women were to be admitted into the thinking classes, or indeed even the human classes. Herzog reminds us of some uncomfortable facts. Cobbett, the radical, was offensively anti-negro, even by the standards of the day; whereas Johnson, the Tory, could see no justification for discrimination on the basis of skin colour. Byron was disgustingly anti-semitic, as was, indeed, the whole culture: \"Eager vocalists turning to The Universal Songster could learn the words to some fifty songs featuring Jews, among them the ever memorable ... 'The Jew Pedlar Selling a Pig, 'Jabesh Ham; or, the Catastrophe of a Pork-Chop Dinner', and 'De Chinkling of de Cash'. Somehow these aren't the sort of deep sea treasures that surface when social historians want to wax romantic about popular culture.\" This is not cut-and-dried partisan history. Look at the swipe he gives EP Thompson, for instance. Herzog's tone is sceptical, constructively flippant, mordant - and, above all, readable. He is even more fun to read than our own Roy Porter, a social historian who has crossed over into a relatively widespread readership. Herzog deserves the same, and if he is a bit too fond of the word \"squelched\", as in what usually happens to human rights, we can forgive him that in the wider scheme of things. What makes this book truly special is the way that you can start thinking \"that reminds me of something ...\" without Herzog's having had to spell it out at all, or even hint at it. The patrician concern about the proliferation of newspapers is echoed in today's reactions to the internet; the justifications for state secrecy and misinformation are as alive now, with the persecution of David Shayler and others, as they were then; and stirring up the mob for illiberal, if not sinister, purposes, is something that we should research with the impending fuel blockade in mind. That Herzog allows these connections to form without the slightest nudge on his part is something almost magical. I know that many people out there would rather eat one of their own feet than read a supposedly academic work like this; but do give it a go. You'll find it's worth it.",

      "body": "<p>In 1985 Kinky Friedman was a failing country-and-western singer, bearings lost in a blizzard of cocaine. \"A lot of my friends were dying of drugs,\" he recalls. \"I was doing enough Peruvian marching powder to decorate a large nativity scene, and my career was tanking. No one wanted to book me.\" </p> <p>One of Friedman's heroes, Hank Williams, had gone through the same mill three decades before: \"He'd had a string of number one hits, yet nobody would book him because he was a drunken idiot who would never show up or would fall off the stage.\" </p> <p>Williams went to Jesus full of whiskey and morphine in the back of a speeding Cadillac one New Year's Day. \"But I didn't have a perfectly timed country-music death,\" Friedman says. Instead, he latched onto a remark made by his sister Marcie: since he was so fond of detective stories, why not write one? </p> <p>That was 15 years ago, and Friedman's first novel, Greenwich Killing Time, has been followed by 12 others. He has kicked the nose candy and is now published in more than a dozen countries. His fans include Bill Clinton, who asked him to write more books - \"I need the laughs\" - and tried to fix up a Hollywood deal for him. </p> <p>Friedman didn't look far to find the character who animates all his novels. Both he and his amateur detective are Jewish Texans with dodgy 'taches and an unhealthy attachment to cowboy hats. Both love animals and cigars and once fronted country bands. Both show an immaturity about women and gays that seems more like wind-up than genuine attitude. Both are relentless, often irritating wisecrackers. \"I'm good for about three minutes of superficial charm,\" Friedman admits, \"then it begins to go downhill.\" Oh, and both go by the name of Richard \"Kinky\" Friedman. The K-word apparently refers to their hair. </p> <p>\"I wrote the first book using my own name, but planned to change the details before sending it to a publisher,\" he explains. But then he thought: \"Jesus, you got a name like Kinky Friedman, you really ought to run with it.\" </p> <p>For good measure, Friedman stuck in friends, family, other members of his old band, the Texas Jewboys, the family ranch in the Lone Star State, his temporary home in the Big Apple, his cokehead past, the women he had the hots for and, most memorably, his beloved cat Cuddles. Most gave him permission to use their names; Cuddles seems to have declined, as she is referred to only as \"the cat\". </p> <p>Friedman, 55, will never rival Agatha Christie for suspense or obfuscation. He may initially interest you in a murder or disappearance, but by the time his blundering alter ego has solved the case, you probably won't give a damn. He readily admits that his latest novel, The Mile High Club, \"is one of the few books I've written that has a plot\". </p> <p>But none of that matters. For a thoroughgoing smartass, \"the Kinkster\" is surprisingly vulnerable and open to beauty. The Mile High Club finds him paraphrasing Oscar Wilde's The Happy Prince for his feline friend. \"It takes a brilliant and troubled homosexual poet,\" he comments, \"to write a story about a statue and a bird that is so beautiful it can reach across an ocean and a century just to touch a man and a cat.\" </p> <p>There was the same mix of crassness and sensitivity in the songs Friedman wrote for the Texas Jewboys. They ranged from Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed, for which the National Organisation of Women named him male chauvinist pig of the year, to Rapid City, South Dakota, perhaps the first country song to touch on abortion, and the Holocaust spiritual Ride 'Em Jewboy. </p> <p>Friedman's novels combine a rough affection for his old chums with a general suspicion of humanity. Perhaps it dates back to that mid-1980s crisis; perhaps it's the result of being born \"the bastard son of two races\" - a Jew in America's most redneck state. Anyway, he says, \"People always let you down, as Jesus found out. And Van Gogh. And Mozart. And Anne Frank. And Oscar Wilde. Five of my heroes, all of whom died in paupers' graves, or no graves at all.\" </p> <p>Animals alone get unconditional love. The Texas ranch where he now lives is home to several dogs, a cat and an armadillo named Dilly, which surfaced in the novel Armadillos and Old Lace . He still writes about Cuddles, though she had to be put down in 1993. \"She was as close to me as any human being I have ever known,\" he declared in the epilogue to Elvis, Jesus and Coca-Cola . \"I dug her grave with a silver spade, in the little garden by the stream behind the old green trailer where both of us lived in summertime. Her burial shroud was my old New York sweatshirt and in the grave with her is a can of tuna and a cigar.\" </p> <p>As Friedman's writing career has taken off, so has his music. Willie Nelson, Tom Waits, Dwight Yoakam and Lyle Lovett covered his songs in a tribute album last year, and he's now in the middle of a European tour. \"Music is fun now that I don't have to do it,\" he says wryly. </p> <p>Even so, time may be running out for the character that gave Kinky Friedman his second chance at fame. \"I've written 15 books about the Kinkster now, including a couple that are not yet published. Perhaps it's time to try something different. So I'm seriously thinking of killing him off in a kind of Reichenbach Falls suicide.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> In Defence of TS Eliot </strong></p> <p> Craig Raine</p> <p> 516pp, Picador</p> <p> \u00a320 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501004063,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> As a poet the youngish Craig Raine was on fire, metaphorically speaking. With their \"shark-infested\" rose stems and dogs grinning \"like Yale keys\", the first simile-fuelled instalments of his Collected Poems (Picador, \u00a325) - The Onion, Memory and A Martian Sends a Postcard Home - have lost none of their capacity to astonish. This is all the more impressive given that Martian ingredients have since become staple parts of the national poetic diet. Raine played an executive role in this: taking up TS Eliot's old job as head chef at Faber, he became an acknowledged legislator of the way British poetry should be cooked. </p> <p>Raine has also been a trenchant and busy critic. In Defence of TS Eliot, his second haul of literary essays, comes without any contextualising intro (or outro, for that matter: no index, no notes about where the pieces first appeared); this brusque lack of preliminaries suggests that the talents exercised here need no introduction. If a poem is \"a handwritten manuscript\", the critic's task is \"to set it up in clear, readable type\". Given the image-richness of Raine's poetry, one might have expected his criticism to display more of \"the talent for metaphorical encapsulation\" he admires in Hopkins. Orwell's \"draught-excluder moustache\" makes a cameo appearance, but as a critic Raine is more concerned with diligence than brilliance. Texts are examined with forensic scrutiny, especially when previous investigators are suspected of tampering with the evidence by trimming quotations. This is painstakingly done in his defence of Eliot (though the amount of energy spent cross-examining his Oxford cronies James Fenton and Tom Paulin has the side effect of making Eliot's anti-semitism seem a strangely local issue). </p> <p>Eliot warned that the poet-critic is always trying to defend his own output, and Raine, naturally, pounces on writers lacking his own high degree of linguistic resolution and independence. The citizenly impulse behind these arresting critical interventions is usually commendable. One gets the impression of a man simmering in long silence, coming reluctantly to the boil because someone has to speak up and point out exactly how far Bruce Chatwin, Toni Morrison, Edmund White (\"can't write\") and Paul Auster (\"poisoned with clich\u00e9s\") fall short of their reputations. Raine is right to damn much of Joseph Brodsky's output, but his failure explicitly to exempt A Part of Speech from this judgment indicates a willingness to fudge in the interest of polemical cudgelling. Yes, phrases like \"on the whole\" and \"to say the least\" are \"incessantly deployed in Brodsky's poetry and prose\", but these ostensibly redundant parts of speech act like springs, coiled with imaginative force subsequently released. </p> <p>It is the assertion that as a thinker Brodsky is \"by turns fatuous and banal\" that is most telling. Raine twice quotes Eliot's admiring observation that Henry James possessed \"a mind so fine that no idea could violate it\". This question of ideas is central to any discussion of Raine and his position in English letters. As mediated by Raine, Eliot's subtle remark is used - coarsely - to suggest that a preoccupation with ideas is a symptom of artistic coarseness. Critical of Orwell for his \"approximations\", in thrall to the imperious precision and verve of Nabokov, Raine champions the exacting style of wordplay at which he was national champ. Thought, in this event, is something like - or, as Raine in professorial mode cannot resist putting it, \"cognate with\" - a knack for setting and solving your own crosswords. Sharing Nabokov's impatience with perceived woolliness, Raine shows how fuzzy the Nabokovian vision becomes when required to look up from and beyond the page. </p> <p>Auden liked juggling with words but, for Raine, was \"easily infatuated\" by ideas, constantly \"indulging his weakness for notions\". The notion that writers should not have notions is a pretty weak one, but towards the end of his Auden essay Raine comes straight out and - echoing a favourite bleat of John Carey's - declares: \"We need ideas, but not in our art.\" This belief - and it is hard not to think of Oxford as its heartland - is a serious blot on the English literary landscape. It means we have tended to rely on exotic foreign imports (Borges, Calvino, Kundera and, most recently, Sebald) to do the idea stuff for us, thereby - the parallel with football is irresistible -impoverishing the development of the domestic game. The corollary of this is that someone like Chatwin, who had a few (half-baked) ideas, is radically overvalued almost as a compensatory reflex. </p> <p>Compare the relative reputations of EM Forster and Rebecca West, who described the former as \"a self-indulgent old liberal with hardly a brain in his head\", and you see the extent to which assumptions about literary form conform to what is little more than a prejudice masquerading as refinement.

      "bodyText": "In Defence of TS Eliot Craig Raine 516pp, Picador \u00a320 Buy it at BOL As a poet the youngish Craig Raine was on fire, metaphorically speaking. With their \"shark-infested\" rose stems and dogs grinning \"like Yale keys\", the first simile-fuelled instalments of his Collected Poems (Picador, \u00a325) - The Onion, Memory and A Martian Sends a Postcard Home - have lost none of their capacity to astonish. This is all the more impressive given that Martian ingredients have since become staple parts of the national poetic diet. Raine played an executive role in this: taking up TS Eliot's old job as head chef at Faber, he became an acknowledged legislator of the way British poetry should be cooked. Raine has also been a trenchant and busy critic. In Defence of TS Eliot, his second haul of literary essays, comes without any contextualising intro (or outro, for that matter: no index, no notes about where the pieces first appeared); this brusque lack of preliminaries suggests that the talents exercised here need no introduction. If a poem is \"a handwritten manuscript\", the critic's task is \"to set it up in clear, readable type\". Given the image-richness of Raine's poetry, one might have expected his criticism to display more of \"the talent for metaphorical encapsulation\" he admires in Hopkins. Orwell's \"draught-excluder moustache\" makes a cameo appearance, but as a critic Raine is more concerned with diligence than brilliance. Texts are examined with forensic scrutiny, especially when previous investigators are suspected of tampering with the evidence by trimming quotations. This is painstakingly done in his defence of Eliot (though the amount of energy spent cross-examining his Oxford cronies James Fenton and Tom Paulin has the side effect of making Eliot's anti-semitism seem a strangely local issue). Eliot warned that the poet-critic is always trying to defend his own output, and Raine, naturally, pounces on writers lacking his own high degree of linguistic resolution and independence. The citizenly impulse behind these arresting critical interventions is usually commendable. One gets the impression of a man simmering in long silence, coming reluctantly to the boil because someone has to speak up and point out exactly how far Bruce Chatwin, Toni Morrison, Edmund White (\"can't write\") and Paul Auster (\"poisoned with clich\u00e9s\") fall short of their reputations. Raine is right to damn much of Joseph Brodsky's output, but his failure explicitly to exempt A Part of Speech from this judgment indicates a willingness to fudge in the interest of polemical cudgelling. Yes, phrases like \"on the whole\" and \"to say the least\" are \"incessantly deployed in Brodsky's poetry and prose\", but these ostensibly redundant parts of speech act like springs, coiled with imaginative force subsequently released. It is the assertion that as a thinker Brodsky is \"by turns fatuous and banal\" that is most telling. Raine twice quotes Eliot's admiring observation that Henry James possessed \"a mind so fine that no idea could violate it\". This question of ideas is central to any discussion of Raine and his position in English letters. As mediated by Raine, Eliot's subtle remark is used - coarsely - to suggest that a preoccupation with ideas is a symptom of artistic coarseness. Critical of Orwell for his \"approximations\", in thrall to the imperious precision and verve of Nabokov, Raine champions the exacting style of wordplay at which he was national champ. Thought, in this event, is something like - or, as Raine in professorial mode cannot resist putting it, \"cognate with\" - a knack for setting and solving your own crosswords. Sharing Nabokov's impatience with perceived woolliness, Raine shows how fuzzy the Nabokovian vision becomes when required to look up from and beyond the page. Auden liked juggling with words but, for Raine, was \"easily infatuated\" by ideas, constantly \"indulging his weakness for notions\". The notion that writers should not have notions is a pretty weak one, but towards the end of his Auden essay Raine comes straight out and - echoing a favourite bleat of John Carey's - declares: \"We need ideas, but not in our art.\" This belief - and it is hard not to think of Oxford as its heartland - is a serious blot on the English literary landscape. It means we have tended to rely on exotic foreign imports (Borges, Calvino, Kundera and, most recently, Sebald) to do the idea stuff for us, thereby - the parallel with football is irresistible -impoverishing the development of the domestic game. The corollary of this is that someone like Chatwin, who had a few (half-baked) ideas, is radically overvalued almost as a compensatory reflex. Compare the relative reputations of EM Forster and Rebecca West, who described the former as \"a self-indulgent old liberal with hardly a brain in his head\", and you see the extent to which assumptions about literary form conform to what is little more than a prejudice masquerading as refinement. To put it crudely: the minor Where Angels Fear to Tread basks in its uncontested status as a work of art, while Black Lamb and Grey Falcon , one of the great books of the century, is, well, an ungainly history of Yugoslavia or something. In her teens, West was drawn to Ibsen, who \"corrected the chief flaw in English literature, which is a failure to recognise the dynamism of ideas\". Characteristically, she later declared that he \"cried out for ideas for the same reason that men cry out for water, because he had not got any\", but the point still stands: \"That ideas are the symbols of real relationships among real forces that make people late for breakfast, that take away their breakfast, that make them beat each other across the breakfast table, is something which the English do not like to realise.\" Raine, the author of the poem \"Bed and Breakfast\", would do well to give this some ...

And with some reason: for more than 10 years, certainly from 1890 to 1900, what you thought about Wilde was a reliable indicator of what you thought and felt about a whole range of emotive issues, ranging from specifics such as sodomy, interior decoration and the West End to more obscure yet fundamental notions of cultural and personal identity. His rise and fall made a front-page drama out of the meanings of masculinity and effeminacy, respectability and fashion, and modernity itself. This symbolic status has not faded over the intervening 100 years. Wilde has continued to function as a kind of cultural litmus test, his name a shorthand for all kinds of surprising allegiances. </p> <p>Every decade of the last century found a different way of using Wilde to express its own concerns. In the era when his name was literally considered unspeakable, at least in this country, paperback copies of The Ballad of Reading Gaol and The Soul of Man under Socialism were badges of political radicalism. Meanwhile Strauss's operatic Salome of 1905 maintained Wilde's reputation as the ne plus ultra of decadence. EM Forster's Maurice, cowering unpublished in the closet in 1914, miserably branded himself \"an unspeakable of the Oscar Wilde sort\". Each of the very different theatrical and film Wildes reinvented him in turn as the image of their own times. In the 1970s, his name was taken in vain by a new kind of badge-wearer; a popular button among stroppier queens of Liberation-era London read simply \"Avenge Oscar\". In our own time Stephen Fry, launching a film that, despite noble intentions, gave us the Wildean pill sugared with a 1990s mix of cost-free sympathy and celebrity, unblushingly compared Wilde to Christ. </p> <p>So to what new uses will this brilliant and fascinating artist be put in our new, millennial and - as you have no doubt noticed - centenary decade? Who is Wilde now, in the year 2000? Sadly these two new titles, optimistically published to cash in on the festivities, fail to discover any new echoes or resonances in the magic name. The only sound generated is the rather ugly one of the barrel being scraped. Greedy publishers and lazy editors, rather than the poor besotted authors, must, I think, take the primary blame for this. Both Barbara Belford and Joan Schenkar have, in their different ways, fallen under the Wilde spell; but Virago and Bloomsbury might have done well to dampen or at least discipline their infatuations. </p> <p>The idea of a new biography so soon after Richard Ellmann's magisterial heavyweight has an appealing chutzpah. Indeed, Belford is right to take him to task for his omissions, and my hopes rose when she promised to illuminate Wilde anew by grounding him securely in the context of both homosexual life and theatrical practice in the late 19th century. The problem is, she doesn't deliver. Although she repeatedly mentions that Wilde had sex with other men, she does nothing with the available historical facts. Picturesque but unsubstantiated speculation that things may have been rather neoclassical between the sheets - early exposure to Graeco-Roman statuary in the National Gallery of Ireland having led directly to intercrural copulation with Robbie Ross in the study at Tite Street in 1887 - really won't do. </p> <p>Her account of late Victorian theatre is hopelessly clogged with irrelevant detail. I was happy to be told that the New York theatre was revolutionised in 1882 by Steele Mackage's invention of the tip-up seat, but unsure what this had to do with Wilde's attempts to stage a hit there. The effect of ill-digested research is pervasive: there are lots of things that need to be said about Wilde's father, but was such a dramatic account of his illegal acquisition of a set of mummified ibis (\"sacred, long-legged, white wading birds\") while on holiday in Egypt really necessary? Despite the promise that this is a \"fresh look\" at Wilde, the only really distinctive thing about this book is Belford's occasionally startling turn of phrase. I was frankly amazed to learn that in fin de si\u00e8cle Algeria \"boys showed their availability by scrambling up men's trousers\". Belford claims that she has spent five years \"getting to know the inner Wilde\", and that the familiar material is delivered \"with a new, centenary spin\". Truth is, this is just a rehash: she has nothing new to say, and says it clumsily. </p> <p>Joan Schenkar can at least claim to be first in the queue. Her contribution to the Wilde centenary is an oblique one: the first biography of Oscar's previously undocumented niece, Dolly. Although Dolly is the ostensible subject, Uncle is named at least once on every page; the constant comparison and overshadowing matches that which dogged Dolly all her life. By the time she hit the saloons of 1920s Paris, she was the last Wilde. This was her entr\u00e9e, and she made a point of talking and looking like her uncle whenever she could. She was, according to girlfriends, both a notable wit and an uncannily convincing lookalike when in Oscar drag. Trouble is, she was precious little else; she took a perverse pride in never writing a word of fiction despite constant assurances that she was destined for literary greatness by virtue of the family aura. True, she dined with, borrowed from, insulted or slept with almost everyone in the astonishing rue Jacob lesbian salon, sliding into major addictions (fast cars, drink, drugs and \"emergency seductions\") before ending up face-down in a rented Belgravia flat at the age of 46. But while simultaneously injecting under the table and dishing the dirt on duchesses may have been chic, it hardly adds up to a career. </p> <p>Schenkar tries hard to argue that this absence of achievement is itself significant, and that underneath the surface dazzle of proto-It Girl outrage there is a serious book about how the Wildean iconography of self-destruction was replayed in a feminine, feminist, modern and modernist world. I wasn't convinced. The opening chapters are spirited and inventive, but although this biographer is commendably besotted by her subject, and often stylishly successful in evoking an extraordinary lost world of Vionnet frocks and detox clinics, Dolly quickly began to pall. Her uncle's achievement was to lodge himself, for better or for worse, permanently in the public imagination. Dolly lived off his myth, rather than substantially elaborating or elucidating it. The same, I'm afraid, might be said for both these biographies. </p> <p> \u0095 Neil Bartlett's new play about Wilde, In Extremis, is at the National Theatre.</p>",

And so is God's terrible final demand that Abram offer Isaac as a sacrifice. This is God's nuclear bomb, winning him the war but at an unbearable price, breaking all hearts including his own. \"Whoever the story belongs to, the events took place in the world,\" says Diski, and, in spite of its ethereal beginnings, this is very much the world as we know it. There is no attempt to emulate Biblical speech and the tone is often deliberately anachronistic. Occasionally this grates; but overall the book succeeds remarkably in bringing to life one of the world's first great family sagas.",

He clearly approves of Macmillan's great con-trick on his own party, leading them deeper into consensus politics while saying the opposite. He is quite enthusiastic about Heath, insisting that he didn't start as a premature Thatcherite, and reckons Callaghan was a good prime minister defeated by impossible circumstances. </p> <p>But he is quite beastly about Wilson, perhaps because (as he readily admits) he fell hook, line and sinker for all that \"white heat of the technological revolution\" stuff at the start.

The good Doctor Johnson, for example, was not about to let it through the hallowed portals of his Dictionary, as Boswell tells us: \"He would not admit civilization, but only civility. With great deference to him, I thought civilization, from to civilize, better in the sense opposed to barbarity, than civility.\" </p> <p>Today we no longer reach so comfortably for words like \"barbarity\". But, as Boswell rightly points out, the word \"civilization\" is derived from the verb \"to civilize\", so what it can usefully denote is a process rather than a congealed achievement. Civilization, properly, is the process of rendering a society more civil. It is a political concept, deriving ultimately from the Latin \"civis\", citizen of a community, and the idea of what is proper to a citizen, which is \"civilitas\" or courtesy. It is in this sense that a beautifully sardonic Gandhi murmured that western civilization \"would be a good idea\". </p> <p>Felipe Fernandez-Armesto, however, claims to believe that the idea of a civilizing \"process\" - whereby societies might learn to live together more peacefully and productively - is tainted irrevocably by the horrors of 20th-century dreams of \"progress\": fascism and Soviet communism. This is rampant nonsense. The fact that some dreams of progress have been wicked is no good reason to abandon the idea of progress itself. It is undeniable that universal suffrage and the abolition of the death penalty have contributed to the civilization of this country in the past century. And we ought constantly to demand more civilization, rather than to abandon the idea completely out of a misguided world-historical pessimism. </p> <p>But then, the key to understanding the deliberate eccentricity of Fernandez-Armesto's book lies in his hysterical anti-liberalism. He is a man complacently \"waiting for the conservative nirvana\", and seriously claims at the book's climax that \"liberal principles become the forerunners of death camps and eugenics\". Such nasty pottiness bookends this fat work: at the start, he smears the work of Arnold Toynbee with the following disgustingly uncivil innuendo: \"Toynbee's enthusiasm for 'pioneer' leaders, steering civilization towards collective goals, seems chilling in a work published just after Hitler came to power.\" Another theorist of civilization, Kenneth Clark, is dismissed for what Fernandez-Armesto calls his \"warped perspective\". But Clark's perspective - his preference for a marble Apollo over an African mask - was no more \"warped\" than any other: it was simply a perspective. It would seem hard, indeed, to write from no perspective at all; unless, perhaps, you can attain the godlike objectivity of a Fernandez-Armesto. </p> <p>Our author's claim is that civilization is fundamentally a measure of how man refashions his environment to his own ends. He solicits both praise for this idea's novelty (\"This is an experimental work ... meant to be ... unprecedented\") and respect for its venerability (\"The usage I advocate is justified by tradition\"), thus setting a rigorously maintained precedent of having his cake and eating it. He notices that Toynbee had the idea in 1919, but dismisses his formulation on a technicality and then conveniently forgets about it. He promises grandly that his revolutionary new recategorisation will open up fresh vistas of historical truth. </p> <p>Up to a point. The central 500 pages are devoted to a grand tour of world history by environment: hostile wastelands of desert, tundra and ice; swathes of uncultivable grassland; tropical and temperate forests; alluvial soils; highlands, islands and \"seaboard civilizations\". The plurality of the book's title emphasises that civilization is not confined to western Europe or other lucky pockets of geography: human ingenuity ensures that it happens pretty much anywhere humans can stay alive. Great structures have been built in rebarbative rainforest or on shifting mud. Fernandez-Armesto's scheme enables pretty juxtapositions (the Aztecs, Ethiopians and Tibetans are seen to have overcome similar problems of altitude) and provocative revaluations (the Aztecs, again, seem more heroically competent in \"civilizing\" their environment than the classical Greeks). </p> <p>But Fernandez-Armesto, in the interest of covering all bases, is so systematically self-contradictory as to be almost comically incoherent. Environment shapes civilization; no, it doesn't; yes, it does; er, OK then, civilizations are \"neither determined nor uninfluenced by environment\". Well, who is going to argue with that? Temporary and mutually exclusive criteria of civilizational \"success\" flash past. The Inuit, for example, are less \"civilized\" than modern Europeans because they have adapted themselves to their icy environment rather than attempting to change it; then again, maybe civilization would be an \"irrational strategy\" in such terrain, \"at least where long-term survival is the goal\". But if long-term survival really were a valid criterion, that would imply that the Inuit have been more successful than, say, the imperial Romans, because the Inuit are still here. </p> <p>Fernandez-Armesto's definition of what sort of behaviour constitutes \"civilizing\" an environment becomes so loose at times - just eating bits of it and constructing ramshackle shelters seems to be enough - that it could accommodate badgers, nest-building birds and termites just as well as it does humans. Stretch the word that thinly and it becomes useless. Some part of him seems to recognise the explanatory poverty of his thesis, for he regularly has recourse to \"civilization\" and its cognates in their old senses, lapsing into the usage he has derided: specifically, city-building societies with complex political cultures. </p> <p> Civilizations, though stuffed with what ought to be fascinating historical facts and comparisons, is the sheerest drudgery to read, because Fernandez-Armesto only rarely remembers what he is supposed to be arguing and instead indulges in reams of irrelevant armchair tourism and purple-hued narration. Were his theory a coherent and useful one, in fact, he would have been able to write a much shorter book. The reader at least ought to be grateful that he thinks \"culture\" cannot explain anything (at least, about half the time he does; as with most of his sweeping statements, he denies it about as often as he asserts it), because his own swerves into that territory are quite shatteringly banal. \"Plato fancied himself as a political thinker,\" we are told facetiously; \"Confucius was part of a vibrant world of ideas\"; Romanticism is \"a scale of values which put emotion above reason\"; and Japanese religion \"surely represent[s] the way human minds work more typically than westerners of the present generations\". What on God's sweet earth can that mean? </p> <p>Oddly, for all his carefully burnished self-image as a pioneering, multicultural, iconoclastic historian, Fernandez-Armesto's prose is that of a parodic 19th-century buffer, an Anglophile gentleman amateur who congratulates himself on having written his book \"in something of a frenzy\" informed by \"no mature deliberation\", who rails constantly against the \"gimcrack rubbish\" of newfangled inventions such as the electronic watch and (I kid you not) the zippered fly, and who observes the dusty gleam of ancient societies with a patronising inverted snobbery, excusing what was violent, brutish and - yes - uncivilized about them. </p> <p> Civilizations is, finally, a useful book in one way only: it defines the sensible limits of multiculturalism by overstepping them. Fernandez-Armesto is of course right to emphasise that modern western civilization is not the historically privileged summit of human evolution, but to doubt that it is in every way better than a superstitious ancient culture of South America that regularly sacrificed newborn babies is the most irrational cant of all.</p>",

An Edwardian lepidopterist and the actor who is to play him in a film 80 years later explore ways of seeing through observations noted in their pillow books. These are not diaries, everyday records of Robert Gilmerton convalescing in 1916 from a shrapnel wound or of David Orr slowly coming to inhabit the role of Gilmerton, but commonplace books in which events, memories and justifications are noted in 10-minute segments. Duthie demands the reader's absolute concentration, but rewards it tenfold. Semi-Detached Cynthia Holz (Piatkus, \u00a36.99) Buy it at BOL Does this herald the 50-something novel? Barbara and Elliot Rifkin make it from being teenaged sweethearts, through marriage, kids and carriage clocks only to find that they can't stomach each other's company 24 hours a day. They decide to split the house horizontally: Barbara has the basement and takes up pottery, Elliot, upstairs, masters cookie-baking and Tai Chi. Not surprisingly, their daughter is angry and their son bewildered; friends don't get it and new acquaintances get the wrong idea. Holz catalogues their progress in an undemanding narrative which is redeemed by an unconventional take on middle-aged marriage.

Seen by some as a lugubrious party pooper for his refusal to share the euphoria attending German unification, Grass followed that cautionary tale three years later with the novel Too Far Afield, published now in English translation. </p> <p>Set in Berlin between the fall of the Wall in November 1989 and the aftermath of unification in October 1990, it probes and laments, largely through the eyes of East German characters, what Grass has elsewhere disparaged as \"unification without unity\". While The Tin Drum (1959) - the novel cited when Grass was awarded last year's Nobel Prize for literature - was a forceful reckoning with Germany's Nazi past, Too Far Afield explores the warnings encrypted in a longer, repetitious national history. </p> <p>Its protagonist is Theo Wuttke, a cultural functionary and itinerant lecturer known as Fonty for his obsessive identification with Theodor Fontane, the 19th-century Prussian balladeer and novelist of Huguenot origins, who was born 100 years to the day before him and whom he reveres as \"the Immortal\". Fonty's family has been sundered since the Wall was built in 1961, his three sons having defected, leaving him, his wife and daughter in \"three and a half rooms\" in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg district. As he observes the \"wallpeckers\" hacking saleable souvenirs from Berlin's crumbling edifice, Fonty dourly celebrates his 70th birthday in McDonald's with his friend Hoftaller, apparently a reincarnation of a 19th-century spy, Ludwig Tallhover. </p> <p>Hoftaller is Fonty's minder, his \"day-and-night shadow\" with whom he is \"glued together for an eternity\". Both now work for the \"Handover Trust\", the agency charged with the privatisation of East German state property (euphemistically termed \"winding down\"). But though Fonty now serves different masters, and can navigate Berlin districts that were off limits for decades, he remains aloof from the bursts of Beethoven's Ode to Joy at the Brandenburg Gate and the \"brief pause scheduled for profound emotion\" that mark the end of the \"Workers' and Peasants' state\". As he sees it: \"Within this world of want, we lived in a comfy dictatorship.\" </p> <p>Grass, a defeated advocate of gradualism and federation (though also a critic of the East German state), writes scathingly of how the velvet revolution segued into what he portrays as colonial annexation. As one Berliner says of the post-unification hangover: \"Y'know, you wish for a thing, but when it comes it's like someone hit you over the head.\" With the advent of the Deutschmark (\"whose very hardness might well turn against us\") and a tide of joblessness, the Easterners are \"leftovers, good only for scrap\". They are prey to \"Parvenooskis\" and \"Nogoodniks\", smart westerners \"on the prowl for real estate, sticky-fingered and unification-drunk\". This crew is embodied by a builder turned speculator who marries Fonty's daughter; a marvellously comic wedding scene flays \"stuck-up Wessies\" for looking down their noses at their poor-relation, second-class-citizen \"Ossies\". </p> <p>Fonty, for whom \"the centuries were fluid\" and whose fevers mirror political crises, recognises the events of the present as Germany's second unification. As the old man imagines a lifetime \"double woven\" with that of his Bismarck-era hero, Grass traces parallels across German literature and history, between the founding eras of 1871 and 1989. He links the betrayals and clampdowns of the 1848 revolution and 1953 East German uprising with the architects of unity, whom he deems \"colossal tricksters\"; the Iron Chancellor with the \"watered-down Bismarck\" Helmut Kohl. Through echoes between Bismarck's three unification wars and Hitler's aggression, or between the St Bartholomew's Night Huguenot massacre and Kristallnacht, on whose 51st anniversary the Berlin Wall falls, Too Far Afield warns insistently of the \"idiotic pride in 'Deutschland' that has always gone hand in hand with violence\", the \"weather-resistant anti-semitism\" and the recurring xenophobia that makes Turks \"the new Huguenots\". </p> <p>The return of \"one-fatherland-indivisible\" invokes a dangerous mythology in a country \"where, for all eternity, Buchenwald lies down the road from Weimar\". Grass underlines this historical continuity through Fonty's workplace, the Luftwaffe HQ turned GDR ministerial complex now housing the Handover Trust, and through the shape-shifting of Hoftaller, a chameleon at his ease whether in Prussia's police state, Hitler's Reich or the Stasi. Hoftaller's spying does not end with the defeat of communism: he merely dons a baseball cap and trainers. </p> <p>The leaps across centuries, sometimes within a sentence - a technique Fonty calls \"double-entry bookkeeping\" - make for a complex and at times mystifyingly allusive novel, which can approach tedium for those not steeped in 19th-century German literature. Yet Fonty's high-flown language, mirroring Fontane's, is interspersed with the mundane voices of his womenfolk - who, though scarcely rounded as characters, offer linguistic relief (a switch well caught by the translator, Krishna Winston). As Fonty's wife sighs during his imaginative flights: \"My Wuttke, he's personifying.\" </p> <p>Though Fonty is its central character, the novel is narrated by \"We Archivists\", anonymous \"footnote slaves\" charged with keeping the archive on Fonty's beloved \"Immortal\". They commandeer Fonty's letters when their own \"field research\" proves inadequate, steeping the book in an atmosphere of surveillance. Betrayal runs in Fonty's family, though often with good cause: his son in Bonn turns informant to save his parents behind the iron curtain, while the Wall's fall reunites Fonty with his French granddaughter, the result of a wartime affair in Lyon when he worked with the French resistance. In tracing what a united Germany means for a family and a \"fatherland\", there is surely symbolism in Fonty's discovery of kinship beyond German borders. </p> <p>Fonty lectures on \"the shadowed writer's position in society\", and the novel is also about the writer's freedom, the forces that constrain it and the impulse to escape. Fonty and Hoftaller are sides of the same coin: \"Spies are immortal, like the poets they spy on ... sometimes poets are spies, too.\" Grass, who defended Christa Wolf when she was ostracised for having informed for the GDR, argued against the opening of Stasi files and the post-unification \"witchhunts\" Fonty sees as \"writers pillorying other writers ... small minds judging others\". </p> <p>While Too Far Afield is over-long and difficult (particularly the uphill trek of its first 100 pages), its pervasive scepticism offers a salutary gloss on the heady exhilaration and uncertainty of the period. It is scepticism without pessimism; a final scene on a ferris wheel - an explicit echo of The Third Man, in which the spy calls it quits - suggests a sanguine leap of faith. The novel is also leavened by a drily off-beat humour, as it returns repeatedly to an image of the two old men that owes something to Beckett or to the comic pathos of a silent movie. The gentle comedy of Fonty, his moustache trembling as he fights to save his old-fashioned ministry lift, is part Kafka, part Chaplin.</p>",

As he sees it: \"Within this world of want, we lived in a comfy dictatorship.\" Grass, a defeated advocate of gradualism and federation (though also a critic of the East German state), writes scathingly of how the velvet revolution segued into what he portrays as colonial annexation. As one Berliner says of the post-unification hangover: \"Y'know, you wish for a thing, but when it comes it's like someone hit you over the head.\" With the advent of the Deutschmark (\"whose very hardness might well turn against us\") and a tide of joblessness, the Easterners are \"leftovers, good only for scrap\". They are prey to \"Parvenooskis\" and \"Nogoodniks\", smart westerners \"on the prowl for real estate, sticky-fingered and unification-drunk\". This crew is embodied by a builder turned speculator who marries Fonty's daughter; a marvellously comic wedding scene flays \"stuck-up Wessies\" for looking down their noses at their poor-relation, second-class-citizen \"Ossies\". Fonty, for whom \"the centuries were fluid\" and whose fevers mirror political crises, recognises the events of the present as Germany's second unification. As the old man imagines a lifetime \"double woven\" with that of his Bismarck-era hero, Grass traces parallels across German literature and history, between the founding eras of 1871 and 1989. He links the betrayals and clampdowns of the 1848 revolution and 1953 East German uprising with the architects of unity, whom he deems \"colossal tricksters\"; the Iron Chancellor with the \"watered-down Bismarck\" Helmut Kohl. Through echoes between Bismarck's three unification wars and Hitler's aggression, or between the St Bartholomew's Night Huguenot massacre and Kristallnacht, on whose 51st anniversary the Berlin Wall falls, Too Far Afield warns insistently of the \"idiotic pride in 'Deutschland' that has always gone hand in hand with violence\", the \"weather-resistant anti-semitism\" and the recurring xenophobia that makes Turks \"the new Huguenots\". The return of \"one-fatherland-indivisible\" invokes a dangerous mythology in a country \"where, for all eternity, Buchenwald lies down the road from Weimar\". Grass underlines this historical continuity through Fonty's workplace, the Luftwaffe HQ turned GDR ministerial complex now housing the Handover Trust, and through the shape-shifting of Hoftaller, a chameleon at his ease whether in Prussia's police state, Hitler's Reich or the Stasi. Hoftaller's spying does not end with the defeat of communism: he merely dons a baseball cap and trainers. The leaps across centuries, sometimes within a sentence - a technique Fonty calls \"double-entry bookkeeping\" - make for a complex and at times mystifyingly allusive novel, which can approach tedium for those not steeped in 19th-century German literature. Yet Fonty's high-flown language, mirroring Fontane's, is interspersed with the mundane voices of his womenfolk - who, though scarcely rounded as characters, offer linguistic relief (a switch well caught by the translator, Krishna Winston). As Fonty's wife sighs during his imaginative flights: \"My Wuttke, he's personifying.\" Though Fonty is its central character, the novel is narrated by \"We Archivists\", anonymous \"footnote slaves\" charged with keeping the archive on Fonty's beloved \"Immortal\". They commandeer Fonty's letters when their own \"field research\" proves inadequate, steeping the book in an atmosphere of surveillance. Betrayal runs in Fonty's family, though often with good cause: his son in Bonn turns informant to save his parents behind the iron curtain, while the Wall's fall reunites Fonty with his French granddaughter, the result of a wartime affair in Lyon when he worked with the French resistance. In tracing what a united Germany means for a family and a \"fatherland\", there is surely symbolism in Fonty's discovery of kinship beyond German borders. Fonty lectures on \"the shadowed writer's position in society\", and the novel is also about the writer's freedom, the forces that constrain it and the impulse to escape. Fonty and Hoftaller are sides of the same coin: \"Spies are immortal, like the poets they spy on ... sometimes poets are spies, too.\" Grass, who defended Christa Wolf when she was ostracised for having informed for the GDR, argued against the opening of Stasi files and the post-unification \"witchhunts\" Fonty sees as \"writers pillorying other writers ... small minds judging others\". While Too Far Afield is over-long and difficult (particularly the uphill trek of its first 100 pages), its pervasive scepticism offers a salutary gloss on the heady exhilaration and uncertainty of the period. It is scepticism without pessimism; a final scene on a ferris wheel - an explicit echo of The Third Man, in which the spy calls it quits - suggests a sanguine leap of faith. The novel is also leavened by a drily off-beat humour, as it returns repeatedly to an image of the two old men that owes something to Beckett or to the comic pathos of a silent movie. The gentle comedy of Fonty, his moustache trembling as he fights to save his old-fashioned ministry lift, is part Kafka, part Chaplin.",

      "body": "<p>Professor Evelyn Fox Keller lounges in a swivel chair in her office at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , with her sockless feet in battered Reeboks on the desk in front of her; from time to time, when agitated, she spins round and rests them on the desk behind her, as sturdy and cluttered as the other one. It's a nice metaphor for the way she fits into the angular world of professional science. She is on top of several subjects, as a pioneering feminist critic and philosopher of science, who has also been a working biologist, but ostentatiously comfortable only on her own terms. </p> <p>Tom Wilkie, adviser in bio-medical ethics at the Wellcome Trust, says that her kind of criticism of science is something that this country badly needs: \"As the BSE crisis shows, we tend to treat scientists as disembodied experts in this culture, but her stuff fills out a fuller picture of the relationship between science and the world around it.\" </p> <p>Her honours as a scientist are numerous: she has been a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study, where Einstein worked, and has won a MacArthur \"genius\" award. But she is also famous for an attack on Harvard (where she gained a doctorate in theoretical physics in 1963) and as a feminist scholar of science. To find her in the splendour of MIT - Nerd Central itself and just up the road from Harvard - is something of a surprise. </p> <p>It is as a feminist critic of science that she is best known. According to the American writer Pamela Weintraub, Keller's work has \"cast a pall on science and its glorious priesthood, whose powerful political bias affects the 'description of nature' emerging from the lab\". </p> <p>Keller was born in 1936, one of three children in a poor Jewish New York City family, first-generation immigrants from Russia. Her father worked in a delicatessen. The children \"made spectacularly good,\" she says: her sister Frances Fox Piven is a political scientist and poverty campaigner; her elder brother Maurice is a biologist at MIT. Evelyn attributes some of their success to the New York public school system - \"It was wonderful. It really was.\" </p> <p>Her original ambition was to be a psychoanalyst: \"I heard about the unconscious when I was 12 from my older sister, and I thought it was the neatest thing I had ever heard.\" It's a big swerve from there to theoretical physics, especially as psychoanalysis is now discredited as about the most unscientific theory that could ever have existed. But she retains a huge admiration for Freud. </p> <p>Maurice was a physicist by then, but it was Evelyn's comparative failure in English composition that tipped the balance. \"No matter how I tried, I couldn't get better than a C in English. I was reading the George Gamow books [popular science of the 50s in which the ordinary hero, bored by physics lectures, falls asleep and understands what is said in the course of vivid dreams] and my older brother was a scientist. So I started to write my English essays about physics topics. All of a sudden I got As.\" </p> <p>She moved into physics, intending to return to psychoanalysis after she had got a degree, but at Brandeis University, something extraordinary happened. Instead of cleverness being a means in itself, or at least a means of escape from the circumstances of her upbringing, it suddenly became something unselfish. She fell in love with theoretical physics. </p> <p>This is not a metaphor, says Keller, but a literal description of her experience. She once expanded on it in an article: \"I fell in love simultaneously and inextricably, with my professors, with a discipline of pure, precise, definitive thought, and with what I conceived of as its ambitions. I fell in love with the life of the mind. I also fell in love, I might add, with the image of myself striving and succeeding in an area where women had rarely ventured. It was a heady experience.\" This idealism is part of a fierce romantic quality that friends detect in her. Gillian Beer, president of Clare Hall, Cambridge, says, \"She's full of a sort of dark life: there's tremendous intensity in her relationships, and even in her laughter. She's a very loyal friend, though she also has enemies, whom she rather relishes.\" </p> <p>As a young scientist, Keller believed she was part of the greatest adventure that humans had ever embarked on: \"I thought it was a cooperative venture in which people wanted to find out what the world was made up of\"; and that the people she worked with were, by definition, working for the benefit of humanity - though perhaps, in those days, she would have said \"mankind\". Years later she wrote: \"I believed not only in the possibility of clear and certain knowledge of the world, but also in the unique and privileged access to this knowledge provided by science in general and physics in particular. I fully accepted science, and scientists, as arbiters of the truth - physicists were, of course, the highest arbiters.\" </p> <p>She graduated in 1957, a year when the prestige of American scientists was as high as it would ever be. She wrote her undergraduate thesis on the work of Richard Feynman [the Nobel Prize winner regarded as the purest example of idiosyncratic genius among all the discoverers of quantum mechanics] and wanted to go to California to study with him. But in the end she went on a state scholarship to Harvard, and almost at once her dreams collapsed. </p> <p>She had no trouble with the work, but she found the atmosphere unendurable. \"Harvard was a disaster,\" she says now. \"It was a very difficult time to be a woman in a physics department.\" There were only three women among the 100 postgraduate physicists. Several months into her first year, a teacher offered her a lift and asked how she was getting on. As she started to tell him, she almost burst into tears; then realised that admitting her feelings filled him with acute discomfort, as if, instead, she had started to take off her clothes. The experience made her even more buttoned up, even more miserable. It is hard to believe now that this confident woman in steel-rimmed spectacles with a huge gleeful smile could ever have been embarrassed about anything. But she was, and she was deeply miserable. She felt persecuted by the faculty and by her fellow students, and bitterly disappointed by the work she was doing. </p> <p>\"I went to graduate school to learn about... the nature of space, time, and matter... I was taught, instead, how to do physics. In place of wisdom, I was offered skills. Furthermore, this substitution was made with moralistic fervour. It was wrong, foolhardy, indeed foolish, to squander precious time asking 'why?'. Proper humility was to bend to the grindstone and learn techniques.\" </p> <p>She found this narrowing of the boundless horizons of science quite mystifying, and was still more puzzled that the people who did it were proud of their narrowed horizons. \"I didn't fully understand that in addition to the techniques of physics, they were also learning the techniques of arrogance.\" She toyed with the idea of going to medical school, but a certain stubbornness kept her going even after she had passed her first set of exams early and felt she had little more to prove. </p> <p>It was chance and family connections that showed her the way out in the summer of 1960. Her brother Maurice, newly married, was spending the summer at Cold Spring Harbor, a small village on the north shore of Long Island which is one of the capital cities of modern biology; it houses a permanent government funded research laboratory and hosts a series of influential science conferences. \"I went there for the summer, because he had a spare room - well, half a spare room, because he had a baby.\" </p> <p>These were the years in which it seemed that all life could be understood by probing at its simplest structures: bacteria and the viruses that prey on them; and most of this work was done by men who had trained as physicists. The structure of DNA had been unravelled by Crick and Watson in 1953, but its code - the syllables spelt out by the letters Crick and Watson had discovered - was not cracked until 1963; and, of course, the task of turning those syllables into intelligible words, and then deciphering the grammar and syntax of their language still continues. Max Delbruck, one of the leaders of this revolution, was working at Cold Spring Harbor, and got her to work in a lab there: \"they were all on the lookout for smart young things, especially from physics\", she says with an unselfconscious acceptance of her own smartness. </p> <p>She switched her attention entirely to biology, and persuaded the physics department to let her take a doctorate in theoretical physics with a dissertation that was in molecular biology: she had thought of a technique which would make it possible to decide whether one or both strands of DNA were used to make proteins: she thought the task would take weeks. It took more than a year in practice, and she left with a doctorate and a conviction that she was not really cut out to be an experimental scientist. \"I couldn't stand it when I'd see three weeks of work go down the tube because someone brushed against the water heater and the temperature went up. There were just so many variables out of control.\" </p> <p>Matt Meselson, the professor under whom she took her PhD, remembers her as a young woman in a hurry. \"She just wanted to get her doctorate quickly and get out. Most of the other students were less impatient. She worked hard. But she didn't really have the patience.\" </p> <p>So she moved to New York, working again as a theoretical physicist at New York University, and in 1964 married her boss, Joseph B Keller, a mathematician of great distinction. Shortly there after, they had two children - a son and a daughter. Jeffrey, now 35, is a software engineer; Sarah, 34, is a university teacher. </p> <p>Evelyn started work in yet another field, this time mathematical biology. She was happy. Two of the papers she wrote are said to be classics in the field: working with the mathematician Lee Segel, she produced equations to describe an extremely puzzling phenomenon: how it is that some single-celled amoebas can change, when times are hard, into a single, multi-cellular organism, without any one cell being responsible for the transformation. \"This was all very nice, but in 1969 I followed my husband to California. [where he still is] Lee was going round the country talking about our work, and he was getting more and more excited, and I was sitting at home getting more and more bored. So I started thinking about women and science.\" In fact she started to study her own predicament as a mathematical biologist with the tools of mathematical biology. She got hold of all the data she could find about women scientists: how many there were, and how long they lasted in their profession. \"The attrition rate was really shocking.\" </p> <p>Four years later, when she was invited to give a lecture series on mathematical biology, \"I felt I could not in good conscience give six lectures without making some reference to my being a woman. So in the last lecture I developed an epidemiological model for women in science using the data I had collected in Stanford in 1970. I showed them the equations, and the birth and death constants\" - which predicted the rate at which women scientists would abandon their profession - \"and then I devoted the last few minutes to a review of the reasons for these difficulties. I decided that probably the most serious obstacle to the success of women was the widespread belief that science was an inherently masculine endeavour. Where did it come from? What consequences did it have?\" </p> <p>It was the first time she had asked those questions out loud and the consequence was a huge sense of personal liberation. Even telling the story 26 years on, much of her face disappears in a huge grin. \"In 1974 these were not polite questions. I went back to the motel that evening and wrote up the talk. It was the first story I ever sold\" - she shakes her hand in the air in a jubilant, cheque-waving motion. </p> <p>That was the beginning of her career as a feminist critic of science. Gillian Beer says, \"What's important is that she asks new questions, and she holds on to them in ways that other people don't. She will start with very bold, sometimes odd - I'd say maybe absurd, if that wouldn't be misunderstood - questions, and moves in from there with that great weight of intellect until she carry them through. We met because I wrote a rather mixed review of her Reflections On Gender And Science and she wrote back and we became friends It's very typical of the way she listens to how people respond to her ideas. But of course it is the sheer intellectual stamina that is most impressive.\" </p> <p>There is certainly a ferocious energy about Keller which the relaxed posture belies. She has a house on the edge of Cape Cod that she loves and where she gardens, and she keeps a kayak for voyages on the chilly Atlantic. </p> <p>One of her happiest memories is of teaching cross-disciplinary courses with her colleagues in the humanities at a small university town in New York State in the 70s. \"Since it was the 70s, you could ask any question you wanted. We were rethinking everything, including a new educational system\"; and in the process she caught up on all the things her scientific education had missed out, reading literature, anthropology, and philosophy. She talks as if this period of blossoming radicalism was about the most fun she ever had in her life. </p> <p>Today, walking through the streets round MIT, once a centre of radicalism, she seems a figure from a long-past era among the hurrying, brightly efficient students, some of whom greet her respectfully. \"They are all so entrepreneurial these days\" she says. \"But when an MIT student goes radical, they really are radical,\" and she laughs at the thought. </p> <p>But even though it is a powerhouse of capitalism now, the atmosphere at MIT remains extraordinarily informal, in ways she fits right into. The faculty lunchroom is a kind of 50s cafeteria, with some of the smartest people in the world eating off paper plates at plain deal tables; after lunch she took a cardboard mug of coffee outside and sat on a bench to enjoy the autumn sunlight, asking a student to move up and make room for her. This mixture of sensual relish and intellectual stringency makes her company rather disconcerting; it would not be very pleasant to be a student who she decided was not trying. </p> <p>The trouble is that like so many revolutionaries she sees her followers going further than she thinks they should. For she still believes in science. It's no use saying , as some do, that science is a purely cultural construct, like art or fashion, because that does nothing to explain why it works and helps us change the world with a precision and power that no other human activity can approach. She doesn't even think there is any special way that women do science differently from men. On the other hand, she believes it is grossly misleading to pretend that science has no cultural element in a way that actually holds back scientific progress. </p> <p>Language which is seen as transparent becomes impervious, she says, and holds people back from the complexity of the phenomena they are trying to understand. The consequence is that both men and women do science less well than they might. These arguments came together, in a huge stroke of good luck, in her study of the maverick geneticist Barbara McClintock, who won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1983, whom she had seen, as from a great distance, in her lab at Cold Spring Harbor in the summer of 1960, when Keller was converted to molecular biology. </p> <p>McClintock had worked there, solitary among the crowds, since 1945. Her speciality was the genetics of maize, a plant to which she remained faithful throughout the decades when almost every other geneticist had moved on to simpler and faster-growing organisms. But, by the detailed and patient study of patterns in individual plants as they grew, McClintock had been able to discover, on her own, two hugely important parts of the genetic mechanism: she identified genes which controlled the activity of others, placed further along the chromosome; and she saw how these regulated genes could \"jump\" from one part of a chromosome to another. She called this \"transposition\". </p> <p>It took her six years to work it all out, and when she presented her results to her peers, no-one understood them. Nearly 15 years later, they were independently rediscovered in bacteria by molecular biologists, and McClintock was acknowledged as a pioneer; but by this time the habit of solitude was well entrenched and she continued to feel isolated by her interests and understanding of the world. </p> <p>Keller's biography of her, A Feeling For The Organism, started off as a study for the New Yorker. But it grew into a full-scale biography, which appeared five months before McClintock won her Nobel Prize (she died in 1992). The moral seemed simple: that women could only succeed in science, as McClintock had, by sacrificing everything else in their lives. </p> <p>Keller says: \"By her own account, even as a child, McClintock neither had nor felt any need of emotional intimacy in any of her personal relationships. The world of nature... became the principle focus of both her intellectual and emotional energies. From reading the text of nature, McClintock reaps the kind of understanding and fulfilment that others acquire from personal intimacy.\" But Keller was also interested in whether McClintock gained a deeper intellectual understanding of the world through this emotional connection. This is sometimes also a plea for a more holistic understanding of the world, not because it is spiritually improving, but because it is in some respects scientifically enlightening.

      "bodyText": "Professor Evelyn Fox Keller lounges in a swivel chair in her office at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , with her sockless feet in battered Reeboks on the desk in front of her; from time to time, when agitated, she spins round and rests them on the desk behind her, as sturdy and cluttered as the other one. It's a nice metaphor for the way she fits into the angular world of professional science. She is on top of several subjects, as a pioneering feminist critic and philosopher of science, who has also been a working biologist, but ostentatiously comfortable only on her own terms. Tom Wilkie, adviser in bio-medical ethics at the Wellcome Trust, says that her kind of criticism of science is something that this country badly needs: \"As the BSE crisis shows, we tend to treat scientists as disembodied experts in this culture, but her stuff fills out a fuller picture of the relationship between science and the world around it.\" Her honours as a scientist are numerous: she has been a fellow at the Institute of Advanced Study, where Einstein worked, and has won a MacArthur \"genius\" award. But she is also famous for an attack on Harvard (where she gained a doctorate in theoretical physics in 1963) and as a feminist scholar of science. To find her in the splendour of MIT - Nerd Central itself and just up the road from Harvard - is something of a surprise. It is as a feminist critic of science that she is best known. According to the American writer Pamela Weintraub, Keller's work has \"cast a pall on science and its glorious priesthood, whose powerful political bias affects the 'description of nature' emerging from the lab\". Keller was born in 1936, one of three children in a poor Jewish New York City family, first-generation immigrants from Russia. Her father worked in a delicatessen. The children \"made spectacularly good,\" she says: her sister Frances Fox Piven is a political scientist and poverty campaigner; her elder brother Maurice is a biologist at MIT. Evelyn attributes some of their success to the New York public school system - \"It was wonderful. It really was.\" Her original ambition was to be a psychoanalyst: \"I heard about the unconscious when I was 12 from my older sister, and I thought it was the neatest thing I had ever heard.\" It's a big swerve from there to theoretical physics, especially as psychoanalysis is now discredited as about the most unscientific theory that could ever have existed. But she retains a huge admiration for Freud. Maurice was a physicist by then, but it was Evelyn's comparative failure in English composition that tipped the balance. \"No matter how I tried, I couldn't get better than a C in English. I was reading the George Gamow books [popular science of the 50s in which the ordinary hero, bored by physics lectures, falls asleep and understands what is said in the course of vivid dreams] and my older brother was a scientist. So I started to write my English essays about physics topics. All of a sudden I got As.\" She moved into physics, intending to return to psychoanalysis after she had got a degree, but at Brandeis University, something extraordinary happened. Instead of cleverness being a means in itself, or at least a means of escape from the circumstances of her upbringing, it suddenly became something unselfish. She fell in love with theoretical physics. This is not a metaphor, says Keller, but a literal description of her experience. She once expanded on it in an article: \"I fell in love simultaneously and inextricably, with my professors, with a discipline of pure, precise, definitive thought, and with what I conceived of as its ambitions. I fell in love with the life of the mind. I also fell in love, I might add, with the image of myself striving and succeeding in an area where women had rarely ventured. It was a heady experience.\" This idealism is part of a fierce romantic quality that friends detect in her. Gillian Beer, president of Clare Hall, Cambridge, says, \"She's full of a sort of dark life: there's tremendous intensity in her relationships, and even in her laughter. She's a very loyal friend, though she also has enemies, whom she rather relishes.\" As a young scientist, Keller believed she was part of the greatest adventure that humans had ever embarked on: \"I thought it was a cooperative venture in which people wanted to find out what the world was made up of\"; and that the people she worked with were, by definition, working for the benefit of humanity - though perhaps, in those days, she would have said \"mankind\". Years later she wrote: \"I believed not only in the possibility of clear and certain knowledge of the world, but also in the unique and privileged access to this knowledge provided by science in general and physics in particular. I fully accepted science, and scientists, as arbiters of the truth - physicists were, of course, the highest arbiters.\" She graduated in 1957, a year when the prestige of American scientists was as high as it would ever be. She wrote her undergraduate thesis on the work of Richard Feynman [the Nobel Prize winner regarded as the purest example of idiosyncratic genius among all the discoverers of quantum mechanics] and wanted to go to California to study with him. But in the end she went on a state scholarship to Harvard, and almost at once her dreams collapsed. She had no trouble with the work, but she found the atmosphere unendurable. \"Harvard was a disaster,\" she says now. \"It was a very difficult time to be a woman in a physics department.\" There were only three women among the 100 postgraduate physicists. Several months into her first year, a teacher offered her a lift and asked how she was getting on. As she started to tell him, she almost burst into tears; then realised that admitting her feelings filled him with acute discomfort, as if, instead, she had started to take off her clothes. The experience made her even more buttoned up, even more miserable. It is hard to believe now that this confident woman in steel-rimmed spectacles with a huge gleeful smile could ever have been embarrassed about anything. But she was, and she was deeply miserable. She felt persecuted by the faculty and by her fellow students, and bitterly disappointed by the work she was doing. \"I went to graduate school to learn about... the nature of space, time, and matter... I was taught, instead, how to do physics. In place of wisdom, I was offered skills. Furthermore, this substitution was made with moralistic fervour. It was wrong, foolhardy, indeed foolish, to squander precious time asking 'why?'. Proper humility was to bend to the grindstone and learn techniques.\" She found this narrowing of the boundless horizons of science quite mystifying, and was still more puzzled that the people who did it were proud of their narrowed horizons. \"I didn't fully understand that in addition to the techniques of physics, they were also learning the techniques of arrogance.\" She toyed with the idea of going to medical school, but a certain stubbornness kept her going even after she had passed her first set of exams early and felt she had little more to prove. It was chance and family connections that showed her the way out in the summer of 1960. Her brother Maurice, newly married, was spending the summer at Cold Spring Harbor, a small village on the north shore of Long Island which is one of the capital cities of modern biology; it houses a permanent government funded research laboratory and hosts a series of influential science conferences. \"I went there for the summer, because he had a spare room - well, half a spare room, because he had a baby.\" These were the years in which it seemed that all life could be understood by probing at its simplest structures: bacteria and the viruses that prey on them; and most of this work was done by men who had trained as physicists. The structure of DNA had been unravelled by Crick and Watson in 1953, but its code - the syllables spelt out by the letters Crick and Watson had discovered - was not cracked until 1963; and, of course, the task of turning those syllables into intelligible words, and then deciphering the grammar and syntax of their language still continues. Max Delbruck, one of the leaders of this revolution, was working at Cold Spring Harbor, and got her to work in a lab there: \"they were all on the lookout for smart young things, especially from physics\", she says with an unselfconscious acceptance of her own smartness. She switched her attention entirely to biology, and persuaded the physics department to let her take a doctorate in theoretical physics with a dissertation that was in molecular biology: she had thought of a technique which would make it possible to decide whether one or both strands of DNA were used to make proteins: she thought the task would take weeks. It took more than a year in practice, and she left with a doctorate and a conviction that she was not really cut out to be an experimental scientist. \"I couldn't stand it when I'd see three weeks of work go down the tube because someone brushed against the water heater and the temperature went up. There were just so many variables out of control.\" Matt Meselson, the professor under whom she took her PhD, remembers her as a young woman in a hurry. \"She just wanted to get her doctorate quickly and get out. Most of the other students were less impatient. She worked hard. But she didn't really have the patience.\" So she moved to New York, working again as a theoretical physicist at New York University, and in 1964 married her boss, Joseph B Keller, a mathematician of great distinction. Shortly there after, they had two children - a son and a daughter. Jeffrey, now 35, is a software engineer; Sarah, 34, is a university teacher. Evelyn started work in yet another field, this time mathematical biology. She was happy. Two of the papers she wrote are said to be classics in the field: working with the mathematician Lee Segel, she produced equations to describe an extremely puzzling phenomenon: how it is that some single-celled amoebas can change, when times are hard, into a single, multi-cellular organism, without any one cell being responsible for the transformation. \"This was all very nice, but in 1969 I followed my husband to California. [where he still is] Lee was going round the country talking about our work, and he was getting more and more excited, and I was sitting at home getting more and more bored. So I started thinking about women and science.\" In fact she started to study her own predicament as a mathematical biologist with the tools of mathematical biology. She got hold of all the data she could find about women scientists: how many there were, and how long they lasted in their profession. \"The attrition rate was really shocking.\" Four years later, when she was invited to give a lecture series on mathematical biology, \"I felt I could not in good conscience give six lectures without making some reference to my being a woman. So in the last lecture I developed an epidemiological model for women in science using the data I had collected in Stanford in 1970. I showed them the equations, and the birth and death constants\" - which predicted the rate at which women scientists would abandon their profession - \"and then I devoted the last few minutes to a review of the reasons for these difficulties. I decided that probably the most serious obstacle to the success of women was the widespread belief that science was an inherently masculine endeavour. Where did it come from? What consequences did it have?\" It was the first time she had asked those questions out loud and the consequence was a huge sense of personal liberation. Even telling the story 26 years on, much of her face disappears in a huge grin. \"In 1974 these were not polite questions. I went back to the motel that evening and wrote up the talk. It was the first story I ever sold\" - she shakes her hand in the air in a jubilant, cheque-waving motion. That was the beginning of her career as a feminist critic of science. Gillian Beer says, \"What's important is that she asks new questions, and she holds on to them in ways that other people don't. She will start with very bold, sometimes odd - I'd say maybe absurd, if that wouldn't be misunderstood - questions, and moves in from there with that great weight of intellect until she carry them through. We met because I wrote a rather mixed review of her Reflections On Gender And Science and she wrote back and we became friends It's very typical of the way she listens to how people respond to her ideas. But of course it is the sheer intellectual stamina that is most impressive.\" There is certainly a ferocious energy about Keller which the relaxed posture belies. She has a house on the edge of Cape Cod that she loves and where she gardens, and she keeps a kayak for voyages on the chilly Atlantic. One of her happiest memories is of teaching cross-disciplinary courses with her colleagues in the humanities at a small university town in New York State in the 70s. \"Since it was the 70s, you could ask any question you wanted. We were rethinking everything, including a new educational system\"; and in the process she caught up on all the things her scientific education had missed out, reading literature, anthropology, and philosophy. She talks as if this period of blossoming radicalism was about the most fun she ever had in her life. Today, walking through the streets round MIT, once a centre of radicalism, she seems a figure from a long-past era among the hurrying, brightly efficient students, some of whom greet her respectfully. \"They are all so entrepreneurial these days\" she says. \"But when an MIT student goes radical, they really are radical,\" and she laughs at the thought. But even though it is a powerhouse of capitalism now, the atmosphere at MIT remains extraordinarily informal, in ways she fits right into. The faculty lunchroom is a kind of 50s cafeteria, with some of the smartest people in the world eating off paper plates at plain deal tables; after lunch she took a cardboard mug of coffee outside and sat on a bench to enjoy the autumn sunlight, asking a student to move up and make room for her. This mixture of sensual relish and intellectual stringency makes her company rather disconcerting; it would not be very pleasant to be a student who she decided was not trying. The trouble is that like so many revolutionaries she sees her followers going further than she thinks they should. For she still believes in science. It's no use saying , as some do, that science is a purely cultural construct, like art or fashion, because that does nothing to explain why it works and helps us change the world with a precision and power that no other human activity can approach. She doesn't even think there is any special way that women do science differently from men. On the other hand, she believes it is grossly misleading to pretend that science has no cultural element in a way that actually holds back scientific progress. Language which is seen as transparent becomes impervious, she says, and holds people back from the complexity of the phenomena they are trying to understand. The consequence is that both men and women do science less well than they might. These arguments came together, in a huge stroke of good luck, in her study of the maverick geneticist Barbara McClintock, who won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1983, whom she had seen, as from a great distance, in her lab at Cold Spring Harbor in the summer of 1960, when Keller was converted to molecular biology. McClintock had worked there, solitary among the crowds, since 1945. Her speciality was the genetics of maize, a plant to which she remained faithful throughout the decades when almost every other geneticist had moved on to simpler and faster-growing organisms. But, by the detailed and patient study of patterns in individual plants as they grew, McClintock had been able to discover, on her own, two hugely important parts of the genetic mechanism: she identified genes which controlled the activity of others, placed further along the chromosome; and she saw how these regulated genes could \"jump\" from one part of a chromosome to another. She called this \"transposition\". It took her six years to work it all out, and when she presented her results to her peers, no-one understood them. Nearly 15 years later, they were independently rediscovered in bacteria by molecular biologists, and McClintock was acknowledged as a pioneer; but by this time the habit of solitude was well entrenched and she continued to feel isolated by her interests and understanding of the world. Keller's biography of her, A Feeling For The Organism, started off as a study for the New Yorker. But it grew into a full-scale biography, which appeared five months before McClintock won her Nobel Prize (she died in 1992). The moral seemed simple: that women could only succeed in science, as McClintock had, by sacrificing everything else in their lives. Keller says: \"By her own account, even as a child, McClintock neither had nor felt any need of emotional intimacy in any of her personal relationships. The world of nature... became the principle focus of both her intellectual and emotional energies. From reading the text of nature, McClintock reaps the kind of understanding and fulfilment that others acquire from personal intimacy.\" But Keller was also interested in whether McClintock gained a deeper intellectual understanding of the world through this emotional connection. This is sometimes also a plea for a more holistic understanding of the world, not because it is spiritually improving, but because it is in some respects scientifically enlightening. It can make our knowledge of the world more precise and reliable, which is, of course, the opposite of what holistic normally means - fuzzy and new age. Keller's latest book, The Century Of The Gene, argues that the idea of the gene, which carried science through to such huge advances in the last century, will not do so well in this one, as more and more is learnt about the ways in which strings of DNA actually work in the world, and the complexities of their interactions with surrounding cells. On one level it is a beautifully illustrated examination of the arcane ways in which particular, meaningful stretches of DNA are pulled out of a chromosome which is, so far as we know, 97% meaningless \"junk\", and assembled into the kind of genes that actually specify the proteins that build people and every other living thing. On another, it is an attack on the view that genes are agents which do things to the passive world around them and are solely responsible for changing it. Lewis Wolpert, professor of biology at London University, a conspicuous opponent of Keller, attacks her for talking \"junk\" and \"bullshit\"; but at the same time says her thesis is \"what everybody knows\" and cries \"So what!\" when specific points are raised. The row between Wolpert and Keller is a wonderful example of the kind of antler-locking into which academics of all sexes naturally fall in a world where simply agreeing with someone can seem an unforgivable insult.

On a pitch made for spending the day at the crease White, who came in briefly the previous evening, thought it would be a felony not to take advantage of it. He batted for another four hours, played faultlessly overall, carefully at the start, impeccably against the Patron's XI spin attack and thunderously towards the end when he moved towards his hundred with panache. He was finally caught at the wicket, swishing vigorously, for 120. </p> <p>In all there were 14 fours and two sixes. One glorious three-ball passage of play that raced him into the 90s saw him drive raspingly straight, through the covers for another boundary and then slide into a lofted off-drive that cleared the boundary fencing and bounced around the concrete terracing. It was as good a shot as any played this tour. </p> <p>It was, of course, his first hundred in England colours but also his first in any cricket for two years. His bowling, high pace and with wicked use of reverse swing, emerged as the revelation of last season but otherwise these have been lean times. </p> <p>Having averaged fewer than 20 in first-class cricket in 1999, he suffered a worrying blackout early last summer and played only nine innings for Yorkshire and England. Yesterday's score, made on the back of successive innings of 0, 0 and 0 not out in the recent one-day series, exceeded his summer's aggregate by 20. </p> <p>Now, with new competition for a Test bowling place alongside Darren Gough and Andy Caddick if a spinner is chosen, White has done his cause no harm, slipping ahead of Dominic Cork. Good on him for that. It was an example - not followed by Mike Atherton on Thursday nor Graeme Hick, unusually, yesterday - of someone recognising a good thing when he saw it. </p> <p>\"I have struggled,\" he said afterwards.\" I've been concentrating on my bowling, I think, and worked hard at that to get it reasonably right but the batting has tailed off. I just wanted to spend a bit of time in the middle. If I batted for the first three hours , I thought it might come back to me and that's what I did. The pitch was so good that I said 'I've got to make the most of this' and I set my stall out to bat for most of the day. It helped me that the opposition said a few words to me when I first went in. They thought I was the nightwatchman. That spurred me on.\" </p> <p>White shared in partnerships of 83 for both the sixth wicket and the eighth, first with Paul Nixon, who made 31 in his first England innings without looking convincing against the spin, then with Ashley Giles, who looked more confident in making 39 before he was lbw. White had another of 44 for the ninth with Ian Salisbury. </p> <p>It saw England to 433 all out, a lead on first innnings of 196, which the Patron's XI had reduced by 49 at the close for the loss of Imran Abbas, caught at the wicket off Ian Salisbury. The spinners should hold the key to an England victory today, though there would be a further opportunity for Matthew Hoggard and Cork to exploit the dewfall first thing. </p> <p>At the start of play it had seemed a certainty that it would be Hick, 77 overnight, who would be celebrating a century. Instead, in the day's second over, he stretched high and far to reach a fastish longhop from Mohammad Sami, and succeeded only in toe-ending it to first slip. </p> <p>His next few hours would have been spent with his backside in an ice bucket to soothe the bruises where he surely kicked himself.</p>",

At least neither Sir Alex Ferguson nor any of his players or backroom staff will allow themselves to be interviewed after the game at Coventry City. All season the United manager has refused to cooperate with the nation's favourite football show, ordering the rest of his staff to keep mum too. Not even the former United man Garth Crooks, armed with one of his trademark 15-clause questions, will be able to scale the wall of silence. </p> <p>The big chill began when Ferguson read a suggestion in Match of the Day magazine which accused him of being a bully. He has, though, had disputes with the show before - in 1993 he went quiet after pundits criticised the total exclusion zone he had placed around Ryan Giggs - and BBC executives were hopeful this one could be resolved as quickly as in the past. After all, they pointed out, the magazine has no editorial links with the programme beyond a shared title. </p> <p>As the stand-off developed, negotiations took place at the highest level on both sides. Peter Kenyon, United's chief executive, was said to be keen on a thawing in relations and, through careful diplomacy by intermediaries, a resolution appeared to have been reached early last month. Word came through the day after England played Germany that normal service would be resumed the following Saturday. </p> <p>Then Ferguson read newspaper extracts from the Radio 5 Live commentator Alan Green's book about the pair's lengthy spat (they have not exchanged a civil word since Green made characteristically combative remarks about Roy Keane during the 1995 FA Cup semi-final). As a response to the Green book Ferguson raised the ante, issuing a blanket ban on all contact with the BBC. Radio and television, local and national, the silence from players and management at the country's top football club is absolute. </p> <p>Ferguson is understood to believe there is an anti-United bias at the corporation involving Green, the ex-Liverpool duo of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, and the former editor of Match of the Day Brian Barwick, a Liverpool fan. It is a belief that remains unshaken even though the current Match of the Day editor, Niall Sloane, is a United fan and the editor of Match of the Day magazine, Tim Glynn Jones, is such a keen red that he used to run the Shankhill Skinhead, an Old Trafford fanzine. Not forgetting Greg Dyke, the top man at the Beeb, who is so fond of the club that he used to be a United director and has spent the past few weeks trying to call in a few favours on his programme's behalf. </p> <p>United haters, of course, may not be so troubled by the silence. And even United fans would presumably prefer a testy grump who wins everything rather than a media darling who wins nothing. </p> <p>So how much does the disagreement between Ferguson and the Beeb really matter? Compared to Kosovo, Gaza and the state of the nation's transport infrastructure, not a lot. But the spat is symptomatic of a rapidly changing relationship be tween those playing and those reporting on football that has serious implications. </p> <p>For Ferguson is not alone in being in dispute with sections of the media. While few have gone quite as far as the former Dundee United chairman Jim McLean, who is under police investigation for an alleged incident with a BBC reporter, there are plenty of others grinding axes. </p> <p>The Manchester City manager Joe Royle still refuses to conduct post-match press conferences if anyone from the Liverpool Echo is present, because of what he describes as a vendetta against him when he was Everton manager. Duncan Ferguson has not spoken to a single journalist since he felt the press gloated at his prison sentence for head-butting an opponent. </p> <p>While there are many in the game who remain open, helpful and polite - it would be hard to find any journalist with a bad word for Jim Smith or Gareth Southgate, for instance - sulks and silences, spats and scraps are becoming ever more regular. One seasoned football reporter reckons that, in 20 years' experience, he has never known an atmosphere as tetchy as the present one. For fear of losing access, he believes, many of his colleagues have become cowed, sycophantic and simply dare not ask the challenging question. The possibility of forming mature relationships with managers or players is a thing of the past. </p> <p>\"Trust,\" he says, \"simply does not exist in football any more.\" </p> <p>The connection may not be obvious but all this is tied up with Middlesbrough launching their own website this week, with Chelsea publishing their own magazine and with Manchester United appointing a director of communications. Clubs are fighting for complete control of the lines of information. They want to communicate directly with their fans without interference from an independent third party, the press. Increasingly, if players and managers have something to say, they say it not via the established media but in club magazines, serialised autobiographies or on their own websites. </p> <p>And why not, the clubs will ask. If there is no trust left, whose fault is that? Newspapers devote huge amounts of space to what is known in the dressing room as \"slaughtering\" players: in the tabloids it is stories about their private lives, in the broadsheets (including this one) it is speculative analysis of their characters. Arsenal's Thierry Henry probably spoke for many when, at the launch of his new website recently, he said his motive was primarily to ensure his fans got the story he wanted them to hear, unfiltered by the distorting prism of the media. </p> <p>But there is something else at work here. There is a widespread assumption in football that the media is making an unjustified killing out of the game, that money is pouring into the pockets of journalists, photographers and broadcasters which rightly belongs to the players, managers and chairmen. The lure of the personal website has as much to do with the financial implications of being able to market a player's image as it does with freedom of information. </p> <p>Money certainly seems to have been at the root of a one of football's longest-running battles between Michael Knighton, when he was chairman of Carlisle United, and the local paper, the News and Star. </p> <p>\"He was very sensitive of criticism of the club,\" says Keith Sutton, the paper's editor. \"He was very upset when we reported that he claimed to have seen a UFO at a motorway service station but the thing that finally made him see red was when we printed a special souvenir supplement after Carlisle got to Wembley in the Sherpa Van Trophy.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It says a lot about Gilles Grimandi that he hopped aboard the 139 bus last Thursday to make his way home. The Frenchman may own a Porsche and be a key player at Arsenal but brash and arrogant he is not. In the event of another fuel crisis his team-mates know where to turn for advice. </p> <p>\"It's no problem to travel by bus or the tube in London,\" says the 29-year-old. \"Sometimes in the south of France it's different but here, when people recognise you, they are always nice. If it's easier to take the bus I will do it.\" </p> <p>If Arsenal supporters are soon lining the route of the 139 it would not be entirely surprising. The man once voted Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's worst signing in a fanzine poll has undergone a remarkable transformation to become an integral and popular figure at Highbury. </p> <p>In the past 16 months only Patrick Vieira and Ray Parlour have started more league and European matches and Grimandi's tenacious style has left its mark on more than Diego Simeone's face. He is being seriously considered for his international debut against Turkey later this month, a few days after his 30th birthday. </p> <p>\"Some people in France have come to see me a couple of times and, if they think I can help, it would be fantastic for me to be in the group,\" says the former Monaco player, who has never made a French squad. \"I would go with a lot of pleasure and pride.\" </p> <p>And no doubt relief at leaving behind the clutch of players who spend international weeks at Arsenal. \"Sometimes we are just two or three,\" Grimandi says. \"Dennis [Bergkamp] has joined us now because he has stopped his career with Holland but they are strange weeks. We train as normal and some young players join us, so it's not a holiday.\" </p> <p>Yet, even if Grimandi has a French cap to cover his unkempt locks, he is unlikely to feel the need for a chauffeur. As an emerging player he studied economics at Nice University, enticed in part by a desire to experience life outside football, and his childhood in the quiet skiing town of Gap in south-east France taught him to appreciate his privileged existence. </p> <p>\"If people could see how some families there still live they wouldn't believe it,\" he says. \"There are small villages no one can get to in the winter because of the snow. The people stay there for four or five months and in spring they can be visited, and people can come down and go shopping in Gap. It's good to go back and see people like that because we have a lot to learn from them.\" </p> <p>A keen skier in his youth - \"all the good skiers in France come from where I lived; I think I am the only footballer\" - Grimandi seemed to be on the slippery slope out of Highbury not long ago. In his second season at the club, in 1998-99, he started only three Premiership matches. </p> <p>\"It was a difficult time for me, perhaps the worst of my career,\" he says. \"It's hard enough in your own country if you do not play but it is even worse abroad. I didn't know whether to stay or leave but I decided it was a good challenge to try one more season to show what I can do.\" </p> <p>It was a wise choice. As his English has improved so has his confidence and sense of belonging. Convinced by Wenger that he could succeed as a midfield player having grown up as a defender, he played an important part last season, turned down a summer move to Marseille and has now taken on an even more crucial role. </p> <p>With his friend Emmanuel Petit gone and Edu's arrival held up by passport problems, Grimandi has forged a strong partnership with Vieira in midfield and slotted in at centre-back when needed. The fact that he is a Premiership ever-present going into today's match at Middlesbrough tells its own tale. </p> <p>Grimandi's work may not be spectacular but it is certainly effective. Invariably available for a pass, he rarely wastes possession and has provided a defensive barrier which Vieira says has given him the opportunity to get forward.

      "bodyText": "It says a lot about Gilles Grimandi that he hopped aboard the 139 bus last Thursday to make his way home. The Frenchman may own a Porsche and be a key player at Arsenal but brash and arrogant he is not. In the event of another fuel crisis his team-mates know where to turn for advice. \"It's no problem to travel by bus or the tube in London,\" says the 29-year-old. \"Sometimes in the south of France it's different but here, when people recognise you, they are always nice. If it's easier to take the bus I will do it.\" If Arsenal supporters are soon lining the route of the 139 it would not be entirely surprising. The man once voted Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's worst signing in a fanzine poll has undergone a remarkable transformation to become an integral and popular figure at Highbury. In the past 16 months only Patrick Vieira and Ray Parlour have started more league and European matches and Grimandi's tenacious style has left its mark on more than Diego Simeone's face. He is being seriously considered for his international debut against Turkey later this month, a few days after his 30th birthday. \"Some people in France have come to see me a couple of times and, if they think I can help, it would be fantastic for me to be in the group,\" says the former Monaco player, who has never made a French squad. \"I would go with a lot of pleasure and pride.\" And no doubt relief at leaving behind the clutch of players who spend international weeks at Arsenal. \"Sometimes we are just two or three,\" Grimandi says. \"Dennis [Bergkamp] has joined us now because he has stopped his career with Holland but they are strange weeks. We train as normal and some young players join us, so it's not a holiday.\" Yet, even if Grimandi has a French cap to cover his unkempt locks, he is unlikely to feel the need for a chauffeur. As an emerging player he studied economics at Nice University, enticed in part by a desire to experience life outside football, and his childhood in the quiet skiing town of Gap in south-east France taught him to appreciate his privileged existence. \"If people could see how some families there still live they wouldn't believe it,\" he says. \"There are small villages no one can get to in the winter because of the snow. The people stay there for four or five months and in spring they can be visited, and people can come down and go shopping in Gap. It's good to go back and see people like that because we have a lot to learn from them.\" A keen skier in his youth - \"all the good skiers in France come from where I lived; I think I am the only footballer\" - Grimandi seemed to be on the slippery slope out of Highbury not long ago. In his second season at the club, in 1998-99, he started only three Premiership matches. \"It was a difficult time for me, perhaps the worst of my career,\" he says. \"It's hard enough in your own country if you do not play but it is even worse abroad. I didn't know whether to stay or leave but I decided it was a good challenge to try one more season to show what I can do.\" It was a wise choice. As his English has improved so has his confidence and sense of belonging. Convinced by Wenger that he could succeed as a midfield player having grown up as a defender, he played an important part last season, turned down a summer move to Marseille and has now taken on an even more crucial role. With his friend Emmanuel Petit gone and Edu's arrival held up by passport problems, Grimandi has forged a strong partnership with Vieira in midfield and slotted in at centre-back when needed. The fact that he is a Premiership ever-present going into today's match at Middlesbrough tells its own tale. Grimandi's work may not be spectacular but it is certainly effective. Invariably available for a pass, he rarely wastes possession and has provided a defensive barrier which Vieira says has given him the opportunity to get forward. The fans appreciate his wholehearted effort, too. \"I play differently because they know what I am capable of and they don't blame me or say I'm a bad player,\" Grimandi says. \"He's efficient,\" explains Wenger, who first worked with Grimandi at Monaco. \"He knows what he can do and he doesn't try to do more than he can. He also has good vision and is good at winning the ball back. He's not scared to put his foot in and he's an intelligent guy, so he always tries to think: 'What can I do better?' \" That intelligence and calm persona off the field are what makes his tendency to lose his rag on it so bizarre. Banned for three Champions League matches for hitting Simeone in Rome, he was also suspended for stamping on Gary McAllister's hand and was sent off last season for elbowing Barcelona's Josep Guardiola.

The scatological tone of Steven Berkoff's text no longer shocks, and its linguistic brutality, once so forceful, now seems excessive. More perplexing nowadays is the fact that the opera's depiction of working-class life, as founded on greed, credulity, violence and aimless stupidity, is in effect a bourgeois, deprecating stereotype rather than satire, while the Sphinx's temporarily feminist triumph smacks vaguely of misogyny. </p> <p>Greek's politics do hit home forcefully, however, in its reminder that little has changed in the intervening period. The \"plague\" of racism and deprivation that dogs Turnage's Oedipus is still with us. Our response to the opera now is sadness, rather than outrage. </p> <p>Sadness is very much the dominant tone of Clare Venables's affecting production. Venables is less interested in the work's politics than in its psychology. The tragic power of her staging derives from the conflict between her depiction of the sexual contentment between Eddie and the mother he has inadvertently married, and our knowledge that the relationship must collapse in anguish once the truth is out. </p> <p>Riccardo Simonetti, louchely handsome, and Louise Mott, very much a tart with a heart, caress each other with the convincing intimacy of lovers who believe that nothing can affect them. When reality dawns, he can't touch her at all. She clings to his legs in desperation. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Venables combines clarity with garishness. Traffic signs indicate the implacable fate that drives Eddie on. Huge video screens carry images of the race riots that swirl round him. Neon lights suggest London's tawdry allure. </p> <p>The score remains compelling, a combination of Stravinskyan neoclassical clarity and the jazz-influenced atonality of Berg's Lulu. Diego Masson, conducting the London Sinfonietta fiercely, brings its pungent lyricism and darkness to life. Thesingers - Simonetti, Mott, Richard Chew and Louisa Kennedy-Richardson - are all outstanding. The packed house consisted mostly of teenagers. Whatever one thinks of Greek, it has brought a new audience to opera, for which we must be grateful. </p> <p>\u0095 Turner Sims Concert Hall, Southampton (023-8059 5151) tonight, then touring to Huddersfield and Cheltenham.</p>",

The tragic power of her staging derives from the conflict between her depiction of the sexual contentment between Eddie and the mother he has inadvertently married, and our knowledge that the relationship must collapse in anguish once the truth is out. Riccardo Simonetti, louchely handsome, and Louise Mott, very much a tart with a heart, caress each other with the convincing intimacy of lovers who believe that nothing can affect them. When reality dawns, he can't touch her at all. She clings to his legs in desperation. Elsewhere, Venables combines clarity with garishness. Traffic signs indicate the implacable fate that drives Eddie on. Huge video screens carry images of the race riots that swirl round him. Neon lights suggest London's tawdry allure. The score remains compelling, a combination of Stravinskyan neoclassical clarity and the jazz-influenced atonality of Berg's Lulu. Diego Masson, conducting the London Sinfonietta fiercely, brings its pungent lyricism and darkness to life. Thesingers - Simonetti, Mott, Richard Chew and Louisa Kennedy-Richardson - are all outstanding. The packed house consisted mostly of teenagers. Whatever one thinks of Greek, it has brought a new audience to opera, for which we must be grateful. \u0095 Turner Sims Concert Hall, Southampton (023-8059 5151) tonight, then touring to Huddersfield and Cheltenham.",

Or the customer in Kent who was shocked to see their neighbour's chimney crash into their garden and land on a wrought iron table. Or the instance of a lawnmover which was blown over a fence and into the next door garden. </p> <p>The most common claims this week have been for tiles blown from a roof, often causing damage to a car or other property below, flooded cars and chimney stacks collapsing. </p> <p>Eagle Star says that most of its recent claims have come from the Birmingham area and have been for an average of \u00a3500. </p> <p>But what should you do if your home is hit by an ill wind or hellish high water? Are you covered, and are you going to face a long slog ar guing with the insurance company? </p> <p>One thing that few people will be able to claim for is wrecked garden fences - hardly any policies cover them. </p> <p>Direct Line says that storm damage is automatically covered by its buildings and contents insurance, which covers outbuildings, garages and sheds but does not include fences, trees or gates. Eagle Star will cover the tree but not the fence; it will be up to you to check the terms of your policy. </p> <p>Most insurers provide emergency 24 hour helplines to deal with immediate enquiries, giving details of approved carpenters, plumbers and electricians to deal with repairs in your area. But Jeffrey Salmon of Salmon Assessors makes the point that you should always take it upon yourself to minimise the damage, even if that means calling a plumber without the nod from your insurer. </p> <p>\"Do not depend on your insurer - they may take up to three weeks to do anything about your claim.

Insurers are obliged to pay for any work you have done which is deemed to have mitigated your loss.\" </p> <p>Eagle Star says it pays bills directly to the supplier and that no claims form is required - the process is conducted over the phone. But for larger repair jobs the contact should have been made with the insurer before you commission the work, or you could end up paying for it yourself. </p> <p>In the case of large claims, that is for \u00a31,000 or more, the insurer generally appoints a loss adjuster to manage the claim. The loss adjuster is supposed to be independent, but is appointed by the insurance company and so presumably will be trying to keep the amount paid out to a minimum. You could consider countering this by appointing a loss assessor who works for the policy holder to maximise the payout. </p> <p>They work on a no-win, no-fee basis, and usually take 10% of the amount paid \"although we generally increase the claimants payout by around 30%,\" says Mr Salmon. Find your local loss assessor in the Yellow Pages. </p> <p><strong> Roof damage</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Always use plastic sheeting or a tarpaulin to prevent water leaking through a storm damaged roof. </p> <p>\u0095 If the damage consists of just a couple of tiles which have fallen, it may be advisable for you to pay for the repairs yourself - although remember that a call out charge alone can be as much as \u00a350. Rebecca Hadley, of AA Insurance Services, says that if you make more than one claim in a year, you will either lose your no-claims bonus or your premium will be increased by an average of 20% (which amounts to the same thing) the next year.

Your insurance should cover the cost of this. </p> <p>\u0095 Collect water in buckets and where ceilings are bulging with water you should pierce the plaster with a broom handle to let it through. </p> <p>\u0095 Hire one or more dehumidifiers and keep them for as long as necessary, which could be three weeks or more. \"If you get wet rot six or seven months after a flood, you will find this is not covered by insurance,\" explains Mr Salmon.

      "body": "<p>The big four banks were taken to task yesterday over the way in which they treat small business customers at an unprecedented public hearing where complaints ranged from allegations of deliberate overcharging to the difficulty of seeking redress. </p> <p>Organisations representing small businesses said the vast majority of their members were unhappy about the fees and charges they faced and added that all too often, the banks were seen as overbearing and impersonal.

      "bodyText": "The big four banks were taken to task yesterday over the way in which they treat small business customers at an unprecedented public hearing where complaints ranged from allegations of deliberate overcharging to the difficulty of seeking redress. Organisations representing small businesses said the vast majority of their members were unhappy about the fees and charges they faced and added that all too often, the banks were seen as overbearing and impersonal. The banks hit back, denying charges of profiteering and claiming that in real terms charges had fallen in recent years. Yesterday's open meeting was held by the competition commission as part of its scrutiny of the level of competition in the small business banking sector. This follows the publication in March of the Cruickshank review of banking, which concluded there were \"real problems\" in the way banks served Britain's 3.5m small businesses, and little prospect of effective competition. Fod Barnes, a former member of the banking review team, told the hearing it had found evidence of excess profitability, linked partly to the concentrated nature of the market - the big four alone provide banking services to 83% of small businesses - and the fact that it was difficult for entrants to gain a foothold. The Federation of Small Businesses, which has 155,000 members, said its latest survey on banking services found that 73% of those questioned were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with charges. Presentations were made by Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, which now owns NatWest. Lloyds TSB said it believed that there was \"real and effective competition\" in the provision of banking services, there were no substantial barriers to entrants and that profits were not excessive. Some of the bankers speaking were prepared to hold their hands up and admit to their failings. Talking about the early 1990s recession, Barclays Business Banking chief executive David Roberts said: \"We had relationships with customers that were, quite frankly, awful. There was fear on both sides.\" The commission is expected to report to trade secretary Stephen Byers in June.",

      "body": "<p>Credit card companies are privately slapping hefty fines on rogue websites for misusing people's card details amid a big jump in complaints about internet fraud, it emerged this week. </p> <p>Much of the problem centres on \"adult\" websites and other disreputable merchants, most of which tend to be based in America or offshore locations such as the US Virgin Islands, that are fleecing credit card-holders in the UK and around the world. </p> <p>Britain is a mecca for credit card fraudsters. Incredibly, more than half of all credit card transactions in Europe take place in the UK and more than half of Europe's card fraud happens here too. And the growth of shopping on the web has the potential to make matters worse. </p> <p>This week, British and US regulators added to fears over net purchases when they warned web users to watch out for internet fraudsters. Officials said they were taking action against more than 250 cyber conmen, mainly in the US, who have been tricking gullible web users. </p> <p>Mastercard/Europay, the international payments organisation, disclosed to Jobs &amp; Money that since June it has fined around 30 websites, many of them sites selling pornographic images and goods, which have generated the largest number of disputed online transactions. </p> <p>Mastercard/Europay carried out research into where credit card disputes - such as alleged fraud and complaints about unsent goods - were arising, and found that about 50% of them related to e-commerce. And about half of these e-commerce disputes related to adult websites. </p> <p>One of the most popular scams operated by US-based adult sites involves requests for users' credit card details, either to pay a \"one-off\" subscription fee or simply to act as proof that customers are over 18. The individual does this, and then he or she finds they are being charged $25-$30 every month by the site - a regular payment they clearly haven't agreed to. Attempts to get the unauthorised payments stopped run up against toll-free phone numbers that only work in America, with no address to write to. </p> <p>Other sites, some of them auction and holiday websites, are taking credit card numbers and passwords and using them to go shopping at major online retailers that might have been visited by the customer. Research shows that people tend to use one password for all their online shopping and rogue sites exploit this fact. They take the card details and password and visit sites that only need a password before allowing customers to shop. CDs and other goods can be bought in large numbers and sent on to an address in another country. </p> <p>So what can the victims do? The fact that it may involve porn means some people will be too embarrassed to contact their bank or credit card company to try to get the matter rectified. Some will simply cut up their card, which is immensely frustrating for the card companies, for whom losing customers is an expensive business. </p> <p>MasterCard/Europay is now hitting back, and earlier this year put in place a policy where if the number of disputed transactions exceeds a certain amount for two consecutive months, it fines the website's bank (it can't fine the sites directly). And these are no token penalties either - the fines start at $5,000 and rise to a hefty $100,000. The October fines were the most severe yet imposed, and are expected to lead to a crackdown on guilty sites. </p> <p>\"Nearly all the people on the list [of those fined] have been what you would call disreputable merchants,\" says Paul Lucraft at Mastercard/Europay. They are all based in America or offshore America. </p> <p>Mr Lucraft stresses that Mastercard/Europay is not mounting a moral crusade against adult websites. \"It just happens to be that a number of the people who are ripping off the system are hiding behind these sites.\" It probably costs the porn sites \"a few cents\" to post images on the net and they are collecting perhaps $30 a month from hundreds or thousands of individuals, he adds. </p> <p>Lack of confidence in net security is deterring millions of people from buying on-line. Future Foundation, a think-tank, says that security topped the list when it asked people what they consider the most important service criteria. It quizzed 1,000 people and found that 76% of non-internet shoppers say that when they do come to make their first online purchase, they will want to deal with brand names they trust - not least because of widespread fears about security. </p> <p>Measures are being put in place to give consumers greater protection against online fraud. Government rules came into force this week which give new rights to people who shop via the internet, phone or mail order. </p> <p> Ministers have amended the Consumer Credit Act so that people are no longer liable for the first \u00a350 when someone uses their credit or debit card to make fraudulent purchases. There is also a new seven-day cooling-off period during which you can change your mind and have your money refunded. </p> <p>In this climate of concern, some companies are now offering nervous net shoppers peace of mind for a price. A company called CPP (Card Protection Plan) recently launched \"e-shopsafe\", described as the first comprehensive insurance policy designed to protect internet shoppers against fraud. It costs \u00a310 a year and covers shopping done via any secure site worldwide - but it may only be worth con- sidering if you do a lot of shopping from over-seas websites because some of the protection it offers is already provided within the new UK rights that came into force on Tuesday. </p> <p>Ms W, a marketing manager from York (she didn't wish to be identified), took out an e-shopsafe policy after she bought a book about environmental volunteer holidays over the internet - but later found her credit card details had been used by a fraudster to buy pornography. </p> <p>Two months later, three transactions appeared on her statement for amounts under $30 that she most definitely didn't recognise. \"When I looked closely I was horrified to see the name of the retailer I had supposedly shopped with. There was no doubt as to what they sold.\" </p> <p>She was eventually reimbursed for the fraudulent transactions but the incident has severely dented her confidence. \"I was surprised at how easy it all seemed for the fraudster. It has also made me more vigilant in checking my credit card statements.\" </p> <p>Parool Patel, a freelance public relations director, was the victim of a similar (non porn-related) incident earlier this year when his statement showed US dollar purchases he had not made. He wondered if it might be internet-related as he had only recently been browsing the net for books and CDs. He contacted the card company which put the transaction into a \"dispute account\" and has heard nothing since. \"I presume they have resolved the fraud or absorbed the cost,\" says Mr Patel. </p> <p>In the longer term, a number of further measures are planned to combat card fraud, both online (which accounts for a small but growing percentage of total card fraud losses) and offline. The UK banking industry is currently rolling out a new generation of \"smart\" credit and debit cards containing computer chips but it's proving to be an agonisingly slow process. Though the roll-out commenced 18 months ago, currently only around 10m of the 120m cards in circulation have chips. </p> <p>These new cards are more difficult and costly to counterfeit than traditional cards with a magnetic strip on the back, which are falling foul of a fast-growing problem called \"skimming\", where fraudsters copy data from a genuine card on to a blank card without your knowledge. </p> <p>This might happen in a restaurant or bar where a crooked waiter takes your card away when you pay and secretly copies it. This is what happened to Adam Mason, 26, a consultant at a London sports marketing company. A few weeks ago he suddenly found he couldn't obtain cash from an ATM with his Barclaycard. When he called the company, they said they had put a block on his card because its fraud office had noticed his plastic had been used simultaneously in London and Morecambe - someone had run up a \u00a3400 bill in two days at various stores in the Lancashire town using a counterfeit card containing his data. </p> <p>Adam had only recently made his first online purchase and initially believed this to be the source of the fraud, but he now reckons it was a result of a visit to \"a particularly dodgy bar\" where he had put his card behind the counter and had never received a receipt. Barclaycard fully reimbursed Adam and also recovered the counterfeit card, and he is full of praise for the way it sorted out the matter so quickly. </p> <p><strong>Tips for foiling fraudsters</strong> </p> <p>Here we identify the online fraudsters' tricks of the trade and offer some advice on how to avoid their clutches. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The password trick:</strong> A crook running a rogue website takes a customer's credit card number and password to go shopping at major online retailers that might also have been visited by that person. Many people use the same password for all their online shopping, so the crook will go to sites that only need a password before they allow customers to buy goods. Armed with the person's credit card details, they can then go on a shopping spree. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use different passwords on different sites. Also, just as you wouldn't give your credit or debit card details to someone you don't know, make sure you trust the online retailer, says CPP, a company specialising in credit card protection. \"Check out an unfamiliar site before you buy,\" it adds. \"Do they have a secure site? Do they provide full address and contact details, not just a mobile phone number? Which trade organisations is the company a member of?\" Secure sites typically display a padlock symbol on your screen when you are entering your details. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The multiple debit trick:</strong> Asking visitors to the site to pay a \"one-off\" fee which turns into a regular amount charged to your credit card every month. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> As we explain in the main article, the sites notorious for doing this are US-based porn sites, so you're clearly dabbling in dangerous waters and some people will have little sympathy for your predicament if this happens to you. If you are going to deal with a website that asks for such a one-off fee, make sure there is a contact phone number that works and check for a full address on the site. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The undelivered goods trick</strong> </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> The advice above applies here too. You've got a better chance of sorting the matter out if the site is in the UK - at least it will be covered by our laws. As we have highlighted, new rules came in this week giving greater protection to people who shop online. One of the new rights is that if you haven't received the goods within 30 days, you are entitled to your money back, unless both parties have agreed to a longer period or alternative goods/services are supplied and you accept them. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The email sales trick:</strong> A site that has your card details emails you with an offer to \"upgrade\" the service you receive. It says this will cost you perhaps an extra $19.99 a month and that if you don't reply within X days it will automatically start deducting the amount from your credit card. You do not get the message in time - it might be an old email address or you're on holiday - and you end up with a regular payment going out that you haven't authorised. </p> <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Check your emails regularly if you subscribe to a site that has your card details. And go through your credit card statement with a fine-tooth comb.</p>",

Much of the problem centres on \"adult\" websites and other disreputable merchants, most of which tend to be based in America or offshore locations such as the US Virgin Islands, that are fleecing credit card-holders in the UK and around the world. Britain is a mecca for credit card fraudsters. Incredibly, more than half of all credit card transactions in Europe take place in the UK and more than half of Europe's card fraud happens here too. And the growth of shopping on the web has the potential to make matters worse. This week, British and US regulators added to fears over net purchases when they warned web users to watch out for internet fraudsters. Officials said they were taking action against more than 250 cyber conmen, mainly in the US, who have been tricking gullible web users. Mastercard/Europay, the international payments organisation, disclosed to Jobs &amp; Money that since June it has fined around 30 websites, many of them sites selling pornographic images and goods, which have generated the largest number of disputed online transactions. Mastercard/Europay carried out research into where credit card disputes - such as alleged fraud and complaints about unsent goods - were arising, and found that about 50% of them related to e-commerce. And about half of these e-commerce disputes related to adult websites. One of the most popular scams operated by US-based adult sites involves requests for users' credit card details, either to pay a \"one-off\" subscription fee or simply to act as proof that customers are over 18. The individual does this, and then he or she finds they are being charged $25-$30 every month by the site - a regular payment they clearly haven't agreed to. Attempts to get the unauthorised payments stopped run up against toll-free phone numbers that only work in America, with no address to write to. Other sites, some of them auction and holiday websites, are taking credit card numbers and passwords and using them to go shopping at major online retailers that might have been visited by the customer. Research shows that people tend to use one password for all their online shopping and rogue sites exploit this fact. They take the card details and password and visit sites that only need a password before allowing customers to shop. CDs and other goods can be bought in large numbers and sent on to an address in another country. So what can the victims do? The fact that it may involve porn means some people will be too embarrassed to contact their bank or credit card company to try to get the matter rectified. Some will simply cut up their card, which is immensely frustrating for the card companies, for whom losing customers is an expensive business. MasterCard/Europay is now hitting back, and earlier this year put in place a policy where if the number of disputed transactions exceeds a certain amount for two consecutive months, it fines the website's bank (it can't fine the sites directly). And these are no token penalties either - the fines start at $5,000 and rise to a hefty $100,000. The October fines were the most severe yet imposed, and are expected to lead to a crackdown on guilty sites. \"Nearly all the people on the list [of those fined] have been what you would call disreputable merchants,\" says Paul Lucraft at Mastercard/Europay. They are all based in America or offshore America. Mr Lucraft stresses that Mastercard/Europay is not mounting a moral crusade against adult websites. \"It just happens to be that a number of the people who are ripping off the system are hiding behind these sites.\" It probably costs the porn sites \"a few cents\" to post images on the net and they are collecting perhaps $30 a month from hundreds or thousands of individuals, he adds. Lack of confidence in net security is deterring millions of people from buying on-line. Future Foundation, a think-tank, says that security topped the list when it asked people what they consider the most important service criteria. It quizzed 1,000 people and found that 76% of non-internet shoppers say that when they do come to make their first online purchase, they will want to deal with brand names they trust - not least because of widespread fears about security. Measures are being put in place to give consumers greater protection against online fraud. Government rules came into force this week which give new rights to people who shop via the internet, phone or mail order. Ministers have amended the Consumer Credit Act so that people are no longer liable for the first \u00a350 when someone uses their credit or debit card to make fraudulent purchases. There is also a new seven-day cooling-off period during which you can change your mind and have your money refunded. In this climate of concern, some companies are now offering nervous net shoppers peace of mind for a price. A company called CPP (Card Protection Plan) recently launched \"e-shopsafe\", described as the first comprehensive insurance policy designed to protect internet shoppers against fraud. It costs \u00a310 a year and covers shopping done via any secure site worldwide - but it may only be worth con- sidering if you do a lot of shopping from over-seas websites because some of the protection it offers is already provided within the new UK rights that came into force on Tuesday. Ms W, a marketing manager from York (she didn't wish to be identified), took out an e-shopsafe policy after she bought a book about environmental volunteer holidays over the internet - but later found her credit card details had been used by a fraudster to buy pornography. Two months later, three transactions appeared on her statement for amounts under $30 that she most definitely didn't recognise. \"When I looked closely I was horrified to see the name of the retailer I had supposedly shopped with. There was no doubt as to what they sold.\" She was eventually reimbursed for the fraudulent transactions but the incident has severely dented her confidence. \"I was surprised at how easy it all seemed for the fraudster. It has also made me more vigilant in checking my credit card statements.\" Parool Patel, a freelance public relations director, was the victim of a similar (non porn-related) incident earlier this year when his statement showed US dollar purchases he had not made. He wondered if it might be internet-related as he had only recently been browsing the net for books and CDs. He contacted the card company which put the transaction into a \"dispute account\" and has heard nothing since. \"I presume they have resolved the fraud or absorbed the cost,\" says Mr Patel. In the longer term, a number of further measures are planned to combat card fraud, both online (which accounts for a small but growing percentage of total card fraud losses) and offline. The UK banking industry is currently rolling out a new generation of \"smart\" credit and debit cards containing computer chips but it's proving to be an agonisingly slow process. Though the roll-out commenced 18 months ago, currently only around 10m of the 120m cards in circulation have chips. These new cards are more difficult and costly to counterfeit than traditional cards with a magnetic strip on the back, which are falling foul of a fast-growing problem called \"skimming\", where fraudsters copy data from a genuine card on to a blank card without your knowledge. This might happen in a restaurant or bar where a crooked waiter takes your card away when you pay and secretly copies it. This is what happened to Adam Mason, 26, a consultant at a London sports marketing company. A few weeks ago he suddenly found he couldn't obtain cash from an ATM with his Barclaycard. When he called the company, they said they had put a block on his card because its fraud office had noticed his plastic had been used simultaneously in London and Morecambe - someone had run up a \u00a3400 bill in two days at various stores in the Lancashire town using a counterfeit card containing his data. Adam had only recently made his first online purchase and initially believed this to be the source of the fraud, but he now reckons it was a result of a visit to \"a particularly dodgy bar\" where he had put his card behind the counter and had never received a receipt. Barclaycard fully reimbursed Adam and also recovered the counterfeit card, and he is full of praise for the way it sorted out the matter so quickly. Tips for foiling fraudsters Here we identify the online fraudsters' tricks of the trade and offer some advice on how to avoid their clutches. \u0095 The password trick: A crook running a rogue website takes a customer's credit card number and password to go shopping at major online retailers that might also have been visited by that person. Many people use the same password for all their online shopping, so the crook will go to sites that only need a password before they allow customers to buy goods. Armed with the person's credit card details, they can then go on a shopping spree. Tip: Use different passwords on different sites. Also, just as you wouldn't give your credit or debit card details to someone you don't know, make sure you trust the online retailer, says CPP, a company specialising in credit card protection. \"Check out an unfamiliar site before you buy,\" it adds. \"Do they have a secure site? Do they provide full address and contact details, not just a mobile phone number? Which trade organisations is the company a member of?\" Secure sites typically display a padlock symbol on your screen when you are entering your details. \u0095 The multiple debit trick: Asking visitors to the site to pay a \"one-off\" fee which turns into a regular amount charged to your credit card every month. Tip: As we explain in the main article, the sites notorious for doing this are US-based porn sites, so you're clearly dabbling in dangerous waters and some people will have little sympathy for your predicament if this happens to you. If you are going to deal with a website that asks for such a one-off fee, make sure there is a contact phone number that works and check for a full address on the site. \u0095 The undelivered goods trick Tip: The advice above applies here too. You've got a better chance of sorting the matter out if the site is in the UK - at least it will be covered by our laws. As we have highlighted, new rules came in this week giving greater protection to people who shop online. One of the new rights is that if you haven't received the goods within 30 days, you are entitled to your money back, unless both parties have agreed to a longer period or alternative goods/services are supplied and you accept them. \u0095 The email sales trick: A site that has your card details emails you with an offer to \"upgrade\" the service you receive. It says this will cost you perhaps an extra $19.99 a month and that if you don't reply within X days it will automatically start deducting the amount from your credit card. You do not get the message in time - it might be an old email address or you're on holiday - and you end up with a regular payment going out that you haven't authorised. Tip: Check your emails regularly if you subscribe to a site that has your card details. And go through your credit card statement with a fine-tooth comb.",

      "body": "<p>When Sir William Jaffray became a Lloyd's underwriter in the 1980s he was not seeking a multimillion-pound income, just a \"reasonable return at a low risk\". </p> <p>The former fine art dealer and loss adjuster says he was persuaded by glossy brochures extolling Lloyd's virtues as a \"sound, blue chip institution\" - and hoped to make up to \u00a35,000 a year. Almost 20 years later the relationship has turned very sour, with Sir William and more than 200 fellow underwriters, known as Names, locked in a legal dispute with the insurance market. </p> <p>Yesterday in London's high court the latest episode in this decade-long wrangle was played out. In a ruling which ran to more than 600 pages, Mr Justice Cresswell dismissed Names' claims that Lloyd's knew, but failed to tell them, of an impending avalanche of asbestos-related claims before they pledged their wealth. </p> <p>As the judgment was read out during a 90 minute hearing there were gasps from the Names and their families, who were packed into Court 4, and laughter when it was suggested Lloyd's should establish an independent panel to assess the cases. </p> <p>Many of those watching the proceedings had become involved with Lloyd's in the late 1970s and 1980s, when agents were vigorously recruiting wealthy individuals to act as underwriters. Many investors rushed to join following the introduction of supertax in the 1970s at up to 98%. </p> <p>In exchange for handsome tax benefits and the promise of substantial returns, the Names pledged to cover losses which, in many cases, far exceeded their means. Today many of those who signed up are facing financial ruin as a result of either underwriting the huge asbestos-related losses or fighting Lloyd's through the courts. </p> <p>Of the 34,000 underwriters who lost money as a result of the crisis, 95% chose to settle with Lloyd's in 1996 and pay back \u00a3100,000 each. More have since come to agreement, but a rebel band of 230 Names rejected settlement offers and insisted they should not be liable. Their action is thought to have already cost around \u00a325m in legal fees. </p> <p>Other overseas cases against Lloyd's are still outstanding, with action under way in Canada, Australia and Belgium, while an individual case has just been settled in the US. </p> <p>The court was told yesterday that the Names are the in nocent victims of unscrupulous agents who were guilty of a \"staggering\" catalogue of \"failings and incompetence\". Lloyd's admitted there were unacceptable practices among some agents in the 1980s, but said it was up to Names to recover losses from the agents and not the regulator, Lloyd's. </p> <p>Estimates for individual losses range from \u00a3120,000 to \u00a35m, with many of the Names having been forced to sell their houses and businesses. </p> <p>Life would have been tough enough without asbestos claims due to the exceptional number of catastrophes in the late 1980s, including Piper Alpha, the San Francisco earthquake and ferocious storms in northern Europe. </p> <p>It was asbestos which brought the most financial devastation. In the early 1980s the volume of claims for diseases such as asbestosis and lung cancer stood at 6,000 a year. Ten years later this figure had increased fourfold to 24,000. </p> <p>\"I recognise that no words can adequately describe the devastation that has been caused to many individuals in financial and personal terms,\" Mr Justice Cresswell said. </p> <p>Max Taylor, Lloyd's chairman, said dissident Names would fail if they took the case to the European court of justice. He claimed that attempts to sue a regulator for anything other than fraud would be resisted. \"All other regulators are protected from legal suits in this way - including the FSA.\" </p> <p>Mr Jaffray hopes to use the new Human Rights Act to undermine the Lloyd's claim that he must prove fraud, rather than a lesser offence of negligence. </p> <p>Mr Taylor emphasised, that he was ready to negotiate with any of the 1,650 Names who have yet to make a settlement and would take into account their personal financial situations. </p> <p> <strong>Loss cause Crisis at Lime Street</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1970s</strong><br> </p> <p><strong>Lloyd's</strong> boasts 25 years of unbroken profits apart from 1966-68. <strong> Cromer</strong> <strong> report</strong> into lossmaking years <strong> partly supressed</strong> , including criticism of quality of information given to Names.

      "bodyText": "When Sir William Jaffray became a Lloyd's underwriter in the 1980s he was not seeking a multimillion-pound income, just a \"reasonable return at a low risk\". The former fine art dealer and loss adjuster says he was persuaded by glossy brochures extolling Lloyd's virtues as a \"sound, blue chip institution\" - and hoped to make up to \u00a35,000 a year. Almost 20 years later the relationship has turned very sour, with Sir William and more than 200 fellow underwriters, known as Names, locked in a legal dispute with the insurance market. Yesterday in London's high court the latest episode in this decade-long wrangle was played out. In a ruling which ran to more than 600 pages, Mr Justice Cresswell dismissed Names' claims that Lloyd's knew, but failed to tell them, of an impending avalanche of asbestos-related claims before they pledged their wealth. As the judgment was read out during a 90 minute hearing there were gasps from the Names and their families, who were packed into Court 4, and laughter when it was suggested Lloyd's should establish an independent panel to assess the cases. Many of those watching the proceedings had become involved with Lloyd's in the late 1970s and 1980s, when agents were vigorously recruiting wealthy individuals to act as underwriters. Many investors rushed to join following the introduction of supertax in the 1970s at up to 98%. In exchange for handsome tax benefits and the promise of substantial returns, the Names pledged to cover losses which, in many cases, far exceeded their means. Today many of those who signed up are facing financial ruin as a result of either underwriting the huge asbestos-related losses or fighting Lloyd's through the courts. Of the 34,000 underwriters who lost money as a result of the crisis, 95% chose to settle with Lloyd's in 1996 and pay back \u00a3100,000 each. More have since come to agreement, but a rebel band of 230 Names rejected settlement offers and insisted they should not be liable. Their action is thought to have already cost around \u00a325m in legal fees. Other overseas cases against Lloyd's are still outstanding, with action under way in Canada, Australia and Belgium, while an individual case has just been settled in the US. The court was told yesterday that the Names are the in nocent victims of unscrupulous agents who were guilty of a \"staggering\" catalogue of \"failings and incompetence\". Lloyd's admitted there were unacceptable practices among some agents in the 1980s, but said it was up to Names to recover losses from the agents and not the regulator, Lloyd's. Estimates for individual losses range from \u00a3120,000 to \u00a35m, with many of the Names having been forced to sell their houses and businesses. Life would have been tough enough without asbestos claims due to the exceptional number of catastrophes in the late 1980s, including Piper Alpha, the San Francisco earthquake and ferocious storms in northern Europe. It was asbestos which brought the most financial devastation. In the early 1980s the volume of claims for diseases such as asbestosis and lung cancer stood at 6,000 a year. Ten years later this figure had increased fourfold to 24,000. \"I recognise that no words can adequately describe the devastation that has been caused to many individuals in financial and personal terms,\" Mr Justice Cresswell said. Max Taylor, Lloyd's chairman, said dissident Names would fail if they took the case to the European court of justice. He claimed that attempts to sue a regulator for anything other than fraud would be resisted. \"All other regulators are protected from legal suits in this way - including the FSA.\" Mr Jaffray hopes to use the new Human Rights Act to undermine the Lloyd's claim that he must prove fraud, rather than a lesser offence of negligence. Mr Taylor emphasised, that he was ready to negotiate with any of the 1,650 Names who have yet to make a settlement and would take into account their personal financial situations. Loss cause Crisis at Lime Street 1970s Lloyd's boasts 25 years of unbroken profits apart from 1966-68. Cromer report into lossmaking years partly supressed , including criticism of quality of information given to Names. Subsequent huge returns and tax breaks for investors prove attractive after Labour government introduces supertax at 98% . Rising house prices allow more investors to pass wealth test. Market begins big expansion 1980s Syndicates underwrite health and safety insurance for US corporations. A series of scandals involving syndicates losing millions of pounds sparks Fisher report. He fails to break down conflicts of interest - underwriting agencies, which seek to insure best risks at highest premiums, continue to be owned by brokers, which seek lowest premiums for clients. US asbestosis and environmental damage claims mount 1990s Losses reach \u00a38bn. Some 95% of the 34,000 Names transfer to Equitas reinsurance, set up by Lloyd's, paying premiums of \u00a3100,000 each. Some 1,700 refuse to transfer and 600 are sued by Lloyd's. In 1997 group led by Sir William Jaffray counter-claim that they were recruited fraudulently. Collectively the 230 are said by Lloyd's to owe \u00a351m 2000 February, Jaffray case begins. November, Mr Justice Cresswell concludes fraud is unproven but lambasts Lloyd's for staggering incompetence.",

This is what a change in art history looks like. Correggio employed him as an assistant on one project; Parmigianino never ran such a successful studio.

His line is serpentine, his bodies weirdly elongated. He sees the body as an engine of drama, drawing a fragmented stone torso with sinister violence, and nature as a vast theatre in a drawing of Trees on a Bluff (1522-24). He drew erotica too: Priapus and Lotis (c.1530-40) allows us to spy on a sleeping nymph. </p> <p>In Parmigianino's second probable self-portrait, A Man Holding a Pregnant Bitch (c.1530-40), he sits holding up his dog on her hind legs. It's a funny little piece, perhaps done for a friend. The fact that he thought it worth his while makes Parmigianino an extraordinarily fresh artist. You can't imagine Correggio wasting his time on such a thing. </p> <p> \u0095 Until January 7. Details: 020-7636 1555.</p>",
