      "body": "<p>Whatever happened to Winona Ryder? Once the great doe-eyed hope of the post-Brat generation in Hollywood, Ryder has slowly receded into one of the least crucial stars still claiming marquee status. Her slip into inconsequentiality has occurred almost without notice. The past four years have seen one notable vehicle, 1999's Girl, Interrupted, which proved to be more of a boon to Angelina Jolie's career than Ryder's. In the past 12 months, Ryder's output has been the lamentable satanic thriller Lost Souls and the dreary May-September weepie Autumn in New York, both virtually unwatchable and both box-office flops in America. If there ever was a time when people went to and talked about Winona Ryder movies, that time has passed. </p> <p>Her rise to fame seem destined: born with the innocent-decadent visage of a Sade heroine, an all-American sense of everyday modesty, and a voice that cracked in all the wrong places, Ryder was a natural in a time when Michelle Pfeiffer was still dewy and Tom Hanks was still funny. Hitting screens at about the same time as River Phoenix, Michael J Fox, Julia Roberts and John Cusack, Ryder was immediately a hot property. She was confirmed as a teen icon both by Tim Burton's Beetlejuice, and Michael Lehmann's Heathers in 1988, and Jim McBride's Great Balls of Fire the following year. In the latter movie, she seemed the only possible choice to play Jerry Lee Lewis's child bride, opposite Dennis Quaid. From there, she was a name people knew, unforgettable in Tim Burton's 1990 Edward Scissorhands despite a preposterous blonde wig, and in Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula in 1992. She took her place amiably in Jim Jarmusch's 1991 ensemble piece Night on Earth (breathing the same air as Cassavetes legend Gena Rowlands), but you knew Ryder was a heavyweight when she co-starred in precious flops - Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael, Mermaids and The House of the Spirits - that never dimmed her fire. </p> <p>We sympathised with the Jewish starlet from the very beginning. We wanted her characters to win love and happiness nearly as much as we wanted little Montana-born Winona Horowitz to get all the breaks and stay a star. It helps that when she did attain stardom, she didn't abuse it. Rather, she used it to explore her classic-lit interests: to land the plum role in Martin Scorsese's 1993 The Age of Innocence (and with it an Oscar nomination), and to lead the way in Gillian Armstrong's Little Women. Though she doesn't have a producer's credit, Ryder enlisted most of that film's main cast and crew. She cast Christian Bale as Laurie, raising his profile from bit-part actor to major Hollywood player. </p> <p>But fortunes fall with dizzying speed in Tinseltown, just as often as they linger for decades with no visible means of support. The kind of career you get seems to be largely a sum of blind chance and unholy factors. There are many simple considerations that we, the public, rarely imagine to be elements in the stardom equation. Some stars go crazy, some disappear because of drug addiction (James Caan most famously), some quit to have families or pursue origami or write novels. Some, like William Hurt in the late 1980s dwindle and vanish simply because the actor \"doesn't like being a movie star\". Hurt went to Europe to escape Hollywood's tail-wagging mentality. </p> <p>As consumers of stardom, we assume that access to the inner sanctum is some sort of ultimate goal, and that with stardom comes unlimited, unreasonable bliss. But if we squint through the layers of lacquer the public relations industry has applied over the years, it's easy to see that being a Hollywood god or goddess can be misery incarnate. Robert Downey Jr knows the LA penal system intimately for a reason - being rich and famous can often mean being wretched and lost. Not that we should feel sorry for any of them - they could just leave and live normal lives for a while. </p> <p>Acting careers can also be subject to another phantom force: the competence, incompetence, intelligence, brainlessness, sanity and/or ingrown madness of agents. What may look to the outside world like an actor's bad choice or decline may in fact be the work of a cackhanded agent. It's clear that, for example, Ashley Judd desperately needs the extremely smart and forceful agent that Tobey Maguire clearly has. And so on. </p> <p>So, what's the deal with Winona? It's impossible to know for sure, but there are visible potholes in her career track. Everything seemed to be going smoothly in 1994 with Little Women and Reality Bites, both projects reflecting a knack Ryder has seemed to have lost since: surrounding herself with superb and underused talent. The next year's How to Make an American Quilt was overlooked as a well-meant, shame-free career blip, but 1996's Boys was not: that miserable boys school drama marked the point at which Ryder's star began to wane. After Little Women, there was the unspoken and somewhat correct belief that Ryder picked and nurtured her own projects; unlike, say, Cameron Diaz, Ryder gets blamed if her films bomb, so she began to play safe by taking third leads, such as the horny bitch in Nicholas Hytner's The Crucible in 1996 and the mousy android in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien Resurrection the following year, the first as perfect a choice for CV-constructing as the second was utterly pointless. Was it necessary to play second banana to Sigourney Weaver's aging intergalactic Mother Courage? It's a role clearly made for someone starting out, not an established name. </p> <p>Ryder disappeared for a couple of years, then resurfaced in another carefully shepherded project, Girl, Interrupted, which this time bore an official Ryder producer credit. For some, that tame girls-in- the-nut-house movie was worth the wait, and Ryder's reputation was untainted. But it did little to restore her earlier promise. Autumn in New York (as yet unreleased in the UK) and Lost Souls were evidently bids to regain visibility. All that's been visible, however, is Ryder's enormous, age-saddened eyes staring out at us from posters of movies no one wants to see. </p> <p>Don't underestimate her recent weight loss and waif routine as she approaches 30. In any case, Ryder's slow fade to black will only get worse: this year, besides a mere cameo in Simone, the new Andrew (The Truman Show) Niccol film about a digitally created film star, she's co-starring with Andy Garcia in Just to Be Together, the new film by a stroke-impaired 88-year-old Michelangelo Antonioni. Hardly a sharp career move. Even in Antonioni's heyday, an American star looking for prestige in Euro art-films was an American star at the end of his or her tether. Today, it's a detour so far off the comeback trail that Ryder may never find her way back to civilisation. </p> <p>\u0095 Lost Souls is released on January 12.</p>",

Some, like William Hurt in the late 1980s dwindle and vanish simply because the actor \"doesn't like being a movie star\". Hurt went to Europe to escape Hollywood's tail-wagging mentality. As consumers of stardom, we assume that access to the inner sanctum is some sort of ultimate goal, and that with stardom comes unlimited, unreasonable bliss. But if we squint through the layers of lacquer the public relations industry has applied over the years, it's easy to see that being a Hollywood god or goddess can be misery incarnate. Robert Downey Jr knows the LA penal system intimately for a reason - being rich and famous can often mean being wretched and lost. Not that we should feel sorry for any of them - they could just leave and live normal lives for a while. Acting careers can also be subject to another phantom force: the competence, incompetence, intelligence, brainlessness, sanity and/or ingrown madness of agents. What may look to the outside world like an actor's bad choice or decline may in fact be the work of a cackhanded agent. It's clear that, for example, Ashley Judd desperately needs the extremely smart and forceful agent that Tobey Maguire clearly has. And so on. So, what's the deal with Winona? It's impossible to know for sure, but there are visible potholes in her career track. Everything seemed to be going smoothly in 1994 with Little Women and Reality Bites, both projects reflecting a knack Ryder has seemed to have lost since: surrounding herself with superb and underused talent. The next year's How to Make an American Quilt was overlooked as a well-meant, shame-free career blip, but 1996's Boys was not: that miserable boys school drama marked the point at which Ryder's star began to wane. After Little Women, there was the unspoken and somewhat correct belief that Ryder picked and nurtured her own projects; unlike, say, Cameron Diaz, Ryder gets blamed if her films bomb, so she began to play safe by taking third leads, such as the horny bitch in Nicholas Hytner's The Crucible in 1996 and the mousy android in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's Alien Resurrection the following year, the first as perfect a choice for CV-constructing as the second was utterly pointless. Was it necessary to play second banana to Sigourney Weaver's aging intergalactic Mother Courage? It's a role clearly made for someone starting out, not an established name. Ryder disappeared for a couple of years, then resurfaced in another carefully shepherded project, Girl, Interrupted, which this time bore an official Ryder producer credit. For some, that tame girls-in- the-nut-house movie was worth the wait, and Ryder's reputation was untainted. But it did little to restore her earlier promise. Autumn in New York (as yet unreleased in the UK) and Lost Souls were evidently bids to regain visibility. All that's been visible, however, is Ryder's enormous, age-saddened eyes staring out at us from posters of movies no one wants to see. Don't underestimate her recent weight loss and waif routine as she approaches 30. In any case, Ryder's slow fade to black will only get worse: this year, besides a mere cameo in Simone, the new Andrew (The Truman Show) Niccol film about a digitally created film star, she's co-starring with Andy Garcia in Just to Be Together, the new film by a stroke-impaired 88-year-old Michelangelo Antonioni. Hardly a sharp career move. Even in Antonioni's heyday, an American star looking for prestige in Euro art-films was an American star at the end of his or her tether. Today, it's a detour so far off the comeback trail that Ryder may never find her way back to civilisation. \u0095 Lost Souls is released on January 12.",

The reasons for people deserting political parties are many, but not being able to give money is hardly one of them. In any case, small contributions would not necessarily have to be banned.

      "body": "<p>The Guardian's monarchy debate has opened up a raft of wider constitutional questions, including not just the role of the monarchy but also the role of parliament in the light of devolution. How much is Westminster still the parliament for the whole of the UK and how much a parliament for England? Our new book, The State and the Nations, exposes for the first time the extent to which Westminster already operates as an English parliament, and its potential to develop this role further.</p> <p>Post-devolution, some have suggested that there should be a separate English parliament to match the Scottish parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. This is not a realistic option. Those who demand one are in effect demanding a full-blown federation, in which the four historic nations would form the component parts. But there is no successful federation in the world where one of the parts is greater than around one-third of the whole. England, with four-fifths of the population, would be hugely dominant: even more dominant than Prussia in the old Germany. Nor would it meet the demands for representation coming from the English regions: to them, an English parliament looks like another form of London dominance.</p> <p>Nor is there any strong public demand: the Campaign for an English Parliament has attracted little public following during its weekly vigils in Parliament Square. When asked in last year's British Social Attitudes survey, 62% of the English said it would be best for England to be governed as it is now, with laws made by the UK parliament, while only 18% said it would be best for England to have its own parliament. And, intriguingly, 30% said they viewed the Houses of Parliament as English, or more English than British: while 27% viewed parliament as equally English and British.</p> <p>The English may have been uttering a greater constitutional truth than they knew. For buried within Westminster is an English parliament which devolution is beginning to disclose. Before devolution we had a three-in-one parliament, and it was clear when Westminster was operating as the legislature for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Post-devolution we are developing a four-in-one parliament, and it will need to become clearer when Westminster is operating in English mode. English business is transacted through the work of the select committees through the new standing committee on regional affairs (which will be open only to English MPs) through questions to ministers on English matters through Westminster Hall, which provides a further forum for English debates and through English legislation.</p> <p>At present, this English business is mixed up with other business. But if we just take the scrutiny function of Westminster, we can see how parliament is developing a sharper territorial focus. Among the select committees we have found four committees whose membership consists solely of English MPs. Three are on subjects you would expect - education and employment, health, and home affairs - matters in which Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland MPs no longer have an interest, because these subjects are now largely devolved. And if we look at the government departments which those select committees scrutinise, we find that their ministers are all MPs from English constituencies. Eight Whitehall home departments are now \"English\" ministries, and the only departments with ministers from Scotland and Wales (apart from the Scottish and Welsh Offices) are the all-UK departments: the Treasury, Foreign Office, DfID, Social Security, DTI.

      "bodyText": "The Guardian's monarchy debate has opened up a raft of wider constitutional questions, including not just the role of the monarchy but also the role of parliament in the light of devolution. How much is Westminster still the parliament for the whole of the UK and how much a parliament for England? Our new book, The State and the Nations, exposes for the first time the extent to which Westminster already operates as an English parliament, and its potential to develop this role further. Post-devolution, some have suggested that there should be a separate English parliament to match the Scottish parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. This is not a realistic option. Those who demand one are in effect demanding a full-blown federation, in which the four historic nations would form the component parts. But there is no successful federation in the world where one of the parts is greater than around one-third of the whole. England, with four-fifths of the population, would be hugely dominant: even more dominant than Prussia in the old Germany. Nor would it meet the demands for representation coming from the English regions: to them, an English parliament looks like another form of London dominance. Nor is there any strong public demand: the Campaign for an English Parliament has attracted little public following during its weekly vigils in Parliament Square. When asked in last year's British Social Attitudes survey, 62% of the English said it would be best for England to be governed as it is now, with laws made by the UK parliament, while only 18% said it would be best for England to have its own parliament. And, intriguingly, 30% said they viewed the Houses of Parliament as English, or more English than British: while 27% viewed parliament as equally English and British. The English may have been uttering a greater constitutional truth than they knew. For buried within Westminster is an English parliament which devolution is beginning to disclose. Before devolution we had a three-in-one parliament, and it was clear when Westminster was operating as the legislature for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Post-devolution we are developing a four-in-one parliament, and it will need to become clearer when Westminster is operating in English mode. English business is transacted through the work of the select committees through the new standing committee on regional affairs (which will be open only to English MPs) through questions to ministers on English matters through Westminster Hall, which provides a further forum for English debates and through English legislation. At present, this English business is mixed up with other business. But if we just take the scrutiny function of Westminster, we can see how parliament is developing a sharper territorial focus. Among the select committees we have found four committees whose membership consists solely of English MPs. Three are on subjects you would expect - education and employment, health, and home affairs - matters in which Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland MPs no longer have an interest, because these subjects are now largely devolved. And if we look at the government departments which those select committees scrutinise, we find that their ministers are all MPs from English constituencies. Eight Whitehall home departments are now \"English\" ministries, and the only departments with ministers from Scotland and Wales (apart from the Scottish and Welsh Offices) are the all-UK departments: the Treasury, Foreign Office, DfID, Social Security, DTI. In terms of English business, the main committees whose work included a significant English element are health, education and employment, environment, transport and the regions, and home affairs. Scotland, Wales and North ern Ireland not only have their select committees each also has a grand committee consisting of all the MPs for the territory. Up to now there has been no English equivalent to the territorial grand committees. But in April the House of Commons agreed to revive the standing committee on regional affairs, consisting of 13 members from English constituencies, with power to consider \"any matter relating to regional affairs in England\". Not a big or powerful committee but it would be the first English committee. And Margaret Beckett has indicated that the committee could expand its role if pressure for English forums at Westminster grows. I do not want to over-state these developments.

Last night's near-collision involved two Sussex-bound Connex South Central trains at Victoria station in central London. As a signal failure had led to signals at Victoria remaining red, one of the trains was allowed through a red light by a signalman. The other train departed without permission and only prompt action by the signalman, who cut the power to both trains, prevented a collision. The two trains finished only feet from each other and Railtrack and Connex launched an immediate inquiry. As Railtrack strove to meet the 18 January deadline set by the rail regulator, Tom Winsor, for producing a route by route recovery plan for the railways, a passenger group said that public confidence in the railways had sunk to \"probably its lowest point ever\". Mr Winsor said that rail disruption since the Hatfield derailment in October could continue until May - at least two weeks after Railtrack's Easter target for a resumption of normal services. However, it was \"highly likely\" the rail system would be back to normal by then, he added. \"I think that there will be substantial progress as January and February go on and by Easter we should have very substantial progress towards full recovery but I do not know when full recovery will take place and the train operators don't know.\" Mr Winsor has made a provisional enforcement order on Railtrack which means if the company does not produce the plans on time he could consider action leading to hefty fines. Railtrack said plans were already well advanced to provide updated route by route recovery programmes to the train operators before January 18. \"No-one's talking about fines at the moment, including the regulator,\" said chief executive Steve Marshall. \"The important thing is to get the information so passengers can really predict what travel is going to be like.\" He said Railtrack still predicted that normal services would be restored by Easter, despite Mr Winsor's comments about May.

Other bestsellers for the BBC's commercial arm included merchandising for another hit children's show, The Tweenies, and videos for anarchic comedy League of Gentlemen. BBC books alone accounted for an estimated \u00a310m in sales, led by top-selling autobiographies by Terry Wogan and Sir Steve Redgrave. Total sales for BBC Worldwide over Christmas are understood to be worth around \u00a320m. Bob the Builder's successes included CD-Roms and computer games and his Can We Fix It? single, which was the best-seller of 2000 as well as the Christmas number one. The Tweenies similarly notched up a big pop hit with their single, which spent eight weeks in the top 10, as well as an educational CD-Rom, a Christmas video and talking figures. A 'buy one, get one free' offer meant 1m Only Fools and Horses videos were sold to retailers, although figures for how many were snapped up by fans are not available. Rupert Gavin, BBC Worldwide chief executive, said: \"It's wonderful to see how popular BBC products are and, because we reinvest the profits in BBC programmes, it's a wonderful boost for the licence payer as well.\"",

The central benefits agency will take over when council services fall below as yet undecided minimum service standards. Shadow social security minister David Willetts announced the move today as part of a four-point plan to tighten up the benefit - including proposals for a cash lump sum to be paid to families to encourage them to move to smaller accommodation if appropriate. Social security secretary Alistair Darling last month claimed some councils were \"failing miserably\" on housing benefit, creating backlogs and delays in the system. He threatened to send in \"action teams\" to tackle problems in the worst authorities, and promised to streamline the system to make it easier for councils to administer. Mr Willetts said Labour had introduced 85 new regulations covering housing benefit since 1997. \"After nearly a decade of steady decline the number of homeless families is now rising again,\" Mr Willetts told a Westminster news conference. \"A major reason for this is that the housing benefit system is in deep crisis, and that is because Labour have been introducing new housing benefit rules at the rate of one a fortnight.\" The Tory proposals involve: \u0095 Laying down minimum standards for the administration of benefit \u0095 Reducing the burden of regulation \u0095 Allowing claimants to keep part of any savings that result from a move into more appropriate accommodation. That would save \u00a3425m a year by 2003-04, said Mr Willetts, bringing total savings identified by his party on the social security budget to \u00a32.5bn by then.

The settlement ends months of high-profile wrangling between the newsagent, distributors and publishers. Publishers had accused WH Smith bosses of \"bully-boy\" tactics amid fears that the plans could put small retailers out of business and damage copy sales. In a statement today, WH Smith spelt out an eight-point plan to be adopted by the industry. Its proposals follow many of the recommendations put forward in the Blueprint solution suggested last year by industry groups the Newspaper Publishers Association and the Periodical Publishers Association. The plan includes both a commitment to keep the existing distribution networks as well as a promise to safeguard the interests of small retailers. The proposed central publications unit recommended in the plan is also to get the go-ahead. And as a concession to WH Smith, retailers will get a beefed up role in newspaper and magazine supply-chain management. Nevertheless, the decision represents a climbdown for WH Smith. A spokeswoman for the PPA said: \"We're delighted that WH Smith has agreed to work with the industry to create a consensual solution.\" As part of the deal, Associated Newspapers, which had given notice on its supply contract with WH Smith's wholesale arm WH Smith news, has withdrawn its notice to end the deal.

      "body": "<p>When George Carman, who has died aged 71, announced last August that he was retiring from the bar because of ill health, his home in Wimbledon was immediately besieged by the press. Carman, visibly sick and walking with difficulty, granted all an audience. He claimed to dislike the limelight, but he knew he was a star, and he enjoyed the fame that a string of sensational cases in the last 20 years of his career gave him.</p> <p>Carman's case list was matchless: Jeremy Thorpe, the spy Geoffrey Prime, the Sun against Gillian Taylforth, Elton John, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Ken Dodd on charges of tax evasion, Imran Khan against Ian Botham, the Guardian against Jonathan Aitken, Mohamed Al Fayed against Neil Hamilton. He said that other QCs, in tax and shipping for example, were equally adept, but the difference was that his cases were the stuff of life, each one an unmissable piece of theatre.</p> <p>He knew that was where his interest and his talent lay. \"I would not like to practise in areas of the law remote from the human condition and the human problem,\" he once said. His view of cases was psychologically based: he sought to persuade his clients to \"remove their mental veils\", and a key tactic was to observe each member of the jury and pick out individuals to whom he could appeal.</p> <p>Carman was frequently criticised for character assassination in court - one victim, Jani Allan, whose sex life was held up to universal derision - told him that \"whatever award is given for libel, being cross-examined by you would not make it enough money\". But he had no regrets about the way lives withered in the face of his attacks. \"That's a matter of judgment for people who decide to involve themselves in the luxury of litigation,\" he said brusquely.</p> <p>There were also dark suggestions of skulduggery concerning the way in which last-minute pieces of evidence would suddenly appear. Carman put it down to good fortune. \"A lot of things turned up by chance. The Jani Allan diary [detailing her sex life] turned up in the course of the case; it wasn't as if I kept it back. If we'd had it, we would have had to disclose it. Equally, with the Gillian Taylforth video ['I give good head,' she declaimed to her fellow partygoers while suggestively brandishing a sausage], two people arrived at a newspaper in the middle of the case.\"</p> <p>In the Taylforth case, in 1994, Carman successfully defended the Sun's allegation that the EastEnders actress had had oral sex with her fianc\u00e9 Geoff Knights in a Range Rover on a slipway off the A1. The case had everything: soap opera, sex and the plaintiff's delightful explanation that her fianc\u00e9 had had to loosen his trousers because of an acute attack of pancreatitis. It made Carman a household name and the barrister who everyone wanted on their side in a libel action.</p> <p>In 1996, the Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan hired Carman to defend him in a libel case brought by England cricket stars Ian Botham and Allan Lamb. The two England players sued Khan after he said that illegal ball-tampering was common among fast bowlers, and over a newspaper article in which he allegedly accused them of racism. Again, Carman won the day.</p> <p>The following year, he represented the Guardian against Jonathan Aitken, who had sued the paper over allegations of improper contacts with middle eastern arms dealers. Aitken's case collapsed following another of Carman's trademark 11th-hour revelations. \"The records of his wife and daughter's air trip to Switzerland emerged in the course of the case. We didn't have them at the start. We didn't know it was coming. More importantly, neither did he.\"</p> <p>His last major case was at the end of 1998, when another former Tory minister, Neil Hamilton, failed in his libel battle with Mohamed Al Fayed. By then, however, Carman was already fighting prostate cancer, and showed less sparkle in court than in the cases on which his reputation rests.</p> <p>Carman became the best-known QC in the country, but he was hardly the barrister that central casting would have chosen; he once said that in a biopic of his life, he would like the foursquare John Thaw to play him. He was 5ft 3in, paunchy, and had a plummy voice that he had manufactured at Oxford, where he studied law after doing national service.</p> <p>The northern accent of which he divested himself came from his native Blackpool. Both his parents worked in retailing, his father in furniture and his mother selling women's clothes. His mother was ambitious, both for herself and her son, and pushed the young Carman hard. He was educated at Upholland College in Lancashire, a Roman Catholic seminary, and briefly considered becoming a priest, though he later said it was only because he was attracted by the idea of delivering sermons. In any case, he discovered girls.</p> <p>When he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, the accent had to go. \"I made a conscious effort to divest myself of a regional accent as soon as I realised I wanted to go into public life,\" he later admitted. He also lost his Christian faith at Oxford, and found it difficult to cope with the death of his mother when he was in his 20s.</p> <p>He practised on the northern circuit and found the early years a struggle. \"After five years, I was earning as much as a Manchester bus driver without overtime. I almost left the bar three times,\" he recalled. But he resented suggestions that his 25 years in the north were merely a preparation for his fame in London. \"I wasn't some little country boy who came here,\" he said. \"I'd studied law at Oxford, done my pupillage in London, and built up a successful practice on a great circuit that had produced many great advocates.\" He became a QC in 1971.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he accepted that the Jeremy Thorpe case, in which he successfully defended the former Liberal leader against charges of conspiracy to murder the model Norman Scott, was the watershed in his career. It brought him south and put him on the front pages for the first time.</p> <p>Carman remembered the career-changing moment precisely. \"I had met David Napley [Thorpe's solicitor] in the early 70s and worked for him intermittently,\" he recalled. \"He rang me in 1978 to say that Thorpe was probably going to be committed for trial on charges of conspiracy to murder and that he was going to retain me. Thorpe was committed for trial - I heard it on the one o'clock news in Cornwall - and I realised that it would be the greatest professional challenge I had faced, and that it might affect my career. It did. Thorpe was tried in May 1979 and it was a sensation. The case had everything, including the dog Rinka.\"</p> <p>Success in the Thorpe case projected Carman into the super-league and, now based in London, a string of headline-grabbing cases cemented his reputation. He defended Geoffrey Prime, the GCHQ spy; a scion of the Vestey family who had beheaded his wife and put her head in the freezer (Carman secured a verdict of \"diminished responsibility\"); Maria Aitken - the sister of Jonathan - against charges of smuggling cocaine; and Ken Dodd against charges of tax evasion. His reputation as a coiner of bons mots is exaggerated, but here he did produce a memorable line when he declared that \"some accountants are comedians, but comedians are never accountants\". His brother-in-law was an accountant, so he knew what he was talking about.</p> <p>Carman was proud of winning Dodd's acquittal, and even prouder of securing the freedom of Dr Leonard Arthur, the paediatrician charged with attempted murder after prescribing \"nursing care only\" for a Down's syndrome baby. Carman's summing-up was a masterpiece. \"He [Arthur] could, like Pontius Pilate, have washed his hands of the matter,\" Carman told the jury. \"He did not, because good doctors do not turn away. Are we to condemn him as a criminal because he helped two people at the time of their greatest need? Are we to condemn a doctor because he cared?\"</p> <p>He prepared his closing speeches carefully, but did not, as critics suggested, practise them in front of a mirror. He had the first three or four sentences and the all-important peroration written down, and delivered them verbatim, but for the middle section he would work from notes to allow for some degree of spontaneity.</p> <p>Carman is likely to be remembered primarily as a libel barrister, but his remarkable run of successes in criminal cases in the 80s should be given due weight. He described libel as the \"last chapter\" in his career, and did not make his first serious incursion into the field until the Sonia Sutcliffe case in 1990.

      "bodyText": "When George Carman, who has died aged 71, announced last August that he was retiring from the bar because of ill health, his home in Wimbledon was immediately besieged by the press. Carman, visibly sick and walking with difficulty, granted all an audience. He claimed to dislike the limelight, but he knew he was a star, and he enjoyed the fame that a string of sensational cases in the last 20 years of his career gave him. Carman's case list was matchless: Jeremy Thorpe, the spy Geoffrey Prime, the Sun against Gillian Taylforth, Elton John, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, Ken Dodd on charges of tax evasion, Imran Khan against Ian Botham, the Guardian against Jonathan Aitken, Mohamed Al Fayed against Neil Hamilton. He said that other QCs, in tax and shipping for example, were equally adept, but the difference was that his cases were the stuff of life, each one an unmissable piece of theatre. He knew that was where his interest and his talent lay. \"I would not like to practise in areas of the law remote from the human condition and the human problem,\" he once said. His view of cases was psychologically based: he sought to persuade his clients to \"remove their mental veils\", and a key tactic was to observe each member of the jury and pick out individuals to whom he could appeal. Carman was frequently criticised for character assassination in court - one victim, Jani Allan, whose sex life was held up to universal derision - told him that \"whatever award is given for libel, being cross-examined by you would not make it enough money\". But he had no regrets about the way lives withered in the face of his attacks. \"That's a matter of judgment for people who decide to involve themselves in the luxury of litigation,\" he said brusquely. There were also dark suggestions of skulduggery concerning the way in which last-minute pieces of evidence would suddenly appear. Carman put it down to good fortune. \"A lot of things turned up by chance. The Jani Allan diary [detailing her sex life] turned up in the course of the case; it wasn't as if I kept it back. If we'd had it, we would have had to disclose it. Equally, with the Gillian Taylforth video ['I give good head,' she declaimed to her fellow partygoers while suggestively brandishing a sausage], two people arrived at a newspaper in the middle of the case.\" In the Taylforth case, in 1994, Carman successfully defended the Sun's allegation that the EastEnders actress had had oral sex with her fianc\u00e9 Geoff Knights in a Range Rover on a slipway off the A1. The case had everything: soap opera, sex and the plaintiff's delightful explanation that her fianc\u00e9 had had to loosen his trousers because of an acute attack of pancreatitis. It made Carman a household name and the barrister who everyone wanted on their side in a libel action. In 1996, the Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan hired Carman to defend him in a libel case brought by England cricket stars Ian Botham and Allan Lamb. The two England players sued Khan after he said that illegal ball-tampering was common among fast bowlers, and over a newspaper article in which he allegedly accused them of racism. Again, Carman won the day. The following year, he represented the Guardian against Jonathan Aitken, who had sued the paper over allegations of improper contacts with middle eastern arms dealers. Aitken's case collapsed following another of Carman's trademark 11th-hour revelations. \"The records of his wife and daughter's air trip to Switzerland emerged in the course of the case. We didn't have them at the start. We didn't know it was coming. More importantly, neither did he.\" His last major case was at the end of 1998, when another former Tory minister, Neil Hamilton, failed in his libel battle with Mohamed Al Fayed. By then, however, Carman was already fighting prostate cancer, and showed less sparkle in court than in the cases on which his reputation rests. Carman became the best-known QC in the country, but he was hardly the barrister that central casting would have chosen; he once said that in a biopic of his life, he would like the foursquare John Thaw to play him. He was 5ft 3in, paunchy, and had a plummy voice that he had manufactured at Oxford, where he studied law after doing national service. The northern accent of which he divested himself came from his native Blackpool. Both his parents worked in retailing, his father in furniture and his mother selling women's clothes. His mother was ambitious, both for herself and her son, and pushed the young Carman hard. He was educated at Upholland College in Lancashire, a Roman Catholic seminary, and briefly considered becoming a priest, though he later said it was only because he was attracted by the idea of delivering sermons. In any case, he discovered girls. When he went up to Balliol College, Oxford, the accent had to go. \"I made a conscious effort to divest myself of a regional accent as soon as I realised I wanted to go into public life,\" he later admitted. He also lost his Christian faith at Oxford, and found it difficult to cope with the death of his mother when he was in his 20s. He practised on the northern circuit and found the early years a struggle. \"After five years, I was earning as much as a Manchester bus driver without overtime. I almost left the bar three times,\" he recalled. But he resented suggestions that his 25 years in the north were merely a preparation for his fame in London. \"I wasn't some little country boy who came here,\" he said. \"I'd studied law at Oxford, done my pupillage in London, and built up a successful practice on a great circuit that had produced many great advocates.\" He became a QC in 1971. Nevertheless, he accepted that the Jeremy Thorpe case, in which he successfully defended the former Liberal leader against charges of conspiracy to murder the model Norman Scott, was the watershed in his career. It brought him south and put him on the front pages for the first time. Carman remembered the career-changing moment precisely. \"I had met David Napley [Thorpe's solicitor] in the early 70s and worked for him intermittently,\" he recalled. \"He rang me in 1978 to say that Thorpe was probably going to be committed for trial on charges of conspiracy to murder and that he was going to retain me. Thorpe was committed for trial - I heard it on the one o'clock news in Cornwall - and I realised that it would be the greatest professional challenge I had faced, and that it might affect my career. It did. Thorpe was tried in May 1979 and it was a sensation. The case had everything, including the dog Rinka.\" Success in the Thorpe case projected Carman into the super-league and, now based in London, a string of headline-grabbing cases cemented his reputation. He defended Geoffrey Prime, the GCHQ spy; a scion of the Vestey family who had beheaded his wife and put her head in the freezer (Carman secured a verdict of \"diminished responsibility\"); Maria Aitken - the sister of Jonathan - against charges of smuggling cocaine; and Ken Dodd against charges of tax evasion. His reputation as a coiner of bons mots is exaggerated, but here he did produce a memorable line when he declared that \"some accountants are comedians, but comedians are never accountants\". His brother-in-law was an accountant, so he knew what he was talking about. Carman was proud of winning Dodd's acquittal, and even prouder of securing the freedom of Dr Leonard Arthur, the paediatrician charged with attempted murder after prescribing \"nursing care only\" for a Down's syndrome baby. Carman's summing-up was a masterpiece. \"He [Arthur] could, like Pontius Pilate, have washed his hands of the matter,\" Carman told the jury. \"He did not, because good doctors do not turn away. Are we to condemn him as a criminal because he helped two people at the time of their greatest need? Are we to condemn a doctor because he cared?\" He prepared his closing speeches carefully, but did not, as critics suggested, practise them in front of a mirror. He had the first three or four sentences and the all-important peroration written down, and delivered them verbatim, but for the middle section he would work from notes to allow for some degree of spontaneity. Carman is likely to be remembered primarily as a libel barrister, but his remarkable run of successes in criminal cases in the 80s should be given due weight. He described libel as the \"last chapter\" in his career, and did not make his first serious incursion into the field until the Sonia Sutcliffe case in 1990. Before that, he had done civil cases, personal injury and contract, as well as criminal cases. He was invited to become a judge in Hong Kong in the 1980s, but declined. His excuse then was that his wife was unwell, but he later said that he would have found it hard to keep quiet on the bench, and preferred the \"blood and sand of the arena\". Carman married three times, though only listed two of his marriages in Who's Who. When pursued on this point by the Daily Mail, which was attempting to \"carmanise\" Carman, he said that he had suppressed the details of his first marriage to protect his wife, who he had married very young, and that the general public did not have to submit to the same rules as litigants. Each of his marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his son Dominic, and four grandchildren. \u0095 George Alfred Carman, barrister, born October 6 1929; died January 2 2001 Related stories George Carman QC: a life in quotations 4 September: George Carman reveals he has cancer 30 August: the great defender",

      "body": "<p><strong>BAD NIGHT</strong></p> <p>Last night wasn't a healthy one for footballers. Fulham captain Chris Coleman seriously injured his right leg after crashing his sports car, while Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler was assaulted outside a bar in Liverpool.</p> <p>At about 9.15pm last night, Coleman's car ended up in a ditch near his home in Surrey. He sustained multiple fractures to his right leg and had to be sedated by paramedics before fireman were able to free him from the mangled wreck of his Jaguar. Coleman, who is out for the season, was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. \"His condition is satisfactory,\" said a hospital spokesperson. \"He is comfortable and in good spirits.\" Police are investigating the accident.</p> <p>Fowler's latest woe - he last year suffered a broken nose, chipped tooth, black eye and bruising to the back of his head after being attacked in the toilets of a Liverpool hotel - began shortly after 2am outside the Wonder Bar pub in Liverpool. According to a Merseyside Police spokesperson, the striker was \"seen outside the premises having been assaulted. He was suffering slight injuries to his face\". Luckily, the Liverpool player did not require hospital treatment. A 39-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of having inflicted Fowler's injuries.</p> <p><strong>GOOD MORNING</strong></p> <p>If anybody deserves a bit of good fortune, it's Dave Jones. As we all know, poor Dave was edged out of his job at Southampton after some fairly heavy - and false - accusations were levelled at him. So it's good to see him return to the world of football after coming through such a hellish time. Whether he'll actually enjoy himself now he's back is another matter, mind you - he's just taken charge of 100% promotion-proof Wolves. And he's been promising everyone promotion. Oh dear.</p> <p>\"I'm here to bring back the good times and take the club back where it belongs, and that's the Premiership,\" he whooped like a Kinnock at a Sheffield rally. \"What's gone on has gone on. That's history now. I just want to look forward and build Wolverhampton Wanderers into a Premiership force.\"</p> <p>Seeing that's something even top promotion guru Graham Taylor couldn't manage, the next few months should be interesting. \"We believe we have found a manager with Premiership credentials,\" insisted Jez Moxey, who is either Wolves' chief executive or the arsonist from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. \"We had over 50 applicants, but Dave is a man with Premiership credentials. He is determined to show to everyone that he can get Wolves into the Premiership and become a Premiership manager again.\" Premiership, Premiership, Premiership ... are this lot obsessed or what?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"London is very special, there is always something to do. I like it\" - Nicolas Anelk ... no, hold on ... Thierry Henry waxes lyrical about the smoky hole he lives in.</p> <p><strong>IBROX: A CORRECTION</strong></p> <p>In yesterday's Fiver, we wrote that the 1971 Ibrox disaster was caused by spectators stumbling immediately after Colin Stein's late equaliser for Rangers against Celtic. However, the official inquiry into the tragedy found that the crush developed 10 minutes after the final whistle. We're sorry to have caused any confusion.</p> <p><strong>LOVELY LUNCHTIME</strong></p> <p>Judging by his gigantic jaw-line, Telegraph journalist Matt Lawson loves nothing more than sinking his teeth into a nice fat succulent story. So we weren't surprised to read his back-page exclusive this morning which revealed that Aberdeen are trying to lure Imperial Lord Ferg back to Pittodrie.</p> <p>According to his meaty report, Aberdeen were preparing to offer Imperial Lord Ferg a 50.1% controlling stake in the club when he retires from Manchester United next season - which would be worth an impressive \u00a33.1m. There was even a quote from a boardroom insider who said: \"There is nobody involved with Aberdeen who would not like to see [Imperial Lord Ferg] back at this club. If he did he would be welcomed with open arms and offered any position.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately, an Aberdeen spokesman this afternoon poured a large glass of uisge beatha over the whole story (before dampening down the resulting steam with an oatcake): \"The board wishes to make it clear that it has had no discussions whatsoever with [Imperial Lord Ferg] regarding either his engagement in the management of the club or of his becoming an investor in Aberdeen Football Club plc.</p> <p>\"[Imperial Lord Ferg] obviously still has many friends at Pittodrie and, because of this and the fact he attended our game against Hearts yesterday, this type of unfounded speculation is not entirely surprising. However, all this is doing is creating false hopes in the minds of our supporters, which is disappointing.\" Unlike the deep-fried Angus cattle, which we hear went down very well.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Spurs have denied reports they are about to sign Argentine playmaker Juan Fernandez di Alessio. \"No-one from our scouting staff has been to Argentina in the last two months,\" David Pleat told the official Spurs website. \"Although we are aware of this club, and a couple of their players have come under scrutiny, we have not looked at this player. This story is false.\"</p> <p>Aston Villa have been offered River Plate's 24-year-old defender Mario Yepes, reports Planet Football. But the website warns: \"Parma and Internazionale lined up moves for the 24-year-old in 2000, and he would not come cheaply.\" </p> <p>Martin O'Neill heads the shortlist to succeed Imperial Lord Ferg at Manchester United, reports the Mirror. They quote outgoing Celtic chief Alan McDonald, who claims United's plc chairman Roland Smith has a short-list of three to replace Ferg - consisting of David O'Leary, Alan Curbishley ... and favourite O'Neill.</p> <p>Lazio are set to sign former Manchester United winger Karel Poborsky for \u00a33.5m, according reports in the Italian press.</p> <p>Blackburn striker Egil Ostenstad is in talks with Primera Liga club Las Palmas over a possible transfer.</p> <p>Bolton are hoping to sign Sunderland winger Nicky Summerbee.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Darren Anderton has followed in the footsteps of Sol Campbell by announcing he wants to stay at Spurs.

      "bodyText": "BAD NIGHT Last night wasn't a healthy one for footballers. Fulham captain Chris Coleman seriously injured his right leg after crashing his sports car, while Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler was assaulted outside a bar in Liverpool. At about 9.15pm last night, Coleman's car ended up in a ditch near his home in Surrey. He sustained multiple fractures to his right leg and had to be sedated by paramedics before fireman were able to free him from the mangled wreck of his Jaguar. Coleman, who is out for the season, was rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. \"His condition is satisfactory,\" said a hospital spokesperson. \"He is comfortable and in good spirits.\" Police are investigating the accident. Fowler's latest woe - he last year suffered a broken nose, chipped tooth, black eye and bruising to the back of his head after being attacked in the toilets of a Liverpool hotel - began shortly after 2am outside the Wonder Bar pub in Liverpool. According to a Merseyside Police spokesperson, the striker was \"seen outside the premises having been assaulted. He was suffering slight injuries to his face\". Luckily, the Liverpool player did not require hospital treatment. A 39-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of having inflicted Fowler's injuries. GOOD MORNING If anybody deserves a bit of good fortune, it's Dave Jones. As we all know, poor Dave was edged out of his job at Southampton after some fairly heavy - and false - accusations were levelled at him. So it's good to see him return to the world of football after coming through such a hellish time. Whether he'll actually enjoy himself now he's back is another matter, mind you - he's just taken charge of 100% promotion-proof Wolves. And he's been promising everyone promotion. Oh dear. \"I'm here to bring back the good times and take the club back where it belongs, and that's the Premiership,\" he whooped like a Kinnock at a Sheffield rally. \"What's gone on has gone on. That's history now. I just want to look forward and build Wolverhampton Wanderers into a Premiership force.\" Seeing that's something even top promotion guru Graham Taylor couldn't manage, the next few months should be interesting. \"We believe we have found a manager with Premiership credentials,\" insisted Jez Moxey, who is either Wolves' chief executive or the arsonist from Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. \"We had over 50 applicants, but Dave is a man with Premiership credentials. He is determined to show to everyone that he can get Wolves into the Premiership and become a Premiership manager again.\" Premiership, Premiership, Premiership ... are this lot obsessed or what? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"London is very special, there is always something to do. I like it\" - Nicolas Anelk ... no, hold on ... Thierry Henry waxes lyrical about the smoky hole he lives in. IBROX: A CORRECTION In yesterday's Fiver, we wrote that the 1971 Ibrox disaster was caused by spectators stumbling immediately after Colin Stein's late equaliser for Rangers against Celtic. However, the official inquiry into the tragedy found that the crush developed 10 minutes after the final whistle. We're sorry to have caused any confusion. LOVELY LUNCHTIME Judging by his gigantic jaw-line, Telegraph journalist Matt Lawson loves nothing more than sinking his teeth into a nice fat succulent story. So we weren't surprised to read his back-page exclusive this morning which revealed that Aberdeen are trying to lure Imperial Lord Ferg back to Pittodrie. According to his meaty report, Aberdeen were preparing to offer Imperial Lord Ferg a 50.1% controlling stake in the club when he retires from Manchester United next season - which would be worth an impressive \u00a33.1m. There was even a quote from a boardroom insider who said: \"There is nobody involved with Aberdeen who would not like to see [Imperial Lord Ferg] back at this club. If he did he would be welcomed with open arms and offered any position.\" Unfortunately, an Aberdeen spokesman this afternoon poured a large glass of uisge beatha over the whole story (before dampening down the resulting steam with an oatcake): \"The board wishes to make it clear that it has had no discussions whatsoever with [Imperial Lord Ferg] regarding either his engagement in the management of the club or of his becoming an investor in Aberdeen Football Club plc. \"[Imperial Lord Ferg] obviously still has many friends at Pittodrie and, because of this and the fact he attended our game against Hearts yesterday, this type of unfounded speculation is not entirely surprising. However, all this is doing is creating false hopes in the minds of our supporters, which is disappointing.\" Unlike the deep-fried Angus cattle, which we hear went down very well. THE RUMOUR MILL Spurs have denied reports they are about to sign Argentine playmaker Juan Fernandez di Alessio. \"No-one from our scouting staff has been to Argentina in the last two months,\" David Pleat told the official Spurs website. \"Although we are aware of this club, and a couple of their players have come under scrutiny, we have not looked at this player. This story is false.\" Aston Villa have been offered River Plate's 24-year-old defender Mario Yepes, reports Planet Football. But the website warns: \"Parma and Internazionale lined up moves for the 24-year-old in 2000, and he would not come cheaply.\" Martin O'Neill heads the shortlist to succeed Imperial Lord Ferg at Manchester United, reports the Mirror. They quote outgoing Celtic chief Alan McDonald, who claims United's plc chairman Roland Smith has a short-list of three to replace Ferg - consisting of David O'Leary, Alan Curbishley ... and favourite O'Neill. Lazio are set to sign former Manchester United winger Karel Poborsky for \u00a33.5m, according reports in the Italian press. Blackburn striker Egil Ostenstad is in talks with Primera Liga club Las Palmas over a possible transfer. Bolton are hoping to sign Sunderland winger Nicky Summerbee. NEWS IN BRIEF Darren Anderton has followed in the footsteps of Sol Campbell by announcing he wants to stay at Spurs. Anderton said: \"I know that because my contract is up in the summer I could talk to foreign clubs now, but I would rather stay at Spurs. I'm not just saying I want to stay, I really do want to. I feel I am part of the family here.\" Michael Knighton has sold his controlling interest in Carlisle United to a consortium of investors led by property company Mamcarr Investments Limited.

      "byline": "Jon Henley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It came into force at midnight on New Year's Eve, and already France's brand-new, long-awaited, much-debated law on the presumption of innocence has made its mark: no less a person than a former president's son, banged up two weeks ago on suspicion of arms-dealing, is free to leave jail.</p> <p>There is the minor matter of \u00a3500,000 of bail to come up with, of course, but it is the principle that counts: Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, elder son and senior adviser to the late Francois, may no longer be held in custody because, as the new law puts it, \"his continued incarceration is not indispensable to the proper functioning of justice\".</p> <p>For those who have not followed the story, J-C, his father's top Africa strategist, was arrested on December 21 on suspicion of using his voluminous address book to help an accused arms trafficker, Pierre Falcone, illegally sell some \u00a3350m of Russian-made arms to Angola in 1993-94 - allegedly in exchange for some \u00a31.3m of Falcone's company's money paid into a Swiss bank account.</p> <p>The affair is highly explosive. It involves the son of a former president and a colourful alleged arms dealer who also happened at the time to be a leading agent of Sofremi, the shadowy French government organisation that dealt, among other things, with official arms sales to Africa.</p> <p>But others who have been dragged in - if only as witnesses, or because their offices have been searched - include a best-selling author, a mysterious and deeply dodgy Russian-born billionaire, a former French interior minister, a retired prefect (or senior state official), and various other government agents.</p> <p>The Mitterrand-Falcone scandal, in short, threatens to blow the lid once and for all off the shady, semi-official and often downright illegal deals hatched between France and many African countries up to the late 1990s, and it threatens to implicate some very senior figures indeed, right the way up to the Elysee palace.</p> <p>This makes it as good a test as any for France's creaking and largely Napoleonic judicial system, currently emerging from a radical and wide-ranging overhaul launched by the former justice minister Elisabeth Guigou.</p> <p>Aimed at rectifying \"a profound lack of confidence on the part of the French people in French justice\", the reforms included major investment in the country's prisons, ensuring public prosecutors are immune from political pressure, and guaranteeing citizens a full right of redress for decisions they are not satisfied with.</p> <p>But one of the most important elements of the reform package is Ms Guigou's core legislation aimed at humanising the system and reinforcing the principle, battered but crucial, of the presumption of innocence.</p> <p>This means that since New Year's Day, suspects held in custody in French police or prison cells are entitled to see a lawyer within an hour of their detention, rather than 20 hours as was previously the case.</p> <p>People called in for questioning as witnesses will no longer find themselves suddenly placed under arrest as suspects - a favourite trick of France's all-powerful investigating magistrates - without the existence of \"clear and concrete evidence\" against them.</p> <p>From now on, too, magistrates must keep suspects informed of the progress of their probes.</p> <p>Nor, more particularly, is it any longer up to the investigating magistrate in charge of the case to decide on the desirability of pre-trial detention - that is now the job of an independent, newly-created specialist whom the investigating magistrate must convince at a public hearing.</p> <p>Ms Guigou's legislation came in handy for Francois Mitterrand's elder son. Both the public prosecutor and the investigating magistrate had argued for his continued detention.</p> <p>But despite the explosiveness of the case and despite the vast sums that J-C has admitted receiving for some very ill-defined work (though he has denied knowledge of any arms deal), the independent court ruled that in this case, pre-trial incarceration was not justified.</p> <p>That may not be a particularly popular decision in a country used to the high-handed and unanswerable ways of a justice system that has not, hitherto, proved notably efficient at dealing with cases of high-level corruption.</p> <p>But it does, finally, bring French judicial practice into line with almost every other liberal democracy in the western world - and if the same principle is also applied to people a little less important that an ex-president's son, France's hitherto opaque and antiquated judicial procedures will have taken a major step forward.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:jon.henley@theguardian.com\">jon.henley@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/concorde/0,7368,347037,00.html\">Concorde crash</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=jon+henley&amp;Query=jon+henley&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=Vdkpublicationdate+desc&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Jon Henley</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://tout.lemonde.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Le Monde</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.liberation.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Lib\u00e9ration</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Le Figaro</a><br><a href=\"http://quotidien.nouvelobs.com/\" target=\"_new\">Le Nouvel Observateur</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.leparisien.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Le Parisien</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.lesechos.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Les Echos</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.afp.com/english/home/\" target=\"_new\">Agence France-Presse</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.tf1.fr/\" target=\"_new\">TF1</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.radio-france.fr/\" target=\"_new\">Radio France</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.goodmorningparis.com/\" target=\"_new\">Good Morning Paris</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.paris-web.com/\" target=\"_new\">Paris web</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ladocfrancaise.gouv.fr/cgi-bin/multitel/CATALDOC/accueil_df  \" target=\"_new\">La Documentation fran\u00e7aise</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.politicalresources.net/france.htm\" target=\"_new\">Political resources</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.elysee.fr/\" target=\"_new\">The Elys\u00e9e palace</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.premier-ministre.gouv.fr/\" target=\"_new\">French prime minister's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.internet.gouv.fr/francais/index.html  \" target=\"_new\">French government</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It came into force at midnight on New Year's Eve, and already France's brand-new, long-awaited, much-debated law on the presumption of innocence has made its mark: no less a person than a former president's son, banged up two weeks ago on suspicion of arms-dealing, is free to leave jail. There is the minor matter of \u00a3500,000 of bail to come up with, of course, but it is the principle that counts: Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, elder son and senior adviser to the late Francois, may no longer be held in custody because, as the new law puts it, \"his continued incarceration is not indispensable to the proper functioning of justice\". For those who have not followed the story, J-C, his father's top Africa strategist, was arrested on December 21 on suspicion of using his voluminous address book to help an accused arms trafficker, Pierre Falcone, illegally sell some \u00a3350m of Russian-made arms to Angola in 1993-94 - allegedly in exchange for some \u00a31.3m of Falcone's company's money paid into a Swiss bank account. The affair is highly explosive. It involves the son of a former president and a colourful alleged arms dealer who also happened at the time to be a leading agent of Sofremi, the shadowy French government organisation that dealt, among other things, with official arms sales to Africa. But others who have been dragged in - if only as witnesses, or because their offices have been searched - include a best-selling author, a mysterious and deeply dodgy Russian-born billionaire, a former French interior minister, a retired prefect (or senior state official), and various other government agents. The Mitterrand-Falcone scandal, in short, threatens to blow the lid once and for all off the shady, semi-official and often downright illegal deals hatched between France and many African countries up to the late 1990s, and it threatens to implicate some very senior figures indeed, right the way up to the Elysee palace. This makes it as good a test as any for France's creaking and largely Napoleonic judicial system, currently emerging from a radical and wide-ranging overhaul launched by the former justice minister Elisabeth Guigou. Aimed at rectifying \"a profound lack of confidence on the part of the French people in French justice\", the reforms included major investment in the country's prisons, ensuring public prosecutors are immune from political pressure, and guaranteeing citizens a full right of redress for decisions they are not satisfied with. But one of the most important elements of the reform package is Ms Guigou's core legislation aimed at humanising the system and reinforcing the principle, battered but crucial, of the presumption of innocence. This means that since New Year's Day, suspects held in custody in French police or prison cells are entitled to see a lawyer within an hour of their detention, rather than 20 hours as was previously the case. People called in for questioning as witnesses will no longer find themselves suddenly placed under arrest as suspects - a favourite trick of France's all-powerful investigating magistrates - without the existence of \"clear and concrete evidence\" against them. From now on, too, magistrates must keep suspects informed of the progress of their probes. Nor, more particularly, is it any longer up to the investigating magistrate in charge of the case to decide on the desirability of pre-trial detention - that is now the job of an independent, newly-created specialist whom the investigating magistrate must convince at a public hearing. Ms Guigou's legislation came in handy for Francois Mitterrand's elder son. Both the public prosecutor and the investigating magistrate had argued for his continued detention. But despite the explosiveness of the case and despite the vast sums that J-C has admitted receiving for some very ill-defined work (though he has denied knowledge of any arms deal), the independent court ruled that in this case, pre-trial incarceration was not justified. That may not be a particularly popular decision in a country used to the high-handed and unanswerable ways of a justice system that has not, hitherto, proved notably efficient at dealing with cases of high-level corruption. But it does, finally, bring French judicial practice into line with almost every other liberal democracy in the western world - and if the same principle is also applied to people a little less important that an ex-president's son, France's hitherto opaque and antiquated judicial procedures will have taken a major step forward.

And while there may still be a reassuring ring about that almost anachronistic word \"nanny\", a certain unease is inevitable in entrusting your little ones to the arms of strangers. After all, behind that seemingly calm and pleasant exterior may lurk a secret smacker, a baby-shaker or worse. </p> <p>Thoroughness pays in trying to find the right carer, and few are likely to breeze so easily into the job as Poppins with her carpetbag and brolly. It is important not only to inspect references but to follow them up by actually speaking to two or three referees, according to The Nanny Handbook, a new guide to hiring and handling nannies and au pairs that covers not only the nitty-gritty of tax arrangements and contracts, but also more emotional issues such as coping with the jealousy of someone else looking after your children. </p> <p>Its authors, Karen House and Louise Shephard, are management consultants in their late 30s who live in Wakefield and Wimbledon respectively, with seven children and 10 nannies' worth of experience between them. Shephard, who has worked full time apart from a brief maternity leave for each of her four children, says she has been \"quite lucky\" with her six nannies, none of whom has been a \"complete disaster\". </p> <p>Minor mishaps there were. One nanny, on her first day, reversed the Volvo into a neighbour's wall but, rather than immediately showing the red card, Shephard booked her some driving lessons. Benevolence paid off: \"She was a great nanny; she stayed for three years.\" </p> <p>But she recalls a narrow escape with one candidate she almost employed, who had impressed at interview and brought good references. \"I was going to offer her the job, so I thought, 'We'll have a cup of tea and an informal chat.' It's impor tant to go on intuition as well. As we went into the kitchen, I noticed she had this watch with a picture of Elton John on the face, which struck me as unusual. She told me she was absolutely bonkers about him. I asked if she went to his concerts. She said, 'Yes, I do, but I've got this terrible problem because I'm infatuated with him and every time I see him or hear his music, I pass out. I've been going to hypnotherapy for it.'\" </p> <p>Nannies are most commonly recruited through agencies, ads in magazines such as the Lady or, increasingly, the internet. While there is no registration system, you may, for a small charge, ask for a police check. But even diligent homework can sometimes fail to uncover a rogue nanny. Samantha Young (not her real name), returning to her job as a high-powered executive after maternity leave for her first child, recruited a day nanny from an ad in The Lady, confident in her choice because she knew two of the referees. But then she heard reports of \"strange things\". </p> <p>\"My cleaning lady told me the nanny had put the baby in the cot and closed the door with the room as hot as a sauna,\" she says. \"On another occasion, my parents tried to visit but the nanny wouldn't let them in. So one day I went out, pretending to go to work, and came back an hour later to find her naked, wearing only my husband's dressing gown. She said the baby had been sick on her.\" </p> <p>The next time Young returned unexpected, she found a bruise on her baby's face. Exit nanny. \"The funny thing was that afterwards I spoke to the two referees and they admitted she had seemed a bit odd and had stolen things,\" she continues. \"Then I saw her in the high street one day, wearing a cardigan exactly like one I had but couldn't find. The last I saw of her was a story I read in the local paper. She was looking after a baby when the family was away and the house had burned down.\" </p> <p>Returning to The Lady for a replacement, Young took on someone even though her last reference was not particularly good: \"I phoned her previous employers a couple of times and they agreed they had had a row, but that she was a good nanny.\" And that is what nanny number two proved to be. </p> <p>The most common cause of problems is a mismatch between parental requirements and a nanny's expectations. Wendy Pins, a mother of three from north London, has been frustrated by the inability of agencies to send her suitable candidates, although she recognises that she has special requirements in being at home full time and having eight-month-old twins: \"Most nannies won't work with a mother at home. They want sole charge.\" </p> <p>Her first live-in nanny, recruited from Australia via an agency, lasted all of three weeks. \"In one incident, she took the wrong turning out of the tube home and got lost,\" says Pins. \"Instead of phoning me on the mobile I had given her, she phoned her mother in Australia in the middle of the night, who then rang me.\" </p> <p>Turning to various temporary daytime nannies, she found that several, despite glowing references on paper, were \"all at sea with twins\". Salvation eventually came, via an ad, in the form of a mother's help who, though unqualified as a nanny, had two sets of twins herself and proved a \"guardian angel\" before leaving suddenly to go to university. </p> <p>Pins is still seeking a part-time nanny, which is harder to find, she says, than a full-time one. Meanwhile, she relies on a couple of mornings a week from a trained maternity nurse and help from a 22-year-old Czech au pair recruited from the internet by her husband Anthony. \"But I would never feel comfortable using an au pair for childcare,\" she says. </p> <p>Au pairs are, of course, a cheaper option than nannies, although they generally do not expect to be left in charge of children under three. Peter Radcliffe, who employs a 19-year-old Hungarian au pair, says he heard about one au pair who dropped a baby: \"She managed to catch the baby by the legs but broke both of them in the process.\" </p> <p>He is happy to leave James, who is three-and-a-half, with the au pair for an hour or two, since she has been with them for some time, but would generally never leave a young child with an au pair until she had shown herself trustworthy. Hungarian-speaking Radcliffe and his wife took unusual precautions in screening the candidate, travelling to Budapest to interview her. </p> <p> Unlike nannies and au pairs, childminders are subject to registration and supervision - by local authorities. They are a fast-growing workforce, numbering more than 82,000, with more than 16,000 new childminders registered each year. The fact of registration, however, does not remove the need for parents to be careful. My wife took our two-year-old son to a childminder recommended by a friend. At first, my wife seemed happy enough to let him join the toddlers scampering downstairs. But back home, she began to harbour doubts about the apparent ratio of one adult to four children. </p> <p>When she checked with the local authority, it confirmed that the maximum for under-fives was three per childminder. Call us overprotective, but while a nursery school may be purpose-built for children's play, a home is still a home, with all the attendant hazards. </p> <p>Our local authority issues childminders with a registration certificate stating the maximum number of children permitted, which it advises potential users to inspect. But practice differs from council to council - one reason why, from September, the regulation of childminders will pass to Ofsted, with the introduction of national standards that, the government promises, \"will focus on children's safety and well-being\". </p> <p>The new controls naturally raise the question of why there is still no registration scheme for nannies. Shephard believes that there \"should be some way of striking them off if children are endangered or if they have been abusive or have revealed confidential information\". </p> <p>In Mary Poppins, a whole squadron of unsuitable nannies, with faces as grim as executioners, are blown away by a miraculous gust, scattered like so many black-hatted crows. Unfortunately, we cannot rely for our children's protection on the intervention of magical figures who descend by umbrella from the clouds, snapping their fingers.</p>",

Au pairs are, of course, a cheaper option than nannies, although they generally do not expect to be left in charge of children under three. Peter Radcliffe, who employs a 19-year-old Hungarian au pair, says he heard about one au pair who dropped a baby: \"She managed to catch the baby by the legs but broke both of them in the process.\" He is happy to leave James, who is three-and-a-half, with the au pair for an hour or two, since she has been with them for some time, but would generally never leave a young child with an au pair until she had shown herself trustworthy. Hungarian-speaking Radcliffe and his wife took unusual precautions in screening the candidate, travelling to Budapest to interview her. Unlike nannies and au pairs, childminders are subject to registration and supervision - by local authorities. They are a fast-growing workforce, numbering more than 82,000, with more than 16,000 new childminders registered each year. The fact of registration, however, does not remove the need for parents to be careful. My wife took our two-year-old son to a childminder recommended by a friend. At first, my wife seemed happy enough to let him join the toddlers scampering downstairs. But back home, she began to harbour doubts about the apparent ratio of one adult to four children. When she checked with the local authority, it confirmed that the maximum for under-fives was three per childminder. Call us overprotective, but while a nursery school may be purpose-built for children's play, a home is still a home, with all the attendant hazards. Our local authority issues childminders with a registration certificate stating the maximum number of children permitted, which it advises potential users to inspect. But practice differs from council to council - one reason why, from September, the regulation of childminders will pass to Ofsted, with the introduction of national standards that, the government promises, \"will focus on children's safety and well-being\". The new controls naturally raise the question of why there is still no registration scheme for nannies. Shephard believes that there \"should be some way of striking them off if children are endangered or if they have been abusive or have revealed confidential information\". In Mary Poppins, a whole squadron of unsuitable nannies, with faces as grim as executioners, are blown away by a miraculous gust, scattered like so many black-hatted crows. Unfortunately, we cannot rely for our children's protection on the intervention of magical figures who descend by umbrella from the clouds, snapping their fingers.",

      "body": "<p>Once in a blue moon my father and I admit that we saved each other's lives. One morning in 1973, my mother set off for work and never got there. Killed in a car accident. My father was 28 and I was a year and a half. </p> <p>My maternal grandparents offered to raise me, but my father decided that he wouldn't have much reason to get up in the morning if I wasn't there. I dread to think what would have become of me if I had been immediately separated from my father after losing my mother. Such a set of circumstances tends to be written up in psychology textbooks as a worst-case scenario. </p> <p>So there we were: a young, grieving man who had only recently left behind a conventional career as an architect to risk his hand at sculpture, and a toddler so traumatised by her mother's disappearance that she temporarily stopped speaking. What developed from that sorry state was a relationship between father and daughter that is so deep that one friend describes the bond between my dad and I as \"palpable\". </p> <p>In the years after Jacquie's death, my father and I got to know each other in a way that is usually impossible in a two-parent family. The \"daddy's girl\" model did not apply, because it relies on daddy being the bearer only of good news and treats - usually to make up for being home so seldom. And daddy's girls generally respond by playing up to the atten tion and being extra-specially nice or gloriously naughty. </p> <p>If he wasn't the classic doting daddy, what was he? Did my father metamorphose into a mother? That is often the perception of what single dads do, but I disagree. I think single dads who rise to the occasion become more of a dad. In my father's case, he had to confront parenting issues that he had been able to avoid while my mother was alive. How should you react when a child won't do what you want her to? Do you hit her? This question proved a watershed in my father's approach to parenting. He says that one night he happened upon a television programme about child abuse and realised that I was a delicate creature and vowed not to hit me. If my mother had lived, my father might have avoided for years being in a position where he was angry with me, and would not have been prepared. But it was just the two of us, so his decision to turn his back on his own history - his father had certainly beaten him - was a victory for us both. </p> <p>There were more light-hearted conundrums. Food is the one I remember best. My father was determined that his lack of feminine skills in the kitchen should not lead to malnutrition in his daughter. As a result, I put up with some horrendous experiments. There was the teaspoon of dry, vile-tasting wheatgerm to be eaten every morning. That gave way eventually to a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses. But worst of all was the fish. Richard read that fish was very nutritious and set about boiling some type of low-grade, frozen white fish every other night for years. He boiled it thoroughly and never once thought that sauce might make it more appealing. I responded by pretending to eat it, but deposited most of it along a ledge that ran under our dining room table. The fish didn't smell because it had been boiled for too long; it sat there until my father decided to move the table for a party. I still remember the shock of watching a wave of desiccated fish tumble to the floor. </p> <p>Although much of the love Richard and I feel for each is obviously the result of the single parent-single child unit created during those crucial years when my personality was forming, there is an element to our bond that has nothing to do with day-to-day closeness and everything to do with the death of Jacquie. It is a painful, slightly desperate love, and it can erupt with a ferocity that alarms people around us. It makes us leap to defend each other more powerfully - and sometimes more irrationally - than we would anyone else. But we sometimes turn that love inwards and become each other's fiercest critic. Knowing that we can't hide from each other can be uncomfortable and we tend to avoid each other when we're struggling with something we aren't sure the other will understand. </p> <p>When people hear about the circumstances of my childhood, they are often curious about my mother's death, but shy about asking questions. I don't blame them for being shy, although I'm perfectly happy to relay details of how my mother died. I am less inclined to discuss what impact her death had on me. I know I should not be surprised that Jacquie's death remains a gaping, painful wound that I stumble over from time to time, but I am surprised all the same. Until my late teens, I rationalised that because I have no visual memory of my mother, her dying didn't have any negative effects on me. When I finally admitted the weakness of this argument I began to piece together what may have happened to me. </p> <p>These days, I believe that a piece of my heart froze when Jacquie died. Or maybe it was like losing a lung. Whatever metaphor I choose, the result is the same - the remaining parts of me had to work that much harder to compensate. For a child to \"bounce back\" from such a loss, she has to become tough, like a weed. I did that, and I'm glad, even proud, that I did. But bouncing back was a short-term solution; for the rest of my life there will be moments when my \"tough\" persona will give way to a much more troubled person. It is a scary prospect, but having a sculptor for a father has helped: I was brought up to accept that messy emotions can fuel creativity. </p> <p>A part of my grief that I express more easily is respect for death's role in life. Most people are sheltered from mortality well into adulthood, but I know death is all around us. Accidents happen, people fall ill. I don't avoid physical risks and don't ask my loved ones to live risk-free lives either, but I can't help myself from saying things such as \"Careful when you're cycling home\" or \"Go and get that checked out\". People who know me realise that these aren't empty words, but that they convey my fervent hope that they will live long, healthy, happy lives. That is what my mother's death, when she was just 25, has taught me - that there is nothing romantic about an early death. It's a loss, pure and simple. And as my father moves through his 50s and I stare 30 in the face, thinking of Jacquie evokes in me the most powerful desire to see my father live to a ripe old age, and for me to do the same.

      "body": "<p>Along with the old adage that you can't be too thin or too rich, American parents have, until now, believed you can't praise your kids too much. But now New York psychologist Dr Ron Taffel has thrown them into turmoil by declaring that too much praise lowers children's motivation and may turn them into \"praise junkies\". </p> <p>Taffel, author of Nurturing Good Children Now, describes watching children sledding in Central Park. \"Their parents were screaming, 'Great job! Phenomenal sledding! That's the best I've ever seen,'\" said Taffel in the New York Times. As he points out, the children were being praised for obeying the laws of gravity. \"It cheapens the praise, and children may become dependent.\" </p> <p>Parents in the US have enthusiastically adopted the teachings of positive parenting, but for some the phrase \"good job\" has become a nervous tic. It is repeated as a mantra in response to their child's most ordinary accomplishments to prevent undesirable behaviour and to save their child from low self-esteem. </p> <p>Schools in the US have joined in, too. Some even display posters exhorting teachers to \"Praise every child every day\". Lilian Katz, from the University of Illinois, claims that saying \"good painting\" will keep children at task while you are watching, but once adult attention is withdrawn, many lose interest in the activity. She believes that demotivation may occur as the child's focus moves from enjoyment of the task at hand to the search for more praise: the more we reward, the more likely the child is to lose intrinsic interest in whatever they were doing to get the reward. </p> <p>This is backed up by research from Joan Grusec at the University of Toronto. Young children who were regularly praised for their generosity in giving to charity became slightly less generous. But the generosity of their peers who were not being praised did not decline. </p> <p>Research in the classroom by Mary Bud Rowe, at the University of Florida, found that students who were praised lavishly were more hesitant in their responses, less likely to persist with difficult tasks and did not share ideas with fellow students. Creativity may also be affected as they take fewer risks in their work. </p> <p>One explanation for the apparent loss of confidence and motivation is that over-praised children feel under pressure to keep it up. \"What kids need is unconditional support,\" avers Alfie Kohn, author of Hooked on Praise. \"That's not just different from praise - it's the opposite of praise. 'Good job!' is conditional. It means we're offering attention and acknowledgement and approval for jumping through our hoops.\" </p> <p>Kohn suggests instead that a simple, evaluation-free description of what the child is doing tells them that you noticed, and lets them take pride in their actions. So should we worry about over-praising here in the UK? </p> <p>Clinical psychologist Sue Jenner, author of The Parent/Child Game, is adamant that over-praising is not an issue. \"In my work, I see many struggling adult personalities, and I have never come across anyone who says they can't cope because of too much praise as a child. Praise is vital for forming a strong child-parent attachment.

      "bodyText": "Along with the old adage that you can't be too thin or too rich, American parents have, until now, believed you can't praise your kids too much. But now New York psychologist Dr Ron Taffel has thrown them into turmoil by declaring that too much praise lowers children's motivation and may turn them into \"praise junkies\". Taffel, author of Nurturing Good Children Now, describes watching children sledding in Central Park. \"Their parents were screaming, 'Great job! Phenomenal sledding! That's the best I've ever seen,'\" said Taffel in the New York Times. As he points out, the children were being praised for obeying the laws of gravity. \"It cheapens the praise, and children may become dependent.\" Parents in the US have enthusiastically adopted the teachings of positive parenting, but for some the phrase \"good job\" has become a nervous tic. It is repeated as a mantra in response to their child's most ordinary accomplishments to prevent undesirable behaviour and to save their child from low self-esteem. Schools in the US have joined in, too. Some even display posters exhorting teachers to \"Praise every child every day\". Lilian Katz, from the University of Illinois, claims that saying \"good painting\" will keep children at task while you are watching, but once adult attention is withdrawn, many lose interest in the activity. She believes that demotivation may occur as the child's focus moves from enjoyment of the task at hand to the search for more praise: the more we reward, the more likely the child is to lose intrinsic interest in whatever they were doing to get the reward. This is backed up by research from Joan Grusec at the University of Toronto. Young children who were regularly praised for their generosity in giving to charity became slightly less generous. But the generosity of their peers who were not being praised did not decline. Research in the classroom by Mary Bud Rowe, at the University of Florida, found that students who were praised lavishly were more hesitant in their responses, less likely to persist with difficult tasks and did not share ideas with fellow students. Creativity may also be affected as they take fewer risks in their work. One explanation for the apparent loss of confidence and motivation is that over-praised children feel under pressure to keep it up. \"What kids need is unconditional support,\" avers Alfie Kohn, author of Hooked on Praise. \"That's not just different from praise - it's the opposite of praise. 'Good job!' is conditional. It means we're offering attention and acknowledgement and approval for jumping through our hoops.\" Kohn suggests instead that a simple, evaluation-free description of what the child is doing tells them that you noticed, and lets them take pride in their actions. So should we worry about over-praising here in the UK? Clinical psychologist Sue Jenner, author of The Parent/Child Game, is adamant that over-praising is not an issue. \"In my work, I see many struggling adult personalities, and I have never come across anyone who says they can't cope because of too much praise as a child. Praise is vital for forming a strong child-parent attachment. Yes, describing what the child is doing is good, but if you give descriptions plus praise, it is a wonderful experience for a child.\" Could there be a more personal reason for the appeal of this theory to some psychologists and parents? \"Adults who were not praised as children are often uncomfortable with praise,\" explains Jenner. \"We have to ask what the backgrounds are of the people who are cot toning on to this. Taffel is in danger of adding to transgenerational cycles of emotional abuse.\" So is it safe to heap limitless praise on our little ones? Dr Sandra Scott, senior psychiatric registrar at the Maudsley Children's Hospital, is unhappy at the suggestion that praise can be detrimental. \"A child is far more likely to be damaged through too little praise,\" she argues, \"but effective praise should be genuine.\" In childhood, many aspects of life are challenging, so what appears to be over-praising may help to acknowledge the child's learning and development, as well as reminding them they are loved. \"The children described by Taffel were probably a bit scared, but had conquered their fears.

      "bodyText": "The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has given the US president, Bill Clinton, his qualified acceptance of a US formula for a negotiated settlement with Israel, a senior Palestinian official said today, according to the Associated Press. Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestine Liberation Organization's Washington representative, told the news agency that the next move in the peace process is up to the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. In two meetings at the White House, Mr Arafat \"presented our position in a positive way,\" Mr Rahman said. \"These were received by President Clinton, and it is now up to Mr Barak.\" Several Palestinian officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, said Mr Arafat had also agreed to 12 days of intensive negotiations with Israel. There was no immediate reaction from Clinton administration officials, who gave no indication after the talks ended near midnight last night that the huge gaps between Mr Arafat's position on key issues and Mr Clinton's outline had been bridged. However, White House spokesman Jake Siewert told reporters at the end of the talks that Mr Clinton had clarified his proposals in more than three hours of meetings with Mr Arafat. Mr Barak said earlier yesterday that with the violence persisting he was shifting his attention from Mr Clinton's outline, which he had accepted last week, conditioned on Mr Arafat's approval, to guarding Israel's security against attacks. Mr Clinton is up against a tight deadline, with only 17 days remaining in his term to try to conclude a peace accord between the two sides. It is his primary foreign policy goal. The proposal, presented to negotiators for the two sides before Christmas, was designed as a basis for another round of negotiations, and not as an agreement itself.

Mr Siewert said last night that Mr Clinton would call the prime minister early today and telephone Mr Arafat in a day or two for more discussion.

So much so that was presented with an award for outstanding achievement in the face of significant obstacles at Workforce's achievement awards 2000 in recognition of his hard work and development. Currently Lee is part of Workforce's innovative recruitment services programme. He has been working within Workforce's marketing and development team where as a database administrator and an equal opportunities review officer he has been able to use and develop new skills and get used to the demands of a real job. He has now progressed into working for an external agency on a temporary basis organising a major mailshot to its customers and suppliers, coordinating the activities of a number of his peers. His time at Workforce has provided some unique opportunities. Following his assistance in a Workforce presentation he was invited to spend the day on UBS Warburg's trading floor, an experience which made him even more determined to do well with his training and get a good job. He also organised Workforce's annual achievement awards liaising with suppliers, ensuring necessary equipment was secured and contributing to the creative way in which Workforce's services were demonstrated. Through all of these experiences he has learnt a great deal about working with others, applying IT, the importance of punctuality and meeting objectives and has also raised his expectations in terms of what may be possible for him. The future looks bright for Lee, ultimately he wants to go into entertainment management and set up his own company. Workforce knows that with his dedication and enthusiasm Lee can achieve anything. Lee also knows how much he owes the charity; when asked about his time there he shrugs and says: \"Workforce is the future of training. It has to be.\"",

      "bodyText": "Workforce has developed a handbook of good practice in assessment and guidance of young people. Funded by the European Social Fund, the handbook examines new ways of assisting young people at risk of exclusion from the labour market in the transition from school to training or work. Many young people who have had bad experiences of education or training in the past do not respond well to exam situations or anything that reminds them of school. Their bad experiences can be due to a range of problems from learning difficulties and disability, through emotional and behavioural problems often linked to family breakdown and trauma, through to language barriers and cultural problems. Workforce has developed a specialist method of working with disaffected young people to ascertain their skills and offer them a pathway to gaining skills, qualifications and employment, without alienating them further. This method is client centred assessment and guidance that does not set young people tests to enter training but instead aims to ascertain the clients' needs and then to find training that meets those needs. Assessments are made in an informal environment with assistance available and no time limits to enable the clients to display their skills and staff to find out where difficulties lie. Some assessments are written, others are verbal, practical or IT based. Guidance about what training is available and appropriate is delivered through the same service so guidance is much better informed and assessment more relevant. Workforce has worked with a variety of pilots of more \"exam based\" assessment methods but have found that young people in this client group will refuse to do them and sometimes drop out of the system. With the client centred model, clients get to discover their own strengths and weaknesses and determine the best way of overcoming their obstacles, gaining qualifications and skills and entering work. By making this commitment, they make their first step towards reintegration into education, training and employment. As a result of this method, 97% of young people are referred successfully into training. Workforce provides assessment and guidance to more than 2000 clients a year and has been developing this method of work since 1994 when it won a national award to develop better ways of working with disaffected young people. Since 1997 it has worked with partners in Ireland and Italy to produce a handbook of good practice. The lessons that Workforce has learned through the development of this process is the integral role of all of the following elements in the process: Marketing: As a client based system it is essential to develop appropriate marketing of the service to attract young people disaffected from education training and other intervention. Initial contact: Initial contact is crucial to a positive relationship with the client. This must include sensitive and effective initial screening processes to identify potential barriers to communication. The assessment and guidance worker (AGW): Staff delivering the service need to have a good awareness of their own attitudes, values and limitations, and to set boundaries to deliver an impartial service. Relationships: The relationship between staff and clients is the key to success. This relationship must be trusting and carefully developed through group induction, one-to-one work, and a genuine response to the clients' aspirations, desires and goals. Motivation and inspiration: The process must inspire and motivate young people who have low self esteem and are disenchanted. The service must be personalised by using selected materials, helping to make young people feel valued and ensures that results are specific to the individual. Assessment and guidance together: Guidance alone can be ill informed without knowledge of skill levels. Assessment alone can be irrelevant if it does not relate to the young person's aspirations and the opportunities available. Participation: Young people must be offered \"reality feedback\" to ensure that their aspirations are realistic but they must be helped to identify their own goals, training needs and path to employment.",

      "bodyText": "Movie premiere Deep Impact on BBC1 pulled in more than 10m viewers, giving ITV's Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? a run for its money. The movie, which is about attempts to destroy an earth-bound asteroid, got a lukewarm critical reception on its theatrical release. But Deep Impact was just what partied-out new year viewers wanted last night, with an average of 10.5m - 38% of the available audience. Millionaire pulled in 10.4m on ITV from 8-9pm on a heavy viewing night. But the show outrated the BBC1 movie for the 55 minutes they were both on air, pulling in 11.7m in its final quarter-hour Elsewhere last night, Sword of Honour, Channel 4's ambitious adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's second world war trilogy, pulled in a respectable audience of 2.2m and a 9% share over nearly two hours from 9pm. Sword of Honour, which concludes tonight, was preceded on Channel 4 by The 1940s House, a documentary series following a modern family living for two months in conditions designed to recreate the experiences of a second world war family. The 1940s House, which has the same format as Channel 4's earlier 1900 House, opened its five-part account with 2.2m and an 8% share.",

The poet did not take into account the inland revenue, the agency which above all can bring the most romantic down to earth. Papers released yesterday at the public record office show how the revenue, noticing the popularity of Brooke's poems after he died in the first world war, decided to look again at the taxes he had paid. The family's solicitors asked for permission to wind up the estate in 1916, the year after the poet died of blood poisoning abord a naval ship off Greece. The revenue promptly wrote back noticing that \"no mention appears to have been made in the original affidavit or in the present account of the deceased's copyrights and royalties\". The solicitor replied: \"There was no value as regards any such assets at the time of the deceased's death. \"We have seen Mrs Parker Brooke, mother of the deceased, and she confirms ... that the copyrights and royalties in existence on her son's death were of no value\". The only book published at his death was a \"small volume published in 1911 [called, simply, Poems] and that no profits accrued to the deceased in respect of these nor has she received any.\" Brooke's publishers, Sidgwick and Jackson, confirmed \"the profit was so trifling that the copyright cannot hardly be said to have any value at the time of his death\". The publishers added: \"It is not too much to say that all the pecuniary value of his poetry arose in the first instance out of the circumstances of his death and therefore at the time of his death was non-existent.\" The correspondence continued until 1925, 10 years after the poet's death. The revenue finally agreed the \"sum of \u00a33 3s 0d for duty\". By then the family had had enough, its solicitor telling the inland revenue it would cost more to reclaim the sum.

Cases of the potentially fatal brain disease have fallen by 75% since all under-18s in England and Wales have been immunised. Experts said they eventually hoped to prevent up to 150 deaths from the C strain of meningitis every year and almost obliterate the disease. The UK is the first country in the world to develop and introduce a meningitis C vaccine and 18m infants, children and teenagers have been vaccinated since its introduction in November 1999.

      "bodyText": "Commercial broadcasters have forged a powerful alliance to fight the BBC's rapid expansion into digital television. Seven TV giants including BSkyB, MTV, and Turner Broadcasting have formally linked up and are seeking a summit with culture secretary Chris Smith to air their concerns over the BBC's proposed services. They say they desperately need to raise awareness among government ministers and MPs about the potentially negative impact of the BBC's plans on its commercial rivals. The broadcasters are also concerned about the process by which the BBC's proposals, including plans for two new children's services and turning BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge into BBC 3 and 4, are being approved by the government. Last year Chris Smith introduced new rules requiring the BBC to get approval from the government before proceeding with plans for any new channels. Commercial rivals say the BBC is ignoring the rules and pressing ahead with its plans to launch services or change its existing services before final approval has been granted by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport. One source close to the alliance said: \"There is a great deal of activity around the BBC's new services, with people being recruited before the consultation process has even begun.\" \"We're simply seeking to have the level of consultation and transparency that's been indicated by Chris Smith and doesn't seem to be happening.\" Greg Dyke, BBC director general, has argued that the BBC's five new services on the two children's channels is a justifiable use of the licence fee because the output is significantly different to that offered elsewhere. But commercial rivals say the BBC does not even have to stick to \"guarantees on minimum UK origination quotas and programming specifications\". The alliance is also expected to lobby culture department officials and MPs. \"Everything is being considered,\" said a senior insider from another broadcaster involved. The heavyweight lobbying group includes BSkyB, Telewest - whose programming arm Flextech is involved in the UKTV pay-TV channels joint venture with the BBC - and Artsworld, the recently launched arts channel headed by Sir Jeremy Isaacs and backed by investors including the Guardian Media Group. MTV and Nickelodeon, which are both owned by US broadcasting giant Viacom; Turner Broadcasting, which is the parent company for CNN International and Cartoon Network; and Discovery have also joined the informal alliance. Disney and ITV companies Granada Media and Carlton Communications were involved in some of the discussions about commercial broadcasters' concerns with the BBC's digital proposals, but have not joined the core lobbying group. The BBC proposals are expected to be formally submitted to the government in the next fortnight, with a consultation period to follow in which interested parties can submit comments and objections. But commercial broadcasters are also concerned that they will only be given a limited window, possibly as short as 20 days, to air their worries about the BBC's plans. \"Nobody knows what the timetable is. It hasn't been published,\" commented a source close to the commercial alliance. Confusion about the consultation process has raised concerns among the BBC's commercial rivals that they will be presented with a fait accompli over its digital plans. The informal lobbying alliance is being coordinated by communications firm Lexington, which also worked on the anti-digital licence fee campaign in 1999. That lobbying effort was launched after the publication in August 1999 of the Davies committee report into the BBC's future funding, which recommended a digital licence fee to finance the corporation's plans for digital expansion. The digital licence fee proposal was eventually discarded by the government, with Mr Smith instead announcing an across the board hike in the BBC licence fee in February last year. The individual companies involved in the latest anti-BBC alliance are also conducting their own lobbying over the issue.",

      "body": "<p>Eva Peron, the populist heroine of Argentine post-war politics, was secretly regarded by the Foreign Office as \"a dangerous but very remarkable woman\" whose mass appeal owed more to pantomime than to politics, according to confidential Whitehall papers released at the public record office today under the 50 year rule.</p> <p>The secret dispatches from the British ambassador in Buenos Aires sent while she and her husband, Juan Peron, occupied the presidential palace, were scathing in their assessment of the Peronist regime - a judgment fully supported in London by the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, and his Foreign Office civil servants.</p> <p>The dispatches paint a picture at odds with the glamorous image portrayed in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, Evita, and by Madonna's film of her life.</p> <p>In January 1950 a dispatch from the ambassador, Sir John Balfour, reporting rumours that an operation for appendicitis might actually have been something more serious is greeted in London by the hostile comment: \"Whatever the truth of these rumours, nothing but good could result from a prolonged spell of ill health.\"</p> <p>A second file reveals that in October 1950 she instructed Argentine diplomats in Europe to approach the Belgian, Dutch and Swedish governments to request she be given their highest decorations.</p> <p>She turned down the offer of an honour from Belgium on the grounds that it was of not a high enough category and officials in London feared that it might soon be Britain's turn.</p> <p>\"I would not put it past her to ask for the Order of the Garter! Evita's ambitions are apparently unbounded. The next feelers, I estimate, are likely to be put out in Norway, Denmark and the Vatican! ... This is really getting beyond a joke,\" warned a note on the Foreign Office file by a senior civil servant in London.</p> <p>The bulk of the files released today cover an account by the ambassador of a luncheon held in honour of the maiden voyage of a British built liner, the Eva Peron, at which Sir John sat next to the president's wife and had a \"tete a tete\". He reported that the main fixture in the lounge aboard the liner was a \"full length, theatrically-painted portrait of the senora in a golden decollete evening dress. Her admirers having drawn attention to this garish picture, she and the president gazed upon it with admiration\".</p> <p>When the band struck up the \"march of the Peronist youth\" praising the president, the senora \"intoned the words with the gusto of a schoolgirl on holiday\".</p> <p>The ambassador told the Foreign Office in London that in the case of Eva Peron \"all the symptoms are present of a fatal self-preoccupation\".

      "bodyText": "Eva Peron, the populist heroine of Argentine post-war politics, was secretly regarded by the Foreign Office as \"a dangerous but very remarkable woman\" whose mass appeal owed more to pantomime than to politics, according to confidential Whitehall papers released at the public record office today under the 50 year rule. The secret dispatches from the British ambassador in Buenos Aires sent while she and her husband, Juan Peron, occupied the presidential palace, were scathing in their assessment of the Peronist regime - a judgment fully supported in London by the foreign secretary, Ernest Bevin, and his Foreign Office civil servants. The dispatches paint a picture at odds with the glamorous image portrayed in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, Evita, and by Madonna's film of her life. In January 1950 a dispatch from the ambassador, Sir John Balfour, reporting rumours that an operation for appendicitis might actually have been something more serious is greeted in London by the hostile comment: \"Whatever the truth of these rumours, nothing but good could result from a prolonged spell of ill health.\" A second file reveals that in October 1950 she instructed Argentine diplomats in Europe to approach the Belgian, Dutch and Swedish governments to request she be given their highest decorations. She turned down the offer of an honour from Belgium on the grounds that it was of not a high enough category and officials in London feared that it might soon be Britain's turn. \"I would not put it past her to ask for the Order of the Garter! Evita's ambitions are apparently unbounded. The next feelers, I estimate, are likely to be put out in Norway, Denmark and the Vatican! ... This is really getting beyond a joke,\" warned a note on the Foreign Office file by a senior civil servant in London. The bulk of the files released today cover an account by the ambassador of a luncheon held in honour of the maiden voyage of a British built liner, the Eva Peron, at which Sir John sat next to the president's wife and had a \"tete a tete\". He reported that the main fixture in the lounge aboard the liner was a \"full length, theatrically-painted portrait of the senora in a golden decollete evening dress. Her admirers having drawn attention to this garish picture, she and the president gazed upon it with admiration\". When the band struck up the \"march of the Peronist youth\" praising the president, the senora \"intoned the words with the gusto of a schoolgirl on holiday\". The ambassador told the Foreign Office in London that in the case of Eva Peron \"all the symptoms are present of a fatal self-preoccupation\". She portrayed herself as the \"tireless handmaiden of her husband\" but in reality she was the mainspring of national activities and largely responsible for \"making the welfare of the workers the foremost preoccupation of the state\". But alongside this achievement lay \"prodigal expenditure and demagogic propaganda with an eye to vote catching, the haphazard grant of favours, vindictive appeals to class hatred, corruption and the enrichment of persons in high places by dubious means\". This was not the worst of her character, according to Sir John. \"Above all the projection on to the stage of national politics of the technique of the vaudeville - not to say pantomime - by a woman who, until her meeting with the Peron, had had no knowledge of public life other than that vouchsafed to a minor actress or film star ... bodes ill for the future.\" The ambassador described Evita as the \"embodiment of Latin American adolescence\". Like Argentina itself she was vainglorious, self-assertive and childishly irrational, Sir John said, adding that her emotional appeal was based on promoting her compatriots from the pit to seats of unaccustomed privilege in the stalls. He predicted that the spectacular success of this leading actress, as he called her, was only likely to last as long as \"tickets can be procured from the official box office at popular prices\".

The opening of formal transport links with China is limited to Quemoy and Matsu. Direct travel from Taiwan's main island is still prohibited by Taipei. Although China's communist rulers have never governed Taiwan, they claim it as part of their territory and threaten to use military force if it insists on pressing its independent statehood. Taiwanese hope that even yesterday's small opening will stabilise their problematic relationship with China. They also hope it will put a damper on the booming illicit trade in seafood, produce and consumer goods between the islands and the mainland, so that legitimate business and investment take over. China wants direct contacts with Taiwan proper and only grudgingly agreed to the routes from the lesser islands. China's main state-run media ignored the visits. In Taipei, however, the mood was buoyant. The stock exchange closed 4.13 percentage points up yesterday and Premier Chang Chun-hsiung said the links could be \"a very important step to herald the end of confrontations that have prevailed for 51 years\". \"We hope this presents a new opportunity to establish stable, peaceful and mutually prosperous relations,\" he said. Crowds of well-wishers with firecrackers and dragon dancers saw the vessels off from Quemoy and Matsu, which lie just off the Chinese coast. A few hours later they docked to low-key greetings in Xiamen and Mawei, ports in China's Fujian province. In Xiamen, some 200 onlookers climbed on top of piles of building materials and clambered up a fence for a better view of the two ships that arrived there. Many had heard about the visit from Taiwanese television, easily received in Xiamen. Some returned waves from the Taiwanese, others simply stared. A third ship travelling from Matsu arrived almost simultaneously in Mawei. On board were worshippers of the deity Matsu, the patron of fishermen popular in Taiwan and south-eastern China. They planned to carry her image to a nearby shrine. Taiwan opened the routes without consulting Beijing, which officially labels the move an insignificant publicity stunt. China wants Taiwan instead to make political concessions to allow talks on comprehensive links, but Taiwan worries that could cost it bargaining power in future negotiations over its status. AP",

All patients are monitored using a simple but objective scoring tool which acts as early warning system. If the patient's condition begins to deteriorate, they are identified quickly and senior medical staff are contacted. This helps prevent further deterioration and ultimately prevents avoidable intensive care admissions and further complications. The Kings Mill Centre For Health Care Services NHS Trust Organisations code: RK5 Address: Mansfield Acute Unit, Kings Mill Hospital, Mansfield Road, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottingham NG17 4JL Telephone: 01623 622515, x4157 Contact: John McCulloch, community relations manager 01623 622515, x4157 Chief executive: John Watkinson Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey has introduced a medical emergencies team (MET) which respond to medical emergencies. This ensures senior medical involvement at an early stage through the use of a medical scoring tool. This system helps prevent morbidity and mortality and shows early but promising results. This system is a good working example of a district general hospital being able to improve dramatically medical response to illness. The audit system and the way in which it is disseminated throughout the trust is a good example of how clinical audit can be used, and has the potential for use in other district general hospitals.

A common type of caseload is respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, and fever. The total number of patients who have been referred to this service to date is 196. The average length of stay during a hospital admission is approximately three days. Therefore this service alone, has resulted in a prevention of 588 inpatient bed days within the first 12 months.

In Hull, the Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, is making an additional 21 critical care beds available. These hospitals are the key units for the delivery of specialised services in developing networks for West and East Yorkshire. This will reduce the need for transfers of patients away from their home areas and ensure specialist staff and their equipment can be fully utilised over the winter.

Over the next six weeks the HDU bed numbers will increase to eight. Six months ago the unit employed a number of international recruits from the Philippines and Malaysia, in the knowledge that following a six-month preceptorship period they would be able to register with the UKCC and work as D/E grade staff nurses within the unit. The unit is fully staffed at present and anticipates a more productive winter period because of the strategic planning.

But six months ago, Kearn had nothing going for him, spending his time \"hanging around\" when not appearing in court on charges of drug-related crimes, car theft, burglary and one instance of racial abuse. </p> <p>Then a probation officer told Kearn about free football coaching at Birmingham City football club, a scheme financed by the basic skills agency (BSA). A key role of this organisation has been to hand out the \u00a320m adult and community fund, set up by the government three years ago to combat the low literacy and numeracy skills which limit the lives of 7m people. Its approach is unusual in that it recognises that the people most in need of basic skills training may not be able to look up telephone numbers, read advertisements or fill in application forms. </p> <p>The fund works, says BSA director Alan Wells, because it recognises that \"potential clients face urgent problems with how to get a roof over their head, or get off drugs, or look after their children, and so wouldn't necessarily join a college course to improve their skills\". </p> <p>Kearn was an unlikely candidate for further education. But having been pulled into a programme through football, and been given the chance to meet other people \"like me\", he was encouraged - during coaching in tackling - to develop skills in teamwork, negotiation and communication. </p> <p>\"I was treated with respect; my views were worth hearing,\" he says of the programme, which Fairbridge, a leading charity supporting young disadvantaged adults, has run in Liverpool, Middlesbrough and Newcastle upon Tyne, as well as Birmingham, over the past 18 months. Literacy training came in the form of working on football reports and articles in the project's newspaper. After touring Scotland in a boat in October, Kearn also studied IT and numeracy skills. </p> <p>\"The work is done in a low key way - there's no big deal about it,\" says Fairbridge development tutor Steve Belcher. \"People on the course are helped to identify their own needs and then buy into whichever training programme fits.\" </p> <p>Among other approaches being tested, Nottingham has \"barefoot\" mentors, all of them sex workers who provide early basic skills training for other local prostitutes that take account of work patterns, childcare and problems related to drug addiction. Lisa, a 27-year-old prostitute, says group learning previously was frustrating. \"I wasn't able to get the support I required and would feel embarrassed about asking for help from people I didn't yet trust,\" she says. Now planning to study for a certificate, she says the prostitute outreach workers project offers \"peace of mind, support and the opportunity to plan for the future and deal with life issues now\". </p> <p>The schemes are successful, says Wells, because the agency works on the basis that literacy programmes work by targeting people where and how they want to learn. \"Organisations working with target groups - young mums, ex-offenders, drug misusers and the homeless - all have their own agendas,\" he says. \"But often they can't make a long-lasting impact on people's lives without improving the literacy and numeracy skills which enable all of us to function fully in society.\" </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the adult and community fund has proved a huge success. The BSA is currently preparing to announce the final 60 projects - chosen from 750 applications - that will be funded with the last \u00a33m of the original \u00a320m adult and community fund. Most projects become self-financing (from other sources) within a year. But the commitment to extending this unique form of support for those deprived of literacy skills is uncertain. </p> <p>In November, the government's new adult basic skills strategy unit within the Department for Education and Employment was launched. At the time, Wells expressed concern that the unit would take a traditional line and limit provision largely to college courses. \"People think there's an audience out there and all you have to do is give them a bit of childcare and they will come in,\" he says. \"They won't.\" </p> <p>Publication last month of the unit's first strategy document has allayed many concerns. And a formal evaluation of the basic skills agency's work is due later in the year. </p> <p>Meanwhile, says Hunt, basic skills training has to be provided in different ways because one size will not fit all. \"There has to be provision for supporting literacy in colleges and the workplace, as well as through distance learning and off-the-shelf self-help packs. But there is clearly a place for focusing on groups that won't access literacy in the usual ways -and that's why our approach to basic skills must continue to be a priority.\" </p> <p> <strong>A new life story</strong><br> </p> <p> Writing newspaper reports acted as a catalyst for David Braithwaite, 45. A year ago, he was busking in Manchester, living in a hostel after his marriage had ended - a double blow as he had poor literacy skills and relied on his wife to fill in forms for him. A decision to become a Big Issue seller led to him writing for a newsletter for vendors that he also helped produce, and which acts as a \"front\" for literacy courses run by the Big Issue Foundation with finance from the adult and community fund. </p> <p>At his previous college, Braithwaite was regarded as having special needs. At the foundation, which operates in Manchester and Leeds, he discovered that his reading and writing problems stem from a dyslexic confusion over words that sound the same but are spelled differently. He now writes fluently and has experience in researching and writing stories.

      "body": "<p>Sure-Yani Eduardo Poroso Flores is leader of the Leco Aguachile peoples in Bolivia. He was arrested and tortured in Bolivia, fled to Ecuador, then London to claim refugee status, aided by human rights workers and with support from Amnesty and Survival. He became homeless, until he was taken in by the St Mungo's charity. His claim for asylum has been rejected, but he lodged an appeal last week. This is his story: </p> <p> We Leco people don't write our history, but we sing it and dance it. The dance is a rich literature, containing more knowledge than a mountain of books. One of these dances records the rubber era. Between 1880 and 1925, there was a holocaust and we were exterminated. The European rubber barons stole our children, killing our sons and raping our daughters. We were treated like animals. Big multinationals founded their wealth on rubber, but the knowledge itself came from indigenous peoples. </p> <p>Every year, the European rubber barons celebrated the 12th of October, when Christopher Colombus \"discovered\" South America, so on that day in 1910 my great-grandfather, leader of my people, led an attack on them. They were having a huge fiesta; their whisky was Scottish, their chocolate was Austrian, and their beer was German. By 4pm, everyone was very drunk. My people fired burning arrows, setting light to their town. The flames were 40 metres high and the town burnt for a week and a half. In our dances, we remember the 12th of October. </p> <p>My grandfather, too, was the leader of the Leco people. When he was old, he passed on to me his tiger necklace and his feathers - and with them the duty of looking after our people. The first thing was to recuperate our identity, to show how we are a nation which existed before the Europeans, before the invasion of the Incas, before the empire of the Tihuanacu. </p> <p>We survived them all, but now we are being destroyed by the empire of neo-liberalism, and capitalism, under the rule of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. I am against the globalisation of the economy because it eliminates our identity and destroys the rainforest. The World Bank, and neo-liberalism in general, are the forces behind changes in the law - from agrarian law to laws concerning mining and oil extraction. </p> <p>Take, for example, the laws over water. We share water with our ancestors, who didn't pay tax on water. But now our large rivers have been privatised for hydro-electric dams and our land privatised for mining exploration; Shell is there and Platinium Canada. I began to protest to the government about the cattle ranching and the mining, about the theft of our territories, because this land is our land. </p> <p>From 1570, indigenous territory was marked on maps of Bolivia, but from 1920, the territory of the Leco community was wiped off the map. I showed my people examples of these two maps and they started crying. My people don't know how to read and write, but they understand things. We gave the white invaders an entire country, and then they stole our own land too. So our people began to make dances about this, too. The land is our home and it is our past, our present and our future. It is our cultural heritage. It is not for private companies, it is territorio sanctuario - sacred land. </p> <p>We are defending our lives, but we are also defending the lives of humanity. This is our vision. The environment is in a state of collapse. Those responsible for pollution are the first-world countries. The Amazon is the last lung of the world, and we protect it for everyone. Yet we are attacked. It is not justice. </p> <p>I was imprisoned for a week for being a political activist. I was blindfolded and taken away and tortured. I have these scars from that time. They tried to make me give them names of other leaders. I didn't. They try to break your morale. It's psychological. They put water on the ground and told me to take off my shoes. Then they sent electric shocks through the water. They had a baton to send electric shocks, and put it on my testicles. The ideology of persecution is to silence leaders; my people are beaten if they speak my name. </p> <p>I come from a biological forest, where our god is the cosmology, the universe. I fled to London, a concrete forest, which has one god - money. All the world moves through this god. The power of money moves through houses, institutions and political power. </p> <p>Two years ago, I became homeless and I was in despair, sleeping on the streets and in police stations. I felt all that I had promised to my grandfather, as he lay dying, was gone - lost in the air. </p> <p>Now I am studying the history of my people, and I also analyse things here like an anthropologist. Britain has tribes, too - the party political tribes, tribes of non-conformists, football tribes and the tribe of hooligans. And the IMF and the World Bank are tribes - tribes which crush people. But of all tribes the international elite is the money tribe. </p> <p>London's streets are a cold cemetery, but London has its soul, and it's called the British Library. In my country, they burnt books about the Leco people, to castrate our identity, memory and history. But here I discovered the story - prohibited, rejected and despised - of my people. And what these books tell coincides with the history in the dances of my people. Here I feel free and I grow in spirit. Reading books, my soul asks questions of wise authors. And then I send their wisdom back by fax to my people at home, and they grow in spirit. </p> <p>My forest, too, speaks like a library - a breathing library - of all you want to know: the air, biology, medicine, plants, hydrotherapy from pre-Inca times. The library of the forest is literature and botany, biology and the spiritual world, and it is a library which only indigenous people know how to read. For these reasons, the Amazon should be conserved like the libraries of Alexandria.</p>",

      "body": "<p>America's environmentalists are in mourning. They were among Al Gore's most ardent supporters, citing a \"Grand Canyon of difference\" between his green credentials and those of presidential rival George W Bush. Millions were poured into television ads demonising Bush's poor environmental record as governor of Texas. But still he triumphed in the end, so what can the world now expect from his stewardship of the global environment? </p> <p>Based on Bush's record and campaign pledges, it doesn't look good, say gloomy US observers. Under Bush's tenure, Texas's air became the most polluted in the country, while oil company executives were appointed to state boards regulating their own industries. On the campaign trail, the president-elect infuriated the green lobby by pledging to allow oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to double logging in national forests. His presidential bid was bankrolled by the fossil fuel lobby, and he denounced the Kyoto climate protection treaty as \"unfair\". </p> <p>\"People around the world should be gravely concerned about President-elect Bush's energy and environment policies,\" warns Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth US. \"I think he is deeply sympathetic to the oil industry agenda and will open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge very quickly, perhaps in the next few months.

While Whitman's state record is mixed - she weakened fines for polluters, while introducing a 10-year plan to preserve a million acres of open space - environmentalists had feared a hardline appointee who would emasculate the national agency. \"We can work with her,\" was the Sierra Club's reaction. </p> <p>Bush's moderate choice for treasury secretary, aluminium magnate Paul O'Neill, is also encouraging, say Washington-based green lobbyists, as he supported Gore's abortive plans for carbon taxes in the early 90s.

      "bodyText": "America's environmentalists are in mourning. They were among Al Gore's most ardent supporters, citing a \"Grand Canyon of difference\" between his green credentials and those of presidential rival George W Bush. Millions were poured into television ads demonising Bush's poor environmental record as governor of Texas. But still he triumphed in the end, so what can the world now expect from his stewardship of the global environment? Based on Bush's record and campaign pledges, it doesn't look good, say gloomy US observers. Under Bush's tenure, Texas's air became the most polluted in the country, while oil company executives were appointed to state boards regulating their own industries. On the campaign trail, the president-elect infuriated the green lobby by pledging to allow oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and to double logging in national forests. His presidential bid was bankrolled by the fossil fuel lobby, and he denounced the Kyoto climate protection treaty as \"unfair\". \"People around the world should be gravely concerned about President-elect Bush's energy and environment policies,\" warns Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth US. \"I think he is deeply sympathetic to the oil industry agenda and will open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge very quickly, perhaps in the next few months. He is hostile to a climate change agreement and believes in unfettered free trade. It could all add up to more fossil fuel use than ever in the US - and more global warming around the world.\" Daniel Weiss, political director of the Sierra Club environmental campaign group, agrees that Bush will be under pressure from some rightwing Republicans and industry backers to pursue an anti-environmental agenda, both at home and abroad. \"Bush has said he wants to be a uniter and a healer and his attitude to the environment will test that claim more than maybe any other issue,\" he says. \"Unlike abortion or gun control, where the public is pretty evenly split, most Americans say they want cleaner air and water and protected wild places.

      "body": "<p>When the Holidays with Pay Act of 1948 was passed, guaranteeing the British worker two weeks' paid holidays, the rush to the seaside - which had already been building up from VE Day in May, 1945 - became a human tidal wave, as regular and vast as the coastal sea itself. Entire industries shut down and headed for Blackpool; the cotton towns in Lancashire would be deserted for Wakes Weeks as everyone decamped to the seaside. The streets of London's east end transferred their communities to Margate. </p> <p>Dad, in his Sunday best collar and tie, sat on the beach and rarely got into swimming togs. Mother wore her best frock, while the kids went wild with bucket and spade. Occasionally, Dad would roll up his trouser legs and have a paddle. Mother might daringly stuff her dress into her knickers, the frock copiously overlapping for reasons of decency, and paddle with the kids. Dress etiquette on and off the beach was strict. The uncouth might sport a knotted handkerchief in lieu of a soft hat. But some wore their bowlers on the beach. </p> <p>Josephine Roffey's family, from Streatham, south London, favoured Margate. Those were the days of the stingy landladies. \"The moment we arrived the old girl took all our meat ration coupons,\" Josephine recalls. \"But all we got was diabolical fish cakes and suet pudding with nothing in it. </p> <p>\"There was me and my two brothers and my mum and dad all in the same room with three beds. You had to go through the old girl's kitchen to get to the toilet, but we had a pot and when my little brother, who was always wanting to go, started my mother would say: 'Tilt it up and wee on the side so the people in the next room can't hear.' But we didn't mind any of this - a holiday by the sea was a revelation.\" </p> <p>Then the Roffeys graduated to a guest-house. \"The difference was enormous,\" Josephine says. \"Once again we were all in the same room, but there was a bathroom and toilet on the landing, and you had your own table in the dining room. Your dinner was brought in on a trolley - I can still see the waitress, she had such a high pile of curls on her head my brother thought it was a bunch of grapes.\" </p> <p>The seaside boarding house was a favourite spot for honeymooners, but the shy ones were likely to remain virginal throughout the holiday. In ITV's two-part series, Some Liked It Hot, which begins on Friday, one woman tells how, when her new husband came to bed, the springs made such a racket that she lay rigid. \"Don't move,\" she told him. \"The landlady will wonder what we are doing.\" </p> <p>Josephine laughs. \"I would have done it on the floor, or standing up,\" she says. </p> <p>They were very tribal in those days; the holidaymakers in Blackpool rarely met \"a Scotchman\". The Scots had their own Blackpool at Whitley Bay. </p> <p>The great liberation for mothers was Butlin's holiday camp, with its free babysitters and guarantees against a dreary, eventless wet August week. The young mothers could dance until late, their handbags swinging on their arms, while a \"nurse\" looked in regularly on the chalets where the kids slept. </p> <p>The entertainment was relentlessly Hi-De-Hi: corny comic turns, sack races, beauty contests; competitions for knobbly knees, shiniest bald head and a competition sponsored by Lux soap to find the loveliest complexion. </p> <p>The war had dislocated home life so badly - dad at the front; mother nursing or in munitions factories; the children evacuated - that right across the class structure there was an enormous will to recreate the family. Holidays was the ideal time. </p> <p>Christine Fagg and her husband, a consultant paediatrician, took an old army ambulance and converted it for the newest holiday experience - caravanning. </p> <p>\"We went to Blakeney Marshes on the Norfolk coast,\" Christine says. \"There was only one bunk, so we brought along an old army bell tent for the overflow. [The overflow was four children, aged four to nine.] We were so many years locked at home in the war it was a miracle to get away from inland towns and see this wonderful sea.\" </p> <p>The wartime ban on using beaches had hidden a secret passion of her husband's. \"I never knew he was a sailing fanatic,\" she says. \"When I met my husband, the whole coastline around East Anglia was barbed wired, off limits. Then he got a sailing boat. But sailing terrified me, so we reached an agreement. We bought a second-hand Sprite Alpine caravan and I learned to hitch the thing up. He went on his sailing holidays with the two eldest boys and I went off with the other two in a caravan\". </p> <p>Christine was one of the earliest British lady caravanners. She had a regular column in Caravan Magazine and wrote The Caravan Book: A Guide to Adventure and Fun on Wheels. \"None of my children would be seen dead in a caravan now,\" she says. </p> <p>What these holidaymakers of the 40s and 50s all remember was the huge sense of joy that little things brought. \"I was ecstatic just to see the sea,\" Christine says. \"When I had a fall once,\" Josephine says, \"a nurse told me that if I was a good girl and didn't make a fuss, she would give me a sweet. I can even remember the colour of the sweet, they were so precious - a green fruit drop. Nowadays, kids would tell her to sod off or ask for a Jack Daniel's.\" </p> <p>But already in 1947 a blight had struck the holidaymakers. Alex Rowell thought it was great that he lived only a mile from the seaside at Seaburn, Sunderland. Every day during the six weeks of school holidays in 1947 they would make their jam sandwiches, roll their togs in their towels and go to their favourite spot on the beach. </p> <p>\"It was by a sewer,\" he says. \"We loved to run along the pipe into the sea. We just thought it was funny when there was a stink every time the wind changed.\" Alex got polio, which permanently paralysed one side of his face. His cousin, Josephine, was paralysed from the waist down. </p> <p>Alex Rowell is now leading a campaign against the local council, who, he claims, never warned of the danger on the beaches although they were planning, in the 1947 epidemic, to close swimming baths. In Sunderland alone 80 were affected. </p> <p>By the 60s, holidays abroad diluted this huge, tribal, inward-looking migrations in search of pleasure. The British turned to Spain in their millions and created their own Blackpools, Margates and Brightons on the Mediterranean. In 1970, more than five million Britons went to Spain. </p> <p><strong>From Blackpool to Benidorm</strong><br></p> <p> On the first post war Saturday of July 1945, trains carried a record 102,889 trippers to Blackpool. Beaches had been off-limits since the start of the war in 1939. </p> <p> The Holidays with Pay Act of 1948 turned this weekend exodus into a two-week annual adventure for workers. </p> <p>The working class went to Blackpool and Margate or, to earn a little extra, went hop-picking in Kent. The middle classes preferred the more select beaches of Bournemouth and Eastbourne. </p> <p>In the summer of 1947, there were almost 8,000 cases of polio in Britain. Many swimming pools were closed down, but polluted beaches - later believed to have been partly responsible for the spread of the disease - remained unrestricted. </p> <p>In 1948, one in 20 British holidaymakers went to a Butlin's camp. </p> <p>But fashions changed and, by 1970, 5.7m British people chose to go to Spain on holiday. </p> <p> \u0095 Some Liked It Hot: Blackpool to Butlins, will be transmitted on Friday, January 5 (ITV 10pm); part two on Friday, January 12. It is accompanied by a book of the same name by Miriam Akhtar and Steve Humphries (with Ros Belford), published by Virgin, price \u00a317.99.</p>",

In ITV's two-part series, Some Liked It Hot, which begins on Friday, one woman tells how, when her new husband came to bed, the springs made such a racket that she lay rigid. \"Don't move,\" she told him. \"The landlady will wonder what we are doing.\" Josephine laughs. \"I would have done it on the floor, or standing up,\" she says. They were very tribal in those days; the holidaymakers in Blackpool rarely met \"a Scotchman\". The Scots had their own Blackpool at Whitley Bay. The great liberation for mothers was Butlin's holiday camp, with its free babysitters and guarantees against a dreary, eventless wet August week. The young mothers could dance until late, their handbags swinging on their arms, while a \"nurse\" looked in regularly on the chalets where the kids slept. The entertainment was relentlessly Hi-De-Hi: corny comic turns, sack races, beauty contests; competitions for knobbly knees, shiniest bald head and a competition sponsored by Lux soap to find the loveliest complexion. The war had dislocated home life so badly - dad at the front; mother nursing or in munitions factories; the children evacuated - that right across the class structure there was an enormous will to recreate the family. Holidays was the ideal time. Christine Fagg and her husband, a consultant paediatrician, took an old army ambulance and converted it for the newest holiday experience - caravanning. \"We went to Blakeney Marshes on the Norfolk coast,\" Christine says. \"There was only one bunk, so we brought along an old army bell tent for the overflow. [The overflow was four children, aged four to nine.] We were so many years locked at home in the war it was a miracle to get away from inland towns and see this wonderful sea.\" The wartime ban on using beaches had hidden a secret passion of her husband's. \"I never knew he was a sailing fanatic,\" she says. \"When I met my husband, the whole coastline around East Anglia was barbed wired, off limits. Then he got a sailing boat. But sailing terrified me, so we reached an agreement. We bought a second-hand Sprite Alpine caravan and I learned to hitch the thing up. He went on his sailing holidays with the two eldest boys and I went off with the other two in a caravan\". Christine was one of the earliest British lady caravanners. She had a regular column in Caravan Magazine and wrote The Caravan Book: A Guide to Adventure and Fun on Wheels. \"None of my children would be seen dead in a caravan now,\" she says. What these holidaymakers of the 40s and 50s all remember was the huge sense of joy that little things brought. \"I was ecstatic just to see the sea,\" Christine says. \"When I had a fall once,\" Josephine says, \"a nurse told me that if I was a good girl and didn't make a fuss, she would give me a sweet. I can even remember the colour of the sweet, they were so precious - a green fruit drop. Nowadays, kids would tell her to sod off or ask for a Jack Daniel's.\" But already in 1947 a blight had struck the holidaymakers. Alex Rowell thought it was great that he lived only a mile from the seaside at Seaburn, Sunderland. Every day during the six weeks of school holidays in 1947 they would make their jam sandwiches, roll their togs in their towels and go to their favourite spot on the beach. \"It was by a sewer,\" he says. \"We loved to run along the pipe into the sea. We just thought it was funny when there was a stink every time the wind changed.\" Alex got polio, which permanently paralysed one side of his face. His cousin, Josephine, was paralysed from the waist down. Alex Rowell is now leading a campaign against the local council, who, he claims, never warned of the danger on the beaches although they were planning, in the 1947 epidemic, to close swimming baths. In Sunderland alone 80 were affected. By the 60s, holidays abroad diluted this huge, tribal, inward-looking migrations in search of pleasure. The British turned to Spain in their millions and created their own Blackpools, Margates and Brightons on the Mediterranean. In 1970, more than five million Britons went to Spain. From Blackpool to Benidorm On the first post war Saturday of July 1945, trains carried a record 102,889 trippers to Blackpool. Beaches had been off-limits since the start of the war in 1939. The Holidays with Pay Act of 1948 turned this weekend exodus into a two-week annual adventure for workers. The working class went to Blackpool and Margate or, to earn a little extra, went hop-picking in Kent. The middle classes preferred the more select beaches of Bournemouth and Eastbourne. In the summer of 1947, there were almost 8,000 cases of polio in Britain. Many swimming pools were closed down, but polluted beaches - later believed to have been partly responsible for the spread of the disease - remained unrestricted. In 1948, one in 20 British holidaymakers went to a Butlin's camp. But fashions changed and, by 1970, 5.7m British people chose to go to Spain on holiday. \u0095 Some Liked It Hot: Blackpool to Butlins, will be transmitted on Friday, January 5 (ITV 10pm); part two on Friday, January 12. It is accompanied by a book of the same name by Miriam Akhtar and Steve Humphries (with Ros Belford), published by Virgin, price \u00a317.99.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Midway through the second half of their team's coruscating demolition of West Ham on Monday night, the crowd in a section of Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium struck up a song. Surprising in itself, some might say, in a stadium which has lately generated all the passion and atmosphere of the reading room at the British Museum. But it was the words of the chant that were intriguing. As Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Wes Brown passed and moved their way to brilliant effect around the pitch, the crowd was singing a parody Christmas song - The Twelve Days of Cantona. </p> <p>There, confronted by what many observers reckon to be the most efficient, ruthless and impressive football ever seen at Old Trafford, were the crowd getting all nostalgic about a former hero, Eric Cantona, who hung up his swagger nearly five years ago. For a non-United supporting friend of mine, this was a defining moment. \"You know why they're singing that, don't you?\" he said. \"Because people get nostalgic for their past when their present is boring.\" </p> <p>This is the latest dismissal of Manchester United by the legions of supporters of other clubs who have been obliged to live in their shadow for a decade: that they are boring. Not in the style of their play, universally admired even in the most grudging of circles. But in their success. Eleven points clear of everybody else at the start of January, they are charged with killing competition in England, of turning our league into the one-horse boreathon endured in Scotland for years. What's more, they've done it with a machine-like team so short of individual charisma, there's not even anyone worthwhile to hate any more. </p> <p>United supporters like me are used to years of abuse. I have been accused of being a glory hunter, a bandwagon jumper, a man who fails to understand the fundamental purpose of football support. I have had to listen as people accuse my team's players of everything from treachery through sodomy to paedophilia. Someone once dismissed me of being incapable of applying intellectual rigour to any subject solely because I supported Manchester United. He wasn't joking. But boring? That's a new one. </p> <p>\"It must be boring watching your team win every week,\" is the standard question of the moment. To which the only answer is: you should be so lucky. Every football fan loves to see their team win; in my experience there is no such thing as someone enthusiastic for the good of the game. Club is more important than football in every true fan's heart. You cannot tell me that a supporter of Carlisle United, currently bottom of the league, would find it remotely boring if his team were 11 points clear at the top. The editor who asked me to write about boring, boring United is an Arsenal fan: boring would not be the word on his lips were his team 11 points ahead rather than 11 points behind. Every single fan of every other club would love it if it were happening to them. Unfortunately it is happening to someone else. And since nasty, ugly, cynical or malicious would be wholly inappropriate adjectives to describe this United team, boring is the one applied to justify their all-consuming envy. </p> <p>But even so, it is interesting to test your own convictions against the new orthodoxy. Do I find this United team dull? In the way they play, the answer is emphatically no. Frankly, the football at times on Monday night was the best I've ever seen. Sacrilege to say it, but a team containing Bryan Robson, George Best, Bobby Charlton and the sainted Cantona himself would have difficulty living with the class of 2001. </p> <p>There is, however, the question of the lack of competitive edge. In truth, the Liverpool defeat apart, games at Old Trafford this season have often resembled training exercises. The exhausting, draining thrill of watching two matched teams slugging it out has not been much of a feature of this season. These days it is the cerebral pleasure of watching football played at its best, the purr of certainty rather than the throaty roar of unexpected success. Different, perhaps, from those early rampaging days of the Ferguson domination, when everything was fresh and new, every victory profoundly felt, the title just something to be dreamed of. But boring? You wish. </p> <p>Besides, this is not entirely United's fault. It is like blaming Tiger Woods for spoiling golf by being too good, or suggesting Pete Sampras should give Wimbledon a miss to give the rest a chance. United can only be responsible for their own game, it is up to others to match them. They are playing football the way it should be played. </p> <p>OK, the detractors say, what about the team? Where is the character of the past? Where is the snap and snarl of Hughes, the arrogance of Schmeichel, the intellectual pretensions of Cantona? Fabien Barthez's bald pate is about as far as it goes for interesting with this lot. It is true that United used to possess a glorious uncertainty, a cavalier element to their make-up that was less a streak than a pathological flaw. Theirs was a capacity for self-destruction as epitomised by their most gifted talent, George Best. Of the many triumphs of his management tenure, the removal of this flaw from the collective psyche is one of Alex Ferguson's greatest achievements. United are no longer unpredictable. Players such as Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, brought up from childhood in the Ferguson way, are about as likely to go off the rails as a Japanese bullet train. Taught from an early age that the only way, as Ferguson puts it, to realise the genius within them, is to subsume their egos to the collective will, they have already achieved far, far more than their more dilettante predecessors could have dared imagine. Even David Beckham, hovering a year or so ago on the brink of believing his own publicity, was quickly re-focused by his manager, and has become a fantastic player for it. His recent rash of after-match television interviews appear to have been designed to re-establish him as an ordinary, everyday dull old Joe rather than a galloping superstar. </p> <p>Charisma comes from ego. And the success of this present team is in part a function of its lack of ego. All for one and one for all. Workrate married to sublime skill: the holy grail of football management.

      "bodyText": "Midway through the second half of their team's coruscating demolition of West Ham on Monday night, the crowd in a section of Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium struck up a song. Surprising in itself, some might say, in a stadium which has lately generated all the passion and atmosphere of the reading room at the British Museum. But it was the words of the chant that were intriguing. As Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, David Beckham and Wes Brown passed and moved their way to brilliant effect around the pitch, the crowd was singing a parody Christmas song - The Twelve Days of Cantona. There, confronted by what many observers reckon to be the most efficient, ruthless and impressive football ever seen at Old Trafford, were the crowd getting all nostalgic about a former hero, Eric Cantona, who hung up his swagger nearly five years ago. For a non-United supporting friend of mine, this was a defining moment. \"You know why they're singing that, don't you?\" he said. \"Because people get nostalgic for their past when their present is boring.\" This is the latest dismissal of Manchester United by the legions of supporters of other clubs who have been obliged to live in their shadow for a decade: that they are boring. Not in the style of their play, universally admired even in the most grudging of circles. But in their success. Eleven points clear of everybody else at the start of January, they are charged with killing competition in England, of turning our league into the one-horse boreathon endured in Scotland for years. What's more, they've done it with a machine-like team so short of individual charisma, there's not even anyone worthwhile to hate any more. United supporters like me are used to years of abuse. I have been accused of being a glory hunter, a bandwagon jumper, a man who fails to understand the fundamental purpose of football support. I have had to listen as people accuse my team's players of everything from treachery through sodomy to paedophilia. Someone once dismissed me of being incapable of applying intellectual rigour to any subject solely because I supported Manchester United. He wasn't joking. But boring? That's a new one. \"It must be boring watching your team win every week,\" is the standard question of the moment. To which the only answer is: you should be so lucky. Every football fan loves to see their team win; in my experience there is no such thing as someone enthusiastic for the good of the game. Club is more important than football in every true fan's heart. You cannot tell me that a supporter of Carlisle United, currently bottom of the league, would find it remotely boring if his team were 11 points clear at the top. The editor who asked me to write about boring, boring United is an Arsenal fan: boring would not be the word on his lips were his team 11 points ahead rather than 11 points behind. Every single fan of every other club would love it if it were happening to them. Unfortunately it is happening to someone else. And since nasty, ugly, cynical or malicious would be wholly inappropriate adjectives to describe this United team, boring is the one applied to justify their all-consuming envy. But even so, it is interesting to test your own convictions against the new orthodoxy. Do I find this United team dull? In the way they play, the answer is emphatically no. Frankly, the football at times on Monday night was the best I've ever seen. Sacrilege to say it, but a team containing Bryan Robson, George Best, Bobby Charlton and the sainted Cantona himself would have difficulty living with the class of 2001. There is, however, the question of the lack of competitive edge. In truth, the Liverpool defeat apart, games at Old Trafford this season have often resembled training exercises. The exhausting, draining thrill of watching two matched teams slugging it out has not been much of a feature of this season. These days it is the cerebral pleasure of watching football played at its best, the purr of certainty rather than the throaty roar of unexpected success. Different, perhaps, from those early rampaging days of the Ferguson domination, when everything was fresh and new, every victory profoundly felt, the title just something to be dreamed of. But boring? You wish. Besides, this is not entirely United's fault. It is like blaming Tiger Woods for spoiling golf by being too good, or suggesting Pete Sampras should give Wimbledon a miss to give the rest a chance. United can only be responsible for their own game, it is up to others to match them. They are playing football the way it should be played. OK, the detractors say, what about the team? Where is the character of the past? Where is the snap and snarl of Hughes, the arrogance of Schmeichel, the intellectual pretensions of Cantona? Fabien Barthez's bald pate is about as far as it goes for interesting with this lot. It is true that United used to possess a glorious uncertainty, a cavalier element to their make-up that was less a streak than a pathological flaw. Theirs was a capacity for self-destruction as epitomised by their most gifted talent, George Best. Of the many triumphs of his management tenure, the removal of this flaw from the collective psyche is one of Alex Ferguson's greatest achievements. United are no longer unpredictable. Players such as Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, brought up from childhood in the Ferguson way, are about as likely to go off the rails as a Japanese bullet train. Taught from an early age that the only way, as Ferguson puts it, to realise the genius within them, is to subsume their egos to the collective will, they have already achieved far, far more than their more dilettante predecessors could have dared imagine. Even David Beckham, hovering a year or so ago on the brink of believing his own publicity, was quickly re-focused by his manager, and has become a fantastic player for it. His recent rash of after-match television interviews appear to have been designed to re-establish him as an ordinary, everyday dull old Joe rather than a galloping superstar. Charisma comes from ego. And the success of this present team is in part a function of its lack of ego. All for one and one for all. Workrate married to sublime skill: the holy grail of football management. Ironic that it has been achieved at United, the club whose merchandise operation would be best placed to exploit the possibilities of a new Cantona. Phil Neville duvet cover anyone? Thought not. Compared to Paolo Di Canio, Benito Carbone and Stan Collymore maybe they are boring. But no one in their right mind would swap Paul Scholes for all three of these characters of the game. There is just one chink of light for those who have simply added boring to the long list of complaints about United dominance these past few years. Liverpool were at their absolute best in 1988, when John Barnes, Peter Beardsley and the rest played a football unmatched until this United team got to work.

His side are six points adrift at the foot of the Nationwide League. But on Saturday the club who for the past two seasons have avoided demotion from the league only on the final Saturday entertain Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup. </p> <p>\"Managing here would have been a challenge even for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger,\" he smiles. \"When I arrived in the summer, someone high up in the club told me that if we finished second from bottom this season the board would probably offer me a 10-year contract. I didn't believe him, but I do now.\" </p> <p>Yet today may provide a new dawn for Carlisle. Stephen Brown, a 47-year-old Canadian-born businessman and former commercial manager of the Scottish non-league club Gala Fairydean, is fronting a consortium which has bought heavily into the club and has pledged to finance an ambitious development of Brunton Park and supply Atkins with belated funds to shore up the makeshift squad. </p> <p>Though the takeover does not signal the end of the Knighton era in Cumbria - Mark Knighton, son of Michael Knighton, who previously owned 93% of the club, will be invited on to the board - it is appropriate that Arsenal's visit draws a veil over the former chairman's direct involvement. In August 1989, Knighton Sr ball-juggled on the Old Trafford pitch after launching an audacious bid to buy Manchester United, where he was a director until 1992. The Gunners provided the opposition that day as well. </p> <p>Knighton's subsequent purchase of the Cumbrians sparked a nine-year rollercoaster which rose as high as the Second Division and two Wembley appearances, via a close encounter with aliens on the M62, before sinking almost as low as the Conference. He resigned as a director of CUFC Holdings - formerly Knighton Holdings, the company that controlled United - in December 1999 and, last September, was disqualified from becoming a director of any company for five years for financial irregularities at a preparatory school he owned in Huddersfield. </p> <p>There is never a dull moment with Knighton around, but the murky intrigue since he put the club up for sale last summer has derailed Carlisle's season. Internal politics have wreaked havoc; the board's \u00a32m rescue package was rejected last month, and two directors were escorted out of Brunton Park by bouncers after being denied access to documents by Andrea Whittaker, the club's financial controller and a director of both United and CUFC Holdings. </p> <p>\"Working under the shadow of trustees hasn't been easy,\" says Andrew Jenkins, a former United chairman who has been a director for 40 years. \"At the start of the season we thought we'd be in for a scrap with the way the club was set up. We had owners and direc tors here; everything was in constant limbo.\" </p> <p>The uncertainty prevented Atkins adding to a squad scarred by last season's relegation scrap. \"I came here because of the potential,\" he says. \"I knew it was going to be difficult with a takeover in progress, but by August we'd seen 50 triallists and only had six contracted senior players. We had to cobble a team together. </p> <p>\"We've had 12 players on monthly contracts, most of whom were with us last season but whose deals expired in the summer. We lost one lad, Anthony Carss, on the Friday before a game when I found out he'd signed for Oldham.

      "bodyText": "Ian Atkins squints up at the television and punches in the stocks and shares index on his teletext remote. \"I'm not doing too badly at the moment,\" he says as columns of coloured numbers flash across the screen. \"As long as you don't look at the league table, that is.\" Temporarily ensconced in the world of personal finance, the Carlisle United manager is spared grim reality. His side are six points adrift at the foot of the Nationwide League. But on Saturday the club who for the past two seasons have avoided demotion from the league only on the final Saturday entertain Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup. \"Managing here would have been a challenge even for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger,\" he smiles. \"When I arrived in the summer, someone high up in the club told me that if we finished second from bottom this season the board would probably offer me a 10-year contract. I didn't believe him, but I do now.\" Yet today may provide a new dawn for Carlisle. Stephen Brown, a 47-year-old Canadian-born businessman and former commercial manager of the Scottish non-league club Gala Fairydean, is fronting a consortium which has bought heavily into the club and has pledged to finance an ambitious development of Brunton Park and supply Atkins with belated funds to shore up the makeshift squad. Though the takeover does not signal the end of the Knighton era in Cumbria - Mark Knighton, son of Michael Knighton, who previously owned 93% of the club, will be invited on to the board - it is appropriate that Arsenal's visit draws a veil over the former chairman's direct involvement. In August 1989, Knighton Sr ball-juggled on the Old Trafford pitch after launching an audacious bid to buy Manchester United, where he was a director until 1992. The Gunners provided the opposition that day as well. Knighton's subsequent purchase of the Cumbrians sparked a nine-year rollercoaster which rose as high as the Second Division and two Wembley appearances, via a close encounter with aliens on the M62, before sinking almost as low as the Conference. He resigned as a director of CUFC Holdings - formerly Knighton Holdings, the company that controlled United - in December 1999 and, last September, was disqualified from becoming a director of any company for five years for financial irregularities at a preparatory school he owned in Huddersfield. There is never a dull moment with Knighton around, but the murky intrigue since he put the club up for sale last summer has derailed Carlisle's season. Internal politics have wreaked havoc; the board's \u00a32m rescue package was rejected last month, and two directors were escorted out of Brunton Park by bouncers after being denied access to documents by Andrea Whittaker, the club's financial controller and a director of both United and CUFC Holdings. \"Working under the shadow of trustees hasn't been easy,\" says Andrew Jenkins, a former United chairman who has been a director for 40 years. \"At the start of the season we thought we'd be in for a scrap with the way the club was set up. We had owners and direc tors here; everything was in constant limbo.\" The uncertainty prevented Atkins adding to a squad scarred by last season's relegation scrap. \"I came here because of the potential,\" he says. \"I knew it was going to be difficult with a takeover in progress, but by August we'd seen 50 triallists and only had six contracted senior players. We had to cobble a team together. \"We've had 12 players on monthly contracts, most of whom were with us last season but whose deals expired in the summer. We lost one lad, Anthony Carss, on the Friday before a game when I found out he'd signed for Oldham. We could never prepare properly because the team might disappear. \"I do feel a little let down - there were other jobs I could have taken - but it was difficult because nobody, not even the board who appointed me, seemed to know what was going on.\" Since enjoying success on a shoestring at Northampton - the Cobblers rose from the basement in 1997 and narrowly missed being promoted to the First Division in the play-offs the following year - Atkins has become a reluctant trouble-shooter, called in by Doncaster and Chester to sort out doomed footballing messes. Indeed, while his current players were revelling in last-day euphoria, Atkins experienced the trauma of relegation to non-league in May. \"They stayed up, but one of the biggest problems we've had is a lot of the players have been here for the last two years,\" he says. \"They've seen all this before and it's difficult to wipe away that losing mentality. If I turn this round and keep us in the league it will be a massive achievement.\" As a player, Atkins was unbeaten against the Gunners; on Guy Fawkes night 1983 he put Sunderland's winner past Pat Jennings at Highbury's Clock End. But, rather than baffle his players with stories of his heyday, on Saturday he is likely to remind them that, nine years ago, Wrexham knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup a year after finishing bottom of the league. \"The likes of Tony Adams and Lee Dixon have seen all this before, but most of the other players have not,\" Atkins adds. \"They may not be used to conditions in this neck of the woods.

      "bodyText": "The Palestinian leader was leaving Washington today after the US president failed to convince him to accept his peace proposals. Refusing to abandon his peace effort, the US president, Bill Clinton, is planning telephone diplomacy with Palestinian, Israeli and Arab leaders. \"We need to hear back very quickly,\" the White House said as time was running out on the president's elusive peace pact. More than three hours of meetings with Yasser Arafat at the White House yesterday yielded a renewed promise from the Palestinian leader to try to curb the violence that has swept away the goodwill needed for an accord. White House spokesman Jake Siewert said: \"In the end, words don't matter here. Deeds do.\" The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, said his focus had now shifted from pursuing a negotiated settlement with Mr Arafat - which he said had \"no real chance\" - to containing terrorism. \"I think everyone understands that we have a very narrow window of opportunity here,\" Mr Siewart said. He did not claim any progress on inducing Mr Arafat to accept a US outline for a negotiated settlement, but added: \"We are going to continue our work.\" He said the meetings were useful and productive and said \"we will have more discussion with the players in the region.\" He said that thanks to Mr Clinton, Mr Arafat had \"specifically agreed to end or stop or reduce acts of violence\". Mr Arafat had promised cooperation in countering terrorism, to intensify efforts to stop the shootings and to arrest those responsible. More than 350 people, mostly Palestinians, have died in violence in the Middle East in the last three months. Hassan Abdel Rahman, chief representative of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Washington, said the meetings had been useful. \"There will be further discussions,\" he said. \" Palestinian officials said that Mr Arafat had concentrated on the issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees, insisting also on reconfiguring the Palestinian state that would emerge from an accord. Mr Barak has accepted President Clinton's outline for a settlement on condition that the Palestinian leader also agrees. The US president-elect, George W Bush, said that Mr Clinton was \"giving it the very best shot he can, and I certainly hope it works\".

      "body": "<p>Yesterday morning when the newspapers were brimming with speculation about Labour's secret benefactor, he was sitting in bed in his French mansion enjoying a simple breakfast and discussing what to do for the best with one of his closest friends. Though he has donated generously to Labour in the past, Lord Hamlyn was not at all keen to be revealed as the man who had bolstered the party's coffers to the tune of \u00a32m.</p> <p>He has always shunned the spotlight where possible, preferring to get on with amassing a huge fortune in publishing and making charitable donations, mainly to the arts. Perhaps more importantly, he is very ill, suffering from cancer and Parkinson's disease, made worse by a bout of pneumonia. But knowing that his continuing anonymity was causing embarrassment to Labour - and that the truth would eventually come out - the 75-year-old peer gave permission for his identity to be disclosed. After all, he said, he was not ashamed of the donation but proud.</p> <p><b> Admission</b><br></p> <p>The belated admission came as no huge surprise to friends of the multi-millionaire. Lord Hamlyn, an anti-establishment tycoon whose family fled the Nazis, was suspicious of the left but has found a political home in Tony Blair's New Labour.</p> <p>Lord Hamlyn, who donates \u00a34m a year to philanthropic causes, has increased his donations in recent months after making a fortune on a property deal in central London. The peer has rented out Robert Maxwell's former Mirror headquarters in Holborn Circus, which has been renovated by the architect Norman Foster, to Sainsbury's for a reputed \u00a316.8m a year. Designer Sir Terence Conran, an old friend of Lord Hamlyn's, said: \"The office property market has smiled upon Paul Hamlyn and allowed him to be generous.\"</p> <p>Lord Hamlyn told friends that he netted a substantial profit on the building, which he bought in 1999 for \u00a340m, after his original tenants, Andersen Consulting, pulled out. The firm, which was paying around \u00a310m a year in rent, had to pay a severance fee. A fierce bidding war between Sainsbury's and Goldman Sachs pushed the rent up to \u00a316.8m.</p> <p>While the political storm has been brewing Lord Hamlyn has been at his French base in the Provence hills, where he met with his old friend Lord Gavron, former chairman of the Guardian Media Group, parent company of the Guardian, and himself a Labour party donor. Lord Gavron visited the tycoon yesterday when they discussed what Lord Hamlyn should do. Lord Gavron said: \"It was the first day he could have really talked about it. On Monday and the day before he was much more ill. He said he had been in touch with London. They were keen to release his name and what did I think?\" The pair agreed that it was best he agree. After all, said Lord Gavron, his friend knew that journalists would keep digging until they had discovered the donor's identity.</p> <p>Lord Hamlyn dislikes publicity. \"He's very shy,\" said Lord Gavron. \"Once he knew it was going to come out he spoke to various people involved. He said: 'If you have to say it's me, I'm not ashamed - I'm proud of it.' He has never made it a secret that he supports the Labour Party.\"</p> <p>He was born in Berlin in 1926, the youngest of four children. His father, Richard Hamburger, was a Jewish paediatrician who fled with his family in 1933, and settled in St John's Wood, north London. Lord Hamlyn was sent to a progressive boarding school in Hertfordshire. His father died when he was 16 and within two years he had left school and changed his name. \"It was really tough for a kid being called Hamburger,\" he said.</p> <p>He worked as an office boy at Country Life and then for a bookshop. During the war he was sent to the Welsh coalmines as a Bevin boy - an alternative to serving in the armed forces. At 22, he started his publishing business from a barrow in Camden market, north London, with an inheritance of \u00a3350 from his grandfather.</p> <p>Richard Charkin, chief executive of Macmillan Publishing, who worked alongside him at Reed International, said: \"He's the best marketeer I know in the book industry. He has that great ability to put himself in the role of the customer and understands the value for money concept in publishing - he invented it.\"</p> <p><b> Created</b><br></p> <p>He created and sold two publishing empires to build a personal fortune estimated at \u00a3230m. In the 70s he joined Rupert Murdoch at the News of the World Organisation - as it was then - as managing director. Though he did not stay long, a friendship endured.</p> <p>As well as his French home, he has a fabulous modern house in Chelsea. He is a partner in the upmarket restaurant Bibendum with Sir Terence Conran. The two have the same corner table and compete for it.</p> <p>Sir Terence said: \"He and his wife have all these wonderful houses. They certainly don't live a frugal life. He's very fond of his helicopter as well.\" Yet twice-married Lord Hamlyn once told an interviewer he had three racehorses but did not really approve of them - he only had them because this was expected of him. Giving some of his fortune away seems to have been a solution. \"If you have been as lucky as I have and the sums of money are as enormous as they are it seems to me unthinkable if some of it didn't go to people who need it,\" he said. He and the charitable foundation into which he ploughed \u00a350m of his personal fortune, have spent a fortune bringing the arts to the people. He has given generously to the British Museum and Bodleian Library in Oxford but has also ploughed money into helping the less well off buy cut-price ballet and opera tickets.</p> <p>And then there is politics. Like his old friend Rupert Murdoch, he is no fan of the establishment. One friend said yesterday: \"I suspect that part of his pro-Labour stance is that he is very much anti-Conservative.\" When asked what was needed to make him withdraw the controversial book Spycatcher - the autobiography of senior intelligence officer Peter Wright which Margaret Thatcher tried to ban - he replied: \"A dukedom.\" In truth, friends say he loves taking on the status quo.</p> <p>Lord Owen, a close friend, said: \"For a short time during the eighties, like a lot of people who were interested in the SDP, he slightly shifted from Labour. When Labour started to recover around 1987 he moved back towards them. He's been a good supporter of Tony Blair in particular.\"</p> <p>Though he is not a close friend of the prime minister, the Blair family have been his guests at the opera. Before the last election he spoke to Labour strategists about the best way of marketing the party. He was made a life peer two years ago, though it was stressed then that the award recognised his charity work, rather than his hefty contributions to Labour coffers.</p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7d728\">Should political donors be named?</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/politics/story/0,3604,417256,00.html\">January 3: Labour's \u00a32m donor is Hamlyn</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,417273,00.html\">January 3: Donation that triggered 48 hours of chaos</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,417074,00.html\">Profile: Paul Hamlyn</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,417047,00.html\">January 2: Lord Hamlyn is Labour's \u00a32m donor</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,416961,00.html\">January 2: Labour may ask \u00a32m donor to go public</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,416791,00.html\">January 1: Pressure on Blair to name \u00a32m donor</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,202856,00.html\">September 9 1999: Anger over minister's \u00a32m donation to Labour</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.public-standards.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Committee on standards in public life</a><br><a href=\"http://www.phf.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Paul Hamlyn Foundation</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hamlyn.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hamlyn Books</a><br><a href=\"http://www.octopus-publishing.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Octopus publishing group</a></p>",

In view of the vast profits they're making and the pressure from government, they ought to be doing something substantial to ease pressures on motorists. We are looking at doing something in the short term but with the weather and the railways, the question is whether we would have public support.\"</p> <p>Crude oil prices fell by almost a third in December, bringing the wholesale price of a litre of unleaded petrol down to 11p.

      "bodyText": "Petrol prices were cut by at least a penny a litre last night as supermarkets fired the opening shots in a potential forecourt price war. The move followed anger that the oil companies, which reported record profits just before Christmas, had failed to cut prices in line with the falling cost of crude oil. David Handley, chairman of Farmers for Action and leader of the fuel terminal blockades which brought Britain to a near standstill in September, yesterday said protesters were ready to return to the fray. \"I think it's absolutely disgusting. In view of the vast profits they're making and the pressure from government, they ought to be doing something substantial to ease pressures on motorists. We are looking at doing something in the short term but with the weather and the railways, the question is whether we would have public support.\" Crude oil prices fell by almost a third in December, bringing the wholesale price of a litre of unleaded petrol down to 11p. The oil companies are enjoying their best forecourt profit margins in months, to the anger of ministers who have demanded price cuts. \"The government has made clear its view that consumers should reap the benefits of the reduction in oil prices,\" a senior DTI source said. There is further bad news on the horizon for motorists after Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, yesterday called for heavy cuts in global crude production, which will send prices back up. A Saudi official said Opec, the 11-member oil exporters' cartel, needed to cut production by 1.5m barrels a day. Kuwait, another Opec member, will push for even bigger cuts at the cartel's meeting in the Austrian capital, Vienna, on January 17. Helen Liddell, the energy minister, will meet oil firms in the coming weeks to urge them to follow the lead taken by the supermarkets. Industry analysts say there is scope for forecourt cuts of at least 2p a litre but retailers are delaying the reduction in an attempt to claw back losses made during the blockades. Sainsbury's and Tesco cut their fuel prices by 1p last night, bringing the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol to 77.8p at Sainsbury's and 78p at Tesco. Martin Hooper, Sainsbury's general manager for petrol, put pressure on the company's rivals by highlighting falling world prices. \"With the price of fuel continuing to fall there is no reason for prices not to come down,\" he said. \"Consumers can rightly enjoy the lowest prices at the pumps for six months and if crude oil continues to fall there is always the possibility of further decreases.\" Some motorists could see bigger cuts in some areas as the supermarkets battle to remain competitive, according to a Tesco spokesman. \"Our pricing policy pledges that we will stay in line with local retailers, so in some areas it will mean a bigger drop than 1p.\" A Shell spokesman refused to discuss possible price cuts but said the firm had reduced the price of petrol and diesel at its motorway and trunk road service stations last week.

Ms Armstrong is concerned that councils have drawn up plans for more than 4,000 separate best value reviews of the services they provide and has warned: \"I think this is too many to carry through. We need simpler, more strategic review programmes.\" Though the first anniversary of the regime is not due until April 1 2001, there is already real concern that many councils have become mired in the fine detail of service reviews and have missed the opportunity to develop more joined up and strategic approaches to their work. The great irony is that many of the local leaders who have consistently expressed fears that best value would become too bureaucratic and over regulated are likely to find it is councils that are in danger of making the process far more complicated than necessary. Ms Armstrong wants councils to focus more clearly on the number and type of reviews they are proposing as part of best value. \"Ideally, an authority's review programme should be built around a mix of service-specific reviews and strategic reviews based on recognisable themes - reviews that are more likely to make a real and lasting difference,\" she said. \"I hear too many stories about reviews of tiny aspects of services.

Members of the forum are responsible for coordinating inspection work and say councils should keep the number of service reviews as low as possible to make sure the inspectorates are able to complete their work and to avoid duplication. So far only 29 best value inspection reports have been published, and some of the reports from the first full year of inspections are unlikely to be released before this summer. New research by the improvement and development agency, due to be published later this month, has shown that many councils continue to face problems breaking out of the \"fixed mindset\" of local government and developing service reviews that challenge the traditional departmental organisation of services. In a review of the work of the audit commission by the House of Commons environment transport and regional affairs select committee published in June last year said: \"We are alarmed at the current and future impact of a developing culture of over-inspection in the public sector.

      "body": "<p>George Bush put the finishing touches to his cabinet yesterday, producing an administration team blending old-school pragmatic conservativism with rightwing radicalism on key domestic issues, tempered by the striking ethnic diversity of the lineup.</p> <p>That diverse image was reinforced when the president-elect announced his last three cabinet nominees. As transport secretary he proposed Norman Mineta, a Japanese-American and a Democrat whose family was interned by the US government during the second world war. Spencer Abraham, an Arab-American senator from Michigan, was named energy secretary, and Linda Chavez, one of several Hispanic-Americans in the Bush entourage, was nominated labour secretary.</p> <p>The 14 cabinet nominees include four women and two blacks, a degree of variety which compares well with the first Clinton administration eight years ago.</p> <p>Despite the cabinet's inclusive appearance, however, resistance to the new administration continued to focus on Mr Bush's nominee for attorney general, John Ashcroft, a radical conservative.</p> <p>There is also expected to be tough questioning by environmentalists during confirmation hearings for Gale Norton, the interior secretary-designate who is a committed proponent of private property rights against government conservation priorities in battles over the creation of nature reserves.</p> <p>Tommy Thompson's nomination as secretary of health and human services is also likely to draw opposition from abortion rights groups, who are concerned over his fierce anti-abortion stand while governor of Wisconsin.</p> <p>Critics, meanwhile, have portrayed the foreign policy team - including Colin Powell as secretary of state, Donald Rumsfeld as defence secretary, Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser (not at present a cabinet-level position) and Dick Cheney as vice-president with a clear coordinating portfolio - as a throwback to the cold war era. Each of them served in earlier Republican administrations and all are opponents of the kind of humanitarian intervention pioneered under Mr Clinton.</p> <p>However, in appointing Mr Rumsfeld, a successful businessman as well as a government veteran, Mr Bush favoured pragmatic manage ment skills in national security issues over ideological zeal. He rejected rightwing demands for the appointment of Dan Coats, a conservative former senator whose priority would have been to reverse Clinton-era measures promoting tolerance of gays in the armed services.</p> <p>Yesterday's nominations were clearly intended to give the new cabinet a more progressive complexion. Mr Bush said Mr Mineta's appointment demonstrated he would run \"an administration who recognises talent wherever we see it, regardless of political party.\"</p> <p>Pointing out that there was \"no such thing as Republican or Democratic highways\" Mr Mineta said that while remaining faithful to his Democratic principles, he would seek out common ground to build bipartisan policy.</p> <p>Linda Chavez, a veteran of the Reagan administration, reminded journalists that her father was a house painter, making her keenly aware of the \"dignity of manual labour\" and vowed to work to improve workforce skills and to pro mote safe working conditions.</p> <p>The only discordant note of the day came with the nomination of Spencer Abraham, the outgoing senator from Michigan. Mr Bush said Mr Abraham, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, shared his belief in the need to meet rising energy demands with \"new domestic exploration and production\", a presumed reference to Mr Bush's proposals to look for oil in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska.</p> <p>Mr Bush lost the popular vote in the November elections to the outgoing vice-president, Al Gore, by half a million votes, but he said yesterday that that would not modify his programme.</p> <p>He pointed out that he had won the vote in the electoral college, which formally selects the president. He said: \"I believe the reason I'm standing here is because of the agenda I articulated during the course of the campaign, and I intend to take that agenda, that I tried to spell out as clearly as I could to the American people, to the halls of Congress.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Mr Bush is due to convene an economic forum in Austin, Texas, today, to hear from business leaders and economists about the health of the nation.</p> <p>The meeting will hear from the chairman of General Electric, Jack Welch, and the chief executive of Wal-Mart, Lee Scott.

      "bodyText": "George Bush put the finishing touches to his cabinet yesterday, producing an administration team blending old-school pragmatic conservativism with rightwing radicalism on key domestic issues, tempered by the striking ethnic diversity of the lineup. That diverse image was reinforced when the president-elect announced his last three cabinet nominees. As transport secretary he proposed Norman Mineta, a Japanese-American and a Democrat whose family was interned by the US government during the second world war. Spencer Abraham, an Arab-American senator from Michigan, was named energy secretary, and Linda Chavez, one of several Hispanic-Americans in the Bush entourage, was nominated labour secretary. The 14 cabinet nominees include four women and two blacks, a degree of variety which compares well with the first Clinton administration eight years ago. Despite the cabinet's inclusive appearance, however, resistance to the new administration continued to focus on Mr Bush's nominee for attorney general, John Ashcroft, a radical conservative. There is also expected to be tough questioning by environmentalists during confirmation hearings for Gale Norton, the interior secretary-designate who is a committed proponent of private property rights against government conservation priorities in battles over the creation of nature reserves. Tommy Thompson's nomination as secretary of health and human services is also likely to draw opposition from abortion rights groups, who are concerned over his fierce anti-abortion stand while governor of Wisconsin. Critics, meanwhile, have portrayed the foreign policy team - including Colin Powell as secretary of state, Donald Rumsfeld as defence secretary, Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser (not at present a cabinet-level position) and Dick Cheney as vice-president with a clear coordinating portfolio - as a throwback to the cold war era. Each of them served in earlier Republican administrations and all are opponents of the kind of humanitarian intervention pioneered under Mr Clinton. However, in appointing Mr Rumsfeld, a successful businessman as well as a government veteran, Mr Bush favoured pragmatic manage ment skills in national security issues over ideological zeal. He rejected rightwing demands for the appointment of Dan Coats, a conservative former senator whose priority would have been to reverse Clinton-era measures promoting tolerance of gays in the armed services. Yesterday's nominations were clearly intended to give the new cabinet a more progressive complexion. Mr Bush said Mr Mineta's appointment demonstrated he would run \"an administration who recognises talent wherever we see it, regardless of political party.\" Pointing out that there was \"no such thing as Republican or Democratic highways\" Mr Mineta said that while remaining faithful to his Democratic principles, he would seek out common ground to build bipartisan policy. Linda Chavez, a veteran of the Reagan administration, reminded journalists that her father was a house painter, making her keenly aware of the \"dignity of manual labour\" and vowed to work to improve workforce skills and to pro mote safe working conditions. The only discordant note of the day came with the nomination of Spencer Abraham, the outgoing senator from Michigan. Mr Bush said Mr Abraham, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, shared his belief in the need to meet rising energy demands with \"new domestic exploration and production\", a presumed reference to Mr Bush's proposals to look for oil in a national wildlife refuge in Alaska. Mr Bush lost the popular vote in the November elections to the outgoing vice-president, Al Gore, by half a million votes, but he said yesterday that that would not modify his programme. He pointed out that he had won the vote in the electoral college, which formally selects the president. He said: \"I believe the reason I'm standing here is because of the agenda I articulated during the course of the campaign, and I intend to take that agenda, that I tried to spell out as clearly as I could to the American people, to the halls of Congress.\" \u0095 Mr Bush is due to convene an economic forum in Austin, Texas, today, to hear from business leaders and economists about the health of the nation. The meeting will hear from the chairman of General Electric, Jack Welch, and the chief executive of Wal-Mart, Lee Scott. Mr Bush hopes to persuade them of the merits of his proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut. Who's who in new administration: Spencer Abraham, Energy Arab-American who supports Bush's proposal to open up Alaska for oil prospecting John Ashcroft, Attorney general A controversial appointment. Hardliner on social issues like abortion and affirmative action Linda Chavez, Labour Former head of Centre for Equal Opportunity, a conservative thinktank on racial affairs Don Evans, Commerce The Texas oilman has been raising money for Bush campaigns since 1978 Norman Mineta, Transportation Japanese-American California Democrat. Made commerce secretary by Clinton in July Gale Norton, Interior A conservative who backs property owners over the federal creation of nature reserves Paul O'Neill, Treasury A friend of Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank Roderick Paige, Education Impressed the president-elect as schools superintendent in the troubled city of Houston Colin Powell, Secretary of state Chairman of joint chiefs of staff under first President Bush. Most popular political figure in US Anthony Principi, Veterans affairs Son of Argentinian immigrant. A Vietnam veteran who has respect of veterans' groups Donald Rumsfeld, Defence Veteran of four Republican administrations and defence secretary under President Ford Tommy Thompson, Health Committed pro-life, seen by pro-choice women as a sign Bush will limit right to choose Christine Todd-Whitman, Environment Moderate Republican. Environmentalists say her record on conservation is mixed Ann Veneman, Agriculture Deputy agriculture secretary for elder Bush. Now the first woman to run the department. Environmentalists distrust her for support for large-scale agri-business.",

They also fear he might add to the pressure on the supreme court to overturn the land mark Roe vs Wade verdict, guaranteeing the right to an abortion. As a senator, Mr Ashcroft pushed for an amendment to the constitution which went further than the demands of many pro-life activists, banning abortions even in cases of incest or rape. He won a courage and integrity award from the American Life League, one of the most militant anti-abortion groups which picket family planning clinics.

The magazine specialises in articles by apologists for the slave-owning Confederate states in the Civil War, and once marketed a T-shirt emblazoned with Abraham Lincoln's portrait and the words of his assassin: \"Thus always to tyrants.\" During the Republican primary elections, the Bush campaign criticised a consultant in the John McCain camp for contributing to the same magazine. The nomination of judges and judicial officials often provides the most contested battlefields in the formative months of a presidency. Congress has blocked most of President Clinton's judicial nominations since Republicans seized control of the legislature in 1994. Earlier, Democrats united to block one of President Reagan's nominees to the US supreme court, Robert Bork, and later tried unsuccessfully to stop President Bush's equally conservative nominee, Clarence Thomas. It looks as if they may fail again this time around.

Dyer was the recipient this time, seemingly for foul and abusive language towards one of the referee's assistants, who drew Bennett's attention to an incident after Dyer felt he should have had a free-kick. Tottenham Hotspur (3-5-2): Sullivan; Doherty, Perry, Campbell; Leonhardsen (Walker, 48min), Anderton (Young, 83), Sherwood, King, Clemence; Rebrov, Ferdinand. Newcastle United(4-4-2): Harper; Barton, Goma, Hughes, Griffin (Glass, 69); Solano, Acuna, Speed, Bassedas; Dyer, Ameobi (Lua-Lua, 69). Referee: S Bennett.",

The current babble about presidential \"legacy\" strikes me in much the same way. History will evolve its verdict in time; meanwhile, the effort self-consciously to condition a legacy seems bogus by definition.</p> <p>In Clinton's case, the bogusness is enhanced by a flurry of executive orders and stroke-of-a-pen decisions, whereby he enacts things that he didn't have the guts to do in eight years of office. Having pardoned a few crooks (that bit presumably came naturally) he suddenly pardoned two non-violent narcotics offenders, gave an interview to Rolling Stone saying that he had his doubts about the war on drugs, rammed through some pro-labour and pro-environmental provisions, and announced that after all the US would sign the Rome Treaty setting up an international court to try war criminals. (The last action was taken a few hours before the New Year deadline.)</p> <p>The crooks to one side, I am glad in principle to see all these decisions and I'd have been glad if Clinton had also responded to the appeal for a last-minute moratorium on the death penalty. (He didn't have the nerve, or do I mean the face, for that.) However, the means and the method seem so opportunistic and surreptitious, as well as smacking of an \"Order in Council\" or monarchical decree, that they tend to degrade the causes they favour. The opportunism can even have a negative effect, because although the pardons cannot be undone, the Rome Treaty can, and it is quite reasonable constitutionally for an incoming administration and a new congress to announce that it can't and won't be bound by a last-minute fiat. One can even picture certain Republicans seizing the lucky chance to repudiate the treaty as a matter of principle rather than of expediency.</p> <p>It sounds amazing, and indeed it is amazing, but the opposition to the treaty thus far has been very candid: we don't want an international legal agreement governing war crimes because we may want to commit a few. This admission, that War Crimes 'R Us, might have been cloaked in a more seemly garb. However, there it is. The US under Clinton vetoed the United Nations resolution that would have beefed up the UN protection force in Rwanda before the genocide. It then supported the short-lived French military intervention on the side of those who committed the genocide. It nominated Slobodan Milosevic as a \"partner in peace\" at Dayton, and issued him a safe-conduct to the Ohio meeting while agreeing to his demand that Kosovo be left off the agenda. It managed to remain officially tight-lipped about all the court decisions concerning General Pinochet, even though investigations persist into his role in the murder of several American citizens. Almost the last words heard by General Suharto of Indonesia (before he, too, wisely opted to become a senile invalid) were the words of the Clinton spokesman who described him as \"our kind of ally\".</p> <p>As with the landmines treaty, where Clinton also took a unilateralist and rejectionist position, the view seems to be that we won't discard any tactic we might feel we need. Obviously, one isn't a superpower for nothing, and there is the future to think about. However, I think the present evident nervousness about war crimes has also to do with the past, and the ways in which this past is legally as well as morally inescapable.</p> <p>The proposition is about to be tested in two ways. It is quite probable that within a few weeks we will see General Ariel Sharon installed as prime minister of Israel. An Israeli commission of inquiry has already found him \"indirectly responsible\" for war crimes committed in Lebanon in 1982; an international tribunal could not possibly have come to such a lenient conclusion from the known facts. (The main \"known fact\" actually doesn't do the Palestinians much credit; their militia and its allies had destroyed the Christian Lebanese town of Damour a few years previously; the Phalangist unit released by Sharon into Sabra and Shatila camps was called the Damour Brigade and was composed of extremist survivors of that atrocity; Sharon's self-evident guilt thus also bespatters at least the military leadership of his victims. But these questions are supposed to be complicated.) American law as it stands prohibits the US government from giving aid to any country that harbours a wanted war criminal. Saudi Arabia is forgiven for sheltering Idi Amin, which it does to this day, on the presumable grounds that Riyadh gives aid to the American economy rather than the other way about. But these distinctions will become less fine once a boastful sponsor of bloody pogroms becomes the main recipient of Washington's military and economic subventions.</p> <p>Then there is the spectre of Pinochet himself, and his chief death-squad organiser Manuel Contreras. In the past few months alone, it has been disclosed that Contreras (who is already in a Chilean jail) had enjoyed a full year on the CIA payroll. It has also been announced that certain highly placed people in the state department knew of the operation, code-named \"Condor\", whereby Pinochet colluded with fellow-dictators in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay to conduct bombings and assassinations well beyond their own borders. One of those bombings took place in downtown Washington, a few hundred yards from where I live, at rush hour on September 21 1976. It murdered Orlando Letelier, a leading Chilean dissident, and his American friend Ronni Moffitt. It remains the only such act of state-supported terrorism ever to have occurred in the capital. Give American law credit for one thing: it is very slow and convoluted but it has an unstoppable quality. As I write, the mills are still grinding. The justice department is becoming less neutral, the FBI feels that it knows who issued the order, the ugly question of obstruction of justice and withholding of evidence is becoming more salient. At long last, the judicial arm may be about to assert itself. If and when it does - not to keep you in suspense much longer - a very famous American pundit may find himself somewhat embarrassed, not to say compromised.</p> <p>I opened by saying that we cannot imagine our own deaths; this need not inhibit us from being strict and exact with those who enjoy imagining and encompassing the death of others.</p> <p>\u0095 Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation. His collection of essays on literature, Unacknowledged Legislation, is published this month. His latest book, The Trial of Henry Kissinger, will be published in March. Francis Wheen is away.</p>",

It sounds amazing, and indeed it is amazing, but the opposition to the treaty thus far has been very candid: we don't want an international legal agreement governing war crimes because we may want to commit a few. This admission, that War Crimes 'R Us, might have been cloaked in a more seemly garb. However, there it is. The US under Clinton vetoed the United Nations resolution that would have beefed up the UN protection force in Rwanda before the genocide. It then supported the short-lived French military intervention on the side of those who committed the genocide. It nominated Slobodan Milosevic as a \"partner in peace\" at Dayton, and issued him a safe-conduct to the Ohio meeting while agreeing to his demand that Kosovo be left off the agenda. It managed to remain officially tight-lipped about all the court decisions concerning General Pinochet, even though investigations persist into his role in the murder of several American citizens. Almost the last words heard by General Suharto of Indonesia (before he, too, wisely opted to become a senile invalid) were the words of the Clinton spokesman who described him as \"our kind of ally\". As with the landmines treaty, where Clinton also took a unilateralist and rejectionist position, the view seems to be that we won't discard any tactic we might feel we need. Obviously, one isn't a superpower for nothing, and there is the future to think about. However, I think the present evident nervousness about war crimes has also to do with the past, and the ways in which this past is legally as well as morally inescapable. The proposition is about to be tested in two ways. It is quite probable that within a few weeks we will see General Ariel Sharon installed as prime minister of Israel. An Israeli commission of inquiry has already found him \"indirectly responsible\" for war crimes committed in Lebanon in 1982; an international tribunal could not possibly have come to such a lenient conclusion from the known facts. (The main \"known fact\" actually doesn't do the Palestinians much credit; their militia and its allies had destroyed the Christian Lebanese town of Damour a few years previously; the Phalangist unit released by Sharon into Sabra and Shatila camps was called the Damour Brigade and was composed of extremist survivors of that atrocity; Sharon's self-evident guilt thus also bespatters at least the military leadership of his victims. But these questions are supposed to be complicated.) American law as it stands prohibits the US government from giving aid to any country that harbours a wanted war criminal. Saudi Arabia is forgiven for sheltering Idi Amin, which it does to this day, on the presumable grounds that Riyadh gives aid to the American economy rather than the other way about. But these distinctions will become less fine once a boastful sponsor of bloody pogroms becomes the main recipient of Washington's military and economic subventions. Then there is the spectre of Pinochet himself, and his chief death-squad organiser Manuel Contreras. In the past few months alone, it has been disclosed that Contreras (who is already in a Chilean jail) had enjoyed a full year on the CIA payroll. It has also been announced that certain highly placed people in the state department knew of the operation, code-named \"Condor\", whereby Pinochet colluded with fellow-dictators in Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay to conduct bombings and assassinations well beyond their own borders. One of those bombings took place in downtown Washington, a few hundred yards from where I live, at rush hour on September 21 1976. It murdered Orlando Letelier, a leading Chilean dissident, and his American friend Ronni Moffitt. It remains the only such act of state-supported terrorism ever to have occurred in the capital. Give American law credit for one thing: it is very slow and convoluted but it has an unstoppable quality. As I write, the mills are still grinding. The justice department is becoming less neutral, the FBI feels that it knows who issued the order, the ugly question of obstruction of justice and withholding of evidence is becoming more salient. At long last, the judicial arm may be about to assert itself. If and when it does - not to keep you in suspense much longer - a very famous American pundit may find himself somewhat embarrassed, not to say compromised. I opened by saying that we cannot imagine our own deaths; this need not inhibit us from being strict and exact with those who enjoy imagining and encompassing the death of others. \u0095 Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation.

      "bodyText": "A sexually transmitted disease that infects thousands of women in Britain is strongly linked to cervical cancer, scientists said yesterday. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common sexually transmitted organism in Britain, accounting in 1999 for 24,311 known new infections in men and 32,544 in women. But because most cases show no symptoms, the actual number of infections is thought to be up to 90% greater. The most serious threat from chlamydia is that it can make women sterile but other long term effects include pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. Findings reported by Finnish scientists suggest it may also play a role in triggering cervical cancer. One specific chlamydia strain, known as serotype G, is associated with a 6.6-fold increase in cancer risk, according to the study published yesterday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Women infected with two other strains had their chances of contracting cervical cancer increased by 3.8 and 2.7 times. Exposure to more than one strain raised the overall risk. The investigators collated the results of blood tests given to 530,000 women in Finland, Norway and Sweden. This data was matched to national cancer registries in each country. The scientists, led by Tarja Anttila from the national public health institute in Oulu, Finland, and Jorma Paavonen, from the University of Helsinki, then focused on 128 women who developed invasive cervical cancer at least 12 months after donating a blood sample. The researchers looked for any association between the presence of antibodies identifying 10 different chlamydia strains and the development of squamous cell carcinoma, the most common form of cervical cancer. According to the public health laboratory, the number of diagnosed chlamydia infections has soared by 76% since 1995. Press Association",

The leader of Hamas on the West Bank, Hassan Youssof, in an interview with the Guardian, accompanied the chilling warning with a prediction that Mr Arafat would be forced to reject the proposed settlement. Until now, Hamas, the most feared of the Palestinian guerrilla groups, has struck only against Israeli targets. Although it has long opposed Mr Arafat's peace negotiations, it is now threatening to extend its campaign of violence to the Palestinian Authority leadership. Mr Youssof said the political danger for Mr Arafat was that he could end up being confronted not only by Hamas but also a breakaway from his own organisation, Fatah, which he claimed had established strong links with Hamas since the uprising began in September. The Hamas warning adds to the already enormous pressure on Mr Arafat, who met Mr Clinton in Washington last night to discuss the US peace plan. Mr Youssof said all three key elements of the proposed peace settlement - the fate of the Palestinian refugees, the future of the Jerusalem holy site and the territorial division - were unacceptable. He added: \"As a Palestinian organisation, we refuse any agreement that does not give the Palestinian people three things: the right of its refugees to return to their homes; all of Jerusalem; and gets all settlers out of the West Bank and Gaza.\" The US proposals offer none of those. Mr Youssof, 49, who has been jailed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority, hinted strongly that Israel could expect a return to suicide bombings, a campaign that created terror in Israel between 1994 and 1996. \"Hamas will not stop fighting and bombing until the occupation is over,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>So, it ended more as a tale of naivety than knavery, another classic lesson for a political party in how not to conduct its affairs. After three days of procrastination, Labour yesterday finally identified its latest \u00a32m donor. The truth - Lord Hamlyn, publisher, philanthropist and long-time Labour supporter - was far less painful than the speculation. So why did they try to hide it? Why did they try to slip this one in before the deadline of February 16, after which the identity and sum of all large gifts will have to be declared?</p> <p>It falls into that very human impulse - getting away with it, while breaking no rules. Thousands of people do it all the time - it's the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Paul Hamlyn has certainly done nothing wrong. He thinks his beneficence is helping democracy. He thought, especially in the light of a serious illness, that he was entitled to anonymity. His friends in the party should have told him this was no longer possible.</p> <p>The problem is expectation. After years of Tory sleaze, this Labour government was expected to be more ethical and more transparent. This is what the prime minister said in August 1997, issuing a new code of conduct for ministers: \"We are all here to serve, and we must all serve honestly, and in the interests of those who gave us our positions of trust.\" Three months later the Bernie Ecclestone and the formula one tobacco saga was revealed.</p> <p>It is harder to be open when you're running short of money - or when you think you're running short of money. At Millbank Tower and at the Tories' Smith Square HQ, they have been trying to devise ever more intricate ways of balancing the books. Long before they lost power, the Conservatives were finding it harder to convince blue chip companies there was anything to be gained from opening their coffers. Hence the reliance on Michael Ashcroft and a few other individuals. Tony Blair's complicated relationship with the trade unions has made life harder for Millbank's money-gatherers. Union donations are coming in again for the election, but not as quickly or as generously as the party would like. New Labour's wooing of the City in the mid-90s still leaves a number of generously-minded big companies, but fewer than before. Hence, the reliance on Lord Sainsbury and a few other individuals.</p> <p>A year ago, Labour came clean with David Sainsbury's \u00a32m, and that story died within a day. Part of the reason for acting so promptly was the knowledge - in the light of the Ecclestone revelations - that Millbank is a leaky place. \"Anyone who thinks that we could carry another \u00a32m donation all the way to the election without it getting out is guilty of gross naivety,\" said one minister.</p> <p>It was Tony Blair who asked Lord Neill's committee on standards in public life to investigate the funding of political parties. John Major had refused to do this. The committee's report of October 1998 was largely accepted by the government, and it is this legislation which comes into effect in six weeks time. Three measures stand out - the formation of an electoral commission, a limit of \u00a320m per party in election spending, and the requirement that the names and amounts of all donations over \u00a35,000 be declared.</p> <p>Laudable though the changes are, they won't be enough. In the long-term, state funding will be the only option. The committee looked at state funding in a number of countries, concluding that although the issue is \"finely balanced\", it thought best to hold off. In their submission to the committee, the Liberal Democrats came up with a scheme - artfully designed to help medium-sized parties - in which any party with more than 5% of the vote would get \u00a32m, with a further \u00a310m distributed between the parties in proportion to the national vote.</p> <p>The Tories and Labour opposed the idea of state funding. But now in Downing Street and at Millbank there are signs of change. Several key figures who were opposed to state funding are now wavering. Intriguingly, Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh - no great advocate of constitutional reform - is now suggesting there is a \"persuasive argument for state funding of political parties\". Tony Blair is said to be, \"on balance against, but persuadable\".</p> <p>He can be persuaded. One of the arguments against state funding is that it divorces politics from voters - no more community tombolas, no more effort to bring new members on board.

      "bodyText": "So, it ended more as a tale of naivety than knavery, another classic lesson for a political party in how not to conduct its affairs. After three days of procrastination, Labour yesterday finally identified its latest \u00a32m donor. The truth - Lord Hamlyn, publisher, philanthropist and long-time Labour supporter - was far less painful than the speculation. So why did they try to hide it? Why did they try to slip this one in before the deadline of February 16, after which the identity and sum of all large gifts will have to be declared? It falls into that very human impulse - getting away with it, while breaking no rules. Thousands of people do it all the time - it's the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Paul Hamlyn has certainly done nothing wrong. He thinks his beneficence is helping democracy. He thought, especially in the light of a serious illness, that he was entitled to anonymity. His friends in the party should have told him this was no longer possible. The problem is expectation. After years of Tory sleaze, this Labour government was expected to be more ethical and more transparent. This is what the prime minister said in August 1997, issuing a new code of conduct for ministers: \"We are all here to serve, and we must all serve honestly, and in the interests of those who gave us our positions of trust.\" Three months later the Bernie Ecclestone and the formula one tobacco saga was revealed. It is harder to be open when you're running short of money - or when you think you're running short of money. At Millbank Tower and at the Tories' Smith Square HQ, they have been trying to devise ever more intricate ways of balancing the books. Long before they lost power, the Conservatives were finding it harder to convince blue chip companies there was anything to be gained from opening their coffers. Hence the reliance on Michael Ashcroft and a few other individuals. Tony Blair's complicated relationship with the trade unions has made life harder for Millbank's money-gatherers. Union donations are coming in again for the election, but not as quickly or as generously as the party would like. New Labour's wooing of the City in the mid-90s still leaves a number of generously-minded big companies, but fewer than before. Hence, the reliance on Lord Sainsbury and a few other individuals. A year ago, Labour came clean with David Sainsbury's \u00a32m, and that story died within a day. Part of the reason for acting so promptly was the knowledge - in the light of the Ecclestone revelations - that Millbank is a leaky place. \"Anyone who thinks that we could carry another \u00a32m donation all the way to the election without it getting out is guilty of gross naivety,\" said one minister. It was Tony Blair who asked Lord Neill's committee on standards in public life to investigate the funding of political parties. John Major had refused to do this. The committee's report of October 1998 was largely accepted by the government, and it is this legislation which comes into effect in six weeks time. Three measures stand out - the formation of an electoral commission, a limit of \u00a320m per party in election spending, and the requirement that the names and amounts of all donations over \u00a35,000 be declared. Laudable though the changes are, they won't be enough. In the long-term, state funding will be the only option. The committee looked at state funding in a number of countries, concluding that although the issue is \"finely balanced\", it thought best to hold off. In their submission to the committee, the Liberal Democrats came up with a scheme - artfully designed to help medium-sized parties - in which any party with more than 5% of the vote would get \u00a32m, with a further \u00a310m distributed between the parties in proportion to the national vote. The Tories and Labour opposed the idea of state funding. But now in Downing Street and at Millbank there are signs of change. Several key figures who were opposed to state funding are now wavering. Intriguingly, Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh - no great advocate of constitutional reform - is now suggesting there is a \"persuasive argument for state funding of political parties\". Tony Blair is said to be, \"on balance against, but persuadable\". He can be persuaded. One of the arguments against state funding is that it divorces politics from voters - no more community tombolas, no more effort to bring new members on board. Yet, apart from a blip before the last election, membership is on a steady downward spiral. The reasons for people deserting political parties are many, but not being able to give money is hardly one of them. In any case, small contributions would not necessarily have to be banned. Schemes could be devised allowing parties to top up the money they get from the state with membership dues, or by other local means. There could be an element of matching funding - as long as the private money was openly declared. There could be extra money for research, or as in Germany for party-based think tanks.

She withdrew her application in the summer without explanation. But since parliament changed the law in October, making it possible for women to serve in tank battalions, as fighter pilots or on submarines, more than 1,900 women have applied to join, either as commissioned or non-commissioned officers. The reform brings Germany into line with other Nato members, including France, Britain and the US - though some countries still keep women out of infantry combat units and submarine crews. Yesterday, 151 women reported for duty in the army, 76 in the air force and 17 in the navy - for the first time facing the same basic training as men. \"Basic training will certainly be a difficult job, but that's why I'm here,\" said Aysun Yazici, 18, reporting for duty at the barracks at D\u00fclmen in the north-west.

The long-term spending boost to social policy which Labour introduced then was historic, ending an era stretching back two decades. \"Public expenditure,\" declared the opening sentence of Margaret Thatcher's first white paper in 1979 \"is at the heart of Britain's present economic difficulties\". What followed through her years of stewardship proved how true she was to that bleak conclusion.</p> <p>By the time New Labour at last saw the light, public services were deeply demoralised and financially impoverished. For over a decade under Margaret Thatcher, they were publicly derided for the way they spent money rather than made it. Even the people's priorities, such as education and health, for which polls showed large majorities in favour of major investment, continued to be denied the resources they needed. The final insult was New Labour's stubborn adherence to Tory spending targets for its first two years - targets the Tories would never have stuck to.</p> <p>But all has now changed. We have had not one, but two comprehensive spending reviews. Together, they account for the largest sustained increase in social policy spending ever envisaged. It is not just the size of the increase - health spending rising at twice its historic rate - but the length of the programme. For the first time in a generation, education and health administrators can plan ahead. The second review has guaranteed increases - a real terms rise of one third for the NHS - through to 2004.</p> <p>Politics has changed too. Labour is rightly bragging about the size of the increases. Tony Blair called a special Downing Street press conference in November where in pre-election mood he said what he should have said long before: \"Who can seriously doubt that Britain has been chronically underinvested in for over 20 years? We have the fourth biggest economy in the world. Yet we do not have the fourth best public services. I lay the blame for that firmly at the door of underinvestment.\"</p> <p>Even more fascinating is the Tory response. Labour's initial spending review was dubbed \"irresponsible and reckless\". But by last July's second review, even they were promising to match Labour pound for pound in increases for health and education - although they remained committed to spending cuts of between \u00a38bn and \u00a316bn to other unspecified services. By last month, Mr Hague was talking about spending reductions that would come from \"savings - not cuts to public services\". He must have known this was nonsense.</p> <p>Public spending is reinstalled as a public virtue. But Labour faces two other problems. First, given the two-year delay at the start, there will be little sign of the benefits from these big increases between now and the election. It takes three years to train a nurse and seven years for a doctor. And as Nigel Lawson ruefully noted when chancellor, the problem with increased education expenditure is that its returns are not apparent within the life term of even the longest-lived administration.</p> <p>Labour's second problem is the dire state of public services which it inherited. Far too many teachers, social workers and health staff have been forced to work amid dilapidation and squalor. Even Labour's historic increases will need to last for more than a decade to turn round two decades of financial squeeze. A third challenge has already been anticipated by Gordon Brown: the need to ensure the extra money is well spent. No chancellor has done more to put in place proper monitoring arrangements.</p> <p>There are plenty of reforms in Labour's record of which they can be rightly proud. They have started to reverse the brutal widening of inequality that occurred under the Tories - the threefold increase in child poverty. Over 1.2m of the 4.4m children living in poverty will be lifted out by 2002. Even more boldly, Labour is committed to lifting them all out by 2020. There has never been a period with so many social experiments - 18 separate taskforces tackling urban regeneration, a flurry of special initiatives to deal with the socially excluded (rough sleepers, truants, children in care), a clutch of new programmes to help families under pressure.</p> <p>Mainstream services have made major advances. In education, the most notable has been the improvement in English and maths in primary schools, where Labour introduced daily literacy and numeracy hours. In law 'n' order, a new emphasis on prevention - including helping 2m poor householders to reinforce their property - has drastically reduced burglaries and car thefts. The government's 10-year health plan won the endorsement of all the major players - medics, managers and nurses.</p> <p>But there is plenty more to do. Education ministers have still not provided a coherent plan for non-academic 14-year-olds. Their under-funding of universities has been shameful. The Home Office has honoured the first but not the second half of the party's mantra: tough on crime, tough on its causes - and has been absurdly timid in reforming our outdated drug laws. Vigilance is needed if the anti-racist reforms that followed the Lawrence inquiry are to succeed.</p> <p>The Conservatives pose no threat. They remain incoherent, initially conceding they needed to become more caring, but now reverting to hardline policies that will only alienate them further from the centre ground. Labour has done much to deserve a second term. First because of the way it has made Britain a fairer society. Second, so that its many fascinating social experiments can have a proper trial. Successful projects need time for consolidation and expansion - and for failures to be weeded out.</p>",

In education, the most notable has been the improvement in English and maths in primary schools, where Labour introduced daily literacy and numeracy hours. In law 'n' order, a new emphasis on prevention - including helping 2m poor householders to reinforce their property - has drastically reduced burglaries and car thefts. The government's 10-year health plan won the endorsement of all the major players - medics, managers and nurses. But there is plenty more to do. Education ministers have still not provided a coherent plan for non-academic 14-year-olds. Their under-funding of universities has been shameful. The Home Office has honoured the first but not the second half of the party's mantra: tough on crime, tough on its causes - and has been absurdly timid in reforming our outdated drug laws. Vigilance is needed if the anti-racist reforms that followed the Lawrence inquiry are to succeed. The Conservatives pose no threat. They remain incoherent, initially conceding they needed to become more caring, but now reverting to hardline policies that will only alienate them further from the centre ground. Labour has done much to deserve a second term. First because of the way it has made Britain a fairer society. Second, so that its many fascinating social experiments can have a proper trial. Successful projects need time for consolidation and expansion - and for failures to be weeded out.",

      "body": "<p>The Guardian's monarchy debate has opened up a raft of wider constitutional questions, including not just the role of the monarchy but also the role of parliament in the light of devolution. How much is Westminster still the parliament for the whole of the UK; and how much a parliament for England? Our new book, The State and the Nations, exposes for the first time the extent to which Westminster already operates as an English parliament, and its potential to develop this role further.</p> <p>Post-devolution, some have suggested that there should be a separate English parliament to match the Scottish parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. This is not a realistic option.</p> <p>Those who demand one are in effect demanding a full-blown federation, in which the four historic nations would form the component parts. But there is no successful federation in the world where one of the parts is greater than around one-third of the whole. England, with four-fifths of the population, would be hugely dominant: even more dominant than Prussia in the old Germany. Nor would it meet the demands for representation coming from the English regions: to them, an English parliament looks like another form of London dominance.</p> <p>Nor is there any strong public demand: the Campaign for an English Parliament has attracted little public following during its weekly vigils in Parliament Square. When asked in last year's British Social Attitudes survey, 62% of the English said it would be best for England to be governed as it is now, with laws made by the UK parliament, while only 18% said it would be best for England to have its own parliament. And, intriguingly, 30% said they viewed the Houses of Parliament as English, or more English than British: while 27% viewed parliament as equally English and British.</p> <p>The English may have been uttering a greater constitutional truth than they knew. For buried within Westminster is an English parliament which devolution is beginning to disclose. Before devolution we had a three-in-one parliament, and it was clear when Westminster was operating as the legislature for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Post-devolution we are developing a four-in-one parliament, and it will need to become clearer when Westminster is operating in English mode. English business is transacted through the work of the select committees; through the new standing committee on regional affairs (which will be open only to English MPs); through questions to ministers on English matters; through Westminster Hall, which provides a further forum for English debates; and through English legislation.</p> <p>At present, this English business is mixed up with other business. But if we just take the scrutiny function of Westminster, we can see how parliament is developing a sharper territorial focus. Among the select committees we have found four committees whose membership consists solely of English MPs. Three are on subjects you would expect - education and employment, health, and home affairs - matters in which Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland MPs no longer have an interest, because these subjects are now largely devolved. And if we look at the government departments which those select committees scrutinise, we find that their ministers are all MPs from English constituencies.</p> <p>Eight Whitehall home departments are now \"English\" ministries, and the only departments with ministers from Scotland and Wales (apart from the Scottish and Welsh Offices) are the all-UK departments: the Treasury, Foreign Office, DfID, Social Security, DTI. In terms of English business, the main committees whose work included a significant English element are health, education and employment, environment, transport and the regions, and home affairs.</p> <p>Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland not only have their select committees; each also has a grand committee consisting of all the MPs for the territory. Up to now there has been no English equivalent to the territorial grand committees. But in April the House of Commons agreed to revive the standing committee on regional affairs, consisting of 13 members from English constituencies, with power to consider \"any matter relating to regional affairs in England\". Not a big or powerful committee; but it would be the first English committee. And Margaret Beckett has indicated that the committee could expand its role if pressure for English forums at Westminster grows.</p> <p>I do not want to overstate these developments. What our book describes is a series of tentative and sometimes unwitting steps in which Westminster is responding to devolution. There has been no strong lead from the government, and no clear sense of Westminster's new role.

      "bodyText": "The Guardian's monarchy debate has opened up a raft of wider constitutional questions, including not just the role of the monarchy but also the role of parliament in the light of devolution. How much is Westminster still the parliament for the whole of the UK; and how much a parliament for England? Our new book, The State and the Nations, exposes for the first time the extent to which Westminster already operates as an English parliament, and its potential to develop this role further. Post-devolution, some have suggested that there should be a separate English parliament to match the Scottish parliament and the Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. This is not a realistic option. Those who demand one are in effect demanding a full-blown federation, in which the four historic nations would form the component parts. But there is no successful federation in the world where one of the parts is greater than around one-third of the whole. England, with four-fifths of the population, would be hugely dominant: even more dominant than Prussia in the old Germany. Nor would it meet the demands for representation coming from the English regions: to them, an English parliament looks like another form of London dominance. Nor is there any strong public demand: the Campaign for an English Parliament has attracted little public following during its weekly vigils in Parliament Square. When asked in last year's British Social Attitudes survey, 62% of the English said it would be best for England to be governed as it is now, with laws made by the UK parliament, while only 18% said it would be best for England to have its own parliament. And, intriguingly, 30% said they viewed the Houses of Parliament as English, or more English than British: while 27% viewed parliament as equally English and British. The English may have been uttering a greater constitutional truth than they knew. For buried within Westminster is an English parliament which devolution is beginning to disclose. Before devolution we had a three-in-one parliament, and it was clear when Westminster was operating as the legislature for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Post-devolution we are developing a four-in-one parliament, and it will need to become clearer when Westminster is operating in English mode. English business is transacted through the work of the select committees; through the new standing committee on regional affairs (which will be open only to English MPs); through questions to ministers on English matters; through Westminster Hall, which provides a further forum for English debates; and through English legislation. At present, this English business is mixed up with other business. But if we just take the scrutiny function of Westminster, we can see how parliament is developing a sharper territorial focus. Among the select committees we have found four committees whose membership consists solely of English MPs. Three are on subjects you would expect - education and employment, health, and home affairs - matters in which Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland MPs no longer have an interest, because these subjects are now largely devolved. And if we look at the government departments which those select committees scrutinise, we find that their ministers are all MPs from English constituencies. Eight Whitehall home departments are now \"English\" ministries, and the only departments with ministers from Scotland and Wales (apart from the Scottish and Welsh Offices) are the all-UK departments: the Treasury, Foreign Office, DfID, Social Security, DTI. In terms of English business, the main committees whose work included a significant English element are health, education and employment, environment, transport and the regions, and home affairs. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland not only have their select committees; each also has a grand committee consisting of all the MPs for the territory. Up to now there has been no English equivalent to the territorial grand committees. But in April the House of Commons agreed to revive the standing committee on regional affairs, consisting of 13 members from English constituencies, with power to consider \"any matter relating to regional affairs in England\". Not a big or powerful committee; but it would be the first English committee. And Margaret Beckett has indicated that the committee could expand its role if pressure for English forums at Westminster grows. I do not want to overstate these developments. What our book describes is a series of tentative and sometimes unwitting steps in which Westminster is responding to devolution. There has been no strong lead from the government, and no clear sense of Westminster's new role. The clearest vision so far has come from the Wakeham commission on Lords reform, which proposed that a reformed House of Lords could represent the nations and regions of the UK, like the second chamber in federal systems. If further reform of the Lords takes place on these lines, the Lords could claim to be the chamber representing the nations of the UK, including elected members from the regions of England. We would have created a quasi-federal parliament, with an English parliament nestling within it; but we dare not yet speak its name.

The proposals, published last month, will see city mayors and local authority cabinets taking only \"key decisions\" - spending or cutting \"significant\" amounts of money, or decisions that affect two or more wards - in public. The vagueness of the definition is likely to mean that, in many cases, the council itself may decide which decisions were key. The Tories claim this will restrict the rights of voters. They want to see the status quo maintained, and have promised to re-introduce it when they return to power. The shadow environment minister, Archie Norman, said: \"Before the election, Tony Blair promised to make government more open. But obsessed with control freakery, Labour are now creating a new culture of secrecy in local councils.\" The changes were laid before parliament on December 19 as a statutory instrument - a legal add-on to last year's Local Government Act. Opposition parties have 40 days to challenge such instruments. Council openness has been a touchy subject for the past year. Ministers wanted to see many more decisions taken behind closed doors, but were forced to climb down under pressure from journalists and opposition parties, and to do a deal with the Liberal Democrats to pass the local government bill through a sceptical Lords. The Local Government Association defended the new openness regime. Assistant director John Rees said: \"Local government is used to taking far more decisions than any other public body in the open. But it is the case that there are issues that benefit from being discussed in private or without undue publicity being given to them at an early stage.\"",

      "bodyText": "It was a mark of the esteem in which George Carman QC was held that even some of those brought down by arguably the greatest courtroom advocate of the 20th century lined up to pay tribute to him yesterday. \"George Carman QC was meticulous in preparation, formidable in combat and he had the coiled spring of a cobra when he had an unexpected surprise,\" said Jonathan Aitken, the disgraced former cabinet minister whose courtroom struggle with the diminutive QC led to his imprisonment for perjury and perverting the course of justice. \"After the battle, he was the quintessence of a chivalrous knight errant, displaying compassion, grace, humour and generosity of spirit.\" Roy Amlott QC, chairman of the Bar Council, said it was a tragedy that Carman, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year, should have died so soon after his retirement. \"He was undoubtedly one of the greatest advocates of our time and one of the few members of the bar who has become a household name through his work as an advocate.\" Ken Dodd, the comedian who was successfully defended by Carman when he faced charges of tax evasion, said he was \"very sad\" to hear of his death. \"George Carman was a very good friend and a brilliant advocate. He was a very passionate man with a wonderful sense of humour. He will be sorely missed.\" Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, described him as an outstanding trial lawyer of the old school and a gifted and deadly cross-examiner. \"These skills, honed in criminal courts, were turned to devastating account in all the major libel trials that marked the climax of his long career.\" But for a man who was so clearly the leader in his particular field, perhaps the most surprising element of Carman's career was just how late he rose to legal superstardom. After studying law at Oxford - he graduated in 1952 with first class honours - followed by a pupillage in London, Carman plied his trade as a criminal barrister in the relative obscurity of the northern circuit. He became a QC in 1971, but it was not until until 1979, when Jeremy Thorpe's solicitor, David Napley, chose Carman to defend the former Liberal party leader on charges of conspiracy to murder, that he cemented the reputation that would see him become the most sought-after libel lawyer in the business. His closing address to the jury, in which he ended by saying that Thorpe had won millions of votes from the people of Britain but now came the 12 most precious votes of all - \"yours and yours and yours\" pointing to each member of the panel in turn - will go down as one of the most dramatic in legal history. Thorpe was acquitted and Carman never looked back. From the austere surroundings of Manchester crown court his new stage became the rather grander Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand, and whoever the litigant might be, it was always Carman who ended up being the star. He may have only stood 5ft 3in tall, but from Gillian Taylforth, the EastEnders actress who sued the Sun over reports that she had performed oral sex on her fiance Geoff Knight in their Range Rover in a layby on the A1, to Jonathan Aitken in his disastrous libel action against the Guardian, he struck fear into the hearts of all those he \"Carmanised\". His reputation was such that many litigants are said to have been put off suing simply after receiving letters from solicitors informing them that Carman had been retained to defend the action. \"Whatever award is given for libel, being cross-examined by you would not make it enough money,\" the South African journalist Jani Allan, who sued over allegations that she had slept with the neo-Nazi leader, Eugene Terre' Blanche, famously put it. Carman had a stage whisper that could be heard halfway down the Strand, something that he used with devastating effect to put off the other barrister in mid stride. Desmond Browne QC, Neil Hamilton's barrister during the disgraced former minister's ill-fated libel battle against Mohamed Al Fayed in 1999, finally cracked after being subjected to a litany of audible insults about the line of questioning he was taking. \"The noises off really are becoming intolerable,\" he told Mr Justice Morland. But the judge, clearly amused by Carman's antics, responded: \"You'll just have to do your best Mr Browne.\" The diminutive QC's cross-examinations were eagerly anticipated by the press benches in much the same way as boxing fans might look forward to a heavyweight title bout. His ability to produce the soundbite that would invariably dominate the front pages of the next day's newspapers was legendary. Queues for the public gallery would start forming along the gothic corridors of the Royal Courts of Justice from the early hours of the morning when \"Gorgeous George\" was due to perform. Always something of an outsider, Carman never became part of the legal establishment and never became a judge, saying he would find it hard to keep quiet on the bench and preferred the \"blood and sand of the arena\". Brought up a devout Roman Catholic, he went to a seminary where he contemplated becoming a man of the cloth, although his obvious interest in women - he was married and divorced three times - might have prohibited that.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday allocated \u00a3174m to one of the hardest policy challenges it has set itself: to curb classroom misbehaviour and truancy at the same time as it seeks to push up standards in state schools. The money, announced by the school standards minister, Jacqui Smith, is \u00a343m more than last year. It would permit schools and education authorities in England to fund a range of innovative projects of the kind pioneered in cities such as York, she said. The schemes will include truancy sweeps and watches in town centres, parental awareness projects and units in schools where hard core disruptive pupils can be taught, possibly on a one to one basis. Ms Smith said: \"Too many children are missing school and cutting their chances of success in life. Some schools are raising attendance levels, but more needs to be done to reduce significantly the 50,000 pupils away from school without permission on any given day.\" Tony Blair and the education secretary, David Blunkett, have repeatedly stressed the importance of higher classroom standards as essential to the social and economic well-being of young Britons, especially in the socially excluded classes. But they have also called for both tougher discipline in the classroom and a curb on the ready exclusion from school of troublemakers - youngsters who sometimes graduate from bullying to drugs and petty crime. The two goals are often hard to reconcile, especially in schools under most pressure from poverty and social breakdown. Ministers committed to \"joined up\" solutions have established a social inclusion pupil support standards fund to administer the \u00a3174m. Signs of success they cite include a 67% cut in youth crime in York since the council's education department used standards fund grant aid to launch a truancy watch scheme in the city centre. Youngsters who skip school, often - though not always - without their parents knowledge or consent, congregate in such places. The absence of visible school uniforms in many schools makes the truant officers' task of detection more difficult. Ms Smith said the new funds added to resources available to schools in most of England's urban areas through the government's excellence in cities programme. It would relieve teachers of the burdens that unruly pupils could impose by increasing numbers of learning mentors and on-site units for disaffected children. The move coincides with a leaked memo, written by the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, which stresses the need for Labour's election strategy to be more radical than in 1997 in committing a second Blair government to tackle poverty as it affects both individuals and communities. The drive for higher standards in primary schools, undertaken by Mr Blunkett, would be extended to secondary level. Since the chancellor, Gordon Brown, has dismayed some voters by quietly redistributing wealth via \"stealth taxes\" - designed not to offend Middle England voters - support for a more overtly radical stance from Mr Mandelson will provide new year cheer for loyal but disaffected Labour MPs and activists. One long touted scheme that may be revived would benefit precisely those youngsters most vulnerable to missing out on the benefits of a full education: a \u00a31,000 \"individual development account\". Costing \u00a3700m a year, it would amount to a savings scheme, started at birth.",

The wavy-capped magic mushroom, \"a particularly aggressive species\" and a native of the Pacific north-west of America, is now firmly established in gardens, parks and any other place where wood chips are used for weed control. </p> <p>About 10 species of mushroom are eaten for their hallucinogenic qualities. Psilocybe cyanescens is identified by its wavy cap, purple brown spore print and rapid blueing of stem and cap on bruising, although there are poisonous species of similar appearance. </p> <p>The blueing reflects the high psilocin/psilocybin content of the fungus (which as any old hippie will tell you is the bit that makes you fly). Dr Shaw is presenting his findings today at the British Ecological Society meeting in Birmingham where he is inviting amateur mycologists to hunt down other rare species. </p> <p>On his way to work at the University of Surrey Dr Shaw passes a roundabout in Leatherhead. \"The roundabout was mulched in 1999 and in May 2000 a flush of creamy-yellow fungi came up.\" </p> <p>They turned out to be four different exotic varieties growing in the wood chips - one of which, Agrocybe putaminium, had only been recorded once before in Britain, at Kew gardens. \"The wood chips were bought from a commercial supplier in Essex, but how they acquired their strange fungal flora is still unclear.\" </p> <p>The bad news for magic mushroom hunters - deliberate growing of magic mushrooms for use is illegal but mere possession is not - is that this is not the time of year for fruiting. </p> <p>But out of sight the roots from which they grow are spreading rapidly. Dr Shaw's theory is that suppliers keep vast heaps of wood chips in nurseries, allowing aggressive fungi to colonise.. </p> <p>Wood chips and bark chips make a better habitat than the original decaying wood on which the fungi grow. This is because the root structure does not have to force its way through a hard surface but glides between the chips. </p> <p>Because of his Leatherhead experience and other discoveries Dr Shaw says there are bound to be exotic species not thought to exist in Britain growing happily in gardens, and some have already transferred to the wild - the magic mushroom has been been found growing on trees in Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire.</p>",

The blueing reflects the high psilocin/psilocybin content of the fungus (which as any old hippie will tell you is the bit that makes you fly). Dr Shaw is presenting his findings today at the British Ecological Society meeting in Birmingham where he is inviting amateur mycologists to hunt down other rare species. On his way to work at the University of Surrey Dr Shaw passes a roundabout in Leatherhead. \"The roundabout was mulched in 1999 and in May 2000 a flush of creamy-yellow fungi came up.\" They turned out to be four different exotic varieties growing in the wood chips - one of which, Agrocybe putaminium, had only been recorded once before in Britain, at Kew gardens. \"The wood chips were bought from a commercial supplier in Essex, but how they acquired their strange fungal flora is still unclear.\" The bad news for magic mushroom hunters - deliberate growing of magic mushrooms for use is illegal but mere possession is not - is that this is not the time of year for fruiting. But out of sight the roots from which they grow are spreading rapidly. Dr Shaw's theory is that suppliers keep vast heaps of wood chips in nurseries, allowing aggressive fungi to colonise.. Wood chips and bark chips make a better habitat than the original decaying wood on which the fungi grow. This is because the root structure does not have to force its way through a hard surface but glides between the chips. Because of his Leatherhead experience and other discoveries Dr Shaw says there are bound to be exotic species not thought to exist in Britain growing happily in gardens, and some have already transferred to the wild - the magic mushroom has been been found growing on trees in Burnham Beeches, Buckinghamshire.",

When the jury foreman read out the verdict she collapsed and had to be stretchered out of court. Jonathan Aitken v the Guardian, 1997 In one of the most spectacular collapses in legal history, the former cabinet minister was imprisoned for perjury and perverting the course of justice after it emerged he had lied under oath about who had paid for a weekend stay at the Ritz hotel in Paris. Once again Carman unveiled a last minute exocet - this time travel documents from British Airways that showed his wife - whom he claimed had paid the bill - and daughter were never in Paris that weekend but actually in Switzerland. Aitken had also got his daughter to sign a false witness statement verifying his version of events. Neil Hamilton v Al Fayed, 1999 George Carman's last great libel victory came after Neil Hamilton, the former Tory MP, sued Mohamed Al Fayed, over allegations that he had taken up to \u00a350,000 in cash from the owner of Harrod's to do his bidding in Parliament. Carman destroyed Hamilton in the witness box, lovingly re-creating every morsel of food and sip of vintage champagne the former minister and his wife, Christine, enjoyed during a free visit to Fayed's Ritz hotel in Paris. His description of Hamilton as a man \"on the make and on the take\" and \"a man with no honour left,\" were enough to persuade the jury to find against the former MP.

More than 1,000 Russian-made tanks, together with artillery and surface-to-surface and anti-aircraft missiles, rumbled through Grand Festivities Square in a four-hour march-past.</p> <p>It could almost have been a flashback to the old days of the Soviet Union, with the Iraqi leader in period costume: blue three-piece suit and black, wide-brimmed hat.</p> <p>But among the uniformed naval, infantry and paramilitary units on parade there was, perhaps, a sign of things to come: white-hooded figures with only their eyes showing - allegedly volunteers for martyrdom in the struggle against Israel.</p> <p>To one side, a giant poster showed Iraqi horses trampling an Israeli flag in front of the Dome of the Rock, with Saddam looking on, god-like, from the sky.</p> <p>By January 16, the 10th anniversary of what the west calls Desert Storm and what Iraq calls the Mother of Battles, Saddam will have seen off four American presidents: Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr and Clinton.</p> <p>It was supposed to be the other way round. Getting rid of Saddam has been official US policy for years and, by any normal standards, it should have succeeded long ago.</p> <p>The devastating war over Kuwait came hot on the heels of a bloody eight-year conflict with Iran, and the damage continues through sanctions and America-British bombing of the no-fly zones.</p> <p>Throughout Saddam's 20-year rule, Iraqis have known only four years without war or sanctions. That would be enough to bring down most leaders, and yet as the familiar faces of the US administration that tried to destroy him return to Washington, Saddam will be strutting across their TV screens, ready to needle them once more. It's not surprising that he looked pleased with himself during Sunday's parade: it was a firm reminder to the world that he has pulled off one of the most remarkable feats of political survival in modern times.</p> <p>There was a moment, in 1991, when he seemed about to fall, but his forces bounced back from their humiliation in Kuwait, crushing revolts in the Kurdish north and the Shi'ite south of Iraq.</p> <p>Two years ago, President Clinton signed the Iraqi Liberation Act, which made available \u00a358m to opponents of the Baghdad regime. Since then, the problem has been how to spend the money.</p> <p>The opposition Iraqi National Congress (INC) has made little headway since 1996, when Saddam wiped out its power base in northern Iraq, under the noses of the Americans. Fortuitously, this provided a morale-boosting victory for the Iraqi army just as it was beginning to show signs of disaffection with the regime.</p> <p>The INC, which includes Kurdish, monarchist, Islamist and independent elements, has been beset by internal squabbles and the Americans have never been totally happy with its leader, Dr Ahmed Chalabi, who was once at the centre of a banking scandal in Jordan.</p> <p>More direct forms of insurrection, meanwhile, have so far failed. It is virtually impossible to organise a successful coup, according to one opposition leader. \"The moment you get three people involved they all tell Saddam about it,\" he said. \"That's because each one knows that if he doesn't tell Saddam, the other two will.\"</p> <p>The money donated to the opposition is nothing compared with the cost of policing the no-fly zones, where 450 tonnes of bombs have been dropped in the past two years, mainly by the Americans. In total, Britain has spent \u00a3800m on maintaining the no-fly zones, while the American presence - 200 aircraft, 19 warships and 22,000 personnel - has been costing around $1bn a year.</p> <p>Although this containment policy may have helped to keep Iraq in check, Saddam has effectively discredited it by highlighting the deaths of innocent shepherds and other civilians caused by the bombing. Two recent events have contributed to Saddam's newfound buoyancy. One was the arrival in Baghdad of a hijacked Saudi airliner in October. It might have been the cue for a confrontation, reminiscent of the human shield crisis of 1990, but that didn't suit Iraq's new international image. All the passengers were released unharmed and kindly sent on their way, allowing Saddam to bask for a few days in the unfamiliar glow of international adulation.</p> <p>In Israel and the occupied territories, meanwhile, the gathering uprising triggered by Ariel Sharon's visit to Jeruselem's Temple Mount was doing more for Saddam's popularity in the region than any PR campaign could. While political realities force other leaders - in Egypt and Jordan, for example - to take a more cautious stance, much to the frustration of public opinion, Saddam is free to increase his stature through ostentatious preparations for an imaginary battle.</p> <p>Bad news from Israel is good news for Saddam. It is largely because of Israel that Iraq is now back in the Arab fold. The Arab League summit, last October, needed to show unity in its support for the Palestinians and had no option but to invite Iraq - for the first time since the invasion of Kuwait.</p> <p>Saddam has also pledged $881m from oil revenues to support the Palestinian uprising. Some of this is going to the families of dead Palestinians, in lump sums of several thousand dollars.</p> <p>Sunday's military parade followed a Christmas message in which Saddam called on Christians, as well as Muslims, to take \"the path of jihad, without which we cannot attain our aspirations of establishing right, justice and peace and delivering humanity from the evils of aggressors, criminal killers\".</p> <p>More than six million Iraqis, including two million women, have already signed up for the struggle to \"put an end to Zionism\". Nobody dares to ask how, exactly, this will be achieved. For the moment it is, almost certainly, a fantasy to please the masses.</p> <p>Today, the official picture from Baghdad looks brighter than at any time in the past 10 years. Thinly-disguised \"humanitarian\" flights from abroad arrive almost daily, Iraqi Airways is operating again (even in the no-fly zones) and oil production has recovered to pre-war levels.</p> <p>Ordinary Iraqis can see changes, too. Food rations are up, power cuts are less severe, drinking water and sewage services are slowly improving.</p> <p>We hear less now about the malnutrition, the lack of medicines and the dying children. Those problems are still there - Iraq's health ministry blamed sanctions for more than 10,000 deaths last month - but Saddam's message has changed: it is no longer that sanctions are a disaster, but that they are so full of holes we might as well abandon them.</p> <p>Resistance to sanctions takes two forms. One is simply to flout them, though some of this illicit trade is stopped by patrols in the Gulf. But despite seizures, supporters of the regime still manage to acquire new cars or the latest computers. One London-based Iraqi recently brought back a much-coveted PlayStation2 for his son from Baghdad: \"It's cheaper there, and there's no waiting list,\" he said.</p> <p>At another level, there are what the Americans describe as Iraq's \"salami tactics\" - picking at weak points in the rules of sanctions, preferably in ways that cause disagreement between the US and other countries. For example: what, precisely, makes a flight to Baghdad \"humanitarian\"?</p> <p>In a region where political symbolism is often valued more than hard facts, Saddam's defiant stance against sanctions plays well to the masses. It has certainly embarrassed the west, but it is largely theatre - like the missiles on display last weekend which looked menacing enough but which actually had ranges under 150 kilometres and therefore complied fully with UN arms-control restrictions.</p> <p>While Iraq continues to protest about sanctions, it shows no willingness to end them on the UN's current terms. But as Britain and the UN have been making conciliatory noises about sanctions, many Arabs believe George W Bush will feel compelled to adopt the hard line his father took. Colin Powell, the new Secretary of State, who was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Bush pere, declared immediately after his nomination that he hoped to \"re-energise\" sanctions. Bush himself has said that he wants sanctions to be tougher - an idea that many experts dismiss as unrealistic.

Iraqi soldiers are currently being paid to write short memoirs for inclusion in a book to mark the 10th anniversary of the Mother of Battles.</p> <p>Sanctions may not have achieved their goals, but there is little doubt that Saddam's campaign against them has kept him out of serious mischief. In his battle with the Security Council he needs international support and, so long as that battle continues, he is not going to risk losing support through military adventures.</p> <p>Once sanctions have gone, it may be a different matter. Even if Iraq meets the weapons inspection criteria, there will be little to stop it re-arming. Intelligence sources suggest that Iraq's nuclear programme is continuing and that it may be between five and 10 years from developing a usable nuclear weapon.</p> <p>Saddam still hankers after leadership of the Arab world, and the history of his rule suggests that he sees only one route to achieving that and to ensuring the survival of his regime: through conflict. <br><br><b>Related story</b><br><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,417195,00.html\">The despots who won't say die</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>On Sunday, in a move that took everyone by surprise, the United States suddenly reversed its previous policy and signed a treaty to establish a permanent international criminal court. The decision was taken by Bill Clinton at the last possible moment, only hours before the deadline set by the United Nations was due to expire. With other last-minute signatories, the total of countries that have declared their support for the Rome treaty now stands at 139, bringing the ultimate goal of a global system of justice a little closer to reality.</p> <p>The international criminal court (ICC) would be the first standing tribunal with jurisdiction to try individuals on charges of genocide, war crimes and other crimes against humanity. It would be a permanent version of the ad hoc tribunals set up at Nuremberg in 1946, to try Nazi war criminals, and more recently in the Netherlands and Tanzania to hear cases involving human rights abuses in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda respectively.</p> <p>While countries as diverse as Chile, Argentina, Senegal, Zimbabwe and Sierra Leone were quick to sign the treaty, the Clinton administration has opposed it ever since it was negotiated in Rome in 1998. In doing so, it lined itself up against some of its chief allies in Europe and alongside some of the world's most notorious torture states, including China. On Sunday, the news that the US had abruptly changed its mind prompted a similar change of heart in Israel; the Israeli announcement overturned an earlier vote against signature by the Israeli cabinet, confirming the enormous influence the United States continues to exert on its embattled ally in the Middle East.</p> <p>So that's the good news. The bad news is that Clinton's decision stops a long way short of ratifying the treaty, a step that must be taken by 60 countries before the court can be set up in the Netherlands. (To date, 27 nations have done so, clearing almost half the hurdles in what often seems a painfully slow and bureaucratic process.) Even worse is the fact that his decision is not legally binding without Senate approval. The incoming Republican administration is firmly opposed, with George W Bush's nominee for defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, warning only last month that \"American leadership in the world could be the first casualty\" of the court.</p> <p>The likely response of the Senate was revealed on Sunday when Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the rightwing Republican who chairs the foreign relations committee, called Clinton's action \"as outrageous as it is inexplicable\". He claimed it was \"a blatant attempt by a lame-duck president to tie the hands of his successor\", adding ominously: \"Well, I have a message for the outgoing president. This decision will not stand.\"</p> <p>Clinton knows this perfectly well, and took the unusual step of declaring that he would neither submit the treaty for Senate approval nor recommend that his successor do so. And while Bush's hands are tied to some extent - he cannot reverse Clinton's action - he can declare that the US will never ratify the treaty. He can also encourage the Senate to reject it, leaving Democratic members - including the outgoing president's wife - to defend it in an atmosphere of overwhelming hostility and growing American isolationism.</p> <p>In that sense, Helms's accusation about Clinton's motives contains some truth. Indeed it does not go far enough, for it is clear that the 42nd president is casting about for grand gestures that will stand as his memorial. With peace in the Middle East as far away as ever, it seems likely that his abrupt volte-face on the ICC is more about looking good than a genuine conversion to what the president described at the weekend as a reaffirmation of \"our strong support for international accountability\".</p> <p>That support might look a bit more convincing if Clinton had signed the treaty two years ago, along with the 73 world leaders who did so in the six months after the Rome conference, instead of caving in to pressure from the Pentagon. Until last weekend, his public position was not easy to distinguish from that of his Republican opponents, who distrust the ICC because they have not been able to secure a promise that no American will ever have to appear before it. Helms announced some time ago that the treaty would be \"dead on arrival\" in Congress if it failed to exclude the future indictment of a single American soldier.</p> <p>For a country whose troops perpetrated the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, and which is currently supplying money, weapons and military advisers to an army with a dismal record of human rights abuses in Colombia, this is a real anxiety. While the most obvious targets of the ICC would be generals and former heads of state, it would also have a duty to examine the conduct of less well-known individuals. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that this might one day include American soldiers serving with the Colombian armed forces or under the aegis of the UN in one of the world's trouble spots.</p> <p>Such a prospect has, until now, worried the outgoing president just as much as it does Helms or Rumsfeld. Like them, Clinton is committed to a policy that treats his fellow-citizens as hugely more valuable, and correspondingly less accountable, than those of other nations. One of the results has been ineffectual interventions in countries such as Rwanda - where Clinton turned up in 1998 and belatedly apologised for failing to prevent genocide four years earlier - and a preference for hi-tech air wars. In Kosovo, it became clear that this policy protects American forces at the cost of unacceptable civilian casualties on the ground.</p> <p>Clinton's Nato allies have put up with this situation to keep the US on side in a whole string of peace-keeping operations. (Privately, supporters of the Blair government even go so far as to admit that Britain's acquiescence in the bombing of Iraq is a quid pro quo for American support elsewhere, particularly in the Balkans.) This means that Clinton has got away with what is really a form of American neo-imperialism, and has now turned his mind to ensuring that things stay that way in the future. He could scarcely have enjoyed a greater stroke of luck than the incoming Bush administration, which can be relied upon to enhance his thoroughly undeserved liberal reputation.</p> <p>Clinton has not even left office and the nostalgic profiles are already being written, a process that can only be accelerated by the conduct of his Republican opponents. That the creation of an international system of justice is too important to be a pawn in this unsavoury game hardly matters; Clinton has had eight years to do great things and failed in almost every respect, from reforming health care to the redistribution of wealth.

They must be able to make an assessment of the adequacy of those plans to deliver a reliable service.\" The action stems from a meeting between Railtrack, the train companies and the regulator on December 15. Rail passengers were subjected to delays and cancellations yesterday as Railtrack failed to complete two big re-signalling projects on time. Railtrack said it had been hampered by bad weather and technical issues. Mr Muir said that it was imperative that Railtrack restored at least 80% of the network to normal by the end of the month. He said that most regional services in Scotland and Wales were back to normal, that the London commuter services were very mixed, and that inter-city services were very chaotic. Some 8,000 of the 18,000 trains that operate daily on the network were running normally. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, visited Railtrack headquarters yesterday, to praise staff who had seen more than 80 speed limits removed over Christmas. Mr Prescott said: \"I am delighted to see that Railtrack has exceeded its target and has replaced more than 40 miles of track, having planned to do 30 miles.\" He said the industry was on target to meet its commitment to restoring 85% of services by the end of January.

The blaze left 184 injured, of whom 90 needed treatment at burns centres across the Netherlands, and in Belgium and Germany. The names of the dead, all under 25 years old, were published in the churches of this Roman Catholic fishing village, where everyone knew someone at the crowded party in the Little Heaven disco and cafe, located in a three-storey wooden house on the quayside. Queen Beatrix planned to visit victims in Amsterdam's AMC hospital with the deputy prime minister, Annemarie Jorritsma, before an evening memorial service took place in Volendam. The village's churches held special services and youth centres opened their doors to give survivors a place to meet and share their grief.

It is not known how many parties are interested in buying Regalian but interest is thought to have been shown by a management team led by Lee Goldstone, the son of company founder David. A Regalian spokesman last night declined to comment on what price had been discussed or when a further announcement is expected to be made. Analysts said many property companies were trading at a discount to their net asset value and a buyback was a popular way of boosting the share price. Marble Arch Tower, housing a business centre, gymnasium and multiplex cinema, is located at the western end of Oxford Street. In the year to March 31 2000, the net rental income from the Tower was \u00a3990,000; its sale is estimated to result in a post-tax profit of \u00a311.5m. Regalian recorded pre-tax profits of \u00a38.2m for the six months ending September 30, 2000, up from a \u00a31.2m loss over the same period the previous year.",

      "byline": "Gretchen Morgenson in New York",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Of all the rude awakenings the bear market has brought to investors, perhaps the most severe has been realisation of how wrong Wall Street's research analysts were last year on the stocks they follow. While the US market sank to its worst performance in more than 10 years, many of them kept right on smiling and saying \"buy\". </p> <p>How can so many who are paid so much to scrutinise companies have blown it so spectacularly for their investor customers? </p> <p>The answer lies in a subtle but significant change in the way Wall Street analysts do their work - and how they are rewarded for it. That shift brought riches and stardom to many securities analysts and cost investors billions in losses. </p> <p>Although brokerage stock gurus are still called analysts, their day-to-day pursuits involve much less analysis and much more salesmanship than before. </p> <p>\"The competition for investing banking business is so keen that analysts' 'sell' recommendations on stocks of banking clients or potential banking clients are very rare,\" said Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the US securities and exchange commission. \"Whether this is an actual or perceived conflict, clearly, in the minds of many institutional buyers, brokerage firm analysis has diminished credibility.\" </p> <p>Robert Olstein, a mutual-fund manager with 32 years ' experience analysing companies' financial results, said: \"Instead of providing investors with the kind of analysis that would have kept them from marching over the cliff, analysts prodded them forward by inventing new valuation criteria for stocks that had no basis in reality and no standards of good practice.\" </p> <p>Investors look to analysts to advise them on whether to buy or sell a stock at its current price. Until the mid-1990s, that is how most analysts approached their work. </p> <p>Today there is almost no such thing as a \"sell\" recommendation from Wall Street analysts. Of 8,000 recommendations covering the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, only 29 are \"sells\", according to Zacks Investment Research in Chicago. On the other hand, \"strong buy\" recommendations number 214. </p> <p>Many investing veterans contend the quality of research has sunk to new lows, the result of shifting economics in the brokerage business which pushed many researchers to put relationships with the companies they follow ahead of investors. </p> <p>The sharp reduction in levels of share-trading commission are one factor. Because analysts' recommendations helped generate trades and commissions, research departments paid for themselves. But as commissions de clined Wall Street firms looked elsewhere for ways to cover the costs of research. </p> <p>The lucrative area of investment banking was an obvious choice. Analysts soon began going on sales calls for stock underwritings, debt offerings and other investment banking deals. In this world, negative research reports carried a cost, not a benefit. </p> <p>\"Research analysts have become either touts for their firm's corporate finance departments or the distribution system for the party line of the companies they follow,\" said Stefan Abrams, chief investment officer for asset allocation at Trust Co of the West in New York. \"Not only are they not doing the research, they have totally lost track of equity values.\" </p> <p>In the past few months, as former stock market favourites crashed to earth, many top analysts remained maddeningly upbeat. </p> <p>Consider Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who became known as Queen of the Internet for her prognostications on e-commerce companies. In 1999, as internet stocks soared and new companies were taken public in droves, she made $15m, according to news reports. </p> <p>Now that internet stocks are in pieces on the ground, she still rates all 11 she follows as \"outperform\" even though as a group they are down an average 83%. Of the 11 companies she remains positive on, eight had securities underwritten by Morgan Stanley. </p> <p>Ms Meeker declined to comment. But Ray O'Rourke, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said her picks had been made for the long term. Moreover, he said, Ms Meeker warned investors last March that internet stocks were volatile. </p> <p>Asked whether Ms Meeker's non-stop optimism had anything to do with Morgan Stanley's role as an investment bank, Mr O'Rourke said: \"It is what it is. But you shouldn't be surprised necessarily to see 'outperforms' on the companies, because we've been very vigorous on the companies we've chosen to bring public.\" - New York Times</p>",

      "bodyText": "Of all the rude awakenings the bear market has brought to investors, perhaps the most severe has been realisation of how wrong Wall Street's research analysts were last year on the stocks they follow. While the US market sank to its worst performance in more than 10 years, many of them kept right on smiling and saying \"buy\". How can so many who are paid so much to scrutinise companies have blown it so spectacularly for their investor customers? The answer lies in a subtle but significant change in the way Wall Street analysts do their work - and how they are rewarded for it. That shift brought riches and stardom to many securities analysts and cost investors billions in losses. Although brokerage stock gurus are still called analysts, their day-to-day pursuits involve much less analysis and much more salesmanship than before. \"The competition for investing banking business is so keen that analysts' 'sell' recommendations on stocks of banking clients or potential banking clients are very rare,\" said Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the US securities and exchange commission. \"Whether this is an actual or perceived conflict, clearly, in the minds of many institutional buyers, brokerage firm analysis has diminished credibility.\" Robert Olstein, a mutual-fund manager with 32 years ' experience analysing companies' financial results, said: \"Instead of providing investors with the kind of analysis that would have kept them from marching over the cliff, analysts prodded them forward by inventing new valuation criteria for stocks that had no basis in reality and no standards of good practice.\" Investors look to analysts to advise them on whether to buy or sell a stock at its current price. Until the mid-1990s, that is how most analysts approached their work. Today there is almost no such thing as a \"sell\" recommendation from Wall Street analysts. Of 8,000 recommendations covering the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, only 29 are \"sells\", according to Zacks Investment Research in Chicago. On the other hand, \"strong buy\" recommendations number 214. Many investing veterans contend the quality of research has sunk to new lows, the result of shifting economics in the brokerage business which pushed many researchers to put relationships with the companies they follow ahead of investors. The sharp reduction in levels of share-trading commission are one factor. Because analysts' recommendations helped generate trades and commissions, research departments paid for themselves. But as commissions de clined Wall Street firms looked elsewhere for ways to cover the costs of research. The lucrative area of investment banking was an obvious choice. Analysts soon began going on sales calls for stock underwritings, debt offerings and other investment banking deals. In this world, negative research reports carried a cost, not a benefit. \"Research analysts have become either touts for their firm's corporate finance departments or the distribution system for the party line of the companies they follow,\" said Stefan Abrams, chief investment officer for asset allocation at Trust Co of the West in New York. \"Not only are they not doing the research, they have totally lost track of equity values.\" In the past few months, as former stock market favourites crashed to earth, many top analysts remained maddeningly upbeat. Consider Mary Meeker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, who became known as Queen of the Internet for her prognostications on e-commerce companies. In 1999, as internet stocks soared and new companies were taken public in droves, she made $15m, according to news reports. Now that internet stocks are in pieces on the ground, she still rates all 11 she follows as \"outperform\" even though as a group they are down an average 83%. Of the 11 companies she remains positive on, eight had securities underwritten by Morgan Stanley. Ms Meeker declined to comment. But Ray O'Rourke, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, said her picks had been made for the long term. Moreover, he said, Ms Meeker warned investors last March that internet stocks were volatile. Asked whether Ms Meeker's non-stop optimism had anything to do with Morgan Stanley's role as an investment bank, Mr O'Rourke said: \"It is what it is. But you shouldn't be surprised necessarily to see 'outperforms' on the companies, because we've been very vigorous on the companies we've chosen to bring public.\" - New York Times",

Labour's first term has been characterised by an almost slavish adherence to whatever taxation policies big business believes are best for the economy.</p> <p>The most damaging example of this was the government's fight to introduce an effective energy tax to combat climate change, which was all but lost following a vociferous campaign by the Confederation of British Industry. Now, with the chance of a second term, Labour must have the courage of its convictions to introduce new taxes if it believes there is a clear social or environmental need, whatever the opinion of big business.

A different question is the emergence of a socialist challenge to Labour which has regularly scored between 5% and 12% in council and parliamentary byelections. John Curtice of the Centre for Research into Elections notes \"... the fifth by-election in a row in which a candidate standing under a socialist label has passed the 5% threshold.

Ann Nicholls Matlock, Derbs trans@ann-nicholls.com \u0095 Polly Toynbee is right to identify taxation as the battleground on which Labour must fight the next election, but to do this successfully will require the party to fundamentally change its relationship with big business. Labour's first term has been characterised by an almost slavish adherence to whatever taxation policies big business believes are best for the economy. The most damaging example of this was the government's fight to introduce an effective energy tax to combat climate change, which was all but lost following a vociferous campaign by the Confederation of British Industry. Now, with the chance of a second term, Labour must have the courage of its convictions to introduce new taxes if it believes there is a clear social or environmental need, whatever the opinion of big business. After all, if the party hasn't got the stomach for a fight, it won't matter what taxation policies are in its manifesto. Nicholas Milton London nicholasmilton@hotmail.com \u0095 So, \"things which people value most can only be bought collectively\". But this amounts to socialism, the word which cannot be spoken. John Ashwell Eastleigh, Hants \u0095 That the Liberal Democrats, Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru can be described as left of New Labour comes as no surprise, considering how far it has moved to the right (Labour looks for business backing, January 2). A different question is the emergence of a socialist challenge to Labour which has regularly scored between 5% and 12% in council and parliamentary byelections. John Curtice of the Centre for Research into Elections notes \"... the fifth by-election in a row in which a candidate standing under a socialist label has passed the 5% threshold. It is easily the best record for the far left in post-war Britain.\" Anna Chen London Socialist Alliance a.chen@virgin.net \u0095 Matthew Engel may be right that the Tories are on their way out as a dominating force in British politics (Comment, January 2), but his analysis is based on one assumption: that we keep the abhorrent first past the post electoral system. I never thought I would say this, but we need a Conservative opposition, just as we need Green MPs. Proportional representation is the only system that can provide a more balanced parliament, representing all shades of opinion. Bert Bruins Exeter Green party b.bruins@virgin.net \u0095 Engel should not forget Ernest Bevin's famous remark about the Tories: \"They are like vermin - you can keep them down for a while, but they'll always come back.\" John White Baldock, Herts",

The script is based on interviews with some of the 87 innocent people convicted and then released from Death Row in the US. The biggest star on the stage tonight is Debra Winger, and any Broadway producer would envy the names who have volunteered their services for previous readings, a list including Richard Dreyfuss, Steve Buscemi and, inevitably, the him and her of New York actorly liberalism, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. </p> <p>The tenor of the evening in the Dag Hammersjold theatre is set by the hosts, Gabriel Byrne and Marisa Berenson, reading condemnations of the death penalty by Albert Camus, Arthur Koestler and the Dalai Lama. But the worthiness of the purpose is frequently contradicted by The Exonerated itself, a script that is rich in what can only be described as gallows humour. </p> <p>\"I know it doesn't mean anything, but there were some people in there who were really guilty,\" says one prisoner. \"I was so sure I was getting out in the summer I had [fake] suntan brought in,\" says another, a petty wiseguy who could have been raised on repeats of The Sopranos. \"Might as well look good when I get out.\" </p> <p>Yet another, a yoga instructor whose husband took 13 minutes to die in the electric chair in Florida while flames shot from his head, asks: \"How could this happen to me? I was a hippie, I was a peace-and-love person. I'm a vegetarian.\" The stories, by turns animated, flat, matter-of-fact and conversational, illuminate not just the mechanics of injustice but questions of class and race, too. \"Like I often say, if you're a black man in the south you might as well have done it because your ass will be found guilty.\" Others are grim little parables, cousins to the short stories of Raymond Carver but offering more obvious consequences. </p> <p>This is not what young actors Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen bargained for when they set out on the project. \"A good friend warned us at the beginning of this process: 'It might be the same thing over and over - I was framed, they were wrong, I was freed and now I'm bitter.' And to be honest, we expected variations on that theme. What we discovered, however, was not nearly as disheartening and far more profound.\" </p> <p>The idea hit the couple when they attended a conference at Columbia law school in Manhattan early last year - which was more than one of the participants, a man in jail in Illinois, was able to do. He made a call to the workshop and talked about how he was tortured by his interrogators but was still in prison. </p> <p>The prisoner's testimony stayed with them and they made contact with 40 of the 87 wronged inno cents, crossing the country by car for six weeks last summer. The play is based on 11 of those statements. \"Honestly, we'd go into these interviews like jaded New Yorkers and come out completely wrecked,\" says Jensen. \"It was profoundly affecting. Before we took the trip, I think I was blindly patriotic. But this made me question everything.\" </p> <p>Richard Dreyfuss, perhaps getting carried away by his passion for the material, adds: \"Some of the stories are just so overwhelming. It's one of those things where you want to get up at the end and strangle the people who did this to the innocent.\" </p> <p>The Exonerated, in its present form, is played by 11 volunteer actors sitting in a line on chairs, batting back and forth tales that blend horror and the mundane; the format means that it is sometimes hard to follow the overlapping narratives. There are plans for a more fully realised production in the spring and performances elsewhere, such as Texas and Florida - places where executions are a less abstract concern than in New York. Earle, convinced that art can make a difference, lumbers on to the stage at the United Nations at the end of the night and says: \"This is what happens when we are able to be big enough to admit that we were wrong.\"</p>",

The script is based on interviews with some of the 87 innocent people convicted and then released from Death Row in the US. The biggest star on the stage tonight is Debra Winger, and any Broadway producer would envy the names who have volunteered their services for previous readings, a list including Richard Dreyfuss, Steve Buscemi and, inevitably, the him and her of New York actorly liberalism, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. The tenor of the evening in the Dag Hammersjold theatre is set by the hosts, Gabriel Byrne and Marisa Berenson, reading condemnations of the death penalty by Albert Camus, Arthur Koestler and the Dalai Lama. But the worthiness of the purpose is frequently contradicted by The Exonerated itself, a script that is rich in what can only be described as gallows humour. \"I know it doesn't mean anything, but there were some people in there who were really guilty,\" says one prisoner. \"I was so sure I was getting out in the summer I had [fake] suntan brought in,\" says another, a petty wiseguy who could have been raised on repeats of The Sopranos. \"Might as well look good when I get out.\" Yet another, a yoga instructor whose husband took 13 minutes to die in the electric chair in Florida while flames shot from his head, asks: \"How could this happen to me? I was a hippie, I was a peace-and-love person. I'm a vegetarian.\" The stories, by turns animated, flat, matter-of-fact and conversational, illuminate not just the mechanics of injustice but questions of class and race, too. \"Like I often say, if you're a black man in the south you might as well have done it because your ass will be found guilty.\" Others are grim little parables, cousins to the short stories of Raymond Carver but offering more obvious consequences. This is not what young actors Jessica Blank and Erik Jensen bargained for when they set out on the project. \"A good friend warned us at the beginning of this process: 'It might be the same thing over and over - I was framed, they were wrong, I was freed and now I'm bitter.' And to be honest, we expected variations on that theme. What we discovered, however, was not nearly as disheartening and far more profound.\" The idea hit the couple when they attended a conference at Columbia law school in Manhattan early last year - which was more than one of the participants, a man in jail in Illinois, was able to do. He made a call to the workshop and talked about how he was tortured by his interrogators but was still in prison. The prisoner's testimony stayed with them and they made contact with 40 of the 87 wronged inno cents, crossing the country by car for six weeks last summer. The play is based on 11 of those statements. \"Honestly, we'd go into these interviews like jaded New Yorkers and come out completely wrecked,\" says Jensen. \"It was profoundly affecting. Before we took the trip, I think I was blindly patriotic. But this made me question everything.\" Richard Dreyfuss, perhaps getting carried away by his passion for the material, adds: \"Some of the stories are just so overwhelming. It's one of those things where you want to get up at the end and strangle the people who did this to the innocent.\" The Exonerated, in its present form, is played by 11 volunteer actors sitting in a line on chairs, batting back and forth tales that blend horror and the mundane; the format means that it is sometimes hard to follow the overlapping narratives. There are plans for a more fully realised production in the spring and performances elsewhere, such as Texas and Florida - places where executions are a less abstract concern than in New York. Earle, convinced that art can make a difference, lumbers on to the stage at the United Nations at the end of the night and says: \"This is what happens when we are able to be big enough to admit that we were wrong.\"",

      "body": "<p>When her new play Spinning Into Butter opened in Chicago last year, Rebecca Gilman was scared - very scared. \"I didn't know what to expect. I worried that people might be indifferent or blase, but I was more worried that some might start yelling and throwing things.\" Gilman's concerns were more than just first-night jitters, for Spinning Into Butter is a play by a white woman about that most incendiary of subjects: race and racism. In particular it looks at the way we invent new vocabularies to hide our old prejudices. </p> <p>In the event, that first-night audience was so stunned that you could have heard a pin drop. Since then, Spinning Into Butter, which opens in London at the Royal Court this week, has caused a real stir in the US: it has been likened to Oleanna, David Mamet's play about sexual harassment and political correctness, engendered fierce argument and divided audiences. The Chicago run was extended three times, and eventually, due to pressure from the audience, every performance was followed by a discussion. </p> <p>The title of the play comes from The Story of Little Black Sambo, Helen Bannerman's much-reviled children's book, published in 1898. Bannerman tells of a black boy who has his clothes stolen by tigers while walking in the forest. The tigers dress themselves in his clothes but then start arguing over which is the grandest of them all. Eventually they get so angry that they remove the garments and start chasing each other around the tree. Little Black Sambo retrieves his clothes and watches while the tigers chase each other so fast that they spin themselves into butter. Then he gets a spoon, scoops up the butter, puts it on his pancakes and gobbles it down. </p> <p>In Spinning Into Butter it is the administration of a liberal arts college situated in New England that gets itself in a whirl when one of its very few black students starts receiving racially motivated threats. Immediately, and without reference to the student in question, senior staff start forming committees and demanding public meetings in which racism will be denounced. Only one, Sarah Matthews, a young dean who we have already seen trying to secure another minority student a much-needed scholarship, has doubts. She believes that before any meetings are held, the threatened student should be consulted, and argues that such public forums are useless anyway. \"All you do is talk about racism, and then you heave this collective sigh of white guilt, and then everyone feels better, and then they drive downtown in their Saabs and buy sweaters,\" she says. </p> <p>But her blustering, pompous colleagues are not going to let this opportunity to bolster their reputations slip by, and soon it is Sarah who is coming under pressure. In the play's second-act climax, which has so shocked American audiences, this apparently decent, liberal, well-meaning woman suddenly says the unsayable and confesses to the unthinkable. Sarah admits that she finds black people frightening, lazy and stupid. If she has to choose between sitting next to a black man on a train or standing up, she'll stand up. This is a woman who has taken \"every class on African American literature and theory\" but is still a racist. </p> <p>\"All I learned was how to appreciate black people,\" Sarah says. \"The way you might appreciate a painting or a good bottle of Bordeaux. I studied them to figure them out. Like Sanskrit. But that's no different from hating them. It is called objectification. And it relies on keeping the object of your investigation at bay. It relies on knowing one or two really well-educated black people. Because when you come face to face with a lot of just regular black people, you can't aestheticise them any more. They're too damn scary.\" </p> <p>Gilman agrees that part of the power of the play comes from the fact that in London, as in Chicago, it is likely to play largely to a white, liberal well-educated audience - people just like Sarah. \"I wanted to play with people's expectations of the characters and force them to think about their own buried, unadmitted racism,\" she says, pointing out that when racists are portrayed on film and TV it is usually as stupid, fat people, which allows educated liberals to disassociate themselves. \"It makes it too easy for us,\" she adds. </p> <p>She was in part inspired to write the play after reading an American survey in which 80% of people said that they knew a racist but only 5% admitted to racism. \"The figures just didn't add up. Someone wasn't being honest.\" </p> <p>Like her previous play, The Glory of Living, a terrifying story of a 15-year-old Alabama girl who procures and murders young girls for her husband's sexual gratification, which was staged to great acclaim at the Court two years ago, Spinning Into Butter also has its origins in a true incident. For two years, the Alabama-born and bred Gilman attended a Vermont college where a black student was the recipient of racial threats. It was the attitudes of other students, mostly New Englanders, that really intrigued her. </p> <p>\"People I didn't know would hear I was from Alabama and come knocking on my door and say: 'Tell me about racism in the south.' I'd say: 'Tell me about racism in the north.' It was as though they didn't think racism was their problem.\" As Sarah facetiously suggests in the play: \"If you don't like black people, moving to Vermont can take care of that. Because there aren't any black people here.\" </p> <p>Gilman also hones in on the way we use and twist language for our own ends and how easy it is to say one thing while feeling another - something much facilitated by political correctness. \"Political correctness has its good sides,\" says Gilman. \"Being self-conscious about how we refer to people is a positive thing. But it is very easy to learn the jargon but not change attitudes. Politicians, corporations and universities are very adept at it.\" </p> <p>It can also prevent us from actually engaging with the real issues, as Gilman makes clear in Sarah's confession, in which she announces: \"Toni Morrison's Beloved sucks.\" After the terrible admissions that have come before, the moment has a comic intensity, but as Gilman points out, there is a serious issue at stake here. \"You can't talk to people about that book because any discussion about it isn't about its merits but about race. Morrison is an icon. To say that you don't like her writing is to risk being branded a racist. That's absurd.\" </p> <p>So far, Gilman has been pleased by the response to Spinning Into Butter. \"Almost nobody has shouted during the performances - they've saved their opinions for afterwards. It has got people talking, and that's good, and lots of people have said to me about the play: 'I am glad somebody said that.' \" But now she worries that, as the play's reputation precedes it, audiences' expectations are getting out of all proportion with what the play is trying to do. </p> <p>\"I've sometimes felt that people thought that I ought to solve racism in this play. But it's only a play. You can't solve racism with a single play, any more than you can solve it with a 10-point bullet plan.</p> <p>\u0095 Spinning Into Butter is at the Royal Court Theatre Upstairs, London SW1 (020-7565 5000), from January 5.</p>",

As soon as one number finished, the rhythm section (including drummer Robert Fordjour, percussionist Donald Gamble, guitarist Cameron Pierre, Peter Martin on bass and bass guitar and Alex Wilson on keyboards) started up the next without a pause. Sometimes the groove was subtle and quiet, and when the DJ's funky opening set gave way to the live players the predominant mood was spacey and modal. </p> <p>Pine's is a distinctly British version of jazz-funk, which easily embraces skanking reggae, calypso flavours and what you might call acoustic drum'n'bass (which sounds very close to straight jazz). Trombonist Dennis Rollins is a good front-line foil to Pine, setting off the leader's flights of virtuosity with simple, gutsy solos (using a wah-wah pedal at one point) and blasting out the tunes with easy assurance. </p> <p>Some of the best pieces employed the quirky but effective combination of soprano sax and trombone, and they play the tricky melodies from memory. The set included several numbers from Pine's recent Back in the Day album, including Power to the People, My Father's Place, Keep it Real and The Jazzstep. </p> <p>Pine picked up the EWI (electric wind instrument) for an affecting version of Monk's Round Midnight, a synthesised arrangement that recalled Michael Brecker's version of In a Sentimental Mood for Steps Ahead. For another piece he played with rhythmic repeat echoes in the manner of John Surman's pioneering solo gigs. Pine's wide knowledge of the jazz heritage, and the influence of John Coltrane in particular, is never far from the surface, so you might hear a snatch of Softly as in a Morning Sunrise or A Love Supreme erupting from a lengthy saxophone solo. But Pine is keen to assert the local tradition, paying tribute to a rollcall of British players including Joe Harriott, Ernest Ranglin and Ronnie Scott. </p> <p>His saxophone playing reminded me a little of Don Rendell, who absorbed the lessons of Coltrane after coming of age in an era when jazz was still principally entertainment music. Pine has travelled in a different direction, learning to use elements of pop and dance after starting in more purist territory - but nothing he has learned has been wasted. His unique position on the scene means that an extended \"look-no-hands\" experiment in saxophone harmonics and circular breathing works as crowd-pleasing spectacle. </p> <p>The audience, a mix of male and female, young and old, black and white, took it all in, clapping on the off-beat while Pine and Rollins mimed silently for one chorus, joining in with the Zulu jumping, appearing to love every minute. At one point Pine surveyed his loyal subjects and asked for a bit of call-and-response: \"I say U, you say K.\" \"UK!\" You couldn't ask for a better plea for peace, love and unity this holiday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Georg Baselitz, who seemed so significant when he began his immensely successful career as an expressionist painter in Berlin in the 1960s, has turned out to be a remarkably irrelevant artist. And to judge by the drooling self-mockery of his new exhibition at Gagosian, even he seems to know he's now a bit of a bloated joke. </p> <p>His new paintings are of dogs. Nothing wrong with that. The dog has an honourable history as a subject in painting. Picasso adored his dog Frika, Hogarth painted himself with his pet pug, Lucian Freud's paintings treat dogs better than people. There's even a book, The Dog in Art, by the American critic Robert Rosenblum. Baselitz has probably read it. His paintings joke about the history of the dog in art and what it might expose about the silliness of art. These pictures mock a once-proud animal now domesticated and pampered rotten. Pink paint is thrown around as if by the senile Willem De Kooning. The effect aimed at is a queasy mixture of hard-edged machismo and pink fleshiness, but instead you think of the Andrex puppy. </p> <p>Much later, you think of Puppy by Jeff Koons. Baselitz, prophet of Teutonic authenticity, seems to have turned into a more brushy version of the great kitschmeister himself. But where Koons has a heartless eye that always makes his irony crisp and telling, poor Georg just seems to be flailing. His paintings are pompous and incredible, and come across not as comments on kitsch but colossal manifestations of it.

      "bodyText": "Georg Baselitz, who seemed so significant when he began his immensely successful career as an expressionist painter in Berlin in the 1960s, has turned out to be a remarkably irrelevant artist. And to judge by the drooling self-mockery of his new exhibition at Gagosian, even he seems to know he's now a bit of a bloated joke. His new paintings are of dogs. Nothing wrong with that. The dog has an honourable history as a subject in painting. Picasso adored his dog Frika, Hogarth painted himself with his pet pug, Lucian Freud's paintings treat dogs better than people. There's even a book, The Dog in Art, by the American critic Robert Rosenblum. Baselitz has probably read it. His paintings joke about the history of the dog in art and what it might expose about the silliness of art. These pictures mock a once-proud animal now domesticated and pampered rotten. Pink paint is thrown around as if by the senile Willem De Kooning. The effect aimed at is a queasy mixture of hard-edged machismo and pink fleshiness, but instead you think of the Andrex puppy. Much later, you think of Puppy by Jeff Koons. Baselitz, prophet of Teutonic authenticity, seems to have turned into a more brushy version of the great kitschmeister himself. But where Koons has a heartless eye that always makes his irony crisp and telling, poor Georg just seems to be flailing. His paintings are pompous and incredible, and come across not as comments on kitsch but colossal manifestations of it. He seems more interested in the frames - which he himself carved in an Italian Renaissance style. Of course, you could attempt all manner of subtle readings. Baselitz's paintings have always featured animals, a bestiary signposting his affinity for German romanticism and the Nordic cult of the wild. You might call these latest works cynical images of the contemporary painter as a wild beast curbed. You might see them as confessions of the tastelessness at the heart of painting. But in truth, they are not diagnoses of anything, they are symptoms, shaggy, slobbering and a bit pathetic. \u0095 Until January 20. Details: 020-7292 8222.",

At the same time, the dot.com revolution has favoured young people. The risks have often been as high as the rewards, with payment in stock options.

(If you are too young to know about Logan's Run, ask the jaded thirtysomething next to you.) </p> <p>It has become conventional wisdom that young people - specifically \"Generation X\", those just old enough to remember Mrs Thatcher coming to power - are different from their older colleagues: more flexible, less loyal, more mobile and less patient than their forebears. A plethora of books and articles has been churned out to help managers deal with the Xers. </p> <p>In Managing Generation X, Bruce Tulgan dramatises their short-termism: \"Xers have had sparse opportunities to experience affiliations of any kind - social, geographical, religious or political.

Don't trust anyone, especially anyone over 30, is the motto of the Xers. </p> <p>Some awful guff gets written about Generation X, such as advice from USA Today on \"how to motivate Generation X\" that includes \"help them carve up the job into bite-size chunks so they can see the day-to-day results\" and \"move from six-month or 12- month reviews to frequent, accurate, specific and timely feedback\". Short of advising that Xers be tucked up in their favourite blanket for an afternoon nap after a glass of milk, it is difficult to see how this advice could be more patronising. </p> <p>And are young workers really so different?

They entered the labour market knowing that security was likely to come only from their own ability to navigate the rapids.

If the thought of returning to work after the Christmas and New Year break left you feeling overwhelmed, anxious or even depressed; if you find yourself harbouring feelings of anger, jealousy or resentment towards your colleagues, you might have felt entitled to a little understanding. But you would have reckoned without the burgeoning stress backlash: the small but increasingly vocal number of maverick psychologists who argue that stress, the pre-eminent workplace problem of recent years, does not even exist. </p> <p>Their unofficial leader is Dr Rob Briner, an occupational psychologist at London University's Birkbeck College. His message: feeling bad at work is normal, and not necessarily even wrong - and now the only place where the concept of stress has any valid currency is in the lucrative, and sometimes damaging, stress management industry. </p> <p>\"Stress has become a trivial concept without a clear set of physical symptoms,\" Briner says. \"We are all so worried about the effect our jobs have on our mental health that we're turning into a nation of emotional hypochondriacs. Stress has been around since the 1950s and if you ask me, it's become the modern equivalent of when people used to say they had 'problems with their nerves'.\" </p> <p>The history of industrial relations has been dogged by the mythical search for the happy, productive worker. But, Briner argues: \"The reality is that it is not really desirable to be happy and relaxed all the time at work, particularly in professions such as nursing and teaching.\" Pressed on this point, he will admit that, no, we don't want to see hospitals and schools filled with grumpy staff - but says adrenalin, and the sentiments that accompany it, are frequently helpful in high-pressure professions. </p> <p>It has long been the predictable view of employers' organisations with all-too-obvious vested interests that the stress crisis in Britain's workplaces has been exaggerated. But now some academic psychologists are starting to doubt that the concept has much validity. As Jo Rick, a research fellow at the Institute for Employment Studies, puts it: \"These days, 'stress' is used to describe any negative experience we have at work, from anger and envy to exhaustion. So when we talk about eliminating stress from the workplace, it's pretty meaningless. Surely we shouldn't be looking to remove from our lives ordinary human emotions such as anger?\" </p> <p>This is, of course, still a decidedly minority view. Much evidence seems stacked against it: an Industrial Society survey shows three-quarters of employers see stress as the most important workplace issue of the next few years, while research from Bristol University indicates that one in five workers experiences some form of office stress; figures from the Institute of Stress Management put the cost to British industry at \u00a37bn through 60m lost working days each year. Last month, primary school teacher Janice Howell received a record compensation payment of \u00a3254,000, having retired from her job after a nervous breakdown. Earlier last year, Beverley Lancaster, a former draughtswoman with Birmingham City Council, was awarded damages of \u00a367,000 in the first ever British case in which an employer admitted liability for causing stress. </p> <p>But what does it really mean to suffer from stress? The epidemic has reached such proportions that the Health and Safety Executive recently produced a discussion document which calls for a code of practice on minimising the risk of work-related stress. One might imagine that such an illustrious body would have come up with a snappy definition of the problem, but no: stress, the HSE says, is \"a reaction to excessive pressures or other types of demand placed on employees\". Which pretty much covers everything from wanting to kill your boss to problems with the vending machine. </p> <p> In America, too, the stress backlash is gaining momentum: a recent book and inevitable website, The Stress Myth (<a href=\"http://www.stressmyth.com\">www.stressmyth.com</a>), from psychologist Serge Doublet, questions the validity of stress as a concept, from 1956, when the term was first coined by psychologist Hans Seyle in his study The Stress of Life, to the present day. \"People feel 'stressed' because they believe in the first place that feeling 'stressed' is a legitimate condition,\" Doublet writes. \"Without such a belief, the subjective feeling is not possible. Nevertheless, in everyday language, feelings of being 'stressed' often appear to supplant the use of emotion terms. Instead of feeling 'annoyed', 'worried', 'apprehensive' or 'frustrated', people declare that they are feeling 'stressed', even though it does not necessarily accurately describe what they feel.\" </p> <p>There has been little research into how far normal levels of stress in a job can develop into something more harmful, Rick says. \"What is harmful is using the term as a catch-all. People then hide behind it instead of tackling the real problem, often to the detriment of their physical health.\" She cites the case of a man experiencing chest pains. His GP told him he was probably suffering from stress and to take a few days' leave. The pains persisted but the man was happy to carry on working, in the belief that they were stress-induced. A few weeks later, he suffered a heart attack. </p> <p>Sceptics reserve their strongest feelings for the stress management industry. Alarmed by the size of payouts in the civil courts and by the prospect of criminal prosecutions under the Health and Safety at Work Act, employers are calling in stress-busting professionals to carry out \"stress audits\", counselling and the teaching of relaxation techniques. </p> <p>\"These people represent a solution in search of a problem,\" Briner says. \"They have a vested interest in scaremongering, in making us fear stress as this great evil of the workplace. Some of the remedies on offer can do more harm than good: if a worker is having problems because they are being made to take on too much work, then there is no point in sending them off for relaxation sessions or therapy, then putting them back in exactly the same conditions. The problem that needs addressing is the volume of work. It's a similar situation with people who have personality clashes with their colleagues. They don't need to learn how to relax, they need to be put on another team.\" </p> <p>Briner says his research has led him to embrace the notion of the \"post-stress workplace\". \"There is scant scientific research to link the effects of stress with ill health,\" he says. \"In fact, negative emotions can be rather good for us: they can help the immune system to kick in.\" </p> <p>Rick, too, dismisses the link between stress and conditions such as heart disease. \"There is no evidence for this because there is no clear diagnosis of what stress is. Even when people do agree a definition, it is almost impossible to pinpoint with certainty that the source of stress comes solely from the workplace.\" </p> <p>When our coping mechanisms shut down, a whole range of factors can be involved, from divorce and debt to dealing with children and relatives. Work does not exist in a vacuum. \"That's why so many of the stress payouts we have seen recently have been settled out of court,\" Briner says. \"They might not have won their cases if they had been heard because it is incredibly difficult to prove. Even if a person has a nervous breakdown, it is not easy to conclude that the sole cause of that was stress at work.\"</p>",
