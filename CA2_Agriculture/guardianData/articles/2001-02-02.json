      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>HOW TO ARRANGE A TRANSFER, THE JOHN HARTSON WAY (PT III)</strong></p> <p>1. Think about all the negotiations that have taken place between Wimbledon and Coventry City. If this transfer isn't on, it's off. On, off. On, off. On, off. On, off, on, off, on, off, on ... ooh, feel dizzy.</p> <p>2. Stop staring through kebab shop window at revolving spit of meat. Go home to sort out impending move instead.</p> <p>3. Flick through papers, all of which report how Coventry will pay the Dons \u00a32.5m with \u00a32.5m to come after appearances. Great! Drink 17 pints of high-energy drink to celebrate. Fall asleep immediately.</p> <p>4. Awake to find everything has gone pear-shaped. One fried peanut-butter and syrup sandwich too many, perhaps. And not only that, the transfer to Cov has fallen through again!</p> <p>5. Listen in stunned disbelief as Coventry chairman Bryan Richardson cites a \"purely technical reason\" for the deal's collapse. \"It is an absolute rule of this club that every player is insured for the full amount of the transfer fee and associated costs. For historical reasons, and nothing to do with John Hartson's current situation, we have been unable to secure the necessary insurance cover.\"</p> <p>6. Shake head as Richardson wishes you \"great success\" in the future. Allow jaw to crash to floor. Express surprise that parts of one's body can move so fast.</p> <p>7. Shame to waste the opportunity of an open mouth. Mmm, chips.</p> <p><strong>CHRYSALIS OFF</strong></p> <p>Chris Wright has a lot to answer for. He managed Jethro Tull. He encouraged Midge Ure to make records. And he ruined a whole generation of young men's eyesight by discovering Blondie. For these crimes, not once has he said sorry. But running Chrysalis Records is one thing, being chairman of Queens Park Rangers is another, and after being told in no uncertain terms by irate Loftus Road regulars to sod off, he is resigning as chairman of the once-successful West London club.</p> <p>\"I have reiterated both publicly and privately that as soon as I felt I had lost [the fans'] confidence I would immediately resign and withdraw from the activities of the club,\" Wright self-righteously announced this morning. And so, following recent \"unsavoury incidents around the directors box\" - ie. unsolicited opinions being given by the great unwashed in the cheap seats - the chairman of holding company Loftus Road plc has decided that \"it is abundantly clear that time has now arrived\".</p> <p>Of course, considering the club may soon be playing at Second Division level for the first time since 1967, a bit of passionate banter from supporters witnessing their team being pulled apart by upwardly mobile neighbours Fulham is the least Wright could have expected. Sadly, his gesture may not be enough to arrest QPR's slide, because there's nobody lined up to take over. \"I will continue to provide whatever financial support is necessary until the company identifies my ultimate long-term successor,\" Wright generously promised. That'll be more scrabbling about the Ryman League for bargains, then.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We had to break a plank of wood with our hands - it was a square block of wood - and you looked at it and thought 'I can't do that'. But he said we were all going to break it before the two hours were over. We're thinking 'no way', but two hours later we held the planks up and we actually broke them with our hands. It was like something you would see in the Karate Kid!\" - Manchester City defender Richard Dunne reveals his side's pre-match preparation for Wednesday night's visit from Liverpool.</p> <p><strong>MARC ARCHES AN EYEBROW</strong></p> <p>During the three seasons Marc Overmars graced the Premiership, the Fiver cannot recall a single time he bottled out of a challenge, went missing during an away trip or was attacked by his team-mates for not trying in the 3-2 defeat against Coventry on December 26 1999. Which is no doubt why the speedy winger today took it upon himself to offer Liverpool striker (and former Barcelona team-mate) Jari Litmanen a pep-talk about how to handle the rough, tough world of English football.</p> <p>\"What advice would I give him? Well, he must keep himself in good condition for the relentless pace of English games and the amount of fixtures one is required to play there,\" Marc chirped quite reasonably on his official website. \"He must also make an effort to acclimatise to the 'English way' of doing things,\" he continued, without making a single reference to booze, vindaloo or booze. Then, without so much as an arched eyebrow, he announced: \"I don't like it when I see foreign players in England moaning and complaining about the way the game is played there. They should just put up or shut up.\"</p> <p>But before the Fiver could think of two types of black kitchen utensil around which to construct a damning sentence, Marc was speeding off again. \"If a player doesn't like playing over winter and thinks there should be a winter break they shouldn't go to England,\" he warned. \"That's the way they play the game there and it's no secret that you have to play some tough games in tough conditions.\" And as we all know, when the going gets tough, some people just never get going.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Arsenal have added Benfica's Robert Enke to their list of goalkeeping targets, according to reports.</p> <p>Joe Kinnear could be set for a return to the game as director of football with Luton Town.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>West Ham have snapped up 18-year-old centre-half Alessandro Zamperini from Roma on a free transfer. </p> <p>Dave Bassett has denied reports that he will replace Gerry Francis as manager of QPR.</p> <p>Celtic midfielder Eyal Berkovic is on the verge of completing a three-month loan move to Blackburn Rovers.</p> <p>Aston Villa manager John Gregory has confirmed his interest in Ajax striker Shota Arveladze but insisted that no contact had been made with Ajax or the player's agent Ivan Benesh. \"We have seen Arveladze in action, along with quite a few other players,\" said Gregory, \"but we haven't spoken to anyone about him and we haven't discussed anything with his agent.\"</p> <p>Manchester City manager Joe Royle has revealed he has received several offers to take Paulo Wanchope on loan - but no firm bids.</p> <p>Aston Villa have launched an appeal against the straight red card handed out to Darius Vassell in the FA Cup tie with Leicester City last weekend.</p> <p>Arrigo Sacchi has retired from football management because of stress. The Parma manager, announcing his resignation at a packed press conference today, said: \"It's a bitter decision but during the match against Verona I felt ill due to stress and accumulated tension. It was an alarm bell. I thought my two years out of the game would have recharged my batteries. Evidently that's not the case.

      "bodyText": "HOW TO ARRANGE A TRANSFER, THE JOHN HARTSON WAY (PT III) 1. Think about all the negotiations that have taken place between Wimbledon and Coventry City. If this transfer isn't on, it's off. On, off. On, off. On, off. On, off, on, off, on, off, on ... ooh, feel dizzy. 2. Stop staring through kebab shop window at revolving spit of meat. Go home to sort out impending move instead. 3. Flick through papers, all of which report how Coventry will pay the Dons \u00a32.5m with \u00a32.5m to come after appearances. Great! Drink 17 pints of high-energy drink to celebrate. Fall asleep immediately. 4. Awake to find everything has gone pear-shaped. One fried peanut-butter and syrup sandwich too many, perhaps. And not only that, the transfer to Cov has fallen through again! 5. Listen in stunned disbelief as Coventry chairman Bryan Richardson cites a \"purely technical reason\" for the deal's collapse. \"It is an absolute rule of this club that every player is insured for the full amount of the transfer fee and associated costs. For historical reasons, and nothing to do with John Hartson's current situation, we have been unable to secure the necessary insurance cover.\" 6. Shake head as Richardson wishes you \"great success\" in the future. Allow jaw to crash to floor. Express surprise that parts of one's body can move so fast. 7. Shame to waste the opportunity of an open mouth. Mmm, chips. CHRYSALIS OFF Chris Wright has a lot to answer for. He managed Jethro Tull. He encouraged Midge Ure to make records. And he ruined a whole generation of young men's eyesight by discovering Blondie. For these crimes, not once has he said sorry. But running Chrysalis Records is one thing, being chairman of Queens Park Rangers is another, and after being told in no uncertain terms by irate Loftus Road regulars to sod off, he is resigning as chairman of the once-successful West London club. \"I have reiterated both publicly and privately that as soon as I felt I had lost [the fans'] confidence I would immediately resign and withdraw from the activities of the club,\" Wright self-righteously announced this morning. And so, following recent \"unsavoury incidents around the directors box\" - ie. unsolicited opinions being given by the great unwashed in the cheap seats - the chairman of holding company Loftus Road plc has decided that \"it is abundantly clear that time has now arrived\". Of course, considering the club may soon be playing at Second Division level for the first time since 1967, a bit of passionate banter from supporters witnessing their team being pulled apart by upwardly mobile neighbours Fulham is the least Wright could have expected. Sadly, his gesture may not be enough to arrest QPR's slide, because there's nobody lined up to take over. \"I will continue to provide whatever financial support is necessary until the company identifies my ultimate long-term successor,\" Wright generously promised. That'll be more scrabbling about the Ryman League for bargains, then. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We had to break a plank of wood with our hands - it was a square block of wood - and you looked at it and thought 'I can't do that'. But he said we were all going to break it before the two hours were over. We're thinking 'no way', but two hours later we held the planks up and we actually broke them with our hands. It was like something you would see in the Karate Kid!\" - Manchester City defender Richard Dunne reveals his side's pre-match preparation for Wednesday night's visit from Liverpool. MARC ARCHES AN EYEBROW During the three seasons Marc Overmars graced the Premiership, the Fiver cannot recall a single time he bottled out of a challenge, went missing during an away trip or was attacked by his team-mates for not trying in the 3-2 defeat against Coventry on December 26 1999. Which is no doubt why the speedy winger today took it upon himself to offer Liverpool striker (and former Barcelona team-mate) Jari Litmanen a pep-talk about how to handle the rough, tough world of English football. \"What advice would I give him? Well, he must keep himself in good condition for the relentless pace of English games and the amount of fixtures one is required to play there,\" Marc chirped quite reasonably on his official website. \"He must also make an effort to acclimatise to the 'English way' of doing things,\" he continued, without making a single reference to booze, vindaloo or booze. Then, without so much as an arched eyebrow, he announced: \"I don't like it when I see foreign players in England moaning and complaining about the way the game is played there. They should just put up or shut up.\" But before the Fiver could think of two types of black kitchen utensil around which to construct a damning sentence, Marc was speeding off again. \"If a player doesn't like playing over winter and thinks there should be a winter break they shouldn't go to England,\" he warned. \"That's the way they play the game there and it's no secret that you have to play some tough games in tough conditions.\" And as we all know, when the going gets tough, some people just never get going. THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal have added Benfica's Robert Enke to their list of goalkeeping targets, according to reports. Joe Kinnear could be set for a return to the game as director of football with Luton Town. NEWS IN BRIEF West Ham have snapped up 18-year-old centre-half Alessandro Zamperini from Roma on a free transfer. Dave Bassett has denied reports that he will replace Gerry Francis as manager of QPR. Celtic midfielder Eyal Berkovic is on the verge of completing a three-month loan move to Blackburn Rovers. Aston Villa manager John Gregory has confirmed his interest in Ajax striker Shota Arveladze but insisted that no contact had been made with Ajax or the player's agent Ivan Benesh. \"We have seen Arveladze in action, along with quite a few other players,\" said Gregory, \"but we haven't spoken to anyone about him and we haven't discussed anything with his agent.\" Manchester City manager Joe Royle has revealed he has received several offers to take Paulo Wanchope on loan - but no firm bids. Aston Villa have launched an appeal against the straight red card handed out to Darius Vassell in the FA Cup tie with Leicester City last weekend. Arrigo Sacchi has retired from football management because of stress. The Parma manager, announcing his resignation at a packed press conference today, said: \"It's a bitter decision but during the match against Verona I felt ill due to stress and accumulated tension. It was an alarm bell. I thought my two years out of the game would have recharged my batteries. Evidently that's not the case. I've realised how difficult it is to coach.\" Lazio goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi, 30, has admitted he could retire at the end of the season because he is not enjoying football any more.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Try a journey with Harry Steyn of Oasis Safaris, in neighbouring Botswana. We spent several days with him in the Okavango Delta, ending up at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe, travelling in a converted Land Rover 101 and camping in the bush. Harry is an entertaining and knowlegable guide and driver, and after seeing a wide variety of wildlife in the day, his stories around the camp fire in the evening were fascinating. Meals were cooked on the camp fire, which also was our source of hot water: bucket showers under the stars are interesting! Presumably costs are kept down by some participation by the clients, eg putting up the tents and gathering firewood (but no washing up or cooking), which adds to the feeling of a real safari. Tel. 020 7387 1211 (ask for Rob) or email oasis.safaris@info.bw Tanya &amp; Edmund Hoare \u0095 I did a well organised safari 18 months ago with Drifters Adventure Tours. They are based in Johannesburg but they cover most of Southern Africa and while they are a package, they were well priced and very efficient. It is possible you could do the eclipse with them. Their address is Drifters Adventours c.c., PO Box 48434, Roosevelt Park, Johannesburg 2195, South Africa. Tel. (+2711) 888 1160, fax (+2711) 888 1020, email: drifters@drifters.co.za Rachel DeLisser \u0095 Why don't you put together one of your own? You can fly to South Africa on SAA (020 7312 5000) and then up to Zambia on Nationwide (the regional airline) or to Zimbabwe on Air Zimbabwe (020 7491 0009) to Harare and on to Victoria Falls. You can book accommodation using information in the guides published for the Automobile Association of South Africa - available in the UK (020 8954 4672). Unless you want five star accommodation the whole way there are many amazing places to stay at under \u00a350 per night per room. Vanessa Sand \u0095 You might initially have a look at Bradt Travel Guide's excellent Africa and Madagascar Total Eclipse 2001 &amp; 2002 guide. It is a comprehensive collection of information regarding how to and where to see the African eclipse, and the accommodation information is updated regularly on the Bradt Travel Guides website at www.bradt-travelguides.com. If you are after a low impact eclipse trip with a reputable independent operator then Dragoman (01728 861 133) still have places available. \u0095 There is a backpackers hotel in Lusaka, Zambia called Chachacha's and they can pick you up on arrival at Lusaka airport. There are cheap dorms or you can camp in a safe garden. They even have cooking facilities so it should fit a budget trip. They provide heaps of travel information and you can get anywhere from there easily. Louise Kerbiriou \u0095 Dragoman (01728 861 133, www.dragoman.co.uk has places available on its five-week trip from Nairobi to Harare departing May 28, spending June 21 40km north of Lusaka. The tour costs \u00a31,055 plus $485 (\u00a3330) kitty and includes transport, meals and crew. International flights extra. Amanda Hammerton \u0095 Doug Stratton can organise his own trip.

      "body": "<p>Selamat hari tahun baru Cina! </p> <p> This week I have reluctantly said goodbye to East Malaysia and crossed to the peninsular, West Malaysia. On Saturday I spent the day with Jeremy and Gay touring Miri and the long deserted beach, while my washing dried. While travelling, I've found that small things can give disproportionate pleasure. On returning from Mulu Park, for example, I had my first hotel room with a bath as well as hot water. Although normally a shower person I lazed in my first bath for two months, unperturbed that, like most of Malaysia, the water had a browny red tinge. Bliss. I decided that I was not going to be embarrassed by the ring left on the bath. Similarly, having the opportunity to wash my sleeping sheet (an essential piece of equipment) was a real treat. </p> <p> So on Sunday, all sparkly clean, it was off to Niah National Park for a couple of days. The hostel accommodation was great, better than most of my hotels, with polished wood and gleaming tiles. I had a four bedroom dorm to myself. As seems to be usual at this time of year, there were few visitors, only Claus, a mature German who seemed to have taken root there and gone native, and was out collecting wild fruits at the crack of dawn, and a young English couple from Bolton. </p> <p> Niah's main attraction is another huge limescale cave, measuring 250m across at the mouth, home to swifts and bats. It takes a good hour to walk round. This time I had hired a flashlight at the caf\u00e9 across the river, which consisted of a light attached to a homemade wooden case holding four huge batteries - clumsy and heavy, but effective. The cave was awesome, with white rocks resembling huge bones scattered about at random. Off the path were little twinkling lights inside the shelters of the locals, who gather the swifts' nests for the famous bird's nest soup, and the guano, which is used for fertilizer. They climb up bamboo poles tied together to the roof of the cave, 60m above. You were occasionally aware of them as they hopped about the rocks. No hopping for me as, despite being extremely careful, I again slipped on the planking, this time with a backside covered in wet mud and bat droppings to show for it. </p> <p> On the way back the Malay skies opened, as they do most afternoons. I sheltered in a cave formed by an overhanging rock with a stream at the bottom. As I watched the rain, eating rambutan, I again felt that peace and contentment that rainforests seem to give me. The next morning I had a wonderful walk, during which I met a snake, saw a red humming bird and watched a large monkey climb down a tall tree only a few yards away. In fact, I spent so long standing still watching things that I missed my boat back to Batu Niah, which meant negotiating another one - by which time, of course, I had missed the bus back to Miri and had to wait two hours for the next one. This must have been my bumpiest bus ride yet. Not for the first time over the last couple of weeks I had cause to thank my mother's family genes for providing me with the \"Scott's behind\", which has plenty of padding. Many times I was actually launched into the air. The female ticket collector sitting in front of me not only managed to sleep for an hour but then spent the second hour totally redoing her hair and makeup. How she managed to accomplish this was a total mystery to me (as was the poster on the front windscreen, which read \"Stop dengue fever. Use polystyrene beads\"). So it was another good trip to round off my stay in Sarawak. Sadly, there was no time to go to Sabah; perhaps when I win my next trip round the world! </p> <p> On Tuesday evening I was off to Kuala Lumpur, always referred to as KL. I had been told that the in-flight magazine had a very good street map of KL. I felt a bit embarrassed tearing it out with a Malaysian either side of me, but I need not have worried, as after the meal the young man on my left methodically cleaned the metal cutlery and then put it in his pocket. The lady to my right also slipped something into her bag, although I couldn't quite see what it was. </p> <p> Anxious about arriving late at night and not being able to check out a room before taking it, I had booked into the YWCA. The lady on the phone promised me the night watchman would be waiting for me with a room ready. When I got there, no sign of life in any shape or form. Refusing to panic, I rang and rang the doorbell until a nice American resident came and let me in. I was about to crash out on the settee when the night watchman finally arrived. I would not want to be him next day when the mother-hen type warden got hold of him. </p> <p> So the last couple of days I have been exploring KL. I like it; it has tall buildings and is a busy city, but it hasn't lost its character. As usual, China town has an abundance of vibrancy, colour and chaos. Through the website, I met up with Feliz, resident in KL for many years, who kindly invited me to stay for a couple of days. Coincidentally, she also originates from Bolton. She lives in a suburb that proudly boasts the Pyramid shopping mall, with a monstrous sphinx/lion at the entrance. </p> <p> Yesterday, I did the tall buildings of KL. First to the famous Petronas Towers which, by virtue of their aerials, claim to be the tallest buildings in the world. Following email advice from Dale I chose to actually go up the KL Tower which has a viewing level nearly 300m up. I wondered what all the gasps were until I saw several spread-eagled bodies hurtle past the window. I had unknowingly hit on the day they were having a display of sky diving off the top of the tower. It was frightening to see how late they left it to open their brightly coloured parachutes. I was mesmerised by it and joined in the competition among the spectators to try and catch a shot of a body flying past. My digital camera soon had a flat battery as time and time again I wasn't quite quick enough. I returned to the bottom to catch them landing with awesome accuracy, with my ordinary camera. </p> <p> So I now have to decide how to spend my remaining time here. The consistent email advice from the two Clares, Nancy, Dale and e-kiloh has convinced me that I should try the National Park (I am off there tomorrow), Pangor Laut, Malaka and the Cameron Highlands. My sister and her husband are coming to KL next week as part of their holiday, so I will have to leave some things to do with them. It will be good to see them. They are also bringing me a new tape from my daughter. </p> <p> I also had an email from a couple I met on the plane on my first flight to Bombay, which I have tried to answer, but unfortunately my reply was returned. It seems such a long time ago, although it's only two months. That makes me a third of the way through my wonderful trip already. I am not going to think about it! Jumpa lagi, kawan-kawan.</p>",

Now, in an exceptional set that is as immaculately performed and recorded as it is meticulously documented, they have released the biggest and most impressive of his recent scores: his first full-length opera, Schneewittchen, premiered in Zurich in 1998. </p> <p>Holliger took his libretto for this deconstructed version of Snow White from a turn-of-the-century play by the Swiss poet Robert Walser, who received so little attention during his lifetime that he eventually abandoned writing altogether, and spent the end of his life in an asylum. It's typical of Holliger to be drawn to a writer whose life and work are inextricably intertwined. His career as a composer has been a series of preoccupations with different writers - his first work to attract international attention was the 1967 Siebengesang, a sort of hybrid song cycle and oboe concerto to texts by Georg Trakl, while his major projects of the 1970s and 1980s were a cycle of instrumental and choral works dwelling on the life of the poet Holderlin and a trilogy of chamber operas based upon Samuel Beckett. In the 1990s he focused on Walser, which resulted in a song cycle before Holliger began work on the opera. </p> <p>Walser treats the archetypal characters in the Snow White story as different facets of his own character; there are no dwarfs, alas, but the Queen, the Prince, the Huntsman, the King and Snow White herself go over the events in the fairy tale from new, more knowing perspectives. The narrative is tortuous; there is no catharsis, no resolution. It is spare, intense and often raw-nerved, and Holliger matches its intensity and teasing symmetries with a score of quite breathtaking imagination and crystalline control. He emphasises the compound personality of the protagonists in the opening bars by treating them as a single voice, only gradually allowing them to separate into their own vocal registers. </p> <p>Their lines leap and dart with improvisational freedom, while the instrumentation surrounds them with a web of delicately coloured counterpoints, with embedded quotations from Couperin, Berg, Schumann and Holliger's own music. The inward-looking world of the text is constantly pushed, expanded and questioned. It is an extraordinary achievement, and a stage work of rich allusiveness and strange, disquieting power. The performance, conducted by Holliger, is masterly, and Juliane Banse in the title role nothing short of superb. </p> <p>To order this CD call Guardian CultureShop on 0800 3166 102.</p>",

About 150,000 teachers are expected to receive performance pay-related increases worth \u00a32000 this year. These were delayed after a court challenge from the National Union of Teachers last year ruled that the scheme was unlawful. Today the NUT general secretary, Doug McAvoy, said the government was \"living in another world\" if it believed the rise could solve the recruitment problem, adding that would-be trainees could earn far better salaries elsewhere.",

      "bodyText": "The relaunch of the Scotsman has cost Andrew Neil's newspaper group up to \u00a35m with between \u00a32m and \u00a32.5m of that on the aggressive price-cutting strategy. Mr Neil said while sales of his group's flagship broadsheet daily have rocketed by 33% - breaking the 100,000 barrier for the first time in the title's history - there had been a significant financial cost. At a reception held in London to celebrate the sales increase, Mr Neil said the risky strategy had been essential. \"We had to blow the paper up and start again or someone else would have blown us up,\" he said. The price-cutting represents between \u00a32m and \u00a32.5m of the total relaunch costs which included the building of the second section S2, the development of the business section and the hiring of staff and a publicity drive. The Scotsman's circulation between July and December last year - which Mr Neil claimed was the industry \"gold standard\" - now stands at just over 100,000. This was up from 75,000 in January last year. Sales also doubled in the difficult Strathclyde market, which is dominated by Glasgow-based rival the Herald. Mr Neil said sales of the Scotsman would have sunk below 70,000 had he not dropped the cover price, brought in new editor Rebecca Hardy and refocused the editorial last May. \"Now we are the biggest selling newspaper in Scotland,\" he said. \"That's something the Scotsman has not been able to say in 184 years.\" For the first time, the paper has recorded a higher Scottish circulation than the combined sales of the five London-based broadsheet dailies. The Scotsman is now the \"one-stop shop\" for London advertisers that want to reach the Scottish broadsheet readership, Mr Neil said. He is also planning changes at Sunday Business, which is also controlled by the Scotsman's owners, Frederick and David Barclay. The business paper's circulation has fallen since the cover price was doubled to \u00a31. Mr Neil said he wanted to make Sunday Business a commercial success to match its critical success. The Barclay brothers want to give the paper a \"younger feel\" and are worried the paper's readers are too old. Former Express columnist Topaz Amoore has joined to edit the paper's magazine section. MediaGuardian.co.uk has learned the brothers are also considering launching a website for Sunday Business. The site would challenge the Financial Times, which dominates the online business sector with its hugely successful FT.com. However, to sustain credibility, a Sunday Business website would have to be maintained on a daily basis - a move that may prove prohibitively expensive.",

      "body": "<b>Why is Corus sacking so many people?</b> <br> The company says it has to cut its losses, which are running at more than \u00a31bn a year. It cites three reasons for the losses: sagging demand for steel in the UK, cheap imports, and the expense of exporting. Both the latter are, of course, largely down to the relative strength of the pound against the currencies of important steel producing and consuming countries. <p><b>Is British steel production inefficient?</b> <br> Far from it. The plant at Llanwern in south Wales, which will be most badly hit by the job cuts, is one of the most productive in the Anglo-Dutch group, which was formed by the amalgamation of the privatised British Steel and Hoogovens. </p> <p><b>So why doesn't Corus sack some Dutch workers?</b><br> Because it's much simpler and cheaper to sack British ones. Successive governments have spent years whittling away at workers' rights, in the name of \"flexibility\". Job security is a no-no in the free market age. </p> <p><b>Still, aren't the job losses a bit embarrassing for a Labour government?</b> <br>Yes - and very, very badly timed: there's an election coming. And the government is genuinely furious with Corus for refusing to consult ministers on its plans. </p> <p><b>South Wales is still solid for Labour, isn't it?</b><br> It has been for 100 years. But of late, Plaid Cymru has been making inroads. The Party of Wales (it doesn't care to use words like 'nationalist' these days) has been quick to exploit Labour's embarrassment. Its former leader Dafydd Wigley is calling on Tony Blair to take over the steel industry - though he was careful to avoid another alarming word, 'nationalisation'. </p> <p><b>Any chance of that happening?</b> <br>None whatsoever. This is new Labour, remember. </p> <p><b>So what can the government do?</b> <br> Precious little, except tidy up a little after the mess. It is barred by EU competition rules from subsidising Corus directly. It could chip in with grants for research and development, offer business rate relief, and perhaps buy some excess land. But at best such measures would be worth less than \u00a380m to Corus - a drop in the ocean compared with 6,050 annual salaries. It's also pretty modest compared with the likely bill for unemployment benefits and other welfare payments. </p> <p><b>Couldn't the government do something about the exchange rate?</b> <br>It could, of course, come off the fence and shoo us into the euro-zone. Or it could take back control of sterling from the Bank of England, and slash interest rates to aid exporters. But neither course is politically acceptable. </p> <p><b>How are the unions responding to the crisis?</b> <br>Convenors from steel factories across the country are meeting in emergency session today. The industry's biggest union, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, is discussing its next move. It has withdrawn its tentative offer to take over the Llanwern plant, because Corus is keeping it open, albeit in drastically scaled-down form. Urgent talks are also being held at the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. The unions hope to persuade Sir Brian Moffat, Corus chairman, that there could be other ways to cut company losses. He has given them two weeks to come up with new ideas. </p> <p><b>Isn't that a hint that he might think again?</b> <br> No. He's not noted for that. Indeed, far from hinting that the jobs might be reprieved, Sir Brian (who once famously remarked: \"I'm interested in making money, not steel\") has bluntly warned that even more might be lost. Yet oddly enough he also insists that he is acting to safeguard the jobs of the 22,000 Corus workers who will remain after the cuts. </p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/EMU/\">Economic and monetary union</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,432373,00.html\">02.02.01: Steel: more jobs may go</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,432398,00.html\">02.02.01: Government caught out by closure plans</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,432396,00.html\">02.02.01: Body blow to close-knit community</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,432331,00.html\">02.02.01: What next?

      "body": "<p>Two flights from Britain carrying emergency aid to the victims of last Friday's earthquake in western India touched down in the town of Bhuj last night as soldiers went on grimly digging bodies from the rubble, fearful that contamination may breed disease. </p> <p>Other states in India have promised to help rebuild towns in the state of Gujarat to spread the enormous cost. But most observers believe that large parts of the three towns worst affected - Bhuj, Bhachau and Anjar - will simply have to be bulldozed. </p> <p>The aid flights by the British Red Cross brought 10 tonnes of blankets, and tents, plastic sheeting, an emergency hospital unit and two vehicles. The \"immediate\" relief operation will last at least four months, such is the scale of the disaster, Red Cross officials predict. </p> <p>Relief workers are now trying to distribute essential medicines and shelter to the half million people left homeless by the earthquake, which killed at least 20,000. </p> <p>While aid has poured into Bhuj, the historic town closest to the epicentre, almost nothing has reached the remote villages to the north, where food and water are running out. </p> <p>The International Federation of the Red Cross said it was appealing for \u00a310m in donations. </p> <p>The 60 British rescue workers left Bhuj last night. Firemen from Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Greater Manchester, they rescued six people with the help of dogs, fibre-optic cable and \"vibraphones\" that detect movement. </p> <p>\"Our brief of search and rescue is basically finished. We have not found anyone else, but I would not be surprised if after 10 days some people are still discovered alive,\" a team member, Mike Thomas, said. </p> <p>In Bhachau, the town worst affected, teams were still retrieving the dead yesterday while volunteers from Bombay burned the bodies on pyres of wood lit by paraffin. </p> <p>\"Our main task is to dispose of the dead as quickly as possible,\" said Subhash Dalvi, one of the volunteers. \"We are very concerned about the spread of disease.\" </p> <p>At Dhanraj apartments, close to the town's obliterated market, Trambak Shah, a garment exporter from Bombay, watched Indian soldiers trying to retrieve his dead parents. He had been due to return to Bhachau last Friday, but missed his train and was delayed until after the quake. </p> <p>Incredibly, rescuers are still digging out survivors who have been in tiny dark spaces without water for six days. In Bhachau a 17-year-old boy, Ghanshyam Sadhu, was rescued after 132 hours. A seven-month-old girl was found alive beside her mother's body. </p> <p>\"The boy had scratches on his elbows and knees but was totally OK,\" Nilkamal Joshi, a doctor running a field hospital in the town, said. \"He was completely disoriented and thought it was still Friday evening. He was crying for water and shouting: 'The thirst is killing me. Death is better than thirst.' \" </p> <p>Dr Joshi, a volunteer from the city of Ahmedabad, where 500 people were killed, said there was now a fear that gastro-enteritis and diarrhoea would set in. </p> <p>Yesterday householders in Bhuj's old city were busy carting away their belongings by donkey, while in Bhachau furniture, television sets, and plastic chairs were being shifted by camel. </p> <p>Police officers admit that looting was widespread and that bogus volunteers had been making off with jewellery, cash, and watches from the broken shops and homes of the dead. </p> <p>\"There is not much we can do about it,\" one said. </p> <p>Bhuj woke up yesterday at 5.00am to another aftershock. Electricity has been restored to some parts of the city, but there is still no running water. Most people are still sleeping outside: astrologers in Bombay have predicted another large earthquake on February 13. </p> <p>\u2022 Donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal can be made by calling <strong>0870 60 60 900</strong>, or by post to: DEC India Earthquake Appeal, PO Box 999, London EC3A 3AA </p> <p>\u2022 Relatives seeking information are asked to call <strong>020 7839 1010</strong></p> <p><strong>How you can help</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.dec.org.uk/\">Disasters Emergency Committee</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.unicef.org.uk/giving/donate/donform.asp?app=\" india\"\">Unicef</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.interaction.org/india00/index.html\">US organisations involved in the relief effort</a> </p> <p> <strong>Related articles</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430307,00.html\">29.01.2001: Hopes fade as toll rises to 20,000</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430302,00.html\">29.01.2001: 'In half a minute everyone was killed'</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/story/0,7369,430308,00.html\">29.01.2001: Leader - Lessons from past disasters go unheeded</a> </p> <p> <strong>Photo gallery</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,429420,00.html\">The disaster in pictures</a> </p> <p> <strong>Graphic</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/naturaldisasters/flash/0,7365,430599,00.html\">Interactive guide to the Indian earthquake</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,428815,00.html\">Map of the disaster zone</a> </p> <p> <strong>Audio</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0129harding.ra\">Indian quake leaves devastation 'on an epic scale'</a><br>The relief effort has come too late for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake, reports <strong> Luke Harding </strong> in Ahmedabad.

Relief workers are now trying to distribute essential medicines and shelter to the half million people left homeless by the earthquake, which killed at least 20,000. While aid has poured into Bhuj, the historic town closest to the epicentre, almost nothing has reached the remote villages to the north, where food and water are running out. The International Federation of the Red Cross said it was appealing for \u00a310m in donations. The 60 British rescue workers left Bhuj last night. Firemen from Lancashire, Lincolnshire and Greater Manchester, they rescued six people with the help of dogs, fibre-optic cable and \"vibraphones\" that detect movement. \"Our brief of search and rescue is basically finished. We have not found anyone else, but I would not be surprised if after 10 days some people are still discovered alive,\" a team member, Mike Thomas, said. In Bhachau, the town worst affected, teams were still retrieving the dead yesterday while volunteers from Bombay burned the bodies on pyres of wood lit by paraffin. \"Our main task is to dispose of the dead as quickly as possible,\" said Subhash Dalvi, one of the volunteers. \"We are very concerned about the spread of disease.\" At Dhanraj apartments, close to the town's obliterated market, Trambak Shah, a garment exporter from Bombay, watched Indian soldiers trying to retrieve his dead parents. He had been due to return to Bhachau last Friday, but missed his train and was delayed until after the quake. Incredibly, rescuers are still digging out survivors who have been in tiny dark spaces without water for six days. In Bhachau a 17-year-old boy, Ghanshyam Sadhu, was rescued after 132 hours. A seven-month-old girl was found alive beside her mother's body. \"The boy had scratches on his elbows and knees but was totally OK,\" Nilkamal Joshi, a doctor running a field hospital in the town, said. \"He was completely disoriented and thought it was still Friday evening. He was crying for water and shouting: 'The thirst is killing me. Death is better than thirst.' \" Dr Joshi, a volunteer from the city of Ahmedabad, where 500 people were killed, said there was now a fear that gastro-enteritis and diarrhoea would set in. Yesterday householders in Bhuj's old city were busy carting away their belongings by donkey, while in Bhachau furniture, television sets, and plastic chairs were being shifted by camel. Police officers admit that looting was widespread and that bogus volunteers had been making off with jewellery, cash, and watches from the broken shops and homes of the dead. \"There is not much we can do about it,\" one said. Bhuj woke up yesterday at 5.00am to another aftershock. Electricity has been restored to some parts of the city, but there is still no running water. Most people are still sleeping outside: astrologers in Bombay have predicted another large earthquake on February 13. \u2022 Donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal can be made by calling 0870 60 60 900, or by post to: DEC India Earthquake Appeal, PO Box 999, London EC3A 3AA \u2022 Relatives seeking information are asked to call 020 7839 1010 How you can help Disasters Emergency Committee Unicef US organisations involved in the relief effort Related articles 29.01.2001: Hopes fade as toll rises to 20,000 29.01.2001: 'In half a minute everyone was killed' 29.01.2001: Leader - Lessons from past disasters go unheeded Photo gallery The disaster in pictures Graphic Interactive guide to the Indian earthquake Map of the disaster zone Audio Indian quake leaves devastation 'on an epic scale' The relief effort has come too late for the victims of Friday's devastating earthquake, reports Luke Harding in Ahmedabad.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Granada have plummeted amid fears of another profit warning from ITV's dominant broadcaster. Granada shares today fell 5.7% to 197p on speculation the company will admit worsening advertising sales growth at its annual general meeting next week. Granada's shares have almost halved in value since September, when the company first issued warnings about ad sales growth. Granada and ITV rival Carlton Communications have found it impossible to match the bumper advertising revenues generataed in the last six months of 1999. During that period, the dot.com boom poured money into broadcasters' pockets. Analysts now talk of a \"recession\" in ITV advertising sales, with March figures expected to show a drastic double-digit decline. February sales could fall by as much as 6.5% compared with the same period last year. \"Advertising growth was negative at the end of last year and, for the first half of this year, the comparative figures will get tougher,\" said one analyst. \"The growth will still be very slow.\" However, ad sales growth is expected to recover in the second half of the year as the Premier League highlights move from the BBC to ITV. The Granada Group's media and hospitality arms have now separated, with Granada Media now trading under the Granada name.",

In fashion, the buzzword was logomania. The rise of ghetto fabulous, the demise of understated: the message was, if it looks expensive and it is expensive, buy it. </p> <p>But fashion speeds on and a revolution is already in the air. The autumn/winter collections for men, shown in Milan and Paris over the past fortnight, have been a battleground for change. Military is the new direction for the style-conscious man. This is a revolt on a scale not witnessed since the last utilitarian uprising over a decade ago, when the combat trouser held the power suit to ransom in reaction to the \"Dynasty boom\" of the 80s. Epaulettes, distressed, beaten, boiled and gunshot fabrics, lean and strict silhouettes and heavy boots are all on the front line. Camouflage is the hot new print; medals replace sovereigns. </p> <p>Miu Miu, Miuccia Prada's diffusion line, Jil Sander, Roberto Cavalli, Iceberg and Raf Simons (back after a season's leave of absence) led the troops in this overwhelming trend. Miu Miu used boiled military wools for neatly proportioned coats and double-breasted field jackets. Sander's storm trooper coats brushed the floor, worn with trousers tucked into boots. Iceberg took its lead from Action Man with camouflage-print shirt and trouser combos, and knits featuring bullet holes. </p> <p>Roberto Cavalli was less literal, with a more playful spin on the look: distressed battledress and army surplus separates embroidered with roses. Raf Simons layered padded flight jackets over field coats and wrapped his models' faces with guerrilla warfare scarves. Even Gianfranco Ferre, more at home with polish without the spit, put epaulettes on his architecturally structured suits and draped camouflage-printed satin parkas over the shoulders of his tuxedos. </p> <p>Yohji Yamamoto looked to Red Square for inspiration, using boiled scarlet wool for high-buttoned jackets, with a soundtrack of a continuous drum roll. Marc Jacobs presented his strongest collection to date for Louis Vuitton, keeping the formula simple with luxurious reefer coats and drummer boy jackets in French navy with red buttonholes, and dress shirts in red and white stripes. </p> <p>A younger, more irreverent take on the military trend came from D&amp;G (Dolce &amp; Gabbana's diffusion line), who added gold epaulettes to sweaters and juxtaposed Napoleonic coats with distressed jeans, and by Moschino, who reworked national flags. Meanwhile, young American designer Sandy Dalal scribbled anti-war messages across T-shirts. </p> <p>Giorgio Armani hosted a party in Milan for the launch of an exhibition of military fashion through the ages, but did not himself stray from his formula of soft tailoring and toughened leather blousons. Martin Margiela offered us whitewashed jeans, suede trench coats and mismatched suits where the trousers had been washed and the jackets dry-cleaned. </p> <p>Dries van Noten began his show with slick Wall Street tailoring before delving into trailer trash with roadie cut-away Aertex vests and hipster pants that flared out to a boot-cut at the ankle. This was a much more adult and camp look than we have come to expect from van Noten, famed for his schoolboy classics. As one department store buyer described the collection: \"The Dries boy has finally reached puberty, realised he is gay and there ain't no stoppin' him.\" </p> <p>Decades after he bounced on to the scene, Jean Paul Gaultier is still challenging the restrictions of men's fashion. Mixing antique lace trim with biker leathers, this collection was vintage Gaultier. Paul Smith took to the Aspen ski slopes for a colourful take on winter wonderland dressing. Bubble-gum pink boucl\u00e9 coats, Fair Isle ski sweaters in candy colours and a mix of tweeds with velvet worked for him. </p> <p>Also using colour to effect was Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, who mixed graffiti prints in techno brights for tailoring and reworked the trench coat in dusty pink velvet, leaving the hem to brush the floor. Kostas Murkudis layered oriental silk brocade cut-off trousers over traditional suit ings, while British-based Daniel Margolin (now big in the US) paired grape and hot pink leather varsity jackets and campus knits with city suits. </p> <p>Dolce &amp; Gabbana put together a complete wardrobe for today's playboy. Horsey prints on silk shirts and velvet jackets, city boy pinstripe suits and racy formula one leather jackets owed more to the pursuits of inherited wealth than to the gigolo style the duo has flaunted in previous seasons. Donatella Versace was one of the few designers who did go down the ghetto fabulous route, with a mainline collection of quilted caramel leathers and almond-coloured, entrance-making tailoring. For younger line Versus, however, the temperature was turned up for a hard-edged, sexy take on op-art dressing. </p> <p>Fendi avoided its usual explosions of colour to layer textures of earthy shades, nearly always cinched at the waist. Burberry Prorsum Collection looked strong, marrying mountaineering sportswear detailing with urban classics. Missoni took itssignature knits one stage further, mixing plain yarns with Lurex; Issey Miyake mixed stripes with ease, while Gigli showed some of the most beautiful tailoring of the season. Nicole Farhi and Prada took the \"nice, wearable classics\" theme too literally. </p> <p>The season really belonged to two labels. Gucci, designed by Tom Ford, and Dior, now under the direction of ex-YSL designer Hedi Slimane, could not be faulted. While very different, these two collections summed up the mood of the season ahead and moved men's fashion ahead by light years. </p> <p>Ford, who also created his first catwalk show for Yves Saint Laurent, presented his best Gucci collection to date. Everything was desirable and everything was luxurious, right down to the distressed jeans with a gold G embroidered on the back pocket. From the silk shirts in icing sugar pink, with a chocolate floral print, to the nappa leather flat caps, the whole experience was mouthwatering. </p> <p>Dior was awarded a well-deserved standing ovation, including Slimane's ex-employer Yves Saint Laurent himself who sat at the centre of the front row. The sympathy with which Slimane's tailoring was cut was breathtaking. His leather moulded to the body, single corsages of roses hung around the models' torsos on strands of fine leather or silk ribbon, while shirts of dove grey (Dior's house colour) showed the diversity of this designer's talents. Fashion does not get much better than this.</p> <p>\u0095 Adrian Clark is fashion director of Loaded.</p>",

Iceberg took its lead from Action Man with camouflage-print shirt and trouser combos, and knits featuring bullet holes. Roberto Cavalli was less literal, with a more playful spin on the look: distressed battledress and army surplus separates embroidered with roses. Raf Simons layered padded flight jackets over field coats and wrapped his models' faces with guerrilla warfare scarves. Even Gianfranco Ferre, more at home with polish without the spit, put epaulettes on his architecturally structured suits and draped camouflage-printed satin parkas over the shoulders of his tuxedos. Yohji Yamamoto looked to Red Square for inspiration, using boiled scarlet wool for high-buttoned jackets, with a soundtrack of a continuous drum roll. Marc Jacobs presented his strongest collection to date for Louis Vuitton, keeping the formula simple with luxurious reefer coats and drummer boy jackets in French navy with red buttonholes, and dress shirts in red and white stripes. A younger, more irreverent take on the military trend came from D&amp;G (Dolce &amp; Gabbana's diffusion line), who added gold epaulettes to sweaters and juxtaposed Napoleonic coats with distressed jeans, and by Moschino, who reworked national flags. Meanwhile, young American designer Sandy Dalal scribbled anti-war messages across T-shirts. Giorgio Armani hosted a party in Milan for the launch of an exhibition of military fashion through the ages, but did not himself stray from his formula of soft tailoring and toughened leather blousons. Martin Margiela offered us whitewashed jeans, suede trench coats and mismatched suits where the trousers had been washed and the jackets dry-cleaned. Dries van Noten began his show with slick Wall Street tailoring before delving into trailer trash with roadie cut-away Aertex vests and hipster pants that flared out to a boot-cut at the ankle. This was a much more adult and camp look than we have come to expect from van Noten, famed for his schoolboy classics. As one department store buyer described the collection: \"The Dries boy has finally reached puberty, realised he is gay and there ain't no stoppin' him.\" Decades after he bounced on to the scene, Jean Paul Gaultier is still challenging the restrictions of men's fashion. Mixing antique lace trim with biker leathers, this collection was vintage Gaultier. Paul Smith took to the Aspen ski slopes for a colourful take on winter wonderland dressing. Bubble-gum pink boucl\u00e9 coats, Fair Isle ski sweaters in candy colours and a mix of tweeds with velvet worked for him. Also using colour to effect was Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, who mixed graffiti prints in techno brights for tailoring and reworked the trench coat in dusty pink velvet, leaving the hem to brush the floor. Kostas Murkudis layered oriental silk brocade cut-off trousers over traditional suit ings, while British-based Daniel Margolin (now big in the US) paired grape and hot pink leather varsity jackets and campus knits with city suits. Dolce &amp; Gabbana put together a complete wardrobe for today's playboy. Horsey prints on silk shirts and velvet jackets, city boy pinstripe suits and racy formula one leather jackets owed more to the pursuits of inherited wealth than to the gigolo style the duo has flaunted in previous seasons. Donatella Versace was one of the few designers who did go down the ghetto fabulous route, with a mainline collection of quilted caramel leathers and almond-coloured, entrance-making tailoring. For younger line Versus, however, the temperature was turned up for a hard-edged, sexy take on op-art dressing. Fendi avoided its usual explosions of colour to layer textures of earthy shades, nearly always cinched at the waist. Burberry Prorsum Collection looked strong, marrying mountaineering sportswear detailing with urban classics. Missoni took itssignature knits one stage further, mixing plain yarns with Lurex; Issey Miyake mixed stripes with ease, while Gigli showed some of the most beautiful tailoring of the season. Nicole Farhi and Prada took the \"nice, wearable classics\" theme too literally. The season really belonged to two labels. Gucci, designed by Tom Ford, and Dior, now under the direction of ex-YSL designer Hedi Slimane, could not be faulted. While very different, these two collections summed up the mood of the season ahead and moved men's fashion ahead by light years. Ford, who also created his first catwalk show for Yves Saint Laurent, presented his best Gucci collection to date. Everything was desirable and everything was luxurious, right down to the distressed jeans with a gold G embroidered on the back pocket. From the silk shirts in icing sugar pink, with a chocolate floral print, to the nappa leather flat caps, the whole experience was mouthwatering. Dior was awarded a well-deserved standing ovation, including Slimane's ex-employer Yves Saint Laurent himself who sat at the centre of the front row. The sympathy with which Slimane's tailoring was cut was breathtaking. His leather moulded to the body, single corsages of roses hung around the models' torsos on strands of fine leather or silk ribbon, while shirts of dove grey (Dior's house colour) showed the diversity of this designer's talents. Fashion does not get much better than this. \u0095 Adrian Clark is fashion director of Loaded.",

The report suggested the launch of two BBC children's channels would not have a negative effect on the market. The study, from consultancy Spectrum, argued that the proposed BBC children's services would have a beneficial impact. It claimed new channels would help to drive digital TV take-up and increase commercial children's broadcasters' advertising and subscription revenues. But a spokesman for Nickelodeon UK said the company \"does not believe the BBC will stimulate market growth\". \"The BBC is making a strange claim when its says new free-to-air channels entering a crowded market will not affect its competitors,\" he added. The Nickelodeon spokesman said a study it commissioned from Andersen Consulting found the proposed BBC children's services could mean up to \u00a3400m less would be invested in programming by commercial broadcasters. \"The entry of BBC News 24 into the market had a huge impact on existing services such as Sky News because most of its viewers were cannibalised from competitor channels.\" \"There is no lack of quality, imaginative, interactive, creative children's television provided by 14 separate services,\" said Disney Channel UK managing director Paul Robinson. \"The BBC should aim its proposed channels at audience sectors resistant to digital television. It should be focusing on homes without children.\" The BBC is planning to launch pre-school service, called CBBC Playbox, and an unnamed channel aimed at six to 13-year-olds. The Spectrum report concludes \"the new BBC channels would be unlikely to have an impact on the revenues of the incumbent operators\" and \"could indirectly help the commercial channels' revenue growth\". The study is to be submitted to the department of culture, media and sport to support the BBC's application for approval for its children's channel proposals. It also found the BBC channels would \"provide a major boost for the UK's production base\".

Channel 4 subsidiary FilmFour is going after more subscribers with the launch of three new channels in April, while The Studio began broadcasting on NTL's cable TV network last night. The launch of The Studio and FilmFour channels will provide extra competition for Sky Movies, which offer 11 movie channels to digital subscribers for around \u00a315 a month. The new FilmFour services will be offered as a package with the existing FilmFour channel for \u00a36 per month.

The time-shifted FilmFour +1 channel will screen one film less each night than the main channel, but will allow for films to fit in with the 9pm watershed, explained the FilmFour spokesman. FilmFour is currently marketed as a premium pay-TV channel, with customers paying \u00a35.99 a month on top of their basic subscription fee. The Studio, which is only available to NTL's 2.2m analogue and digital cable subscribers, is being pitched as a contemporary film channel. Universal and NTL have chosen to launch The Studio as a basic tier service - free to viewers who pay a monthly pay-TV fee - rather than a premium offering such as FilmFour and Sky Movies. FilmFour said its new film packages will allow for even greater flexibility, though initially they will only be available on Sky Digital. The outfit said it hoped to secure digital cable carriage for the extra services in the next few months. The addition of the new channels is expected to lead to a stronger film buying team at Channel 4, which will be looking for wider deals with studios to cherry-pick films for the new services.

      "body": "<p>Never underestimate the importance of organised religion in the United States. This is a nation of believers, in which 86% consider themselves practising Christians, seven out of 10 people say that the events described in the Bible are literally true and 63% of the population says that religion can answer \"most or all of today's problems\".</p> <p>In this respect, the US is very different from Europe and Britain in particular. So, when George Bush began saying during the election campaign that he foresaw an important role for \"faith-based organisations\" in such policy areas as education, prisons, welfare and social programmes, few Americans dissented. Al Gore, indeed, agreed with him. The election campaign was full of such talk from both sides.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it is unlikely that many Americans are yet aware of the full significance of the role Mr Bush intends these religious organisations to play in the social policies of the future. Indeed it would not be an exaggeration to say that Mr Bush foresees a policy revolution with religion at its centre.</p> <p>To understand what Mr Bush is attempting, it's also important to understand what he means - and certainly what some of those around him mean - by the phrase \"compassionate conservatism\".</p> <p>Mr Bush's catch phrase was always a neat campaign slogan. But it was - and is - also an agenda. It's not about finding a middle course between government and the market. It's not about capitalism with a human face. It's about using government to enable religion, and more specifically to enable evangelical Christianity, to transform American society from anarchy into order.</p> <p>Before this week, Mr Bush's most important utterance on the subject came in a speech in Indianapolis in July 1999. What leaps out from that speech is its evangelical tone. At its heart is Mr Bush's commitment to \"the transforming power of faith\". Elsewhere in the speech he extolled \"the power of religion to protect families and change lives\".</p> <p>The Indianapolis speech revealed the intellectual debt Mr Bush owes to one man in particular. Marvin Olasky has been a Mr Bush adviser since 1993. His book Compassionate Conservatism, in which Mr Bush wrote an enthusiastic preface, was published last year. It spells out its aims vividly and with great passion.</p> <p>Compassionate conservatism, Mr Olasky says, is \"a full-fledged programme with a carefully considered philosophy\". Its guiding star is that \"Christ changes lives\" and it calls for an American president who \"will have to speak regularly about the importance of faith in God to poverty fighting and other social concerns\".</p> <p>This week, as one of his first presidential acts, Mr Bush began to act out the part that Olasky has scripted for him. After meeting some three dozen religious leaders and activists at the White House, Mr Bush announced the setting up of a White House office of faith-based and community initiatives and ordered five key government departments to set up similar internal agencies to focus their own work with religious groups.</p> <p>It is now more than 18 months since the Indianapolis speech, and Mr Bush's approach to the faith-based agenda has become more subtle and conciliatory in important ways.

      "bodyText": "Never underestimate the importance of organised religion in the United States. This is a nation of believers, in which 86% consider themselves practising Christians, seven out of 10 people say that the events described in the Bible are literally true and 63% of the population says that religion can answer \"most or all of today's problems\". In this respect, the US is very different from Europe and Britain in particular. So, when George Bush began saying during the election campaign that he foresaw an important role for \"faith-based organisations\" in such policy areas as education, prisons, welfare and social programmes, few Americans dissented. Al Gore, indeed, agreed with him. The election campaign was full of such talk from both sides. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that many Americans are yet aware of the full significance of the role Mr Bush intends these religious organisations to play in the social policies of the future. Indeed it would not be an exaggeration to say that Mr Bush foresees a policy revolution with religion at its centre. To understand what Mr Bush is attempting, it's also important to understand what he means - and certainly what some of those around him mean - by the phrase \"compassionate conservatism\". Mr Bush's catch phrase was always a neat campaign slogan. But it was - and is - also an agenda. It's not about finding a middle course between government and the market. It's not about capitalism with a human face. It's about using government to enable religion, and more specifically to enable evangelical Christianity, to transform American society from anarchy into order. Before this week, Mr Bush's most important utterance on the subject came in a speech in Indianapolis in July 1999. What leaps out from that speech is its evangelical tone. At its heart is Mr Bush's commitment to \"the transforming power of faith\". Elsewhere in the speech he extolled \"the power of religion to protect families and change lives\". The Indianapolis speech revealed the intellectual debt Mr Bush owes to one man in particular. Marvin Olasky has been a Mr Bush adviser since 1993. His book Compassionate Conservatism, in which Mr Bush wrote an enthusiastic preface, was published last year. It spells out its aims vividly and with great passion. Compassionate conservatism, Mr Olasky says, is \"a full-fledged programme with a carefully considered philosophy\". Its guiding star is that \"Christ changes lives\" and it calls for an American president who \"will have to speak regularly about the importance of faith in God to poverty fighting and other social concerns\". This week, as one of his first presidential acts, Mr Bush began to act out the part that Olasky has scripted for him. After meeting some three dozen religious leaders and activists at the White House, Mr Bush announced the setting up of a White House office of faith-based and community initiatives and ordered five key government departments to set up similar internal agencies to focus their own work with religious groups. It is now more than 18 months since the Indianapolis speech, and Mr Bush's approach to the faith-based agenda has become more subtle and conciliatory in important ways. Mr Bush has gone out of his way to say that \"government will never be replaced by charities and community groups\" and to stress that federal dollars will not go to \"fund the religious activities of any group\". These apparent compromises won a generally respectful reception for Mr Bush's initiative this week. But the package raises a succession of explosive issues nevertheless, even if few politicians of either party seem to want to draw attention to them. In the first place, Mr Bush's move skates deliberately close to the constitutionally guaranteed separation of church and state, which the supreme court has repeatedly upheld. For example, one of Mr Bush's chief lieutenants in this area of policy the former mayor of Indianapolis, Steve Goldsmith, has argued that government should support homeless shelters in which participation in daily prayer is a condition of entry. Secondly, Mr Bush has yet to ensure that the \"faith-based\" programmes are run in compliance with, or at least compatibly with, the rules which apply to government programmes. Existing organisations must be audited and, unlike many religious organisations, are covered by anti-discrimination law. No such standards have yet been drawn up for the organisations Mr Bush hopes to encourage. Yet perhaps the main problem Mr Bush faces is that the programme has been set up to achieve something - religious conversion - which he is increasingly forced to deny for political reasons. Olasky, however, is explicit. In his book he says that proselytising is desirable. He supports \"change by conversion\". It is in many respects the rationale of his philosophy. \"Marvin is an evangelical Christian and Mr Bush is an evangelical Christian,\" commented one activist last year. This week, Mr Bush placed that activist, John DiIulio, in charge of his new White House initiative.

The BBC's offering attracted 5m viewers to give it a 25% share, only marginally less than ITV's 5.4m. But elsewhere the BBC fared less well. BBC2's Horizon - on a new clue to the missing link - failed to capture the public's imagination and attracted just 1.8m viewers from 9pm. A Channel 4 documentary on the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, scheduled in the same slot, proved more popular viewing, with 3.3m people tuning in for the first of a two-part documentary entitled Secrets of the Dead.",

      "bodyText": "Ulster TV could be heading for a courtroom bust-up with broadcasting watchdogs after it blocked the company's \u00a325m takeover bid for Irish radio group County Media. Following the decision by the Independent Radio &amp; Television Commission, UTV said it was awaiting a detailed explanation of the verdict before considering its next step. UTV, the holder of the ITV franchise for Northern Ireland, would not comment further. But before the IRTC's ruling, UTV was understood to be considering challenging any negative decision under EU competition rules. IRTC policy states existing media companies cannot own more than 27% of a sound broadcasting service. UTV is expected to argue that the law is specific to Ireland and breaks EU laws allowing European companies to establish businesses in any EU member state. Conor Maguire, IRTC chairman, recently made heavy hints that clearing the County Media takeover would go against the regulator's existing policy. Cork-based County Media owns three radio stations: 96FM in Cork city, 103FM in north Cork and 103Fm in west Cork. Relevant story Nov 23: Ulster TV moves into radio",

      "bodyText": "Online games retailer Gameplay is the latest dot.com to feel the pinch, cutting 275 jobs and hiving off non-core operations. The most visible casualty of the restructure will be Gameplay's eight high street @Jakarta stores. These will close even though the company recently spent \u00a35m on a rebranding initiative. Of the 275 job losses, 54 will be in the company's head office in London and will affect all departments, including marketing, IT and support. It is believed Gameplay will still employ more than 600 staff. The company hopes the cutbacks will help it achieve annual cost savings of \u00a312.5m. Gameplay chairman Mark Strachan said the restructure was necessary to speed up profitability, despite the company having more than \u00a340m in the bank from last year's float. \"This broad and decisive restructure has the single aim of bringing forward the point at which the group is profitable,\" Mr Strachan said. He added he was also in talks with potential corporate partners, which may lead to new equity investments in Gameplay. Under the restructure the company will have two core divisions - technology and boxed games - and reduce its European activity, with local websites ditched in favour of a centrally run international site. However, the interactive TV business, in which BSkyB has a 6% stake, is to remain a core component of Gameplay's future strategy. Dixons sold the @Jakarta stores onto Gameplay last year in return for a 12.5% stake in the games company. At the time of the deal, Dixons talked about strong ties between Gameplay and Freeserve. A Gameplay spokesman said the high street stores were always part of the long-term picture and were never going to be profitable in the short term. He added while the Gameplay stores gave the company a higher profile, they had been adversely affected by the overall downturn in the boxed games market. Games retailers have suffered from their heavy dependence on games manufacturers to launch games consoles on time and market them effectively. A poor performance from Dreamcast last year, and delays and distribution problems with PlayStation 2, have exacerbated the problems.",

He also pursued a long and sometimes controversial postwar career as a writer for stage and screen, culminating in the film Peeping Tom, which hurt the reputation of its leading British director, Michael Powell. </p> <p>Obeying Churchill\u2019s order to \u201cset Europe ablaze\u201d, SOE, a parallel secret service run by a mixture of brilliant brains and bungling amateurs, sent spies into occupied Europe to gather information and work with resistance groups. Casualties were high, as when the Germans penetrated its Dutch network and executed some 50 agents, despite warnings from Holland, and Marks\u2019s own suspicions, disastrously ignored by the SOE command. </p> <p>It fell to Marks to provide individual agents with the ciphers with which to send information to London by radio. Some of these were based on poems so familiar that an educated German was quite capable of recognising them and guessing the cipher, a fact that had not occurred to his superiors. </p> <p>He therefore wrote new poems for people such as Violette Szabo, one of his most famous agents, who dropped into France armed with the usual concealed cyanide pill (in case of torture) and the following verse, inspired by the death of a woman Marks had loved: \u201cThe life that I have/ Is all that I have/ And the life that I have/ Is yours.\u201d </p> <p>Marks\u2019s later means of protecting individual agents\u2019 ciphers was to issue them with pads on easily concealed squares of silk, to be destroyed after use. Such ciphers were virtually unbreakable in the pre-computer age, and were not new; but Marks refined a stratagem still used long after the war. </p> <p>He also managed to stop his superiors from insisting that agents repeat partly indecipherable messages for London\u2019s administrative convenience, since this hugely increased their chances of capture by the Gestapo. Instead, he used his knowledge of individual agents\u2019 foibles to work out what they meant, and his quicksilver intelligence to fill in gaps. </p> <p>Marks\u2019s deduction that the Germans had broken into the Dutch network was based on the fact that all messages from Holland in 1943 came across without a single error. He ended one dummy message to Holland with the letters HH, a common German sign-off standing for Heil Hitler. When the reply carried the automatic HH, he knew there was a German on the key. </p> <p>Leopold Marks was educated at St Paul\u2019s school, west London. His father, Benjamin, owned a London bookshop, later made famous by Helen Hanff\u2019s memoir (also filmed) of her postal relationship with a dealer at the shop, Frank Doel: 84 Charing Cross Road. At the age of eight, Leopold, an only child, read Edgar Allen Poe\u2019s story, The Gold Bug, about a treasure protected by a code; at the same age, he also cracked his father\u2019s secret pricing code for second-hand books in a few minutes. </p> <p>Conscripted in January 1942, Marks was trained as a cryptographer, completing a week\u2019s decipherment exercise in hours. Unlike the rest of his intake, who were sent to the main British codebreaking centre at Bletchley Park, he was assigned to SOE. There, he apparently failed another test when he took all day to break a text he was expected to decipher (with the aid of a key) in 20 minutes. Not untypically, SOE had forgotten to supply the key. </p> <p>Marks\u2019s extraordinary ability brought rapid promotion to leadership of cryptography and cryptanalysis (making and breaking codes and ciphers) at SOE. Soon he was running a mini Bletchley at Grendon Underwood, in Buckinghamshire, staffed with 400 female volunteers specially chosen by him. But the young genius was not always comfortable at SOE, convinced that his Jewishness was held against him by some. </p> <p>Awarded an inconspicuous MBE for his war work, Marks kept in touch with the intelligence world after demobilisation, and went into a successful career writing for the theatre and films. </p> <p>Much of a not always brilliant output was derived from his SOE experience. In 1960, he wrote the script for Peeping Tom, about a serial killer who films young women as he stabs them to death. Filmed as if through the killer\u2019s eye, it made the viewer a voyeur, if not an accomplice, a device which undermined Powell\u2019s career: the film was first shown on television only in 1997. But the US film-maker Martin Scorsese acknowledged his debt to this picture, condemned at the time as pornographic and evil. There was clearly a dark side to Marks\u2019s mind. He also worked for the Boulting brothers. </p> <p>Marks did not take over the bookshop on his father\u2019s death. Strongly built, yet notably soft-voiced, he was proud of his wartime exploits, though he kept the real secrets secret. But I remember his vivid description, at the Anglo-Dutch conference on Holland At War, in London in 1969, of his double struggle to frustrate the German \u201cEngland spiel\u201d in Holland, and to persuade SOE to change its ways. </p> <p>He challenged the version of the story included by the historian MRD Foot in his book on SOE. Publication of Marks\u2019s memoirs, Between Silk And Cyanide, in 1998, had been blocked by Whitehall for more than 10 years. </p> <p>Illness, money problems and the breakdown of his childless, 34-year marriage to the painter Elena Gaussen last year brought a bitter end to the life of an octogenarian who may be seen to have peaked in the secret service world when he was in his early 20s. </p> <p> \u2022 Leopold Samuel Marks, cryp- tographer and screenwriter, born September 24 1920; died January 15 2001</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 August 2017.

The move had been widely predicted after the merger of the two companies finally went through at the end of 2000. It is aimed at reducing the number of media agencies used by the new company across the world. In the UK, Glaxo Wellcome used Mindshare and Universal McCann while Smithkline Beecham used Mediacom TMB. Creative and planning agencies are not affected by the review. No one at Glaxo Smithkline was available for comment.",

Although money is a key issue, what is very much at stake is who should be credited with the authorship of a film - the person who conceived the original idea and wrote the script or the director who brought it to the screen. What is particularly galling to the screenwriters is the growing tendency of directors to insist on the words \"A Film By\" over the title, the so-called \"possessory credit\".

      "byline": "Interview by Esther Addley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Two years into my job as director-general of the prison service, I will admit that there is an awful lot to do. Many prisons still need radical improvement, and there are a small number of which I am frankly deeply ashamed.</p> <p>But to concentrate on the problems that dog the prison service, as the Guardian's series has done, is to ignore what has been achieved in Britain's jails. We are changing prisons - like Wormwood Scrubs, Wandsworth and Brixton - that have beensuccessfully resistant to change for too long.</p> <p>Of course, I would welcome an end to overcrowding. But this home secretary has provided me with the money to keep pace with the projected rise in the prison population. There is no impending crisis on prisoner places.</p> <p>The bigger problem is that for too long, overcrowding has been an excuse not to treat prisoners properly. If people are going to be imprisoned, there is an obligation to make it a decent and constructive experience for them. I know prison regimes are still unacceptable and inhumane on occasions, but our governors now understand that we expect a lot more from them.</p> <p>We had to reform our institutions so they were acceptable in 21st-century Britain. That means being utterly intolerant of abusive prison officers, for example. If someone assaults a prisoner, I expect them to be dismissed. The service is more selective about who it employs, and staff are overwhelmingly committed to treating individuals decently. I genuinely believe, from speaking to prisoners and staff, that there has been a fundamental change in attitudes.</p> <p>The prison service has two main jobs. Firstly, we have to keep people securely in custody. Only five years ago, there were about 300 escapes from prisons every year; with two months remaining this financial year, there have been only eleven.</p> <p>But most of us didn't join the prison service just to lock people away. We joined because we believed that people could be changed. And despite my lingering reservations about a small number of prisons, I believe we are finally managing to do that. Let me give three examples.</p> <p>It used to be said that prisons were awash with drugs. Two or three years ago that was a fair comment. Today, by testing at least 5% of the prison population every month, we know that drug misuse has fallen from 30% three years ago to around 12% at the moment. We have invested \u00a375m in the last three years on drug treatment in prisons, with another \u00a388m to come - it offers a good chance for those who would find it hard to come off drugs in the community to do so while in prison.</p> <p>The second area is the offending behaviour programmes. David Wilson in yesterday's G2 criticised these courses, arguing they were based on an assumption that criminals were somehow psychologically different from the rest of us. In fact, the programmes use established skills of cognitive processing (which are being applied very successfully in the field of mental health). And it is an fact that reconviction rates for those who have taken the courses are noticeably lower. Clearly they don't cure everybody, but they are having a significant impact on reoffending.</p> <p>Finally, we are doing important educational work. A large proportion of Britain's prisoners have been permanently excluded from school, and two-thirds of them have very low levels of literacy and numeracy. This year, 60,000 educational qualifications will be awarded to prisoners, for many of them the first qualification they will ever have had.</p> <p>I don't believe we have been brave enough as a prison service to deal with those problems that were not easily solveable. We have got to accept the fact that prison must be a humane and constructive place, not least because all but 23 of my population are going home some day.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two years into my job as director-general of the prison service, I will admit that there is an awful lot to do. Many prisons still need radical improvement, and there are a small number of which I am frankly deeply ashamed. But to concentrate on the problems that dog the prison service, as the Guardian's series has done, is to ignore what has been achieved in Britain's jails. We are changing prisons - like Wormwood Scrubs, Wandsworth and Brixton - that have beensuccessfully resistant to change for too long. Of course, I would welcome an end to overcrowding. But this home secretary has provided me with the money to keep pace with the projected rise in the prison population. There is no impending crisis on prisoner places. The bigger problem is that for too long, overcrowding has been an excuse not to treat prisoners properly. If people are going to be imprisoned, there is an obligation to make it a decent and constructive experience for them. I know prison regimes are still unacceptable and inhumane on occasions, but our governors now understand that we expect a lot more from them. We had to reform our institutions so they were acceptable in 21st-century Britain. That means being utterly intolerant of abusive prison officers, for example. If someone assaults a prisoner, I expect them to be dismissed. The service is more selective about who it employs, and staff are overwhelmingly committed to treating individuals decently. I genuinely believe, from speaking to prisoners and staff, that there has been a fundamental change in attitudes. The prison service has two main jobs. Firstly, we have to keep people securely in custody. Only five years ago, there were about 300 escapes from prisons every year; with two months remaining this financial year, there have been only eleven. But most of us didn't join the prison service just to lock people away. We joined because we believed that people could be changed. And despite my lingering reservations about a small number of prisons, I believe we are finally managing to do that. Let me give three examples. It used to be said that prisons were awash with drugs. Two or three years ago that was a fair comment. Today, by testing at least 5% of the prison population every month, we know that drug misuse has fallen from 30% three years ago to around 12% at the moment. We have invested \u00a375m in the last three years on drug treatment in prisons, with another \u00a388m to come - it offers a good chance for those who would find it hard to come off drugs in the community to do so while in prison. The second area is the offending behaviour programmes. David Wilson in yesterday's G2 criticised these courses, arguing they were based on an assumption that criminals were somehow psychologically different from the rest of us. In fact, the programmes use established skills of cognitive processing (which are being applied very successfully in the field of mental health). And it is an fact that reconviction rates for those who have taken the courses are noticeably lower. Clearly they don't cure everybody, but they are having a significant impact on reoffending. Finally, we are doing important educational work. A large proportion of Britain's prisoners have been permanently excluded from school, and two-thirds of them have very low levels of literacy and numeracy. This year, 60,000 educational qualifications will be awarded to prisoners, for many of them the first qualification they will ever have had. I don't believe we have been brave enough as a prison service to deal with those problems that were not easily solveable. We have got to accept the fact that prison must be a humane and constructive place, not least because all but 23 of my population are going home some day.",

      "body": "<p>If you stand outside the perimeter of HMP Grendon on an icy grey winter's morning, it's not that different from any other modern prison. It's not Pentonville or Wormwood Scrubs - it's 60s brutalist, rather than Victorian monolith - but there are the same blank walls, not as high, not as austere, but faceless, windowless, topped with the same loops of razor wire that keep the community inside apart from us outside. </p> <p>There are the same Porridge-style prison gates with a spyhole; the same prison staff in the same uniforms, carrying the same jangling keys, with which they methodically unlock and lock, unlock and lock, day in, day out, all day, every day. </p> <p>It's not until you are inside that you start to notice the difference. At first it is subtle, it creeps up on you: an unexpected camaraderie between inmates and prison staff. They chat about forthcoming events in the prison; they call each other by their first names; there is a mutual respect. The prisoners seem relaxed, the atmosphere is calm. There is none of the edgy us-and-them atmosphere that pervades other prisons - there is no sense of imminent danger. It is more like a student hall of residence than a category B prison. </p> <p>On the governor's walls hang Christmas cards from inmates, former and current. \"Thank you for giving me this chance to change,\" reads one. \"I don't have that long to go now until I'm released. I'm very confident about me and my future.\" Also posted on the wall are these words: \"If you want to know what someone is really like, give him some authority.\" </p> <p>For the old lag who has spent his entire life in and out of prison, Grendon must come as a dramatic culture shock. Inmates move around with comparative freedom: their cells are unlocked at 8am, they remain open all day, prisoners eat together and talk together, with lock-up at 9pm. Most crucially they attend daily group therapy sessions. There they confront their crimes, take responsibility for their actions and explore their lives, their pasts, their childhoods, to try to uncover why they have done what they have done and how to avoid doing it again. </p> <p>For Grendon is a therapeutic prison - the only one of its kind in the country. It opened in 1962 as an experiment in the psychological treatment of prisoners, and today it is proof that prison can be humane, constructive and life-changing. It is proof that prison can be more than sheer containment, benign or otherwise. It is proof that prison can work. </p> <p>Mark Leech served almost 20 years in 62 prisons, but since Grendon has become an award-winning journalist, author and leading campaigner for penal reform. \"It certainly worked for me. Once you get locked into being a criminal, you just accept it. Grendon made me realise there were other options I could choose.\" </p> <p>Not everyone will leave Grendon a model citizen, but many prisoners undergo radical change. When they walk out of the gates, the hope is that they will be at least a little less aggressive, a little less hostile, a little less dangerous and a little less likely to reoffend. </p> <p>The reconviction rates are encouraging. For those prisoners serving life sentences elsewhere, there is a 24% reoffending rate; at Grendon it is 8%. For non-lifers the reoffending rate is 10% lower at Grendon than elsewhere, and if prisoners complete the therapy, which ideally runs for at least 18 months, reoffending is slashed by 20-25%. </p> <p>Set in the rolling Buckinghamshire countryside near Aylesbury, Grendon houses some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain, many of whom have severe personality disorders - 95% of inmates have committed offences of violence against the person, 27% have committed sex offences. Out of the 200 current inmates, 94 are lifers, and many have come to Grendon because traditional prisons, or \"the system\", as it is called, cannot deal with them. </p> <p>The prison is divided into therapeutic wings. Each wing is a democratised community that selects its own officials and sets its own rules. There are three key policies that everyone is expected to observe - no drugs, no sex, no violence. If you breach any of the three, your peers can decide whether you should be allowed a second chance or kicked out. </p> <p>Sean, 37, is 10 years into a life sentence for rape. He has done time in prisons all over the country; now at Grendon, he is determined to turn his back on crime. \"I led a very active criminal lifestyle. That's been one of the things I've struggled with. It's trying to switch that off and not see things in a criminal way. </p> <p>\"I committed the rape. That was the point in my life when I thought, I've got to do something. I can't go on like that. The first six months I was put on remand I thought, I can't go on - no more hurting people and totally destroying another human's life. I needed to stop.\" </p> <p>He, like all of Grendon's inmates, had to volunteer to go there - motivation is crucial. Prisoners have to want to change. \"Grendon has taught me how to deal with people, how to communicate. Four years ago I would not have known how to communicate properly. I would have been quite intimidated, but now I feel quite confident about who I see I am as a person. </p> <p>\"I can't do with having the victims on my conscience any more. Before I could not see the victims. Now I can. I feel when I'm in other prisons that it's just reinforcing my old behaviour - me against the system. In other prisons I feel like I'm an inmate. Here I feel I'm part of a team who are working towards my progress.\" </p> <p>If Grendon works, Sean benefits, the taxpayer benefits, society benefits - arguably even his victims benefit, by knowing he is not hurting anyone else in the way they have been hurt by him. </p> <p>Daryl, 35, is serving 10 years for conspiracy to commit an armed robbery. \"I'd been a thief all my life. When I got nicked for this I thought to myself, I've got to try and sort my life out. I was sick of my own behaviour but I didn't know how to break away from it.\" </p> <p>Grendon gave him the chance. To some it looks like a cushy number - more freedom, a softer regime, an easy way to do your time. Others in the prison system can be scornful (prison officers at Grendon are called the Care Bears by colleagues elsewhere). But staff and inmates at Grendon insist it's the toughest way \"to do your bird\". The therapy is intensive, gruelling, demanding work. </p> <p>\"This has been one of the hardest things I've done,\" says Daryl. \"If you are really determined to change all aspects of your life, you have to do things you never thought you would do here. It's hard. You've got all sorts of peer pressures going on. People thinking you are a grass. It's hard to live with all that. Here you've got a chance to change your life. You just couldn't do this in a normal establishment. I believe in myself this time. I want it. That's the most important thing. You've got to want it.\" </p> <p>But what of Gary Watkins, who spent time in Grendon after being convicted of a vicious sex attack? He volunteered for Grendon; perhaps he too was determined to change. Within a month of his release on parole he kidnapped a 17-year-old girl at knifepoint, dragged her into his car, bound her with ropes and sexually assaulted her. He told Oxford crown court that he had maintained fantasies of assaulting and killing a young girl throughout his treatment. </p> <p>John Shine, Grendon's director of research and development, is realistic about the prison's achievements. \"Some people here make enormous changes. Other people we have to be extremely cautious about when assessing the real impact of therapy. We don't know what goes on in their head.\" </p> <p>Mark Morris, the prison's director of therapy, adds that the Grendon way is not necessarily the right way for every prison or every prisoner. \"One of the problems we have is the issue of people who are here to genuinely work on themselves and people who are here because they see it as an easy route. There are people trying to manipulate the structure, trying to get on top of the therapeutic community process to work in their own nefarious ways. Where that manipulative, destructive impulse is at its height, we need settings which are more control-focused.\" </p> <p>A second therapeutic prison is finally opening later this year, almost 40 years after Grendon began taking in prisoners. HMP Dovegate, at Marchington, east Staffordshire, will offer a further 200 places for prisoners who want to undergo therapy (there are currently 200 prisoners on a waiting list at Grendon), but unlike its role model it will be attached to a 600-bed traditional prison and run by a private company. </p> <p>Maybe that is progress, but it is abysmally slow, and it is against a backdrop of a spiralling prison population and a persistently punitive atmosphere. The prison officer who shows me round Grendon tells me at the end of my visit that he is in favour of bringing back hanging. Perhaps he is kidding. </p> <p>\"How can you think that when you work in a place like this?\" I ask. \"I'm a professional,\" he says. He does his job according to the rules of Grendon and he does it very well. \"But I read the reports; I see what these people have done.\" </p> <p>Grendon is humane; it is positive; it treats prisoners as human beings, no matter how heinous their crime, and it offers them an alternative. \"If you have to have prisons then this is the best way to run them,\" says Grendon's governor, Tim Newell. </p> <p>But there are those who fear that Grendon is used as a fig leaf to cover up the overwhelming failure of our prison system. While Grendon is a success story, it should not distract us from the bigger question: why do we keep on expanding our prison population when we know it is costly and inefficient, and creates more problems than it solves?</p>",

      "body": "<b> Ashley Johnson, 34</b> <br> Sentence: series of short terms <br>Crimes: deception and fraud <p>The first time I got sentenced, it was three months in a detention centre for theft. I was 17 and the discipline did me good. I really felt when I came out I was going to make a go of it without crime. I took up a degree, but dropped out after two years because I didn't have the funds. </p> <p>The next time I got caught I was 21 and went to a young offenders institute for 12 months. Again, when I came out there was no support network. There was less incentive to really change. Probation monitored but didn't help me. </p> <p>This time I was more clued up, more prepared. I'm a bit of a communicator and a thinker and I used the time to plan ahead what were near-enough fool-proof crimes. You realise certain systems are easy to break through or break into. I was working out how I was going to survive, where there were softer bear traps - less police and lower punishments, so less risk. </p> <p>My knowledge and connections increased while I was inside. People they tell you what they've done and how they've done it, and what the downsides are so you can calculate whether the risk is worth taking. You realise that if you deal in drugs, you get longer punishments. </p> <p>I went into deception because the sentences were small and the money was big. Drugs worth \u00a310,000 means five years. With deception, you get six months. I earned hundreds of thousands of pounds that way. I spent most of it gambling, travelling and living the playboy lifestyle, but being into deception, I also knew ways of hiding money away. </p> <p>My opinion is prison really only works for people who have done several sentences. There comes a time when you think: \"Bloody hell, what's happening here? I don't want to spend my life going in and out of jail.\" You become an old lag and start telling the young jack-the-lads about how it was for you when you were young and in jail. It hit me how much money I have spent and how much I was losing by being in prison. I had repayments and overheads I couldn't keep up. </p> <p>In the end, I bullied probation and counsellors into giving me the help I needed but I think the support needs to be so much better the first time around. That's why organisations like Nacro are good. They take a lot of the sweat from the statutory organisations. Confidence has also gone into the voluntary sector because criminals see the statutory services as an extension of the criminal justice system. </p> <p><b> Bobby Cummines, 49</b><br> Sentence: 12 years<br> Crime: armed robbery</p> <p>I was convicted for my first offence at the age of 16. From then on it was a downward spiral of increasingly serious offences. I did a seven-and-a-half-year sentence, and some years later a 12-year sentence for armed robbery, which took me to most of the maximum security units in the country. </p> <p>Education was what worked for me in prison. I went to Maidstone prison, where they had a brilliant education department and I started an Open University degree. They helped me explore why I was so different from everyone else, and why I was involved in violence from a young age. I had some good education officers and a probation officer at the time who was a good man and helped me work out what I was doing and where I was going. </p> <p>But it was the individual officer rather than the probation service that helped. They basically did nothing for me. It wasn't that they didn't care, it's just the workload was so big that you only got five minutes. It was only the fact that I came out, got married and had a lovely little daughter that I turned my life around and took any job I could, working up from there. </p> <p>When I came out, I was really affected by my record. At first I told the truth, but as soon as that happened the door was shut on me. So I thought to myself: \"OK, there's only one way to do it. Don't declare it.\" So I didn't. Which caused another problem because then I had to make up a whole history of where I'd been for the last 12 years. </p> <p>Then I got little bits of jobs, cash in hand, those sorts of things. People saw I was good and wasn't offending, so they gave me more.

      "bodyText": "Ashley Johnson, 34 Sentence: series of short terms Crimes: deception and fraud The first time I got sentenced, it was three months in a detention centre for theft. I was 17 and the discipline did me good. I really felt when I came out I was going to make a go of it without crime. I took up a degree, but dropped out after two years because I didn't have the funds. The next time I got caught I was 21 and went to a young offenders institute for 12 months. Again, when I came out there was no support network. There was less incentive to really change. Probation monitored but didn't help me. This time I was more clued up, more prepared. I'm a bit of a communicator and a thinker and I used the time to plan ahead what were near-enough fool-proof crimes. You realise certain systems are easy to break through or break into. I was working out how I was going to survive, where there were softer bear traps - less police and lower punishments, so less risk. My knowledge and connections increased while I was inside. People they tell you what they've done and how they've done it, and what the downsides are so you can calculate whether the risk is worth taking. You realise that if you deal in drugs, you get longer punishments. I went into deception because the sentences were small and the money was big. Drugs worth \u00a310,000 means five years. With deception, you get six months. I earned hundreds of thousands of pounds that way. I spent most of it gambling, travelling and living the playboy lifestyle, but being into deception, I also knew ways of hiding money away. My opinion is prison really only works for people who have done several sentences. There comes a time when you think: \"Bloody hell, what's happening here? I don't want to spend my life going in and out of jail.\" You become an old lag and start telling the young jack-the-lads about how it was for you when you were young and in jail. It hit me how much money I have spent and how much I was losing by being in prison. I had repayments and overheads I couldn't keep up. In the end, I bullied probation and counsellors into giving me the help I needed but I think the support needs to be so much better the first time around. That's why organisations like Nacro are good. They take a lot of the sweat from the statutory organisations. Confidence has also gone into the voluntary sector because criminals see the statutory services as an extension of the criminal justice system. Bobby Cummines, 49 Sentence: 12 years Crime: armed robbery I was convicted for my first offence at the age of 16. From then on it was a downward spiral of increasingly serious offences. I did a seven-and-a-half-year sentence, and some years later a 12-year sentence for armed robbery, which took me to most of the maximum security units in the country. Education was what worked for me in prison. I went to Maidstone prison, where they had a brilliant education department and I started an Open University degree. They helped me explore why I was so different from everyone else, and why I was involved in violence from a young age. I had some good education officers and a probation officer at the time who was a good man and helped me work out what I was doing and where I was going. But it was the individual officer rather than the probation service that helped. They basically did nothing for me. It wasn't that they didn't care, it's just the workload was so big that you only got five minutes. It was only the fact that I came out, got married and had a lovely little daughter that I turned my life around and took any job I could, working up from there. When I came out, I was really affected by my record. At first I told the truth, but as soon as that happened the door was shut on me. So I thought to myself: \"OK, there's only one way to do it. Don't declare it.\" So I didn't. Which caused another problem because then I had to make up a whole history of where I'd been for the last 12 years. Then I got little bits of jobs, cash in hand, those sorts of things. People saw I was good and wasn't offending, so they gave me more. I did a lot of voluntary work with ex-offenders and I got the volunteer of the year award from the Society of Voluntary Associates. Eventually, I got a full-time job and from then on I stayed in the workplace. I was made redundant but didn't go back to crime. I just got another job. I'm well on my way now. It was mostly done with support from my now ex-wife and friends I met working. When a job came up, they'd say: \"Bob's good. He can do that.\" They trusted me, and I moved on.",

      "byline": "Stephen Bates",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This week, in one of his first policy measures, President Bush handed over social services to religious groups - using public money to encourage them to do welfare work. </p> <p>The idea was formed when Mr Bush was a candidate. \"Where my administration sees a responsibility to help people, we will look first to faith-based organisations, charities and community groups that have shown their ability to save and change lives,\" Mr Bush said on the stump in 1999. He says he converted to Jesus after meeting Billy Graham in 1985. </p> <p>But political enthusiasm for social action by the churches is not confined to America. Compare Hilary Armstrong, the Labour minister for regeneration: \"Faith leaders should press local authorities to make more use of the resources faith communities can offer in regeneration.\" </p> <p>Or Tory leader William Hague last November: \"I want to denationalise compassion where the state is failing to deliver results. I want to roll back the frontiers of the state so that more work of faith and secular community-based initiatives can flourish. Religious people have as much right to a place in public life as any other citizen in our country.\" </p> <p>It is easy to see the political appeal. Religious people are more caring and benevolent, aren't they? Charities operating under their ethos are more likely to inculcate spiritual values and social concern. They have been at it for years too - some since Victorian times. And, if they take things over, it will be one more means of rolling back the state and even, maybe, reducing public expenditure. </p> <p>Not necessarily, say religious charities and the church people who support them. The idea of being drafted has left them less than ecstatic. \"We are in danger of being used as pawns. Christian groups, even those which are sympathetic, need to look carefully at who they are getting into bed with,\" says Rob Taylor, of the evangelical charity Adullam Homes, which runs centres offering support and accommodation for drug addicts, ex-offenders and others in 33 local authority areas across the Midlands and north of England. It receives \u00a36.5m in public funding. </p> <p>\"I think there is a degree of naivety by the politicians as if giving services over to faith-based groups will prevent some of the things which have happened in local authority care but the standard of professionalism is no easier to achieve. </p> <p>\"I have a suspicion that certain people are looking to do the job on the cheap. Many Christian groups already operate with a minimum of staffing and without employing people on the correct salary levels. If Mr Hague is looking to find \u00a38bn of cuts this might well be attractive to him.\" </p> <p>According to Malcolm Davies of Methodist Homes for the Aged: \"Our priority is to offer quality provision. That is how we sell ourselves to local authorities. We develop care in a Christian context but we are available to all.\" </p> <p>Jim Richards, director of the Roman Catholic diocese of Westminster's Children's Society, has similar fears. \"Is it the role of the church to replace the state? You could be tied in to a very tight contract which leaves you little room either for manoeuvre and innovation, or to criticise the authorities,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We work with families and children of all faiths and none. We don't thump the Bible at them. It is the church's mission to reach out irrespective, not to proselytise. If people have not got a roof over their heads, if they are in extreme distress, you cannot say you have to come to Jesus first.\" </p> <p>Churches form an enormous and well-established network supplying education and social care. By long tradition, church schooling is state-supported. Some 1.7m pupils attend the almost 7,000 schools shown in the pie chart. In addition, church groups are prominent in the movement for social housing, hospices and care for the elderly. Much of the help is inside the community. Jewish Care assists some 5,000 people every day. Sikh and Muslim places of worship also serve as social services centres. </p> <p>Father James McCarthy, who runs a Blackburn organisation working with excluded groups such as drug addicts, believes faith organisations can offer spiritual aid and meet needs that state provision may miss. \"The vicarage or presbytery can be a sanctuary when the offices close down. We can be a bridge to get round bureaucratic systems. But we complement, not replace.\" </p> <p>Even the largest faith-based charities are puny compared with state provision: National Children's Homes, which is Methodist in origin and one of the biggest, has an annual budget only as large as a single council social services department. </p> <p>There is a mis-match here between what charities think they are doing and ought to do and the tasks politicians want to impose on them. </p> <p>Of course, the American experience is not the same as ours. There is no state funding of religious schools in the US, for instance, but a much heavier incidence of church attendance: up to 40% attend church on Sundays (compared with 7% here), 90% say they believe in God, 80% in the afterlife, compared with Britain's 60% who say they have some spiritual belief. </p> <p>As for whether pushing churches into social services will work, privatisation has not been a happy experience even in the president's home state of Texas. Over 20 years of privatising welfare functions there has not worked and horror stories abound. </p> <p>\u0095 Stephen Bates is the Guardian's religious affairs correspondent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week, in one of his first policy measures, President Bush handed over social services to religious groups - using public money to encourage them to do welfare work. The idea was formed when Mr Bush was a candidate. \"Where my administration sees a responsibility to help people, we will look first to faith-based organisations, charities and community groups that have shown their ability to save and change lives,\" Mr Bush said on the stump in 1999. He says he converted to Jesus after meeting Billy Graham in 1985. But political enthusiasm for social action by the churches is not confined to America. Compare Hilary Armstrong, the Labour minister for regeneration: \"Faith leaders should press local authorities to make more use of the resources faith communities can offer in regeneration.\" Or Tory leader William Hague last November: \"I want to denationalise compassion where the state is failing to deliver results. I want to roll back the frontiers of the state so that more work of faith and secular community-based initiatives can flourish. Religious people have as much right to a place in public life as any other citizen in our country.\" It is easy to see the political appeal. Religious people are more caring and benevolent, aren't they? Charities operating under their ethos are more likely to inculcate spiritual values and social concern. They have been at it for years too - some since Victorian times. And, if they take things over, it will be one more means of rolling back the state and even, maybe, reducing public expenditure. Not necessarily, say religious charities and the church people who support them. The idea of being drafted has left them less than ecstatic. \"We are in danger of being used as pawns. Christian groups, even those which are sympathetic, need to look carefully at who they are getting into bed with,\" says Rob Taylor, of the evangelical charity Adullam Homes, which runs centres offering support and accommodation for drug addicts, ex-offenders and others in 33 local authority areas across the Midlands and north of England. It receives \u00a36.5m in public funding. \"I think there is a degree of naivety by the politicians as if giving services over to faith-based groups will prevent some of the things which have happened in local authority care but the standard of professionalism is no easier to achieve. \"I have a suspicion that certain people are looking to do the job on the cheap. Many Christian groups already operate with a minimum of staffing and without employing people on the correct salary levels. If Mr Hague is looking to find \u00a38bn of cuts this might well be attractive to him.\" According to Malcolm Davies of Methodist Homes for the Aged: \"Our priority is to offer quality provision. That is how we sell ourselves to local authorities. We develop care in a Christian context but we are available to all.\" Jim Richards, director of the Roman Catholic diocese of Westminster's Children's Society, has similar fears. \"Is it the role of the church to replace the state? You could be tied in to a very tight contract which leaves you little room either for manoeuvre and innovation, or to criticise the authorities,\" he says. \"We work with families and children of all faiths and none. We don't thump the Bible at them. It is the church's mission to reach out irrespective, not to proselytise. If people have not got a roof over their heads, if they are in extreme distress, you cannot say you have to come to Jesus first.\" Churches form an enormous and well-established network supplying education and social care. By long tradition, church schooling is state-supported. Some 1.7m pupils attend the almost 7,000 schools shown in the pie chart. In addition, church groups are prominent in the movement for social housing, hospices and care for the elderly. Much of the help is inside the community. Jewish Care assists some 5,000 people every day. Sikh and Muslim places of worship also serve as social services centres. Father James McCarthy, who runs a Blackburn organisation working with excluded groups such as drug addicts, believes faith organisations can offer spiritual aid and meet needs that state provision may miss. \"The vicarage or presbytery can be a sanctuary when the offices close down. We can be a bridge to get round bureaucratic systems. But we complement, not replace.\" Even the largest faith-based charities are puny compared with state provision: National Children's Homes, which is Methodist in origin and one of the biggest, has an annual budget only as large as a single council social services department. There is a mis-match here between what charities think they are doing and ought to do and the tasks politicians want to impose on them. Of course, the American experience is not the same as ours. There is no state funding of religious schools in the US, for instance, but a much heavier incidence of church attendance: up to 40% attend church on Sundays (compared with 7% here), 90% say they believe in God, 80% in the afterlife, compared with Britain's 60% who say they have some spiritual belief. As for whether pushing churches into social services will work, privatisation has not been a happy experience even in the president's home state of Texas. Over 20 years of privatising welfare functions there has not worked and horror stories abound. \u0095 Stephen Bates is the Guardian's religious affairs correspondent.",

      "body": "<p>In room 31 of Helsinki district courts, Tuomo Tapani-Salo is in trouble. Three years ago, on a ferry trip from Sweden, he was found with a bag full of cigarettes, alcohol and perfume stolen from the ship's duty-free shop. The short, barrel-shaped skinhead insists he was carrying the bag for a friend, Johannes. Johannes cannot be prosecuted because he was under 15 at the time. But he is in court to back up Tuomo's story, wearing two black eyes and army fatigues, courtesy of his national service. </p> <p>Outside you could be in any courthouse in Britain. Anxious parents in their frayed Sunday best, the accused affecting studied nonchalance, bored policemen in uniform and lawyers carrying battered briefcases; all wait, whisper and walk in expectant circles on polished floors that smell of cheap disinfectant. </p> <p>But inside, the room is a bare setting of wooden panelling and fluorescent glare. No emblem, crest or Latin scripture is embossed on the wall laying claim to the higher ideals of truth and justice. Just the sign of a cellphone inside a red circle with a red line through it - a sign of the times in a country where there are more mobiles than people. </p> <p>Tuomo stands to hear the verdict. Not guilty, says the judge, and he and Johannes head out for a smoke with a smile. Next door, in room 32, six people have been tried. Two for possession of drugs, three for violent assault and one on 17 different charges ranging from possession of an illegal firearm to twice driving under the influence of drugs. Only the latter goes to prison, for an eight-month stretch. The rest are fined. </p> <p>Seven cases, six guilty verdicts; one imprisoned, six walk free. Another morning in the Finnish judicial system - a country with the lowest prison population in the European Union. Here they have made it a point of principle to keep criminals out of prison, unless they are believed to pose a risk to society. </p> <p>\"I don't believe longer prison sentences help our real safety,\" says Markku Salminen, general director of the Finnish prison administration. \"If you put someone in prison, then it is almost certain that they'll be released and go back again. Prison is like university - the university of crime.\" </p> <p>This, the Finns believe, is particularly true of the young, who are only incarcerated for the harshest crimes. </p> <p>This liberal approach can produce what looks like very illiberal results. Rapists can sometimes walk out of a Finnish court with a conditional sentence - depending on the circumstances in which the crime was committed, and whether it was a first offence. </p> <p>It wasn't always like this. As recently as the 70s, Finland had one of the highest prison populations in western Europe. But since then the number of prisoners has been falling dramatically, to just below the rest of Scandinavia, even as the rates and patterns of crime have kept in line with its Nordic neighbours. </p> <p>The move to cut the prison population began not with politicians but academics during the late 60s. Inspired by the radicalism of the age, intellectuals insisted that criminal policy should be part of an overall social policy, related to employment and educational opportunities, and proclaimed that there was no evidence of a link between long prison sentences and less crime. \"The outcome of all this was a criminal political ideology - humane neo-classicism - which stressed both legal safeguards against coercive care and the objective of less repressive measures in general,\" says the head of the national research institute of legal policy in Finland, Tappio Lappi-Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. \"Instead of direct or simple deterrence, the theory speaks of indirect general prevention or - more often - the moral-creating and value-shaping effect of punishment.\" </p> <p>Gradually but consistently these abstract principles began to be translated into action by a mixture of decriminalising some offences (such as public drunkenness), relaxing sentencing on others, and reducing the minimum prison sentence from four months in 1976 to just 14 days in 1989. </p> <p>The most dramatic changes were in the sanctions for two specific crimes - drink-driving and theft. During the mid-70s, judges were allowed greater scope to impose conditional sentences and fines instead of imprisonment. In the 90s community service also became a popular punishment for both, leaving only repeat offenders and rare cases ending up behind bars. </p> <p>The results, in terms of prison population, were startling. In 1971, 38% of those sentenced for theft went to jail; in 1991, it was 11%. Similarly, in 1971, 70% of drink-drivers were sentenced to prison; in 1981, it was 12%. There was no commensurate increase in rates of theft or drink-driving. </p> <p>Remarkably, given the high and permanent profile that law and order has attained in British political culture, this ideologically inspired sea-change was introduced without any political comment or interference. So while crime has been extensively theorised, it has not been politicised for electoral advantage. \"Finnish criminal policy is exceptionally expert-oriented,\" says Mr Lappi-Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. \"In a small country like this, reforms have been prepared and conducted by a relatively small group of experts. So far, Finnish politicians have been able to resist the temptation of low-level populism on this issue.\" </p> <p>At a recycling depot in the industrial area of the city, Jarmo Laihonen is savouring his finest hour. Last spring he was kicked out of his house after a drunken row with his wife. He decided to drive the short distance to his girlfriend's house and was stopped by the police for drink-driving. He was sentenced to 170 hours community service, which he serves eight hours a week in two, four-hour stints, hauling old furniture and electrical goods around the shop floor. This is hour 169. When he finishes later today he will be a free man.</p> <p>\"I was relieved when I was sentenced to community service,\" he says. \"I've been to prison a few times before and it isn't useful for me. Many of my friends think it was too soft a sentence but they don't know what it's like. I think this will be my last time, where crime is concerned.\" </p> <p>If Jarmo succeeds, it will be against the odds. Whatever community service in Finland does achieve, it does not stop people getting into trouble. Three-quarters of those given community service, which usually involves menial work or helping the disabled or the elderly, reoffend, compared with 80% who are released from prison. </p> <p>Maija Kukkonen, head of the probation service, says the rate is high but does not denote a failure of the system. \"So long as the rate is lower than those who are released from prison, or even if it was the same, then I would say it is a success. Because so long as they are on community service, they are still with their family, they can keep their house and job, pay their taxes and they remain in society. When people come out of prison, they often have nothing.\" </p> <p>Not everyone is convinced. As he begins the Wednesday night police patrol through central Helsinki, Markku Salminen says that without the threat of prison, it is difficult to enforce the law. But five hours into his shift, there does not seem to be that much law to enforce: he has yelled at a jay walker, and dealt with one parking incident, a woman who could not turn off her car alarm, a man who would not pay his restaurant bill, and an elderly couple who have been terrorised by their violent son (who hit his father over the head with his shoe). </p> <p>Finland remains a relatively safe country. Polls show that police are regarded as more trustworthy than priests. And they have earned it. The detection rate for murder is around 96%, compared with 26% in America. It is this, not prison, that prevents crime, says Mr Salminen, who used to be a detective. \"People never think about what kind of punishment they are going to receive when they commit a crime. They worry about getting caught.\" </p> <p>Ronja Siren was dealing in drugs, guns and explosives, in a gang of 50, when she was caught. Sitting in the H\u00e4meenlinna closed prison, where she is serving a nine-year sentence, she says she uses the gym as a physical outlet for the emotional stress of being separated from her two young children and husband, who is also in prison. \"The gym is very important to me. I go there every evening that I can. If I am going to get myself out of this situation, it will be down to myself,\" she says. </p> <p>The regime in H\u00e4meenlinna, just over 60 miles from Helsinki, is strict but not oppressive. Prisoners are locked up from 10 at night to six in the morning, when they must slop out the buckets they use for toilets. Most have televisions and videos in their rooms and, on each wing, there is a communal area where they can eat and relax.

      "bodyText": "In room 31 of Helsinki district courts, Tuomo Tapani-Salo is in trouble. Three years ago, on a ferry trip from Sweden, he was found with a bag full of cigarettes, alcohol and perfume stolen from the ship's duty-free shop. The short, barrel-shaped skinhead insists he was carrying the bag for a friend, Johannes. Johannes cannot be prosecuted because he was under 15 at the time. But he is in court to back up Tuomo's story, wearing two black eyes and army fatigues, courtesy of his national service. Outside you could be in any courthouse in Britain. Anxious parents in their frayed Sunday best, the accused affecting studied nonchalance, bored policemen in uniform and lawyers carrying battered briefcases; all wait, whisper and walk in expectant circles on polished floors that smell of cheap disinfectant. But inside, the room is a bare setting of wooden panelling and fluorescent glare. No emblem, crest or Latin scripture is embossed on the wall laying claim to the higher ideals of truth and justice. Just the sign of a cellphone inside a red circle with a red line through it - a sign of the times in a country where there are more mobiles than people. Tuomo stands to hear the verdict. Not guilty, says the judge, and he and Johannes head out for a smoke with a smile. Next door, in room 32, six people have been tried. Two for possession of drugs, three for violent assault and one on 17 different charges ranging from possession of an illegal firearm to twice driving under the influence of drugs. Only the latter goes to prison, for an eight-month stretch. The rest are fined. Seven cases, six guilty verdicts; one imprisoned, six walk free. Another morning in the Finnish judicial system - a country with the lowest prison population in the European Union. Here they have made it a point of principle to keep criminals out of prison, unless they are believed to pose a risk to society. \"I don't believe longer prison sentences help our real safety,\" says Markku Salminen, general director of the Finnish prison administration. \"If you put someone in prison, then it is almost certain that they'll be released and go back again. Prison is like university - the university of crime.\" This, the Finns believe, is particularly true of the young, who are only incarcerated for the harshest crimes. This liberal approach can produce what looks like very illiberal results. Rapists can sometimes walk out of a Finnish court with a conditional sentence - depending on the circumstances in which the crime was committed, and whether it was a first offence. It wasn't always like this. As recently as the 70s, Finland had one of the highest prison populations in western Europe. But since then the number of prisoners has been falling dramatically, to just below the rest of Scandinavia, even as the rates and patterns of crime have kept in line with its Nordic neighbours. The move to cut the prison population began not with politicians but academics during the late 60s. Inspired by the radicalism of the age, intellectuals insisted that criminal policy should be part of an overall social policy, related to employment and educational opportunities, and proclaimed that there was no evidence of a link between long prison sentences and less crime. \"The outcome of all this was a criminal political ideology - humane neo-classicism - which stressed both legal safeguards against coercive care and the objective of less repressive measures in general,\" says the head of the national research institute of legal policy in Finland, Tappio Lappi-Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. \"Instead of direct or simple deterrence, the theory speaks of indirect general prevention or - more often - the moral-creating and value-shaping effect of punishment.\" Gradually but consistently these abstract principles began to be translated into action by a mixture of decriminalising some offences (such as public drunkenness), relaxing sentencing on others, and reducing the minimum prison sentence from four months in 1976 to just 14 days in 1989. The most dramatic changes were in the sanctions for two specific crimes - drink-driving and theft. During the mid-70s, judges were allowed greater scope to impose conditional sentences and fines instead of imprisonment. In the 90s community service also became a popular punishment for both, leaving only repeat offenders and rare cases ending up behind bars. The results, in terms of prison population, were startling. In 1971, 38% of those sentenced for theft went to jail; in 1991, it was 11%. Similarly, in 1971, 70% of drink-drivers were sentenced to prison; in 1981, it was 12%. There was no commensurate increase in rates of theft or drink-driving. Remarkably, given the high and permanent profile that law and order has attained in British political culture, this ideologically inspired sea-change was introduced without any political comment or interference. So while crime has been extensively theorised, it has not been politicised for electoral advantage. \"Finnish criminal policy is exceptionally expert-oriented,\" says Mr Lappi-Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. \"In a small country like this, reforms have been prepared and conducted by a relatively small group of experts. So far, Finnish politicians have been able to resist the temptation of low-level populism on this issue.\" At a recycling depot in the industrial area of the city, Jarmo Laihonen is savouring his finest hour. Last spring he was kicked out of his house after a drunken row with his wife. He decided to drive the short distance to his girlfriend's house and was stopped by the police for drink-driving. He was sentenced to 170 hours community service, which he serves eight hours a week in two, four-hour stints, hauling old furniture and electrical goods around the shop floor. This is hour 169. When he finishes later today he will be a free man. \"I was relieved when I was sentenced to community service,\" he says. \"I've been to prison a few times before and it isn't useful for me. Many of my friends think it was too soft a sentence but they don't know what it's like. I think this will be my last time, where crime is concerned.\" If Jarmo succeeds, it will be against the odds. Whatever community service in Finland does achieve, it does not stop people getting into trouble. Three-quarters of those given community service, which usually involves menial work or helping the disabled or the elderly, reoffend, compared with 80% who are released from prison. Maija Kukkonen, head of the probation service, says the rate is high but does not denote a failure of the system. \"So long as the rate is lower than those who are released from prison, or even if it was the same, then I would say it is a success. Because so long as they are on community service, they are still with their family, they can keep their house and job, pay their taxes and they remain in society. When people come out of prison, they often have nothing.\" Not everyone is convinced. As he begins the Wednesday night police patrol through central Helsinki, Markku Salminen says that without the threat of prison, it is difficult to enforce the law. But five hours into his shift, there does not seem to be that much law to enforce: he has yelled at a jay walker, and dealt with one parking incident, a woman who could not turn off her car alarm, a man who would not pay his restaurant bill, and an elderly couple who have been terrorised by their violent son (who hit his father over the head with his shoe). Finland remains a relatively safe country. Polls show that police are regarded as more trustworthy than priests. And they have earned it. The detection rate for murder is around 96%, compared with 26% in America. It is this, not prison, that prevents crime, says Mr Salminen, who used to be a detective. \"People never think about what kind of punishment they are going to receive when they commit a crime. They worry about getting caught.\" Ronja Siren was dealing in drugs, guns and explosives, in a gang of 50, when she was caught. Sitting in the H\u00e4meenlinna closed prison, where she is serving a nine-year sentence, she says she uses the gym as a physical outlet for the emotional stress of being separated from her two young children and husband, who is also in prison. \"The gym is very important to me. I go there every evening that I can. If I am going to get myself out of this situation, it will be down to myself,\" she says. The regime in H\u00e4meenlinna, just over 60 miles from Helsinki, is strict but not oppressive. Prisoners are locked up from 10 at night to six in the morning, when they must slop out the buckets they use for toilets. Most have televisions and videos in their rooms and, on each wing, there is a communal area where they can eat and relax. But the rest of the time there is a range of work and study activities which they can do if they wish. Siren's offence shows just how crime patterns in the region are changing. With Russia and Estonia now opened up, Finland, like the rest of Scandinavia, has become vulnerable to drugs smuggling and small-scale mafia activity, which has prompted both a rise in foreign prisoners and a more hardened, desperate type of criminal. For with more serious crime comes stiffer sentences, which means the average time spent in prison is growing. Last year, for the first time in a long time, the prison population increased by 8%. Moreover, by adding heroin and amphetamine to the nation's favourite drug, alcohol, a growing number of drug-abusing inmates have created a sub-culture in prison which is demanding a more repressive response from guards. \"Prisoners trade drugs, which leads to a debt system where one prisoner owes another money or cigarettes which can then lead to violence,\" says Anna-Kaarina Gr\u00f6nholm, the governor of Helsinki prison. \"So we have to continually have checks, urine tests and raids, which does change the atmosphere within a prison.\" Those with serious drug or alcohol dependency are also less likely to be suitable for community service, thereby compounding the likelihood of them going to jail. In the nearby open prison of Vanaja, the atmosphere is more relaxed but the sanctions for transgression more severe. Prisoners here are free to come and go as they please, so long as they check in at night, and have access to a sauna, skis and a tennis court. Some work at sewing, weaving or gardening within the grounds. Others commute to colleges in the area. One woman, convicted of white-collar crime, drives the 60 miles to Helsinki every day to a regular job and is monitored with the use of a special kind of mobile phone. They are paid a wage or grant from which they pay taxes. Most are being prepared for release, and any breach of the rules would put them back in the closed prison. Hessu, 70, who killed his wife 10 years ago, came to Vanaja recently after a spell in a closed prison, and works in the library. \"It's not hard to get used to here because you can freely come and go so I feel like I'm half-way to civilian life already,\" says the former merchant seaman. But there is evidence that the consensus that produces this comfort may be showing signs of strain. The expert-led approach to prison policy has partly been able to work because it has been shielded from the popular scrutiny. When it was formulated Finns had just a couple of state television channels and an exclusively broadsheet print media, and were primarily preoccupied with Russian foreign policy. Now the Finns are members of the EU, there are several cable channels and two vibrant tabloids. So perception of crime has increased, even when crime has not; between 1992 and 2000, the purchase of burglar alarms almost trebled, and special windows and door protection rose nine-fold. Moreover, the political consensus that produced it was underpinned by an economic cohesion that no longer exists, with some families already into a second generation which has not known work. The time may be ripe for a populist demagogic attack on perceived leniency. The fragility was shown a few years ago when a paedophile and murderer, Yamu, was up for release. With a culture where tabloids could now set the agenda, the prospect of his release sparked great public interest. On the website of one of the red-top papers were two questions. The first: \"Do you think Yamu should be released?\" The second: \"Do you think our prison sentencing is tough enough?\"",

You can't get more establishment than Mr Ramsbotham. But according to Home Office whisperers, he's a loose canon, a turn-coat - even worse, a liberal. </p> <p>As Jack Straw tells Britain's judges, yet again, that he wants even more people banged up, Mr Ramsbotham is illustrating exactly why and how Britain's jail population must be cut right back. </p> <p>The one word Mr Ramsbotham uses again and again is \"appalled\". Her majesty's chief inspector of prisons is appalled by the drug problems, health problems, overcrowding problems, funding problems, you name it. As the prison population has increased by 50% over the past 10 years, so its budget has been slashed. The biggest problem, he says, is many of the people shouldn't be in prison in the first place. </p> <p>Take the elderly. \"When I discover an 87-year-old on a Zimmer frame with Alzheimer's in a so-called high-security training prison on the ground that he represents a danger to the public, now I'm sorry but I think this is a nonsense.\" So what would his policy be? \"When you reach the cut-off age, 60 or 65, the local social services should become involved. Early release on humane grounds should be considered.\" </p> <p>Mr Ramsbotham has spent most of the past five years visiting prison after prison - unannounced. He and his team (doctors, psychiatrists, educators, work-skill people, engineers) then take up residence for a week, wander round the prison, observe, and talk to the prisoners about the problems they face. </p> <p>When I ask what has shocked him most about what he has seen he returns to his first prison visit - to Holloway. There were rats and cockroaches, used tampons thrown outside windows, 15-year-old girls locked up in the antenatal unit. \"I said to the midwife, 'Are those girls pregnant?', and she said, 'No.' I said, 'What are they doing here?' She said they don't know where else to put them, and I said, 'Are all the other women pregnant?' 'Oh no,' she said there's a psychotic, a psychiatrically disturbed ... I said, 'What's going on here?' She shut the door and looked at me and said, 'I'm an Ibo from Nigeria where they're meant to be less civilised than here, and I have to tell you I have never seen anything as inhuman and disgusting as the way they treat people in Holloway.' I've never forgotten that.\" </p> <p>He talks about the number of women in prison for minor offences, mainly drugs, many of them banished from their children. Surely they would be better off rehabilitated in the community? \"I couldn't agree with you more. Holloway represents all that is impossible about the imprisonment of women at the moment. The average length of stay is 28 days. What can you actually do useful in 28 days?\" </p> <p>Does he think the age of criminality is too young? In Norway it is 15 as opposed to 10 in Britain. \"I do not believe that prison is anything other than an adult environment and children should be out of it. I'm not saying there should not be children in custody, but it shouldn't be in prison service custody.\" </p> <p>Mr Ramsbotham approaches prisons with his old military precision. He laughs at the notion he's a liberal, says he has no politics, he just wants to see an efficiently-run service. The job, is not so different from the days when he bossed the streets of Belfast.

I met a man in prison the other day who has admitted assets of \u00a356m, and he's a drug dealer. That amount of money is a very dangerous part of the corruption in prisons; the bullying and intimidation of prisoners. It can also be used as a weapon to bribe and corrupt prison officers.\" </p> <p>Mr Ramsbotham says one of the difficulties of discussing all this with politicians is that they have no first-hand experience of prisons. Amazingly, no serving prime minister has ever visited a prison. \"No minister has ever accompanied me on an inspection. When ministers go to prisons they show them what they think ministers would like to see.\" </p> <p>We do a tally. There are currently 63,000 people in UK prisons. When you take away the kids, the elderly, the mentally ill, the asylum seekers, those inside for trivial shoplifting or drug offences, Mr Ramsbotham reckons you've stripped a good 20,000 away. While Mr Straw expects the prison population to rise to 78,000 by 2007, Mr Ramsbotham reckons it could be cut to about 40,000 now. </p> <p>Mr Ramsbotham says that since he has been doing this job he has kept a statement on his desk to remind him why he is there. \"It was made just before 10 o'clock on the evening of July 20, 1910, by Winston Churchill. It's the famous phrase that the mood and tenor of a nation can be judged by the way it treats its criminals, and there's a treasure in the heart of every man if only you can find it.

Then your chief inspector should be regarded as an ally. To me, if I was home secretary my enemy would be those people working in prisons who are not doing their job.\" </p> <p>This summer Mr Ramsbotham is due to retire. He says he has loved the job, feels significant progress has been made, such as the setting up of the youth justice board. There is so much left to do, he says. He talks enthusiastically about the thematic review of inequalities he has begun - race, gender, disability, the elderly and people with mental health problems. \"I may well not be allowed to finish it.\" </p> <p>So why is he retiring? \"You'll have to ask the home secretary. I would be happy to stay.\" And they won't extend his contract again? \"Well they've announced that I was retiring so presumably they've made up their minds.\" He says that he first heard his impending retirement announced in the press and no one from the home office has yet discussed it with him. Perhaps it's a measure of his success that they feel the need to see him off? \"My answer to that is, OK, shoot the messenger, but the message won't go away.\"</p>",

He talks enthusiastically about the thematic review of inequalities he has begun - race, gender, disability, the elderly and people with mental health problems. \"I may well not be allowed to finish it.\" So why is he retiring? \"You'll have to ask the home secretary. I would be happy to stay.\" And they won't extend his contract again? \"Well they've announced that I was retiring so presumably they've made up their minds.\" He says that he first heard his impending retirement announced in the press and no one from the home office has yet discussed it with him. Perhaps it's a measure of his success that they feel the need to see him off? \"My answer to that is, OK, shoot the messenger, but the message won't go away.\"",

But now the role seems to have been taken over by the students' union. Leaders of Sheffield University's union have enraged members by slapping a \"censorious\" ban on the controversial rapper Eminem. The union banned the controversial American from club nights and student media after a handful of members complained about his lyrics on bludgeoning women and gays to death and abusing his \"stinkin' ass mom\". The union ruled that Steel Press, Sheffield's award-winning student newspaper, was allowed to write straight news stories mentioning the singer but not to review his latest CD, the Marshall Mathers LP, or his UK tour which starts next week. Fans have been barred from wearing Eminem T-shirts in the bar. But students said it constituted censorship and they would break the ban. Dan Morfitt, head of music at Sure, the student radio station, said the ban was extreme and he planned to break it on Monday by playing an Eminem record \"to see what happened\". \"We have really got to go for it to break this ban.

Andreaz Nowakowski, of the Sheffield union, said: \"Our aim is to create a culture of tolerance, equality and respect for all our members.\" Eminem's homophobia and misogynism spoiled that atmosphere. Mr Nowakowski said the fact that students yesterday staged protests at the ban was \"frustrating\", but they would be given a chance to air their views. The Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom called the ban heavy-handed censorship, but the National Union of Students and gay rights' groups welcomed it. Owain James, national NUS president, said: \"NUS will not condone sexist or homophobic language in any way.\" Angela Mason, executive director of Stonewall, the gay rights group, said public debate on Eminem was needed. Peter Tatchell of OutRage! said the group was against censorship but was appalled by Eminem's lyric fantasies about killing gays and women. No other student unions moved to join Sheffield's ban yesterday. American homosexual organisations have organised a Rally Against Hate outside the Grammy awards ceremony in Los Angeles on February 21, where Eminem is expected to sing and collect awards. Not welcome: from Pepsi to Straw Jack Straw In February last year, Leeds University student union voted to revoke the life-long membership of the home secretary, their former president, because of his \"anti-libertarian policies\". KitKats Around 80 student unions, including Cardiff and Cambridge, ban the sale or advertisement of KitKats, Polo Mints, Toffee Crisps, Nescaf\u00e9 and other Nestl\u00e9 products - including L'Oreal shampoo - because students do not agree with the company's ethical policy and marketing of baby milk in the developing world.

The new brand will be aimed at women in their 20s and 30s.</p> <p>The lower pricing and younger target audience will distinguish the range from M&amp;S's upmarket designer label Autograph, which was launched last autumn. </p> <p>It is not known what Mr Davies's new M&amp;S brand will be called.</p> <p>\"I have always been an admirer of Marks &amp; Spencer and the quality of its products. I passionately believe in this business,\" he said.</p> <p>However, last November Mr Davies took a very different line in a Sunday Telegraph interview, saying he \"had not had one conversation with M&amp;S - and I won't\". </p> <p>\"I would not go to M&amp;S. I am not that sort of person - it's too corporate,\" he added.</p> <p>Mr Davies's change of heart may have come about because he has been able to reach a deal with M&amp;S that allows him to set up his own company - of which he will be chief executive - to supply the retailer, rather than work in-house. </p> <p>He is credited with creating a supermarket's first credible clothing range, Asda's George label, in the late 1980s. Prior to that he worked as a designer for Next.</p> <p>Mr Davies was one of a string of senior executives, including chief executive Allan Leighton, who left Asda after US giant Wal-Mart acquired the supermarket chain. He quit in November last year.</p> <p>M&amp;S has been hiring talent from outside the company in a bid to turn its fortunes around. </p> <p>This week the retailer appointed Warehouse managing director Yasmin Yusuf to the new post of creative director. It had already hired Michele Jobling, previously managing director of department store Liberty, to run its children's wear operation.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Asda's former fashion guru George Davies has done what he said he would never do - join ailing retailer Marks &amp; Spencer. M&amp;S has signed up Mr Davies to design, manufacture and supply an exclusive women's wear collection for M&amp;S. The range will be launched in October across 100 M&amp;S stores and will be merchandised in a specially designed part of the shop. The range will carry low price-tags, in an attempt to help M&amp;S compete with competitively priced high street rivals. The new brand will be aimed at women in their 20s and 30s. The lower pricing and younger target audience will distinguish the range from M&amp;S's upmarket designer label Autograph, which was launched last autumn. It is not known what Mr Davies's new M&amp;S brand will be called. \"I have always been an admirer of Marks &amp; Spencer and the quality of its products. I passionately believe in this business,\" he said. However, last November Mr Davies took a very different line in a Sunday Telegraph interview, saying he \"had not had one conversation with M&amp;S - and I won't\". \"I would not go to M&amp;S. I am not that sort of person - it's too corporate,\" he added. Mr Davies's change of heart may have come about because he has been able to reach a deal with M&amp;S that allows him to set up his own company - of which he will be chief executive - to supply the retailer, rather than work in-house. He is credited with creating a supermarket's first credible clothing range, Asda's George label, in the late 1980s. Prior to that he worked as a designer for Next. Mr Davies was one of a string of senior executives, including chief executive Allan Leighton, who left Asda after US giant Wal-Mart acquired the supermarket chain. He quit in November last year. M&amp;S has been hiring talent from outside the company in a bid to turn its fortunes around. This week the retailer appointed Warehouse managing director Yasmin Yusuf to the new post of creative director. It had already hired Michele Jobling, previously managing director of department store Liberty, to run its children's wear operation.",

      "bodyText": "The head of one of Europe's biggest car makers has attacked the European commission's decision to approve British government aid for the Nissan plant in Sunderland. Jean-Martin Folz, the president of PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, described the decision as shocking and bizarre. Speaking ahead of the opening of the group's new $600m (\u00a3405m) manufacturing complex at Porto Real in Brazil Mr Folz said: \"I am surprised that a company which is making such brilliant results, from what we read in the press, needs such investment subsidy in a plant which is supposed to be one of the most productive in the UK.\" Mr Folz said he could have understood the decision if Nissan had been deliberating between a European Union and a non-EU location for its investment in the production facilities for the new Micra but not when the choice was between two EU countries. \"It is really bizarre, shocking.\" Mr Folz is also unhappy that the EC is planning reform of the block exemption under which car distribution within the EU is exempt from some of the competition provisions of the Treaty of Rome. The existing block exemption is due to expire next year and competition commissioner Mario Monti has said he wants to put the customer in the driving seat. But Mr Folz said manufacturers and dealers had both said the current system was the right one and that \"independent poll evidence\" showed that consumers agreed. \"All the stakeholders have said they are very satisfied with the present situation. I hope the commission will listen to the opinion of concerned people and not to self proclaimed representative organisations,\" he said. Peugeot's Ryton plant in the UK is currently working three shifts producing the popular 206 hatchback which will provide it with a secure future for the next few years. The key to PSA's commitment to UK manufacturing will come at the end of 2003. \"At that time we have to make a strategic decision [over whether to invest \u00a3100m in a new paint shop],\" Mr Folz said. At the time the exchange rate between the pound and the euro and the relationship between sterling and the single currency \"will be something we will be considering at that time\". Speaking at the official opening of the Porto Real plant - situated in the countryside between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo - Mr Folz said that PSA was aiming for global sales of 3m vehicles this year. The new plant, which shares a site with suppliers that will provide 60% of its component requirements, is already producing the Citro\u00ebn Picasso and production of the Peugeot 206 is due to start in a few months time. The investment in Porto Real reflects PSA's determination to bolster its market share in Latin America's Mercosur's trade zone in general and Brazil in particular. PSA is looking for sales in Brazil of 45,000 this year, which would give the group a 3.6% market share. \"While these figures are still modest, our ambition is to become a major player by quickly increasing sales to more than 100,000.\" \u0095Mazda will not reverse its decision to shift some production to Europe now that the euro is strengthening against the yen, Mark Fields, the firm's president, said yesterday. The Ford Motor affiliate said in November it would start producing 100,000 sub-compact cars a year at a Ford plant in Europe from 2003 to reduce the impact of the strengthening yen on its export earnings. Since then the euro has risen sharply but Fields said neither Mazda's profit forecast nor its plans to shift production had changed.",

The computer games group has restructured its UK and European marketing departments following yesterday's announcement it is to stop making the Dreamcast console. Ms Turner has been promoted to head of European marketing, Sega Europe. She replaces Mr Stern, who left Sega after less than six months in the job. The UK director of marketing role has been axed and the UK and European marketing departments have been consolidated under Ms Turner. A Sega spokesman said the Dreamcast announcement has resulted in redundancies across the company. Marketing operations have been affected but he was unable to confirm how many people were involved. \"Sega Europe is restructuring its business to enable it to go forward with a focus on software. This has led to a number of job losses, which are to be regretted,\" he said. \"Sega Europe is a now a leaner and fitter company that is ready for the challenge ahead.\" Sega Europe is without a creative advertising agency at present. Bartle Bogle Hegarty resigned the \u00a360m pan-European account in December in order to work on rival games console Microsoft Xbox. The Sega spokesman said the company was talking to creative agencies about an advertising brief for the company's software products. The company will continue to produce software for various platforms, including consoles, PDAs, mobile phones and TV set-top boxes. Carat handles the company's media buying.",

      "bodyText": "The monthly magazine is a ballsy Taurus Bull (coverdated May 1 1994), with an opposition of the Sun to over-the-top Jupiter in the sex and money signs of Taurus and Scorpio. The Moon, symbol of women, is placed next to outrageous Uranus, targeting the mag defiantly against New Nappy Man and marking the end of political correctness. Loaded Man is shown by macho Mars in Aries, packed with testosterone but isolated and oddly disconnected from all the other planets in the horoscope. Full of balls, he's always coming but doesn't know where he's going. Founder James Brown and his gang caught the 90s mood and had a runaway success. However, the unsustainable rebel stance has gone limp and Brown now thinks the men's magazine sector, including Loaded, has become \"stale\" and \"embarrassing\". New editor Keith Kendrick is a forceful Aquarian (January 30 1964), full of ideas, principles and prejudices and, with a strong Mars himself, he loves a fight. He has great connections with the mag and his crusading, visionary Jupiter on its Mars allows him to give Loaded Man a purpose in life, beyond bonking. Kendrick was worth the year-long wait to find a new editor and, given a big advertising campaign, he'll soon get Loaded talked about again. But there is a downside shown in an uncanny parallel between the two horoscopes. Both Kendrick and Loaded get hit this coming year by Mercury's progressed opposition to Pluto. Mercury is the communications planet and Pluto symbolises the underworld, the realm of Hades. In mythology, he is a god of rape and hidden desire and represents the shadowy side of man's bestial instincts. According to astrologer Howard Sasportas, this Mercury-Pluto combination stirs up primitive instincts and brings \"overwhelming sexual images, powerful aggressive urges, angry and destructive thoughts and impulses. \"Pluto grips the mind and draws forth images and thoughts that we have usually managed to keep hidden or have previously denied were there.\" (The Gods of Change). As Mr Kendrick gropes around for something more substantial than men behaving badly, he'll feel the pressure to shake taboos and be daring, provocative and rude - and he's got to risk making his current readers uncomfortable. One way he could give Loaded more impact would be to evoke Pluto as the planet of psychology and poke around in the murky depths of what makes Loaded Man tick - cute little motifs such as masturbation, castration and Oedipus (mother fucking). But however Mr Kendrick deals with the scary issue of the male shadow, expect controversy this summer. Email the Media Medium at maggie@companyguide.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Lise has a sweet smile and wide eyes - and she wants to make it easier for her fellow countrymen and women to adapt to the biggest currency changeover they have ever seen. ''L'euro est plus facile ensemble'' - the euro is easier together - she says. Lise's pretty pre-teen face and encouraging message have been splashed all over newspapers and TV screens in France in the last few days, the first sign of the ambitious advertising campaigns getting under way as euroland prepares for the big day. The timetable is clear - and immutable: euro notes and coins go into circulation in just under 11 months, next January 1, and there is much hard work to be done before then. Everyone knows that their deutschemarks, francs, lira, guilders, drachmas, pesetas and schillings will be disappearing for good. But over 300m people in 12 countries must also get used to the fact that what has been a \"virtual'' currency since January 1999, used only for paper financial transactions, is about to become the real thing. And real means the staggering 15bn banknotes and 56bn coins which will have been shipped to banks and retail outlets by December 15 and will be in full use a fortnight later. Yet there is still far too little understanding of this enormous change. ''Surveys show that public knowledge of the euro is improving,'' Pedro Solbes, the European commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs, said this week.''But many people still have only a vague idea about the actual changeover timetable. And most consumers have still not begun to acquaint themselves with the new scale of values. To remedy this, far more information will have to be made available.'' In Frankfurt, European central bank officials agree, but are careful to emphasise the distinction between the role of the euro system - the ECB plus the 12 national central banks - and that of national governments. ''National campaigns are addressing more political themes in the sense that they are selling the euro to their population and trying to foster confidence,'' said one. ''The Euro System is focussing on a product - the banknotes and coins. The scope of these two messages is quite different.'' Here is snapshot of how the information is being conveyed to ordinary people 333 days before E-Day. In Germany, euroland's largest member, the euro action committee began its campaign in December with its central message that ''real values will prevail'' scheduled to increase in intensity in a five stage campaign throughout the year. Plans include newspaper adverts, TV spots, a ''euro-tent'' tour, a telephone hotline and internet sites. Ireland, one of the zone's smallest economies, is having an advertising campaign on the theme ''one year to go.'' People are being encouraged to use up hoarded coins before what is being dubbed Changeover Day. In the Netherlands - which has the best euro website of the 12 - information efforts double this year compared to 2001. Campaigns will focus on the dual display of prices, characteristics of the new notes and coins and guidelines on how to act in the period of dual circulation. Special programmes are being prepared for the mentally handicapped and ethnic minorities. Italy has concentrated on a TV campaign using actors struggling with euro calculations in ''normal'' daily situations. In one sketch a man flirts with a pretty shop assistant while his wife waits outside. And the public are being encouraged to learn an easy conversion formula - ''take out the zeros, divide by two, and there you are.'' Soccer games are to be used to explain basic issues. In Belgium an operation to collect hoarded national coins will be conducted from October 15 to November 15. Everything, of course, has to be published in both French and Dutch. Portuguese are using touch screens for euro information and there are campaigns tailored specially for schools and the tourist industry. The Lisbon underground has done its own dedicated work. Some of the 12 euroland countries are more advanced than others. France's slick publicity campaign, run by the Publicis group, puts it at the top of the preparations league: all civil servants are due to be paid in euros from July 3. And since last month all electricity and gas invoices have been detailed in euros only - though the total is still in dual display. Finland is placing special emphasis on small and medium enterprises - identified by Mr Solbes as the key problem everywhere: one in every three believes it is too early to make preparations and has not worked out how the changeover will affect them. Ominously for Finnish consumers, tabloid newspapers have already rounded up their prices from five to six markka -the exchange value of the euro. Right across euroland there is a recognition that a smooth transition is vital for political reasons and thus that the millions of citizens for whom the whole thing is still a distant nightmare must be helped to master the intricacies ahead. ''Conversion to the euro remains an abstract notion in the minds of many,'' admitted the French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, as he launched little Lise's face across the land. ''Our intention is to make each of us feel concerned.''

The archduke would still have been assassinated in Sarajevo in June 1914, but instead of the meagre 15-minute funeral ceremony which Emperor Francis Joseph then ordained, there would instead have been a full gathering of the crowned heads of Europe. They, while consoling the old man, would have backed Austria's demands on Serbia, or in some other way arrived at a solution to the problem.</p> <p>Hence, perhaps, no first world war and no second world war, but instead a long period of order and democratic evolution. Coming to our times, Prince Charles might have contemplated marriage with a Hohenzollern princess. If such a different century had happened, given the energy and capacity for growth that Germany had shown before 1914, it would have been a \"German century\" marked not by conflict and destruction, but by economic success and by a hegemony peacefully achieved.</p> <p>The Germany of today cannot be blamed for occasionally musing that what did not happen in the 20th century might still in some way be possible in the 21st. The other European states, however, spent the same years protecting themselves against German power, and the habits of the past are not easily set aside. Such shades do still loiter behind the arras when France and Germany debate today's issues of reform and change in the European union, or when Britain considers joining the common currency. Of course, Germany's recent pressure for a constitutional definition of powers in the union is not a bid for dominance in Europe. Yet the combination of Germany's economic prowess and Germany's reforming instincts in Europe do give other countries cause for concern.</p> <p>The reason is that Germany, alone among European states, has nothing to lose in advocating a more federal union. Germany has the largest population in Europe, and generates a third of the eurozone's gross product. Its corporations are embarking on a new phase of expansion in this continent and in North America characterised both by much friction and by large ambitions. It is the dominant outside economic power in eastern Europe, where local firms fall to its investors every month.</p> <p>France is economically vigorous as well, and Britain and other countries are not wholly out of the race, but Germany's greater weight is clear. Germany is reorganising its armed forces and will, in the not too distant future, be able to match French and British military capacities. The simple point in this is that the most powerful member of a federation is not often outvoted or outclassed. Its derogation of powers to the supranational level is more nominal than real, since it will frequently get its way at the centre without great difficulty. Indeed, its power may well be enhanced by federation.</p> <p>The German demand for extra votes for Germany at the Nice summit, a demand that was only headed off by other concessions that also give Germany a numerical advantage in European decision-making, dramatised these issues. At the same time as Germany argued for constitutional changes, it tried to ensure that, when those changes came, it would be in a strong position to win most of the arguments.</p> <p>If one was to be completely cynical about the German line on the definition of powers, it might be said that the aim is to reserve to Germany the powers it deems essential to keep under absolutely full control while arranging to dominate the use of the powers that Germany and all the rest of us would pass to European institutions. The truth, no doubt, is more middling: European idealism and the German left's tradition of anchoring German power within a containing European framework play as much a part as any calculation of self-interest.</p> <p>Yet Joschka Fischer and Chancellor Schr\u00f6der have not been shrewd or considerate in their timing. Schr\u00f6der's sudden enthusiasm for his foreign minister's views, from which he earlier preserved a certain distance, suggests a lurching quality to Germany's policy-making. France is already deep into the campaign for this year's local and next year's general elections, a campaign in which Lionel Jospin and Jacques Chirac will both try to steer a delicate course on European matters. Britain also faces an election in which Europe will be an issue, to be followed (assuming a Labour victory) by a referendum on the euro. Other members of the union have their special difficulties. Not the moment, perhaps, at which to stir the pot.</p> <p>But this is not how Germans see the problem, which arises instead, as Gunther Nonnenmacher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung puts it, from the \"fixed fundamental beliefs\" of the French political class. These beliefs are that the union provides a structure within which French rivalry with Germany can be peacefully pursued with the aim of ensuring \"precedence over Germany or at least equal status\". Nonnenmacher adds that France seems equally disturbed when Germany fails to lead as when it tries to do so.</p> <p>Other members of the union might not disagree with that thumbnail sketch of French attitudes. What can be held against both countries is their failure to grasp the alienating effect on others of their continuing pre-occupation with each other. Even if Germany sees itself as weaning France away from a too exclusive relationship, the effort to do so still leaves other states in the irritating position of onlookers, or being forced to choose sides when they do not wish to do so. French and German leaders came out of their informal summit on Wednesday, supposed to ease the strains of Nice, stressing that the Franco-German relationship was as strong as ever and that the \"deepening\" of Europe was a joint priority. What that means, if anything, we will wait to see, but French and German differences have surely not disappeared this week over a few plates of foie gras and choucroute in Strasbourg.</p> <p>The European story is a strange one. Every day we argue the merits of various schemes of governance that will make Europe more united, and every day we demonstrate a refusal to arrive at common policies in everything from the regulation of telecommunications to relations with Iraq. Javier de Solana, in charge of Europe's common foreign and security policy, complained recently that we either cannot arrive at one or, when we do, that it is so \"over-negotiated\" as to be useless.</p> <p>It might be deemed sensible to try to achieve an informal unity of policy before trying to impose unity institutionally, and that is the main objection to Germany's present approach. That, and the fact that it is less selfless than it appears. If German leaders were to admit that the federal path is significantly easier for them to take than it is for others, more honest discussions might then be possible.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It is the dominant outside economic power in eastern Europe, where local firms fall to its investors every month. France is economically vigorous as well, and Britain and other countries are not wholly out of the race, but Germany's greater weight is clear. Germany is reorganising its armed forces and will, in the not too distant future, be able to match French and British military capacities. The simple point in this is that the most powerful member of a federation is not often outvoted or outclassed. Its derogation of powers to the supranational level is more nominal than real, since it will frequently get its way at the centre without great difficulty. Indeed, its power may well be enhanced by federation. The German demand for extra votes for Germany at the Nice summit, a demand that was only headed off by other concessions that also give Germany a numerical advantage in European decision-making, dramatised these issues. At the same time as Germany argued for constitutional changes, it tried to ensure that, when those changes came, it would be in a strong position to win most of the arguments. If one was to be completely cynical about the German line on the definition of powers, it might be said that the aim is to reserve to Germany the powers it deems essential to keep under absolutely full control while arranging to dominate the use of the powers that Germany and all the rest of us would pass to European institutions. The truth, no doubt, is more middling: European idealism and the German left's tradition of anchoring German power within a containing European framework play as much a part as any calculation of self-interest. Yet Joschka Fischer and Chancellor Schr\u00f6der have not been shrewd or considerate in their timing. Schr\u00f6der's sudden enthusiasm for his foreign minister's views, from which he earlier preserved a certain distance, suggests a lurching quality to Germany's policy-making. France is already deep into the campaign for this year's local and next year's general elections, a campaign in which Lionel Jospin and Jacques Chirac will both try to steer a delicate course on European matters. Britain also faces an election in which Europe will be an issue, to be followed (assuming a Labour victory) by a referendum on the euro. Other members of the union have their special difficulties. Not the moment, perhaps, at which to stir the pot. But this is not how Germans see the problem, which arises instead, as Gunther Nonnenmacher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung puts it, from the \"fixed fundamental beliefs\" of the French political class. These beliefs are that the union provides a structure within which French rivalry with Germany can be peacefully pursued with the aim of ensuring \"precedence over Germany or at least equal status\". Nonnenmacher adds that France seems equally disturbed when Germany fails to lead as when it tries to do so. Other members of the union might not disagree with that thumbnail sketch of French attitudes. What can be held against both countries is their failure to grasp the alienating effect on others of their continuing pre-occupation with each other. Even if Germany sees itself as weaning France away from a too exclusive relationship, the effort to do so still leaves other states in the irritating position of onlookers, or being forced to choose sides when they do not wish to do so. French and German leaders came out of their informal summit on Wednesday, supposed to ease the strains of Nice, stressing that the Franco-German relationship was as strong as ever and that the \"deepening\" of Europe was a joint priority. What that means, if anything, we will wait to see, but French and German differences have surely not disappeared this week over a few plates of foie gras and choucroute in Strasbourg. The European story is a strange one. Every day we argue the merits of various schemes of governance that will make Europe more united, and every day we demonstrate a refusal to arrive at common policies in everything from the regulation of telecommunications to relations with Iraq. Javier de Solana, in charge of Europe's common foreign and security policy, complained recently that we either cannot arrive at one or, when we do, that it is so \"over-negotiated\" as to be useless. It might be deemed sensible to try to achieve an informal unity of policy before trying to impose unity institutionally, and that is the main objection to Germany's present approach. That, and the fact that it is less selfless than it appears. If German leaders were to admit that the federal path is significantly easier for them to take than it is for others, more honest discussions might then be possible. martin.woollacott@theguardian.com",

He has never been able to empty his bowel and is fed through a tube, which requires him to be attached to a feeding machine 10 hours a day. </p> <p>Currently in Southampton general hospital, Mr Bond is refusing treatment, but said that if an illiostomy were to be offered to him by Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridgeshire he would consider having it. </p> <p>It is a transplant operation and of the nine people who have undergone it, only two have survived. </p> <p>\"I used to cope,\" Mr Bond told BBC 2's Southern Eye programme. \"But not any more. The decision I made was not to have any more surgery and that would end in dying, which is a gift really, because it would take away the pain.\" </p> <p>Three years ago Mr Bond's system was further weakened by the penicillin-resistant superbug, MRSA, a recurring illness which infects the line in his chest and requires him to undergo operations to remove the tube. He has twice attempted suicide because of the pain. </p> <p>\"Have you ever seen [the film] Aliens?\" he said. \"It's like one of these little creatures inside your stomach trying to pop out. </p> <p>\"The pain is excruciating. Doctors have likened it to that of a woman in labour.\" </p> <p>Mr Bond's mother, Beverley Dodds, said: \"Of course I don't want him to die. But I love him enough to let him die. </p> <p>\"There's just got to be a better way because this is awful.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Half of me wants to give him the [pill] box and say, 'There you are, Dan,' and the other half, as a mum, wants to protect him.\" </p> <p>During the making of the documentary, Mr Bond attempted to kill himself by injecting painkillers down the line in his chest. He became unconscious before he was able to administer a lethal dose. </p> <p>His stepfather Mike, a hostage negotiator, said: \"I am frequently called to incidents where somebody is indicating that they want to end their life. My function is to try to talk them out of it. </p> <p>\"But if somebody genuinely wants to end their life, then I don't think anybody should interfere.\" </p> <p>Sir Ludovic Kennedy, president of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, said: \"This makes a cast-iron case for the decriminalisation of euthanasia. </p> <p>\"Danny has had more than 300 operations. It's terrible that anyone should suffer that. It is the quality of life that is important rather than the length of life. And Danny has no quality of life.\" </p> <p>Mr Bond said: \"I have had no childhood, no teenage years at all. I've always been stuck in a hospital cubicle or in my own room doing nothing. I have had enough.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A 20-year-old man who has undergone 300 operations, including 17 colostomies, to correct a rare bowel disorder, has asked surgeons to let him die rather than risk another failed operation. Danny Bond, who lives in Southampton with his mother and stepfather, has lived in constant pain since being born with chronic pseudo-obstruct, a condition which prevents the nerves between the brain and the bowel communicating. He has never been able to empty his bowel and is fed through a tube, which requires him to be attached to a feeding machine 10 hours a day. Currently in Southampton general hospital, Mr Bond is refusing treatment, but said that if an illiostomy were to be offered to him by Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridgeshire he would consider having it. It is a transplant operation and of the nine people who have undergone it, only two have survived. \"I used to cope,\" Mr Bond told BBC 2's Southern Eye programme. \"But not any more. The decision I made was not to have any more surgery and that would end in dying, which is a gift really, because it would take away the pain.\" Three years ago Mr Bond's system was further weakened by the penicillin-resistant superbug, MRSA, a recurring illness which infects the line in his chest and requires him to undergo operations to remove the tube. He has twice attempted suicide because of the pain. \"Have you ever seen [the film] Aliens?\" he said. \"It's like one of these little creatures inside your stomach trying to pop out. \"The pain is excruciating. Doctors have likened it to that of a woman in labour.\" Mr Bond's mother, Beverley Dodds, said: \"Of course I don't want him to die. But I love him enough to let him die. \"There's just got to be a better way because this is awful.\" She added: \"Half of me wants to give him the [pill] box and say, 'There you are, Dan,' and the other half, as a mum, wants to protect him.\" During the making of the documentary, Mr Bond attempted to kill himself by injecting painkillers down the line in his chest. He became unconscious before he was able to administer a lethal dose. His stepfather Mike, a hostage negotiator, said: \"I am frequently called to incidents where somebody is indicating that they want to end their life. My function is to try to talk them out of it. \"But if somebody genuinely wants to end their life, then I don't think anybody should interfere.\" Sir Ludovic Kennedy, president of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, said: \"This makes a cast-iron case for the decriminalisation of euthanasia. \"Danny has had more than 300 operations. It's terrible that anyone should suffer that. It is the quality of life that is important rather than the length of life. And Danny has no quality of life.\" Mr Bond said: \"I have had no childhood, no teenage years at all. I've always been stuck in a hospital cubicle or in my own room doing nothing. I have had enough.\"",

The plan, called Improving Health in Wales, also confirms that community health councils (CHCs) - the local patient watchdog bodies set to be abolished in England for being outdated - are to be retained. It proposes to freeze prescription charges at current levels and provide free prescriptions and dental checks to all under the age of 25. In England, free prescriptions are available to those under 18 or in full-time education. The initiative effectively creates a two-tier prescription drugs pricing system enforced by postcode which will give young Welsh residents and students a cheaper service to that available in England. The move follows last week's decision by the Scottish executive to use their devolved powers to introduce free personal care for elderly people in residential homes - also in the face of UK government policy. That decision - and the Welsh CHCs decision - will further encourage Westminster MPs and lobby groups who want the UK government to amend its health and social care bill currently going through parliament. UK ministers have refused to budge on providing free personal care for the elderly in long-term care in England and have made it clear they have no intention to reprieve CHCs. A spokesman for the Association of CHCs in England and Wales welcomed the Welsh NHS plan and said Welsh CHCs would expect to have the right to check conditions in English hospitals to which Welsh residents have been referred. Welsh first minister Rhodri Morgan today formally introduced the plan. It has been dubbed as a \"re-launch of the NHS in Wales\" that will transform the health of Welsh people and drive up the quality of NHS services. But the Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents trusts and health authorities in the principality questioned whether the all the proposals would be affordable. \"The cost implications are enormous. Not everything is affordable and politicians will have to bite some very hard budgets over what services they will stop doing in order to afford all this,\" said Welsh confederation director Richard Thomas. The plan abolishes Wales' five health authorities and effectively brings NHS strategic planning under direct control of the Welsh assembly. A raft of initiatives will be introduced to put patients at the centre of health care provision and decision making, and to give local authorities more of a say in health planning. The abolished health authorities' commissioning role will taken on by GP-led local health groups - the Welsh equivalent of English primary care groups. The plan also heralds the closure of \"traditional\" local hospitals and their replacement with new forms of secondary care provision.

      "body": "<p>In his hour of need Peter Mandelson may be conspicuously short of political friends on the Labour benches at Westminster. But, even among his foes, he does not lack conspiracy-minded colleagues who believe he was set up for last week's precipitous fall from power.</p> <p>As Labour MPs head for their constituencies nine days after the Northern Ireland secretary's resignation they take with them a spread of theories as to who pushed Mr Mandelson - and why?</p> <p>A cock-up or a plot? Some of Mr Mandelson's sworn enemies think his resignation must mean there is more Hinduja-related skulduggery to emerge from Sir Anthony Hammond's inquiry. Others think he was stitched up. Either version makes better sense than what is currently known.</p> <p>The prime minister's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, started out as the conspiracy theorists' prime suspect on Wednesday January 24, the day of the resignation. But as the drama unfolded the focus of attention shifted to the Home Office, specifically to Jack Straw and his octopus-like entourage. This weekend, as Mr Mandelson broods on his fate, it is swinging back again.</p> <p>Last Wednesday it was the Downing Street spokesman whose candid 11am briefing alerted startled reporters to the fact that Mr Mandelson was already astride a horse with a noose around his neck, awaiting only Tony Blair's pat on the horse's rump. It came when he faced TV crews at 1.33pm.</p> <p>The immediate conspiracy theory was that, in the fight for Blair's ear, Mr Campbell had seen his chance to finish off his old-friend-but-most-serious-rival. Mr Mandelson had been forced out once for a lack of candour over Geoffrey Robinson's \u00a3373,000 loan, then allowed back after 10 months. He could not be allowed to embarrass Tony again.</p> <p>Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's chief of staff, was present at the \"kangaroo court\" which decided that Mr Mandelson must go. So was Derry Irvine, lord chancellor and Tony Blair's old legal patron, a clumsy politician but forceful. Both are unelected, some MPs note.</p> <p>Whatever the details (or the threats from his lawyers) both sides agree that Mr Mandelson had been guilty of a series of misjudgments in dealing with the Observer's January 20 inquiries about the Hinduja passport application, with Mr Campbell in the succeeding 48 hours and - by implication - with Mr Blair.</p> <p>In short, unless Mr Mandelson was right to say he could not remember the June 1998 phone call to Mike O'Brien because it had never taken place, he must have lied. Mr Mandelson wavers on the point: at one stage he was saying that the very fact that civil servants had listened in proved he had nothing to hide.</p> <p>But the plot quickly thickened. Once Mr Campbell had told reporters of the error - his friend, Peter, had indeed spoken to Mr O'Brien - and Mr Mandelson had contradicted him publicly on TV on January 23, the man dispatched to get to the bottom of it all was the also unelected cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson.</p> <p>Before he got the top job Wilson was permanent secretary at the Home Office. Though billed as a former Treasury solicitor by Downing Street, Sir Anthony Hammond QC, now in charge of the investigation, was himself legal adviser to the Home Office. Few MPs expect him to prove a better Sherlock Holmes than Sir Richard.</p> <p>Some Labour MPs with ministerial insight into the ways of Whitehall say: \"Peter was a loose cannon on the deck, roaming too far across Whitehall. During his trip to Syria over Christmas he was treated as if he was already foreign secretary. The permanent secretaries, led by Wilson, saw their chance and took it.\"</p> <p>By that theory Mr Straw was their chosen instrument. But was he a conscious agent or an unwitting one? In Mr Mandelson's own version, his ill-judged, rambling account in the Sunday Times (dictated at intervals on the hoof) acknowledges that the home secretary had reminded him of the O'Brien call the previous week.</p> <p>They spoke because Mr Straw wanted to agree what his junior minister, Barbara Roche, should say in her Commons answer to the Lib Dem MP Norman Baker. Mr Straw is usually thought of as straight-acting \"with complete consistency and integrity\" Mandelson wrote.

      "bodyText": "In his hour of need Peter Mandelson may be conspicuously short of political friends on the Labour benches at Westminster. But, even among his foes, he does not lack conspiracy-minded colleagues who believe he was set up for last week's precipitous fall from power. As Labour MPs head for their constituencies nine days after the Northern Ireland secretary's resignation they take with them a spread of theories as to who pushed Mr Mandelson - and why? A cock-up or a plot? Some of Mr Mandelson's sworn enemies think his resignation must mean there is more Hinduja-related skulduggery to emerge from Sir Anthony Hammond's inquiry. Others think he was stitched up. Either version makes better sense than what is currently known. The prime minister's press secretary, Alastair Campbell, started out as the conspiracy theorists' prime suspect on Wednesday January 24, the day of the resignation. But as the drama unfolded the focus of attention shifted to the Home Office, specifically to Jack Straw and his octopus-like entourage. This weekend, as Mr Mandelson broods on his fate, it is swinging back again. Last Wednesday it was the Downing Street spokesman whose candid 11am briefing alerted startled reporters to the fact that Mr Mandelson was already astride a horse with a noose around his neck, awaiting only Tony Blair's pat on the horse's rump. It came when he faced TV crews at 1.33pm. The immediate conspiracy theory was that, in the fight for Blair's ear, Mr Campbell had seen his chance to finish off his old-friend-but-most-serious-rival. Mr Mandelson had been forced out once for a lack of candour over Geoffrey Robinson's \u00a3373,000 loan, then allowed back after 10 months. He could not be allowed to embarrass Tony again. Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's chief of staff, was present at the \"kangaroo court\" which decided that Mr Mandelson must go. So was Derry Irvine, lord chancellor and Tony Blair's old legal patron, a clumsy politician but forceful. Both are unelected, some MPs note. Whatever the details (or the threats from his lawyers) both sides agree that Mr Mandelson had been guilty of a series of misjudgments in dealing with the Observer's January 20 inquiries about the Hinduja passport application, with Mr Campbell in the succeeding 48 hours and - by implication - with Mr Blair. In short, unless Mr Mandelson was right to say he could not remember the June 1998 phone call to Mike O'Brien because it had never taken place, he must have lied. Mr Mandelson wavers on the point: at one stage he was saying that the very fact that civil servants had listened in proved he had nothing to hide. But the plot quickly thickened. Once Mr Campbell had told reporters of the error - his friend, Peter, had indeed spoken to Mr O'Brien - and Mr Mandelson had contradicted him publicly on TV on January 23, the man dispatched to get to the bottom of it all was the also unelected cabinet secretary, Sir Richard Wilson. Before he got the top job Wilson was permanent secretary at the Home Office. Though billed as a former Treasury solicitor by Downing Street, Sir Anthony Hammond QC, now in charge of the investigation, was himself legal adviser to the Home Office. Few MPs expect him to prove a better Sherlock Holmes than Sir Richard. Some Labour MPs with ministerial insight into the ways of Whitehall say: \"Peter was a loose cannon on the deck, roaming too far across Whitehall. During his trip to Syria over Christmas he was treated as if he was already foreign secretary. The permanent secretaries, led by Wilson, saw their chance and took it.\" By that theory Mr Straw was their chosen instrument. But was he a conscious agent or an unwitting one? In Mr Mandelson's own version, his ill-judged, rambling account in the Sunday Times (dictated at intervals on the hoof) acknowledges that the home secretary had reminded him of the O'Brien call the previous week. They spoke because Mr Straw wanted to agree what his junior minister, Barbara Roche, should say in her Commons answer to the Lib Dem MP Norman Baker. Mr Straw is usually thought of as straight-acting \"with complete consistency and integrity\" Mandelson wrote. Yet Labour critics of his proudly-illiberal stance on civil liberty say that he has also misled the Commons. Mr Blair himself is notoriously slack with mere facts at question time. After all, say the Westminster conspiracy theorists, Mr Straw wants to be foreign secretary, the post Mr Mandelson coveted until recently, and possibly prime minister. It also happens that Keith Vaz, a fellow barrister, shares his legal chambers, it emerged last night. If the Home Office granted the Hindujas their UK passports, despite their unsavoury reputations in India, it might be wise to deflect whatever scandal looms. Who better to take the hit than Mr Mandelson, a man famously short of friends on the backbenches ? One shrewd Labour MP said this week that Mr Mandelson reminded him of Al Capone. \"We all know he went to jail for tax evasion, but that tax evasion wasn't the real reason.\" Robert Harris, the fallen minister's novelist friend, thinks that Captain Dreyfus, the French-Jewish officer jailed for treason in 1894, is a better parallel. As with the suggestion that homophobia lay behind the fall, both comparisons are extravagant. But the questions which hover over the affair will not be resolved easily by secrecy-minded Whitehall investigators on the eve of an election. That is why Mr Mandelson and his allies are fighting in public. For once the prince of darkness fears the dark. And he should know.

The MPs asked for the the two cases to be forwarded to prosecutors for possible criminal proceedings. More than 10,000 demonstrators marched through Jakarta to the parliament, demanding clean government and a clear reform agenda. The parliament's deputy chairman said the memorandum to Mr Wahid stated that he had violated his oath of office and a decree on main taining clean government. The president has three months to reply to the memorandum and improve his performance. If MPs are still dissatisfied at the end of April they can issue a second warning, after which he will have 30 days to change. If he has not done so, a vote to remove him can be held.

Mr Wahid's party has only 10% of the seats, the PDIP is the biggest party, with 35%. \"We're mandated by our constituency to uphold the law and the constitution, so we should not tolerate any corruption,\" Laksamana Sukardi, who read out the PDIP's stance on the financial scandals, said. The military representatives in the parliament also voted against Mr Wahid. \"This is a matter of morality and we have to take a stance,\" General Hari Sabarno said. A four-month parliamentary investigation found that Mr Wahid \"could be suspected of playing a role\" in his masseur's the theft of \u00a32.75m from the state logistics agency. It also said he had been deliberately inconsistent in explaining how he spent a \u00a31.4m gift from the Sultan of Brunei, which was intended for social welfare.",

      "bodyText": "Germany, the frontline of the US military presence in Europe during the cold war, will confront the new American defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, in Munich tomorrow about Washington's plans to build a national missile defence system (NMD). The Germans are particularly worried that the Pentagon may ask its European allies come under an extended missile shield. One senior official in Berlin called it a \"poisoned chalice\". At an annual conference on security policy, Mr Rumsfeld, a cold war hawk and now a proselytiser for NMD, will come face to face with a formidable coalition of European leaders apprehensive about the proposed system. It will be lead by a German delegation expected to include Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, his foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, and the defence minister, Rudolf Scharping. The French defence minister, Alain Richard, and Russia's influential national security adviser, Sergei Ivanov, who is strongly opposed to the US missile project, are also due to attend tomorrow's conference. Mr Rumsfeld can expect a more sympathetic hearing from the Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, and the British defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, who is known to be more favourably inclined towards the US project than many of his European counterparts. Opposition to the NMD-nicknamed \"son of Star Wars\" - is not the only potential source of tension in Munich this weekend. Europe is nervously awaiting the response of President Bush's team to its plan to set up a common European defence force. Berlin is afraid that a tough line from Washington, which is suspicious that European force ocould undermine Nato, together with mounting tension caused by the NMD, could prompt the worst crisis in US-European relations in decades. The Germans will tell Mr Rumsfeld that they have a list of questions about the efficacy and impact of the proposed anti-missile shield. The first is whether the system, designed to protect America against attack from so-called \"rogue\" states such as Iran, Iraq and North Korea, would be extended to cover Europe - and, if so, at what price. Senior foreign policy advisers in Berlin fear that the huge cost of development could make NMD unpopular with highly taxed European electorates. \"How would we explain to the German people why we are spending millions on NMD rather than on health or the environment?\" a senior German diplomat asked. There is also concern that a wider missile system could be used by the US to argue that a separate European defence force was unnecessary. An offer to extend NMD to Europe would probably be accompanied by an invitation to include European firms in the project's development and manufacture. But German officials said they expected the core technology to be retained by the Americans. In 1983, a German delegation visited the United States to gauge the extent to which German firms might benefit from inclusion in the earlier \"Star Wars\" scheme proposed by Ronald Reagan's presidency. They returned unconvinced of the spin-off benefits, officials said. The NMD project was raised when Tony Blair and Mr Schr\u00f6der dined in Berlin earlier this, though details of their conversation were not made public. In the absence of a joint European foreign policy - a lack much lamented in German political circles - Mr Schr\u00f6der and his cabinet are prepared to voice their objections unilaterally. Senior advisers to the German government are warning that the missile plan could prompt China in particular to develop something similar and defray the vast cost by selling the technology to some of the states against which NMD is directed. The Germans' other prime objection is that the system would undermine international arms-control treaties.",

      "body": "<p>The Global Mars, an ageing, modest-sized tanker bound for India with 6,000 tonnes of palm oil products, was making good time.</p> <p>After 20 hours of watching her bow cut a path from Port Kelang in Malaysia through the busy waters of the Malacca Strait, the Burmese pilot's focus had begun to waver. He had already weaved his way through the 200-odd commercial vessels that ply the 500-mile waterway daily.</p> <p>As night fell he continued north-west at 12 knots into the Andaman Sea, off the coast of Thailand. The strait's narrowest passage, where most of Asia's pirates lurk, had long dipped below the horizon. The 17 other members of the crew were relaxing in their cabins.</p> <p>Silently, an unlit fishing vessel glided up to the stern. A masked man threw a shrouded grappling hook over the rail and clambered aboard, lowering a rope to the many waiting hands below.</p> <p>Within minutes the pirates, masked and armed with guns and metre-long swords, had rounded up the 18 startled sailor, bound and blindfolded them, and transferred them to the hold of the waiting boat.</p> <p>There they remained for 11 day while their captors anchored the Global Mars at sea, repainted her, renamed her Bulawan, and sailed her into a preselected port, carrying forged identity papers and flying a Honduran flag, to unload 3,500 tonnes of their booty. It was the kind of a professionalism exhibited only by organised crime syndicates.</p> <p>On the 12th day the crew were dumped into an open boat and set adrift with minimal rations. After five days in the Andaman Sea they were found off the coast of Phuket.</p> <p>Horrifying though their ordeal may have been, they were fortunate. Last year 72 crew and passengers were killed in pirate attacks, 40 of them in south-east Asia, according to the International Maritime Bureau's annual report on piracy, released today. Twenty six people are missing.</p> <p>Piracy rose by 56% last year to 469 incidents, of which 119 were reported in Indonesian waters, hostages being taken in 46 of the latter incidents.</p> <p>Even those attacks which do not result in loss of life or hostage-taking are becoming increasingly violent, the IMB's deputy director, Capt Jayant Abhyankar, said.</p> <p>\"These pirates are extremely brutal. They terrorise the crews, beat them, shoot them and lock them up for long periods, during which they are in constant fear for their lives.\"</p> <p>On the Global Mars, when one of the crew locked himself in his cabin the pirates fired shots into the air, telling him they would continue killing his mates if he did not come out.</p> <p>A spokesman for the cruise company Maersk-Sealands said: \"We have had some incidents with charters in south-east Asia in the past. Our scheduling is now arranged to make sure all our vessels only arrive and depart during daylight, to eliminate the risk of having to anchor outside ports, waiting for pilots.\"</p> <p>Pirates struck 75 times in the Malacca Strait last year, compared with two the year before. It makes an inviting target: 90% of Malaysia's trade by volume traverses through it and it is 1,000 miles shorter than alternative routes from the Persian Gulf to the Pacific. Its 2,700 miles of coastline is pock-marked with bays, inlets and tributaries that make perfect hideouts</p> <p>Some experts believe that changes in regional economics drove piracy from its mid-1990s hotbed in the HLH triangle (Hong Kong-Luzon-Hainan Island) further south into and around the straits.</p> <p>\"The aftereffects of the financial crisis was definitely a factor in the rise of piracy in south-east Asia,\" said David Tan, executive director of the Singapore Shipping Association. \"Indonesia's ongoing political instability has not allowed it to recover from that as quickly as some of its northern neighbours.\"</p> <p>The global liberalisation of trade has also had some influence, by reducing the demand for some black-market goods, Capt Abhyankar said.</p> <p>Because smuggling has become less profitable, the crime syndicates which used to control the waterways jealously have moved on, allowing petty criminals to flourish.</p> <p>In May, four months after the Global Mars was hijacked, the Bulawan was found anchored off Zhuhai, southern China. The authorities, tipped of by the IMB, arrested the 11 Filipinos and nine Burmese nationals on board, but just as promptly released them. They said there was no evidence of any offence being committed in Chinese waters, despite an array of munitions on board.</p> <p>This, Capt Abhyankar said, illustrates the problems faced by the IMB. There are jurisdictional hurdles to overcome before prosecuting, and some countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, have no laws governing piracy.</p> <p>\"Piracy is a growing problem and very difficult to prosecute,\" he said. \"The UN has said it may get involved, we hope they do. It may be time for the security council to have a look at this.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Global Mars, an ageing, modest-sized tanker bound for India with 6,000 tonnes of palm oil products, was making good time. After 20 hours of watching her bow cut a path from Port Kelang in Malaysia through the busy waters of the Malacca Strait, the Burmese pilot's focus had begun to waver. He had already weaved his way through the 200-odd commercial vessels that ply the 500-mile waterway daily. As night fell he continued north-west at 12 knots into the Andaman Sea, off the coast of Thailand. The strait's narrowest passage, where most of Asia's pirates lurk, had long dipped below the horizon. The 17 other members of the crew were relaxing in their cabins. Silently, an unlit fishing vessel glided up to the stern. A masked man threw a shrouded grappling hook over the rail and clambered aboard, lowering a rope to the many waiting hands below. Within minutes the pirates, masked and armed with guns and metre-long swords, had rounded up the 18 startled sailor, bound and blindfolded them, and transferred them to the hold of the waiting boat. There they remained for 11 day while their captors anchored the Global Mars at sea, repainted her, renamed her Bulawan, and sailed her into a preselected port, carrying forged identity papers and flying a Honduran flag, to unload 3,500 tonnes of their booty. It was the kind of a professionalism exhibited only by organised crime syndicates. On the 12th day the crew were dumped into an open boat and set adrift with minimal rations. After five days in the Andaman Sea they were found off the coast of Phuket. Horrifying though their ordeal may have been, they were fortunate. Last year 72 crew and passengers were killed in pirate attacks, 40 of them in south-east Asia, according to the International Maritime Bureau's annual report on piracy, released today. Twenty six people are missing. Piracy rose by 56% last year to 469 incidents, of which 119 were reported in Indonesian waters, hostages being taken in 46 of the latter incidents. Even those attacks which do not result in loss of life or hostage-taking are becoming increasingly violent, the IMB's deputy director, Capt Jayant Abhyankar, said. \"These pirates are extremely brutal. They terrorise the crews, beat them, shoot them and lock them up for long periods, during which they are in constant fear for their lives.\" On the Global Mars, when one of the crew locked himself in his cabin the pirates fired shots into the air, telling him they would continue killing his mates if he did not come out. A spokesman for the cruise company Maersk-Sealands said: \"We have had some incidents with charters in south-east Asia in the past. Our scheduling is now arranged to make sure all our vessels only arrive and depart during daylight, to eliminate the risk of having to anchor outside ports, waiting for pilots.\" Pirates struck 75 times in the Malacca Strait last year, compared with two the year before. It makes an inviting target: 90% of Malaysia's trade by volume traverses through it and it is 1,000 miles shorter than alternative routes from the Persian Gulf to the Pacific. Its 2,700 miles of coastline is pock-marked with bays, inlets and tributaries that make perfect hideouts Some experts believe that changes in regional economics drove piracy from its mid-1990s hotbed in the HLH triangle (Hong Kong-Luzon-Hainan Island) further south into and around the straits. \"The aftereffects of the financial crisis was definitely a factor in the rise of piracy in south-east Asia,\" said David Tan, executive director of the Singapore Shipping Association. \"Indonesia's ongoing political instability has not allowed it to recover from that as quickly as some of its northern neighbours.\" The global liberalisation of trade has also had some influence, by reducing the demand for some black-market goods, Capt Abhyankar said. Because smuggling has become less profitable, the crime syndicates which used to control the waterways jealously have moved on, allowing petty criminals to flourish. In May, four months after the Global Mars was hijacked, the Bulawan was found anchored off Zhuhai, southern China. The authorities, tipped of by the IMB, arrested the 11 Filipinos and nine Burmese nationals on board, but just as promptly released them. They said there was no evidence of any offence being committed in Chinese waters, despite an array of munitions on board. This, Capt Abhyankar said, illustrates the problems faced by the IMB. There are jurisdictional hurdles to overcome before prosecuting, and some countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, have no laws governing piracy. \"Piracy is a growing problem and very difficult to prosecute,\" he said. \"The UN has said it may get involved, we hope they do. It may be time for the security council to have a look at this.\"",

After the Yugoslav army's first combat death last week, Gen Pavkovic rushed to the area. \"The government hoped he would criticise the local commanders but all he did was praise them,\" said a senior Yugoslav journalist in Bujanovac. \"There are serious differences between Pavkovic and Covic, and you cannot exclude the possibility that the army is trying to embarrass the government.\" It is hard to see an early solution, if the current polarisation goes on. Mr Halimi says secession from Serbia and union with Kosovo is not the issue, \"though if talks with the Serb authorities don't succeed, centrifugal forces will go stronger\". He wants the government to open direct talks with the guerrillas. \"Demilitarisation is the most urgent thing. Then we need international monitoring.\" he insists. But the two sides differ over what demilitarisation means. The Albanians want Serb forces to pull out, while the Serbs say it is the guerrillas who must withdraw. K-For peacekeepers are sticking to the rule not to enter the zone, but are tightening up their searches on the Kosovo border. Around 100 Albanians, including one of the guerrilla leaders, have been arrested for entering the area illegally. Some Serb officials want K-For to move into the buffer zone and start joint patrols with the Yugoslav army and police. But the prospect of British and other troops so openly taking sides and being shot at by Albanian guerrillas is reminiscent of Ulster. \"It has big implications,\" says a western diplomat in Belgrade. \"What if someone takes a pot shot at the troops? You have to shoot back.\"",

For the first 10 minutes, however, the characters spend the majority of their screen time discussing the \"Open Source\" approach to computer programming. To the casual moviegoer, this lesson in modern software development seems an educational, yet incongruous, digression in a would-be Hollywood blockbuster. But a glance around the auditorium, at the occasional figures convulsing with pleasure at the mere mention of this internet cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre , and you would realise it's there specifically to tantalise one particular segment of the audience. A demographic sometimes shunned in real life, yet no less appealing to marketing executives and movie studios. The demographic of the nerds. </p> <p>On paper, it makes sense. At the risk of stereotyping this lively and diverse element of the population, they tend to be male, and (if employable) often have a lot of disposable income from their jobs in the hi-tech industries. So, Hollywood figures, they'll more than likely buy into the movie merchandising, the tie-in novelisation, the action figures, and the DVD. </p> <p>Their interests are well known and well understood, and often the kinds of things that are fun to put in films anyway: science fiction, fantasy, special effects, TV shows, cute girls, comic books and superheroes. Their heroes are nerds too: Wayne and Garth, Jay and Silent Bob, Mulder and Scully. If studios play their cards right, more dedicated enthusiasts might spend months posting every single production rumour on internet fan sites and do your advance marketing for you - the Lord of the Rings adaptation is currently benefiting from such attentions. And, as a bonus, they're believed capable of living entirely off the food groups available in the foyer. </p> <p>The tricky bit is finding a property that's new. There have been film versions of most of the superheroes, a fair few of the comic books, and a lot of the big TV shows - culminating in the movie version of The X Files, a film of no interest whatsoever to anyone who hadn't seen the 100 or so preceding episodes. Of course, to maximise a movie's geek appeal, the geekier the subject-matter, the better. (There is some technical distinction between \"geek\" and \"nerd\", one being more insulting than the other - but, like stalactites and stalagmites, no one can remember which way round it goes.) </p> <p>Which leads us, inevitably, to the nerdiest of all nerd activities, a pastime considered so deviantly unfashionable that, as far as I'm aware, not even Stuart Maconie has felt the need to sneer at it in I Love the Seventies. I'm talking about an activity that combines the unwholesomeness of video games with the dullness of extensive rulebooks and old-fashioned dice-rolls. I'm talking about Dungeons and Dragons. </p> <p>For better or worse, Dungeons and Dragons - colloquially abbreviated to \"D&amp;D\" - became the standard bearer for the entire genre of role-playing games (traditionally shortened to \"RPGs\"). Not to be confused with the altogether zanier business of dressing up as medieval characters and running around an old castle (that's \"Live Role-Playing\"), RPGs are considerably more sedentary, involving each player creating a character - an elf or a human, a fighter or a thief - with a range of numerical attributes. This is a process immortalised in satirical newspaper the Onion's story, \"Bill Gates Grants Self 18 Dexterity Points, 20 Charisma\", and their poignant \"Ask a Seventh-Level Magic User\" problem page. The \"Dungeon Master\" then leads the players through a semi-improvised adventure of monster-fighting, treasure-collecting, tavern-brawling and other adolescent diversions, calculating each success or failure with a roll of the 20-sided die. </p> <p>Developed in the 1970s by individuals with names like E Gary Gygax, D&amp;D swept through the teen years of any right-thinking Tolkien-reader in the 1980s. For those awkward RPG-free moments on the way to school, you had your more portable choose-your-own-adventure \"Fighting Fantasy\" novels. D&amp;D had its own terrible animated TV series, and even provoked a scaremongering TV movie called Mazes and Monsters, in which a young and impressionable Tom Hanks became so obsessed with mythological gibberish that he actually believed himself to be \"Keeper of the Graven Eye of Timor\" - a role which Hanks now rarely mentions in interviews. </p> <p>And then, at the height of its powers, D&amp;D died. Beset by increased competition from more sophisticated video games, newer RPGs like the UK's more violent Warhammer, and the general passing of the craze, the D&amp;D licence was sold in 1997 to Wizards of the Coast, owners of the similarly-themed all-conquering card game Magic: The Gathering. While the new film coincides with the release of a new edition of the rules (and is also the result of the first-time writer-director- producer Courtney Solomon's one-man, 10-year odyssey to bring his favourite game to the screen), you've got to ask yourself: isn't releasing a D&amp;D movie now slightly akin to making a film about breakdancing, or skateboarding, or Rubik's Cube? </p> <p>On the other hand, it does have almost all the elements to ensure timeless geek appeal. It boasts Cult actors like Tom \"Dr Who\" Baker and Richard \"Rocky Horror Show\" O'Brien, who seems intent on capitalising on his most famous role, that of host of TV's The Crystal Maze, by bellowing the line \"You finish the maze, you win the prize!\" It has monstrous overacting by a British villain (Jeremy Irons); a cute girl or two, including American Beauty's Thora Birch; plus non-stop swordfights and computer-graphics special effects unlikely to disappoint even the most ardent fans of The Phantom Menace - admittedly, its most likely target audience. </p> <p>What's more, it's still almost a year until the first real Lord of the Rings film gets here - and, let's not forget, it's all about Dungeons and Dragons! But even the most dedicated fans can transform into the most fearsome critics, if scorned. \"Clerics are one of the basic character types in D&amp;D,\" argues James Wallis, a UK-based RPG publisher whose \"Dragonmeet\" convention aims to restore British role-playing to its mid-80s heyday. \"But - there are no clerics in the film!\" </p> <p>Equally alarmingly, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie fails to heed the one rule of all great geek movies - that the viewer should, through their shared, perhaps ridiculed hobby, identify with the protagonist as an everyday, put-upon bullied guy. Take WarGames - a dweeby computer hacker is enrolled to defuse a real-life nuclear conflict (which, admittedly, he accidentally initiated, while trying to impress a girl). The Matrix - a dweeby Keanu Reeves is enlisted by Carrie-Anne Moss to overthrow a real-life cybernetic dystopia. Galaxy Quest - dweeby fans assist the cast of a Star Trek-style TV show enrolled by aliens to battle a real-life . . . well, you get the idea. </p> <p>But the D&amp;D movie isn't about some kids who play D&amp;D and find that the skills they've then acquired turn out to be genuinely useful somehow - it's actually about two thieves, and a princess, and an elf. Still, maybe it's for the best that there are some classic teen-male obsessions - listening to Iron Maiden, building Airfix model aircraft - that can't be cynically marketed into fleetingly fashionable special-effects blockbusters. Sony shamelessly claimed they'd made videogaming socially acceptable by sticking a few Playstations in nightclubs, but no one's ever going to pull off the same trick by getting out their D&amp;D rulebooks and character sheets in the Ministry of Sound. </p> <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons opens on February 16.</p> <p><strong>Nerds to the rescue - Films that were saved by their nerdy fans</strong></p> <p> <strong> Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979)</strong><br>Takings: $82.3m </p> <p>Bold yet flawed attempt to recapture the idealism of the TV series, cancelled a full decade before. Fans of the original series, a cult hit through endless syndication, generated enough interest in Kirk and his increasingly elderly crew to kickstart one of sci-fi's longest-running movie franchises and, ultimately, resurrect the TV format in the form of The Next Generation, Voyager and Deep Space Nine.</p> <p> <strong> War Games (1983)</strong><br>Takings: $79.5m </p> <p>Still regarded as the benchmark for the way computer hacking movies should be done: Matthew Broderick is a pale-looking American high-school kid who stumbles into a secret nuclear-launch computer system. Before being lured into the maw of big-budget monster nonsense like Godzilla and Inspector Gadget, Broderick went on to star in uberteen movie par excellence, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. </p> <p> <strong> Mortal Kombat (1995)</strong><br>Takings: $70m </p> <p>Movie versions of video games often flounder, but Brit director Paul Anderson knew he was on to a winner with a game - and ultimately, a film - consisting of little but what America's film censors described as \"non-stop martial arts action and some violence\". Went on to spawn an almost indistinguishable sequel - the equally unapologetically titled Mortal Kombat: Annihilation - and a spinoff TV show. </p> <p> <strong> Tron (1982)</strong><br>Takings: $33m </p> <p> Surreal Disney showcase for early computer-graphics special effects, partly inspired by the video games and computer hacking crazes of the 1980s. Still revered among the cognoscenti and arguably the most authentic depiction of PC internals to date. Inspired numerous terrible imitations, including the disgraceful Lawnmower Man 2. Disney themselves are believed to be currently working on a sequel, Tron 2.0. </p> <p> <strong> Clerks (1994)</strong><br>Takings: $3.2m </p> <p> Kevin Smith's micro-budget debut captured a dedicated geek fanbase with its Star Wars and comic-book references and affectionate portrait of consumer-store slacker lifestyles. And he's made an effort to stay in touch with them with through his viewaskew.com website - for instance, bemoaning network support for last year's swiftly cancelled Clerks: The Animated Series.</p>",

Which leads us, inevitably, to the nerdiest of all nerd activities, a pastime considered so deviantly unfashionable that, as far as I'm aware, not even Stuart Maconie has felt the need to sneer at it in I Love the Seventies. I'm talking about an activity that combines the unwholesomeness of video games with the dullness of extensive rulebooks and old-fashioned dice-rolls. I'm talking about Dungeons and Dragons. For better or worse, Dungeons and Dragons - colloquially abbreviated to \"D&amp;D\" - became the standard bearer for the entire genre of role-playing games (traditionally shortened to \"RPGs\"). Not to be confused with the altogether zanier business of dressing up as medieval characters and running around an old castle (that's \"Live Role-Playing\"), RPGs are considerably more sedentary, involving each player creating a character - an elf or a human, a fighter or a thief - with a range of numerical attributes. This is a process immortalised in satirical newspaper the Onion's story, \"Bill Gates Grants Self 18 Dexterity Points, 20 Charisma\", and their poignant \"Ask a Seventh-Level Magic User\" problem page. The \"Dungeon Master\" then leads the players through a semi-improvised adventure of monster-fighting, treasure-collecting, tavern-brawling and other adolescent diversions, calculating each success or failure with a roll of the 20-sided die. Developed in the 1970s by individuals with names like E Gary Gygax, D&amp;D swept through the teen years of any right-thinking Tolkien-reader in the 1980s. For those awkward RPG-free moments on the way to school, you had your more portable choose-your-own-adventure \"Fighting Fantasy\" novels. D&amp;D had its own terrible animated TV series, and even provoked a scaremongering TV movie called Mazes and Monsters, in which a young and impressionable Tom Hanks became so obsessed with mythological gibberish that he actually believed himself to be \"Keeper of the Graven Eye of Timor\" - a role which Hanks now rarely mentions in interviews. And then, at the height of its powers, D&amp;D died. Beset by increased competition from more sophisticated video games, newer RPGs like the UK's more violent Warhammer, and the general passing of the craze, the D&amp;D licence was sold in 1997 to Wizards of the Coast, owners of the similarly-themed all-conquering card game Magic: The Gathering. While the new film coincides with the release of a new edition of the rules (and is also the result of the first-time writer-director- producer Courtney Solomon's one-man, 10-year odyssey to bring his favourite game to the screen), you've got to ask yourself: isn't releasing a D&amp;D movie now slightly akin to making a film about breakdancing, or skateboarding, or Rubik's Cube? On the other hand, it does have almost all the elements to ensure timeless geek appeal. It boasts Cult actors like Tom \"Dr Who\" Baker and Richard \"Rocky Horror Show\" O'Brien, who seems intent on capitalising on his most famous role, that of host of TV's The Crystal Maze, by bellowing the line \"You finish the maze, you win the prize!\" It has monstrous overacting by a British villain (Jeremy Irons); a cute girl or two, including American Beauty's Thora Birch; plus non-stop swordfights and computer-graphics special effects unlikely to disappoint even the most ardent fans of The Phantom Menace - admittedly, its most likely target audience. What's more, it's still almost a year until the first real Lord of the Rings film gets here - and, let's not forget, it's all about Dungeons and Dragons! But even the most dedicated fans can transform into the most fearsome critics, if scorned. \"Clerics are one of the basic character types in D&amp;D,\" argues James Wallis, a UK-based RPG publisher whose \"Dragonmeet\" convention aims to restore British role-playing to its mid-80s heyday. \"But - there are no clerics in the film!\" Equally alarmingly, the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie fails to heed the one rule of all great geek movies - that the viewer should, through their shared, perhaps ridiculed hobby, identify with the protagonist as an everyday, put-upon bullied guy. Take WarGames - a dweeby computer hacker is enrolled to defuse a real-life nuclear conflict (which, admittedly, he accidentally initiated, while trying to impress a girl). The Matrix - a dweeby Keanu Reeves is enlisted by Carrie-Anne Moss to overthrow a real-life cybernetic dystopia. Galaxy Quest - dweeby fans assist the cast of a Star Trek-style TV show enrolled by aliens to battle a real-life . . . well, you get the idea. But the D&amp;D movie isn't about some kids who play D&amp;D and find that the skills they've then acquired turn out to be genuinely useful somehow - it's actually about two thieves, and a princess, and an elf. Still, maybe it's for the best that there are some classic teen-male obsessions - listening to Iron Maiden, building Airfix model aircraft - that can't be cynically marketed into fleetingly fashionable special-effects blockbusters. Sony shamelessly claimed they'd made videogaming socially acceptable by sticking a few Playstations in nightclubs, but no one's ever going to pull off the same trick by getting out their D&amp;D rulebooks and character sheets in the Ministry of Sound. Dungeons &amp; Dragons opens on February 16. Nerds to the rescue - Films that were saved by their nerdy fans Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) Takings: $82.3m Bold yet flawed attempt to recapture the idealism of the TV series, cancelled a full decade before. Fans of the original series, a cult hit through endless syndication, generated enough interest in Kirk and his increasingly elderly crew to kickstart one of sci-fi's longest-running movie franchises and, ultimately, resurrect the TV format in the form of The Next Generation, Voyager and Deep Space Nine. War Games (1983) Takings: $79.5m Still regarded as the benchmark for the way computer hacking movies should be done: Matthew Broderick is a pale-looking American high-school kid who stumbles into a secret nuclear-launch computer system. Before being lured into the maw of big-budget monster nonsense like Godzilla and Inspector Gadget, Broderick went on to star in uberteen movie par excellence, Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Mortal Kombat (1995) Takings: $70m Movie versions of video games often flounder, but Brit director Paul Anderson knew he was on to a winner with a game - and ultimately, a film - consisting of little but what America's film censors described as \"non-stop martial arts action and some violence\". Went on to spawn an almost indistinguishable sequel - the equally unapologetically titled Mortal Kombat: Annihilation - and a spinoff TV show. Tron (1982) Takings: $33m Surreal Disney showcase for early computer-graphics special effects, partly inspired by the video games and computer hacking crazes of the 1980s. Still revered among the cognoscenti and arguably the most authentic depiction of PC internals to date. Inspired numerous terrible imitations, including the disgraceful Lawnmower Man 2. Disney themselves are believed to be currently working on a sequel, Tron 2.0. Clerks (1994) Takings: $3.2m Kevin Smith's micro-budget debut captured a dedicated geek fanbase with its Star Wars and comic-book references and affectionate portrait of consumer-store slacker lifestyles. And he's made an effort to stay in touch with them with through his viewaskew.com website - for instance, bemoaning network support for last year's swiftly cancelled Clerks: The Animated Series.",

      "body": "<p>It is a melancholy experience to make someone's acquaintance, be enthralled by his wit and passion, become aware you're watching him waste away, and then have him die on you - all in 80 minutes. That's what happens in Jem Cohen and Peter Sillen's documentary Benjamin Smoke. Benjamin, born Robert Dickerson, was the singer and lyricist for a band called Smoke, hence the movie's title. They recorded two CDs (Another Reason to Fast and Heaven on a Popsicle Stick) and were a local sensation, but they weren't well-known elsewhere. </p> <p>Benjamin, a native of Jonesboro, Georgia, was a speed-freak, a pill-head and a drag queen, as well as a considerable poet and an inspired singer whose deep growl of a voice could slide from rumination to peaks of intensity. The film is not, however, primarily a musical document - and, when they first set out, its makers were not aware how the story would end. \"We just wanted to capture something that we knew was remarkable,\" Cohen said. \"And even before we knew that Benjamin was sick, we knew that it might not last.\" </p> <p>It's clear that one reason Cohen and Sillen started the movie was that they wanted to record Benjamin talking. What we hear is his dry humour delivered in a languorous southern drawl, a non-stop chatter with laugh lines that crest slowly and break somewhere offshore. The talk emerges from a wide mouth set in a cadaverous face. </p> <p>He talks about his life with out regret or inflation. He started fooling around with drag when he was nine, found his destiny as a teenager when he heard Patti Smith's album Horses, went to New York in 1978 - only to spend his time there sweeping up broken glass at the CBGB club. He returned to Georgia and got involved in dozens of bands, from ephemeral punk to something harder to pin down. The story involves tiny audiences, lowdown venues and police raids. </p> <p>There are photographs of Benjamin in drag, looking sleek. Other pictures, ravaged by dampness, have patches of emulsion missing and look contaminated. </p> <p>Benjamin lived in a part of Atlanta called Cabbagetown, once a mill town inhabited by immigrants from Appalachia. The mill closed in the 1970s and the place became a slum. The camera darts outside to the desolate frame houses scattered around the landscape, and to the young people who, in Benjamin's words, \"go to jail early and whose parents use inhalants\", working on their go-karts outside. </p> <p>The place feels lost in time, an outcropping of the 20th century that came unglued somewhere between the Truman and Johnson administrations, and now rattles around like dice in a cup. You get glimpses of faceless downtown Atlanta in the distance, looking like another planet. The atmosphere of Cabbagetown seems a logical extension of Benjamin's presence and the look of his room, with its flea-market panache. It's a scavenger's aesthetic, the unfakeable sort reserved for people with no money, whose only choice is to extract beauty from discards. </p> <p>By the time we see Smoke play together, the music fits right into the prevailing tone of unpremeditated originality, as if it were the only sort of music possible. The line-up consists of cello, banjo doubling on trumpet, guitar and drums. There are rock elements, a sort of blues, and something related to ancient hill ballads, but nothing you could put your finger on. Like certain kinds of Middle Eastern music, it is dominated by a fluid drone that rises occasionally to frantic peaks that are then reabsorbed by the unhurried flow. </p> <p>Benjamin can sound as if he is making the words up, even when he isn't, as he growls, talk-sings, and wanders away from the key. The volume is never high, but an intensity emerges from the emotional concentration. The band members are always seated, as if they need to be. </p> <p>Gradually we realise that Benjamin is in pain. He never says so but, every time he makes a move, the cost is apparent. He has Aids, a matter about which, by his own admission, he is uncharacteristically quiet, because he doesn't want others' impressions of him to be distorted by his disease. The first two-thirds of the picture, which seem to exist in an elastically stretched present tense, give way to urgency and imminence. </p> <p>Cabbagetown itself is changing - you see the signs of doom: the loft conversions, the antique shops. And then Benjamin moves, at his mother's behest, to government-sponsored housing downtown, where he'll be more accessible. He shows the camera his pill-box filled with his dozens of daily doses. He still manages to perform, even fulfilling a dream - opening for Patti Smith in Atlanta. </p> <p>Cohen learned of Benjamin from Michael Stipe of REM, for whom he had made five music videos; Sillen is best-known for documenting another southern singer- songwriter, Vic Chesnutt. The scavenger aesthetic guides their film-making here, as they use bits of film left over from other jobs as well as video and Super-8 film to assemble a patchwork that resembles its subject. Cohen's films are all collages to one degree or another: Lost Book Found, his evocation of vanishing New York; Buried in Light, his harshly lyrical east European travelogue. </p> <p>He will, for example, cut from grainy Super-8 close-up indoor talk to a majestic landscape shot in 35mm but underexposed in a way that suggests it may not be real. You've seen that sort of mix-and-match approach before (Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers comes to mind), but Cohen's use of it is singularly personal. </p> <p>Despite its subject's illness and death (a day after his 39th birthday), the movie is anything but grim. Benjamin's matter-of-fact humour and incredible resilience won't permit the tone to slide toward solemnity or preaching. </p> <p>In the stills of his last performance, weeks before his death, he looks as though he weighs maybe 60lb, some of them accounted for by the slightly askew wig on his head, but his eyes don't look the least bit ready to check out. It is Patti Smith who, some time later, eulogised Benjamin in a poem: </p> <p>With a throat smooth as a lamb </p> <p>Yet dry as a branch not </p> <p>snapping </p> <p>He throws back his head </p> <p>Yet he does not sing a thing </p> <p>mournful. </p> <p>\u00a9 Luc Sant\u00e9.

As a committed sports bigot of many years' standing I skipped the most fascinating Superbowl in ages. The half-time show was a wildly chaotic corporate rock'n'roll affair, with Aerosmith singing Walk This Way, accompanied by a smorgasbord of ill-matched thug-rappers, meat-rack boy bands and silicone-enhanced boy toys like Britney Spears. </p> <p>The Baltimore Ravens ate the New York Giants for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but the man voted most valuable player of the game, Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis, was unfortunately linked last year with a still-unsolved double murder that happened just after the 2000 Superbowl. Usually the MVP gets a much-publicised free trip to Disneyland and his face appears on the new Wheaties box, to be admired by sports nuts at breakfast tables nationwide. Not Ray Lewis though, and I'm crushed that we've been denied the surreal prospect of seeing an accused killer on the nation's emblematic cereal box or taking a spin on Mr Toad's Wild Ride at Uncle Walt's Magic Kingdom. </p> <p>So where was I when all this was unfolding, live and lysergic? I was watching the final awards ceremony of this year's Sundance film festival, the annual jamboree in the Utah Rockies, which affords the opportunity for film-world celebrities, Carmen Electra among them, to pose for photos in a winter-sports setting. The awards were broadcast on - you'll like this - the Sundance Channel. I could have kicked myself when I caught the Superbowl update on the late news. Instead, I'd been watching aghast as the cream of Robert Redford's \"indie\" film world settled into an orgy of ass-kissing and mutual back-slapping. </p> <p>Movies really are coming to resemble national politics. If the real Oscars are the Republican National Convention of the Hollywood calendar, what are the Sundance awards, the self-styled anti-Oscars? Are they like the Reform Party? Or the Green Party? No, they're like the Democratic Party Convention, a spin-doctored, politically pasteurised, pseudo-liberal rearrangement of the same ugly elements: the grovelling, the mendacious \"incredibly talented guy to work with\" garbage, the endless thank-you speeches, the multinational sponsors, the craven supplication before wealth, fame and power, and all the same snouts in all the same troughs. </p> <p>The trouble is, the participants still act as if every breast-beating utterance they make has the revolutionary intensity of a mimeographed communique from the Symbionese Liberation Army or the Weather Underground. The only place one can locate a comparable wellspring of vanity and self-importance is in the interviews of - oh, let's say Robert Redford. </p> <p>To quote the host of the awards show, actor Donal Logue: \"See, this is just what's so great about Sundance. All that matters here are the artists and the movies . . . But moving right along, our Best Documentary award is sponsored by Mercedes-Benz!\" And so on. In its defence, Sundance is a useful forum and marketplace for films and ideas, and has transformed the American cinema, but to style itself the alternative to the mainstream is akin to labelling the Baltic the alternative to the North Sea - it's all the same water. </p> <p>My aversion to it was probably sharpened by my having read a book I can't recommend highly enough to anyone who wants to learn about the generally corrupt overlaps and sweetheart deals between film festivals, distributors, mainstream film critics and allegedly independent film-makers. </p> <p>Jonathan Rosenbaum is the 56-year-old critic for the weekly Chicago Reader and Jean-Luc Godard thinks he's America's best film critic. That's good enough for me. His new book Movie Wars: How Hollywood and the Media Conspire to Limit What Films We Can See (A Cappella Press, Chicago) is as trenchant, perceptive and unfoolable as his reviews over the past three decades. </p> <p>Having attended hundreds of festivals in that time, and having watched as festival press conferences deteriorated from the passionate, obscenity-filled verbal fisticuffs of the 1970s into the castrated photo-ops of today, the man knows whereof he speaks. His father and grandfather also owned a chain of cinemas in southern Alabama, so Rosenbaum saw just about every movie released in his entire childhood for free. Despite feeling he grew up in the golden age of cinema, he won't sit still for the idea that films ain't what they used to be. </p> <p>The great movies are out there, he says, and he knows because he's bothered to see them. It's just that they are being ignored by distributors who think the people won't accept subtitles (tell it to the Crouching Tiger); or that they can re-edit a film into something \"even better\" (hello, Harvey \"Scissorhands\" Weinstein); or that it's OK to buy up twice as many movies as you will distribute, because it keeps them out of the hands of the competition (and of us movie-lovers, too, incidentally - thanks again, Harv). </p> <p> A lso in the way are critics who downplay anything not from Hollywood. Rosenbaum scorns Pauline Kael's isolationist influence on American film criticism, and Janet Maslin's appalling ignorance at the New York Times, where her every utterance was closely scrutinised by distributors. </p> <p>Finally, he questions Hollywood's received wisdom that the audience is stupid and bovine, a contention that all the \"voodoo\" of test-marketing does nothing but reinforce. Audiences have never been so visually sophisticated and cine-literate, and their desire for new thrills can be read into the success of movies such as Crouching Tiger, Being John Malkovich and The Blair Witch Project. Demand isn't the problem: it's the suppliers and their opinion-making lapdogs. We should hate them for treating us like idiots. </p> <p>And we should love Rosenbaum for treating us like people hungry for great cinema, and for eviscerating the multiple corruptions of the \"media-industrial complex\". He's this week's MVP. I say put him on the Wheaties carton.</p>",

No, they're like the Democratic Party Convention, a spin-doctored, politically pasteurised, pseudo-liberal rearrangement of the same ugly elements: the grovelling, the mendacious \"incredibly talented guy to work with\" garbage, the endless thank-you speeches, the multinational sponsors, the craven supplication before wealth, fame and power, and all the same snouts in all the same troughs. The trouble is, the participants still act as if every breast-beating utterance they make has the revolutionary intensity of a mimeographed communique from the Symbionese Liberation Army or the Weather Underground. The only place one can locate a comparable wellspring of vanity and self-importance is in the interviews of - oh, let's say Robert Redford. To quote the host of the awards show, actor Donal Logue: \"See, this is just what's so great about Sundance. All that matters here are the artists and the movies . . . But moving right along, our Best Documentary award is sponsored by Mercedes-Benz!\" And so on. In its defence, Sundance is a useful forum and marketplace for films and ideas, and has transformed the American cinema, but to style itself the alternative to the mainstream is akin to labelling the Baltic the alternative to the North Sea - it's all the same water. My aversion to it was probably sharpened by my having read a book I can't recommend highly enough to anyone who wants to learn about the generally corrupt overlaps and sweetheart deals between film festivals, distributors, mainstream film critics and allegedly independent film-makers. Jonathan Rosenbaum is the 56-year-old critic for the weekly Chicago Reader and Jean-Luc Godard thinks he's America's best film critic. That's good enough for me. His new book Movie Wars: How Hollywood and the Media Conspire to Limit What Films We Can See (A Cappella Press, Chicago) is as trenchant, perceptive and unfoolable as his reviews over the past three decades. Having attended hundreds of festivals in that time, and having watched as festival press conferences deteriorated from the passionate, obscenity-filled verbal fisticuffs of the 1970s into the castrated photo-ops of today, the man knows whereof he speaks. His father and grandfather also owned a chain of cinemas in southern Alabama, so Rosenbaum saw just about every movie released in his entire childhood for free. Despite feeling he grew up in the golden age of cinema, he won't sit still for the idea that films ain't what they used to be. The great movies are out there, he says, and he knows because he's bothered to see them. It's just that they are being ignored by distributors who think the people won't accept subtitles (tell it to the Crouching Tiger); or that they can re-edit a film into something \"even better\" (hello, Harvey \"Scissorhands\" Weinstein); or that it's OK to buy up twice as many movies as you will distribute, because it keeps them out of the hands of the competition (and of us movie-lovers, too, incidentally - thanks again, Harv). A lso in the way are critics who downplay anything not from Hollywood. Rosenbaum scorns Pauline Kael's isolationist influence on American film criticism, and Janet Maslin's appalling ignorance at the New York Times, where her every utterance was closely scrutinised by distributors. Finally, he questions Hollywood's received wisdom that the audience is stupid and bovine, a contention that all the \"voodoo\" of test-marketing does nothing but reinforce. Audiences have never been so visually sophisticated and cine-literate, and their desire for new thrills can be read into the success of movies such as Crouching Tiger, Being John Malkovich and The Blair Witch Project. Demand isn't the problem: it's the suppliers and their opinion-making lapdogs. We should hate them for treating us like idiots. And we should love Rosenbaum for treating us like people hungry for great cinema, and for eviscerating the multiple corruptions of the \"media-industrial complex\". He's this week's MVP. I say put him on the Wheaties carton.",

      "body": "<p>When Serge Gainsbourg died in his bedroom on March 2 1991, a month short of his 63rd birthday, France went into mourning. Brigitte Bardot, who had been his lover, gave a eulogy; President Mitterrand, who wasn't, gave him one too. He was \"our Baudelaire, our Apollinaire\", said the head of state. \"He elevated song to the level of art.\" Flags were flown at half-mast - a less fitting symbol for the priapic pop genius than the bottles of whisky and Pastis and packets of Gitanes cigarettes left as tributes by the crowds who descended, \u00e0 la Princess Di, on the police barricades erected around his home on the Rue de Vernueil. </p> <p>\"Ask anyone in Paris,\" said Nicolas Godin of the French band Air, \"and they can remember what they were doing when they heard Gainsbourg had died. It was such a shock. Because he was always there, part of our culture. He was always on the television doing something crazy. He was a poet. He was a punk. And he wanted to fuck Whitney Houston.\" </p> <p>The man who looked like an elegant turtle cross-bred with a particularly louche, chain-smoking wolf was also a singer, a songwriter, a cutting-edge soundtrack composer, a Eurovision Song Contest winner, novelist, photographer, actor, artist, drunk, director, screenwriter, populist, provocateur, sentimentalist, clown, lover, intellectual, and the man who single-handedly liberated French pop. In spite of - or because of - a singular dedication to cigarettes, alcohol, sensuality and provocation (his infamous \"I want to fuck you\" offer to fellow-guest Houston on a French family TV show combined all four), his musical output over more than three decades was staggering. </p> <p>It encompassed a variety of reinventions that made David Bowie look stereotyped - classical, chanson, jazz, girl-group pop, rock, reggae, disco and funk. He displayed a profound knowledge of, and respect for, tradition, while simultaneously giving it two fingers, then used all these disparate things to make something unique. </p> <p>His lyrics were mind-boggling exercises in Franglais, triple entendres and rhythmic, onomatopoeic word-percussion. Literature, sexual obsession, farting, incest, philosophy, grammar, cabbages, Nazi death camps and the Torrey Canyon disaster were all considered perfectly reasonable subject matter for his songs, which were whistled in the street and printed in poetry books that were studied in universities. And yet on this side of the Channel, Gainsbourg is really known for just one song: his 1969 number one hit with Jane Birkin, Je T'Aime . . . Moi Non Plus. </p> <p>\"There's a trilogy in my life,\" said Gainsbourg, \"an equilateral triangle, shall we say, of Gitanes, alcoholism and girls - and I didn't say isosceles, I said equilateral. But it all comes from the background of a man whose initiation in beauty was art.\" Brigitte Bardot - or BB, as the French call her - was the actress for whom the term \"sex kitten\" was invented. Bardot was signed by Gainsbourg's record company, Philips, in 1962, and she had already released two singles that her labelmate had written before they were both booked to appear on Sacha Distel's primetime Saturday night TV show. It was 1967, two months after the so-called Summer of Love, and Gainsbourg fell for BB mightily. She was, Distel said, \"the dream of Serge's life\". </p> <p>It must have been a dream come true to find that Bardot was attracted to him too, and that their rendezvous should happen just as her second marriage was on the rocks. She invited him to appear on her Le Bardot Show, and what started as a working relationship soon developed into a love affair. It was a discreet one to start with: unlike Gainsbourg, Bardot had a horror of press attention. Initially they met furtively at friends' apartments, but then threw caution to the wind and allowed the paparazzi to snap them at all the top nightspots or in Bardot's convertible Triumph Spitfire (with Bardot at the wheel as Gainsbourg couldn't drive), gliding through a Paris plastered with photos of BB in thigh-high boots and black leather mini-skirt straddling a motorbike - an advertisement for her latest Gainsbourg-penned single, Harley-Davidson. </p> <p>On the Le Bardot Show, the stream of Gainsbourg classics inspired by his new love (or demanded by her producers) were performed by the pair in front of outlandish sets of the cod-psychedelic variety that you only ever saw on 1960s TV shows. For Comic Strip, for instance, Bardot was made up as a black-wigged Barbarella character, surrounded by bright \"comic-book\" balloons bearing \"Zip! Pow! Wiz!\" exclamations. For Bonnie and Clyde, Gainsbourg played the part of Clyde with shoulder-holster and cigarette, while BB, in a long skirt, short wig and beret, was his loyal moll. </p> <p>Bonnie and Clyde was the title track of Gainsbourg and BB's album together, released in 1968. It was one of a pair of songs Gainsbourg had written in the space of a night following a disastrous early date with Bardot. Struck dumb with either nerves or alcohol, his usual wit deserted him, the evening was a flop and he thought he had blown it. But Bardot phoned the next day and demanded as a penance that he write her \"the most beautiful love song you can imagine\". In fact he wrote two - Bonnie and Clyde and Je T'Aime . . . Moi Non Plus. </p> <p>Late one night in the winter of 1967, Gainsbourg and Bardot went into a dimly lit studio in Paris and recorded Michel Colombier's arrangement of Je T'Aime in an intimate two-hour session. The two singers were squashed into a small, steamy glass booth; engineer William Flageollet witnessed what he described as \"heavy petting\". Word leaked to the press that it was an \"audio v\u00e9rit\u00e9\" recording, with the Sunday paper France-Dimanche reporting that the four minutes and 35 seconds of \"groans, sighs, and Bardot's little cries of pleasure\" set to almost churchlike organ music gave \"the impression you're listening to two people making love\". </p> <p>The next thing the journalists did was call up Bardot's husband and ask him what he thought of it. His reply made the next day's headlines - \"Furious Gunter Sachs Demands the Single Be Withdrawn\" - something that Bardot's agent was agreeing to behind the scenes. Bardot was about to star with Sean Connery in Shalako, released in 1968, and it was not a good time for a scandal (in any case, Bardot hated scandals). </p> <p>She wrote Gainsbourg a letter, pleading with him not to release the record. Gainsbourg protested: \"The music is very pure. For the first time in my life, I write a love song and it's taken badly.\" But he had witnessed the public's love-hate relationship with Bardot, and put the tapes in a drawer. They would stay there until 1986 when she finally gave permission for their \"sublime\" version of Je T'Aime, as Gainsbourg described it, to come out. </p> <p>\"Well, we all know Bardot is an idiot,\" grunted Marianne Faithfull of the original decision to proscribe the song. \"Of course when Gainsbourg had her, she was in peak condition, tip-top form - but always very conformist.\" Gainsbourg had later asked Marianne to do the song with him. \"Hah! He asked everybody,\" she said - including the actress-singers Val\u00e9rie Lagrange and Mireille Darc (Alain Delon's ex-wife). </p> <p> The affair ended and Bardot went back to her husband. Gainsbourg busied himself recording and meeting film commitments. For the film Slogan, released in France in 1969, it was decided that an English actress was needed. Jane Birkin - \"a young actress with that perfect 1960s Swinging London look: long, ironed hair, big eyes and coltish body shoehorned into a belt-sized mini-skirt\" - got the part. Initially, the two did not get on. An evening out in Paris was planned to break the ice. </p> <p>\"We were at Regine's nightclub for a long time,\" Birkin recalled, \"and I asked Gainsbourg to dance.\" (Gainsbourg had been waiting for \" un slow \" so that he could ask Jane the same thing.) \"And he stepped on my feet! I was so surprised. I thought, 'So this sophisticated, arrogant, seemingly confident man doesn't know how to dance' - and I realised it was because he's in fact shy. He seemed so worldly-wise, but at the same time he was very childlike. </p> <p>\"From there he took me to another nightclub - to every nightclub in Paris until six in the morning. We went to Madame Arthur, where his father used to play the piano for the transvestites, who all came up kissing Gainsbourg and saying 'Ooh cheri, how are you?' And he took me to the Russian nightclubs where the Russian violin players played until we got into the taxi on the street and Gainsbourg stuffed 100 franc notes into their violins. He loved them and they loved him, and he told them ' Nous sommes des putes ' ('We're all prostitutes') and asked them to play the Valse Triste, that terribly melancholic slow waltz by Sibelius, which they played right up to the taxi, and which he afterwards always called 'Jane's song'. Then I thought he was going to take me to his parents' house [where Gainsbourg still lived], like all good boys do, but no, he took me straight to the Hilton, where they asked him if he wanted his usual room!\" </p> <p>Birkin was horrified. The evening had started out, quite successfully all things considered, as a quest for an entente cordiale but she was about to become another notch on his rented bedpost. \"In the lift as we were going up, I was pulling faces to myself, thinking, gosh, how could I have got myself into such a mess? I had only known John Barry in all my life, and suddenly here I was with someone who had only taken me out for one night.\" Once in his room she said she wanted to use the bathroom, where she hid out as long as she could - \"and tried to tidy myself up and try to look as if I was used to this sort of thing. By the time I got back into the bedroom, he was asleep. There he was, he'd drunk so much that he was out cold. And I was so relieved! It meant I could nip out to the drugstore and pick up a little 45 record of this song we had been listening to all evening which was 'Yummy yummy yummy I've got love in my tummy' by God knows who. I stuck it between his toes - still he didn't move - and went back to my hotel.\" </p> <p> The pair became inseparable. Shortly after filming, Gainsbourg asked Jane to record a new version of Je T'Aime. </p> <p>\"I don't know how he got Jane to do it because she was such a lovely English upper-class schoolgirl,\" said Marianne Faithfull. \"But of course, he would have got her to do it by fucking her brains out! And Je T'Aime was perfect for Jane. She was born for it.\" </p> <p>Certainly Je T'Aime's languid, almost over-pretty, chocolate-box melody contained some surreal images for a love song - \" je vais et je viens, entre tes reins \" translates as \"I come and go between your kidneys\". But then, this was a love song that denied it was a love song, or was too cynical or insecure to own up to it. The lyrical subtleties were lost on late-1960s Brits. What they heard was an expertly stroked organ, orgasmic groans and a soft-focus melody, the musical equivalent of a Vaseline-smeared Emmanuelle movie. It was confirmation that life across the Channel was one of unchecked lubriciousness, and Je T'Aime became as essential a part of any successful seduction as a chilled bottle of Blue Nun. </p> <p>The press, of course, speculated - as they had with the Bardot version - that Gainsbourg and Birkin had simply recorded a live sex session. To which Gainsbourg said, according to Birkin, \"'Thank goodness it wasn't, otherwise I hope it would have been a long-playing record'. We made it, very boringly, in the studio in Marble Arch, both of us in sort of telephone cabins.\" </p> <p>As soon as they had finished recording the song, Gainsbourg and Birkin rushed back with it to Paris. \"The hotel where we were living at the time, where Oscar Wilde had died - Gainsbourg liked it because of that anecdote - had a restaurant in the wine-cellar where people could sit in the little compartments and have dinner, and there was a man who used to play rather slow and discreet records for background music. Gainsbourg couldn't resist popping on Je T'Aime . . . Moi Non Plus,\" Birkin recalls. As they sat back and watched, \"Everybody's knives and forks were in the air, suspended. Nobody went on eating. Gainsbourg said 'I think we've got a hit.' \" </p> <p>Gainsbourg claimed that his hymn to sexual liberation was, in fact, an \"anti-fuck\" song, about the desperation and innate impossibility of physical love. Whatever the truth, at the age of 41 and after 11 years in the business, Gainsbourg finally had an international success. </p> <p> With their success assured, Gainsbourg, with Birkin, decided to record France's first concept album. </p> <p>L'Histoire de Melody Nelson (released in 1971) is Gainsbourg's beautifully strange and brooding concept album about the love affair between a middle-aged Frenchman and an underage English girl set to music that sounds like a late-1960s jukebox landed on an orchestra accompanying a reading by Samuel Coleridge. Staccato electric guitar, piano rolls, a quasi-psychedelic rock combo, strings, a 70-piece choir and an omnipresent thick, rubbery, doom-laden bass that rumbles through the 28-minute, seven-track album like the wheels of a big old car propelling the story to its fateful conclusion. </p> <p>Muttering close to the microphone, Gainsbourg tells his story of sex, aesthetics, death, obsession and the impossible ideal of purity in a haunted, deadpan voice, like a French Ancient Mariner compelled to prop up another bar and recount the tale over again to yet another indifferent stranger. </p> <p>The opening track, Melody, finds Gainsbourg behind the wheel of his 1910 Rolls-Royce, suddenly aware that the Spirit of Ecstasy has led him to a dangerous, isolated spot in an unsalubrious Paris suburb. Losing control of the car and himself, he runs into a girl on a bicycle, watches her tumble into the road like a doll, her skirt flying over her head to reveal her innocent white knickers. Her name is Melody, an English girl, barely 15 years old, with red hair - \"her natural colour\", he adds, with a mix of poignancy and regret . The stage is set for danger and sex. But first the music glides into an innocent, acoustic Ballade de Melody Nelson, as the driver finds out more about the \" deliceuse enfant \". Only after the lush, old-time-romantic Valse de Melody and the trumpet-laden declaration of love, Ah! Melody, does he take us off to the funky Hotel Particulier where, reflected in the mirror above the rococo bed, we watch him deflower her. (Unlike Je T'Aime, Birkin says, there was a tape recorder under the bed - the horsey laugh on this track is the sound of her being tickled in a hotel room). </p> <p>Young Melody gets homesick (for Sunderland!) and catches a flight back home, but the plane crashes, leaving a tormented, broken, middle-aged man face-to-face with his own solitude, and with \"nothing to lose and no God to believe in\". The tragedy, of course, was inevitable. Once she had lost her virginity, the underage redhead had to die in order to keep the ideal of beauty, youth and purity alive in his imagination. The inspiration for this love story - somewhat pessimistically perhaps - was obvious. \"Melody is Jane,\" he said. \"Without Jane there wouldn't have been any record.\" </p> <p> Always looking for a new direction, Gainsbourg then headed for Jamaica to record a reggae album with Sly and Robbie, at the time the leading reggae rhythm section. </p> <p>\"Reggae had only just started to get going in France when Gainsbourg made Aux Armes Et Caetera [To Arms Etc, released in 1979],\" said Philippe Lerichomme, Gainsbourg's artistic director. </p> <p>\"I had been asked to go to a club one Sunday night to listen to a punk group, who were due on stage at midnight. So I was in this half-empty club, nothing I heard had interested me, it was midnight and the group didn't come on. The disc jockey, who was very good, was playing some very hot things in the meantime - punk, and some reggae. And it came to me in a flash. It was two o'clock in the morning, so I waited a few hours and then phoned Gainsbourg and said, 'We must go to Jamaica and make a reggae album'. And Gainsbourg said 'Good idea!' He did not need any persuasion.\" </p> <p>A week had been booked at Island's Dynamic Sounds studio, a place Gainsbourg would describe to Birkin on his return (with a touch of artistic licence) as the most primitive place imaginable, with chickens clucking about on top of the mixing board. At the outset, it looked like it might turn out to be seven days too long. </p> <p>\"When we arrived,\" said Lerichomme, \"the engineer wasn't there and we couldn't really communicate because Jamaicans speak a special kind of English we found difficult to understand, and for a while Robbie didn't know which one of us was the singer and kept talking to me - because Gainsbourg was older than me and he was wearing a suit.\" Not that they gave the impression of caring either way. \"It was quite tense, no one smiling - it was a case of take the money and run. Gainsbourg, to try to ease the atmosphere, tried to talk to them and said, 'Do you know any French music?' and they started to take the piss out of us, 'French music? We're Jamaican.' </p> <p>\"Gainsbourg and I looked at each other, crestfallen. This wasn't good. Then Sly said, 'We know just one piece of French music, a song called Je T'Aime . . . Moi Non Plus, which has a girl groaning in it.' And Gainsbourg said in English, 'It's me'. That changed the whole mood. We recorded very, very fast, and when it was done they didn't want to leave. They hung around the studio to hear the playbacks, smoking their enormous spliffs, saying, 'Great! Brilliant!' \" </p> <p>Drummer Sly Dunbar remembered getting a call from Chris Blackwell, the head of Island Records. \"He said this French guy wants to work with us, but he didn't realise he was the guy who did Je T'Aime - it was very popular in Jamaica. We couldn't believe it. He didn't say why he wanted to do a reggae album. So when we met him here in Kingston we said, 'So, we're going to make it polished?' And he said no, no, no, he wants it raw. It took less than a week to do everything. He just sang and said he wanted us to play reggae, so we just played reggae, and he didn't say anything - he was into the music, but he was also having a good time. He was constantly smoking and drinking but he never looked drunk. I didn't see him smoke ganja, it was just his French cigarettes in the blue pack. </p> <p>\"He was singing in French. We didn't know what he was singing about, but his singing was good and the melodies were great.\" Perhaps it was for the best that they didn't know. Relax Baby Be Cool - one of the album's perkier tracks, a mix of reggae, 1960s R&amp;B and comic-strip \"bing-boong\" noises - is a chat-up routine taking place against a backdrop of hooded Klansmen, morgues and blood running through the streets. The minimalist lyrics of Eau et Gaz \u00e0 Tous les Etages (Water and Gas on Every Floor) has a man taking his dick out and pissing and farting his way upstairs. The slinky singalong Lola Rastaquou\u00e8re is an ode to an underage rasta girl whose breasts are \"two spheres that I would give up two months' pay for, just to get to roll my poor joint between them\". </p> <p>But the song that made Gainsbourg notorious, the song that had the album flying out of the shops back home in France, was the second track, Aux Armes et Caetera, released in 1979. Over a swaying backdrop of laid-back reggae with a patter of percussion and slinky support vocals from the I Threes, an understated Gainsbourg talk-sings the words familiar to every Frenchman: \" Allons enfants de la patrie/ Le jour de gloire est arriv\u00e9 \" - the opening lines of the French national anthem. It was a masterstroke. Hearing a bunch of Jamaicans messing with La Marseillaise was, for the French, the equivalent of the Sex Pistols' God Save the Queen and Jimi Hendrix's Star-Spangled Banner rolled into one. </p> <p>The outcry over the \"freggae\" national anthem made the scandal caused by Je T'Aime pale into insignificance. The national daily paper Le Figaro condemned it as an outrage. An editorial suggested Gainsbourg should be excommunicated and have his French citizenship removed. </p> <p>\"The journalist called him a walking pollutoid,\" said Birkin. \"He said how someone - and let's not neglect the fact that the name Gainsbourg was hardly French - could dare to do the national anthem with a lot of rastas was poison. Gainsbourg, I remember, was so shocked. He was nearly crying. But then he found it was great fun that he was no longer on the entertainment page, he was on the news page.\" </p> <p>\u00a9 Sylvie Simmons.

Bonnie and Clyde was the title track of Gainsbourg and BB's album together, released in 1968. It was one of a pair of songs Gainsbourg had written in the space of a night following a disastrous early date with Bardot. Struck dumb with either nerves or alcohol, his usual wit deserted him, the evening was a flop and he thought he had blown it. But Bardot phoned the next day and demanded as a penance that he write her \"the most beautiful love song you can imagine\". In fact he wrote two - Bonnie and Clyde and Je T'Aime . . . Moi Non Plus. Late one night in the winter of 1967, Gainsbourg and Bardot went into a dimly lit studio in Paris and recorded Michel Colombier's arrangement of Je T'Aime in an intimate two-hour session. The two singers were squashed into a small, steamy glass booth; engineer William Flageollet witnessed what he described as \"heavy petting\". Word leaked to the press that it was an \"audio v\u00e9rit\u00e9\" recording, with the Sunday paper France-Dimanche reporting that the four minutes and 35 seconds of \"groans, sighs, and Bardot's little cries of pleasure\" set to almost churchlike organ music gave \"the impression you're listening to two people making love\". The next thing the journalists did was call up Bardot's husband and ask him what he thought of it. His reply made the next day's headlines - \"Furious Gunter Sachs Demands the Single Be Withdrawn\" - something that Bardot's agent was agreeing to behind the scenes. Bardot was about to star with Sean Connery in Shalako, released in 1968, and it was not a good time for a scandal (in any case, Bardot hated scandals). She wrote Gainsbourg a letter, pleading with him not to release the record. Gainsbourg protested: \"The music is very pure. For the first time in my life, I write a love song and it's taken badly.\" But he had witnessed the public's love-hate relationship with Bardot, and put the tapes in a drawer. They would stay there until 1986 when she finally gave permission for their \"sublime\" version of Je T'Aime, as Gainsbourg described it, to come out. \"Well, we all know Bardot is an idiot,\" grunted Marianne Faithfull of the original decision to proscribe the song. \"Of course when Gainsbourg had her, she was in peak condition, tip-top form - but always very conformist.\" Gainsbourg had later asked Marianne to do the song with him. \"Hah! He asked everybody,\" she said - including the actress-singers Val\u00e9rie Lagrange and Mireille Darc (Alain Delon's ex-wife). The affair ended and Bardot went back to her husband. Gainsbourg busied himself recording and meeting film commitments. For the film Slogan, released in France in 1969, it was decided that an English actress was needed. Jane Birkin - \"a young actress with that perfect 1960s Swinging London look: long, ironed hair, big eyes and coltish body shoehorned into a belt-sized mini-skirt\" - got the part. Initially, the two did not get on. An evening out in Paris was planned to break the ice. \"We were at Regine's nightclub for a long time,\" Birkin recalled, \"and I asked Gainsbourg to dance.\" (Gainsbourg had been waiting for \" un slow \" so that he could ask Jane the same thing.) \"And he stepped on my feet! I was so surprised. I thought, 'So this sophisticated, arrogant, seemingly confident man doesn't know how to dance' - and I realised it was because he's in fact shy. He seemed so worldly-wise, but at the same time he was very childlike. \"From there he took me to another nightclub - to every nightclub in Paris until six in the morning. We went to Madame Arthur, where his father used to play the piano for the transvestites, who all came up kissing Gainsbourg and saying 'Ooh cheri, how are you?' And he took me to the Russian nightclubs where the Russian violin players played until we got into the taxi on the street and Gainsbourg stuffed 100 franc notes into their violins. He loved them and they loved him, and he told them ' Nous sommes des putes ' ('We're all prostitutes') and asked them to play the Valse Triste, that terribly melancholic slow waltz by Sibelius, which they played right up to the taxi, and which he afterwards always called 'Jane's song'. Then I thought he was going to take me to his parents' house [where Gainsbourg still lived], like all good boys do, but no, he took me straight to the Hilton, where they asked him if he wanted his usual room!\" Birkin was horrified. The evening had started out, quite successfully all things considered, as a quest for an entente cordiale but she was about to become another notch on his rented bedpost. \"In the lift as we were going up, I was pulling faces to myself, thinking, gosh, how could I have got myself into such a mess? I had only known John Barry in all my life, and suddenly here I was with someone who had only taken me out for one night.\" Once in his room she said she wanted to use the bathroom, where she hid out as long as she could - \"and tried to tidy myself up and try to look as if I was used to this sort of thing. By the time I got back into the bedroom, he was asleep. There he was, he'd drunk so much that he was out cold. And I was so relieved! It meant I could nip out to the drugstore and pick up a little 45 record of this song we had been listening to all evening which was 'Yummy yummy yummy I've got love in my tummy' by God knows who. I stuck it between his toes - still he didn't move - and went back to my hotel.\" The pair became inseparable. Shortly after filming, Gainsbourg asked Jane to record a new version of Je T'Aime. \"I don't know how he got Jane to do it because she was such a lovely English upper-class schoolgirl,\" said Marianne Faithfull. \"But of course, he would have got her to do it by fucking her brains out! And Je T'Aime was perfect for Jane. She was born for it.\" Certainly Je T'Aime's languid, almost over-pretty, chocolate-box melody contained some surreal images for a love song - \" je vais et je viens, entre tes reins \" translates as \"I come and go between your kidneys\". But then, this was a love song that denied it was a love song, or was too cynical or insecure to own up to it. The lyrical subtleties were lost on late-1960s Brits. What they heard was an expertly stroked organ, orgasmic groans and a soft-focus melody, the musical equivalent of a Vaseline-smeared Emmanuelle movie. It was confirmation that life across the Channel was one of unchecked lubriciousness, and Je T'Aime became as essential a part of any successful seduction as a chilled bottle of Blue Nun. The press, of course, speculated - as they had with the Bardot version - that Gainsbourg and Birkin had simply recorded a live sex session. To which Gainsbourg said, according to Birkin, \"'Thank goodness it wasn't, otherwise I hope it would have been a long-playing record'. We made it, very boringly, in the studio in Marble Arch, both of us in sort of telephone cabins.\" As soon as they had finished recording the song, Gainsbourg and Birkin rushed back with it to Paris. \"The hotel where we were living at the time, where Oscar Wilde had died - Gainsbourg liked it because of that anecdote - had a restaurant in the wine-cellar where people could sit in the little compartments and have dinner, and there was a man who used to play rather slow and discreet records for background music. Gainsbourg couldn't resist popping on Je T'Aime . . . Moi Non Plus,\" Birkin recalls. As they sat back and watched, \"Everybody's knives and forks were in the air, suspended. Nobody went on eating. Gainsbourg said 'I think we've got a hit.' \" Gainsbourg claimed that his hymn to sexual liberation was, in fact, an \"anti-fuck\" song, about the desperation and innate impossibility of physical love. Whatever the truth, at the age of 41 and after 11 years in the business, Gainsbourg finally had an international success. With their success assured, Gainsbourg, with Birkin, decided to record France's first concept album. L'Histoire de Melody Nelson (released in 1971) is Gainsbourg's beautifully strange and brooding concept album about the love affair between a middle-aged Frenchman and an underage English girl set to music that sounds like a late-1960s jukebox landed on an orchestra accompanying a reading by Samuel Coleridge. Staccato electric guitar, piano rolls, a quasi-psychedelic rock combo, strings, a 70-piece choir and an omnipresent thick, rubbery, doom-laden bass that rumbles through the 28-minute, seven-track album like the wheels of a big old car propelling the story to its fateful conclusion. Muttering close to the microphone, Gainsbourg tells his story of sex, aesthetics, death, obsession and the impossible ideal of purity in a haunted, deadpan voice, like a French Ancient Mariner compelled to prop up another bar and recount the tale over again to yet another indifferent stranger. The opening track, Melody, finds Gainsbourg behind the wheel of his 1910 Rolls-Royce, suddenly aware that the Spirit of Ecstasy has led him to a dangerous, isolated spot in an unsalubrious Paris suburb. Losing control of the car and himself, he runs into a girl on a bicycle, watches her tumble into the road like a doll, her skirt flying over her head to reveal her innocent white knickers. Her name is Melody, an English girl, barely 15 years old, with red hair - \"her natural colour\", he adds, with a mix of poignancy and regret . The stage is set for danger and sex. But first the music glides into an innocent, acoustic Ballade de Melody Nelson, as the driver finds out more about the \" deliceuse enfant \". Only after the lush, old-time-romantic Valse de Melody and the trumpet-laden declaration of love, Ah! Melody, does he take us off to the funky Hotel Particulier where, reflected in the mirror above the rococo bed, we watch him deflower her. (Unlike Je T'Aime, Birkin says, there was a tape recorder under the bed - the horsey laugh on this track is the sound of her being tickled in a hotel room). Young Melody gets homesick (for Sunderland!) and catches a flight back home, but the plane crashes, leaving a tormented, broken, middle-aged man face-to-face with his own solitude, and with \"nothing to lose and no God to believe in\". The tragedy, of course, was inevitable. Once she had lost her virginity, the underage redhead had to die in order to keep the ideal of beauty, youth and purity alive in his imagination. The inspiration for this love story - somewhat pessimistically perhaps - was obvious. \"Melody is Jane,\" he said. \"Without Jane there wouldn't have been any record.\" Always looking for a new direction, Gainsbourg then headed for Jamaica to record a reggae album with Sly and Robbie, at the time the leading reggae rhythm section. \"Reggae had only just started to get going in France when Gainsbourg made Aux Armes Et Caetera [To Arms Etc, released in 1979],\" said Philippe Lerichomme, Gainsbourg's artistic director. \"I had been asked to go to a club one Sunday night to listen to a punk group, who were due on stage at midnight. So I was in this half-empty club, nothing I heard had interested me, it was midnight and the group didn't come on. The disc jockey, who was very good, was playing some very hot things in the meantime - punk, and some reggae. And it came to me in a flash. It was two o'clock in the morning, so I waited a few hours and then phoned Gainsbourg and said, 'We must go to Jamaica and make a reggae album'. And Gainsbourg said 'Good idea!' He did not need any persuasion.\" A week had been booked at Island's Dynamic Sounds studio, a place Gainsbourg would describe to Birkin on his return (with a touch of artistic licence) as the most primitive place imaginable, with chickens clucking about on top of the mixing board. At the outset, it looked like it might turn out to be seven days too long. \"When we arrived,\" said Lerichomme, \"the engineer wasn't there and we couldn't really communicate because Jamaicans speak a special kind of English we found difficult to understand, and for a while Robbie didn't know which one of us was the singer and kept talking to me - because Gainsbourg was older than me and he was wearing a suit.\" Not that they gave the impression of caring either way. \"It was quite tense, no one smiling - it was a case of take the money and run. Gainsbourg, to try to ease the atmosphere, tried to talk to them and said, 'Do you know any French music?' and they started to take the piss out of us, 'French music? We're Jamaican.' \"Gainsbourg and I looked at each other, crestfallen. This wasn't good. Then Sly said, 'We know just one piece of French music, a song called Je T'Aime . . . Moi Non Plus, which has a girl groaning in it.' And Gainsbourg said in English, 'It's me'. That changed the whole mood. We recorded very, very fast, and when it was done they didn't want to leave. They hung around the studio to hear the playbacks, smoking their enormous spliffs, saying, 'Great! Brilliant!' \" Drummer Sly Dunbar remembered getting a call from Chris Blackwell, the head of Island Records. \"He said this French guy wants to work with us, but he didn't realise he was the guy who did Je T'Aime - it was very popular in Jamaica. We couldn't believe it. He didn't say why he wanted to do a reggae album. So when we met him here in Kingston we said, 'So, we're going to make it polished?' And he said no, no, no, he wants it raw. It took less than a week to do everything. He just sang and said he wanted us to play reggae, so we just played reggae, and he didn't say anything - he was into the music, but he was also having a good time. He was constantly smoking and drinking but he never looked drunk. I didn't see him smoke ganja, it was just his French cigarettes in the blue pack. \"He was singing in French. We didn't know what he was singing about, but his singing was good and the melodies were great.\" Perhaps it was for the best that they didn't know. Relax Baby Be Cool - one of the album's perkier tracks, a mix of reggae, 1960s R&amp;B and comic-strip \"bing-boong\" noises - is a chat-up routine taking place against a backdrop of hooded Klansmen, morgues and blood running through the streets. The minimalist lyrics of Eau et Gaz \u00e0 Tous les Etages (Water and Gas on Every Floor) has a man taking his dick out and pissing and farting his way upstairs. The slinky singalong Lola Rastaquou\u00e8re is an ode to an underage rasta girl whose breasts are \"two spheres that I would give up two months' pay for, just to get to roll my poor joint between them\". But the song that made Gainsbourg notorious, the song that had the album flying out of the shops back home in France, was the second track, Aux Armes et Caetera, released in 1979. Over a swaying backdrop of laid-back reggae with a patter of percussion and slinky support vocals from the I Threes, an understated Gainsbourg talk-sings the words familiar to every Frenchman: \" Allons enfants de la patrie/ Le jour de gloire est arriv\u00e9 \" - the opening lines of the French national anthem. It was a masterstroke. Hearing a bunch of Jamaicans messing with La Marseillaise was, for the French, the equivalent of the Sex Pistols' God Save the Queen and Jimi Hendrix's Star-Spangled Banner rolled into one. The outcry over the \"freggae\" national anthem made the scandal caused by Je T'Aime pale into insignificance. The national daily paper Le Figaro condemned it as an outrage. An editorial suggested Gainsbourg should be excommunicated and have his French citizenship removed. \"The journalist called him a walking pollutoid,\" said Birkin. \"He said how someone - and let's not neglect the fact that the name Gainsbourg was hardly French - could dare to do the national anthem with a lot of rastas was poison. Gainsbourg, I remember, was so shocked. He was nearly crying. But then he found it was great fun that he was no longer on the entertainment page, he was on the news page.\" \u00a9 Sylvie Simmons.

Now Cadiz could be about to play a part in one of the great dramas of California: the battle for water.</p> <p>The settlement stands at the centre of a $1bn project which supporters claim will solve southern California's water problems for the next 50 years, and which detractors suggest will prove to be an economic and ecological disaster that will damage the delicate desert eco-system for centuries to come.</p> <p>At the heart of the largest public-private project in the state's history, is a buccaneering self-made businessman from Surrey called Keith Brackpool.</p> <p>Mr Brackpool, 43, who still has family in England, came to the United States in his 20s as an investment banker. He was head of the American division of Albert Fisher, the food distribution company, until 1991 when it emerged that he had a $10m controlling stake in a subsidiary of Polly Peck, the Asil Nadir-owned company which had collapsed dramatically. Mr Brackpool resigned from Albert Fisher. His spokeswoman said yesterday that his departure from the company was \"extremely amicable\" and that he had left at the time \"so that there was no suggestion of impropriety\".</p> <p>In the early 80s, Mr Brackpool had been shown satellite photos indicating that there was water under the Mojave desert, and he embarked on the scheme which could now come to fruition. His company has gradually bought up almost 60,000 acres of the desert.</p> <p>Cadiz Inc's tiny office in the Mojave desert consists of a wooden house with a jokey sign inside which warns employees that, if they speak in Spanish, they will be paid in pesos. The company's current business is agricultural - producing grapes and citrus fruits - and it posted a net loss in 1999 of $8,594,000, which, it says, is similar to any project at its early stages of development.</p> <p>But the company's massive potential is shown by Cadiz's main headquarters - a spectacular skyscraper overlooking the Pacific in Santa Monica. Whether it can realise that promise depends on California's desperate need for more water.</p> <p>Forced to cut back on the quantity of water it is sucking out of the Colorado river, the state faces a possible critical drought. The Metropolitan Water District (MWD), which provides around 17m people with water in southern California, is seriously looking at the possibility of a $1bn 50-year deal with Mr Brackpool that would both store excess water in wet years and pump water from an aquifer under the desert during dry years.</p> <p>This month, a decision is due to be made on whether the Cadiz Programme, as it is called, should go ahead, subject to final environmental tests. The crucial decision comes just as California is in the midst of a power crisis, with rolling black-outs across the state.</p> <p>Mr Brackpool's company has several agricultural schemes on the go, including one with the Saudi royal family in Egypt, which Cadiz Inc says could become the largest single agricultural project in the world.</p> <p>It is also one of the biggest financial backers of California governor Gray Davis, the man who hopes to take the Democratic nomination for president in 2004. Cadiz Inc contributed $133,000 to Mr Davis's 1998 gubernatorial campaign and a total of $445,000 to all politicians. His spokeswoman said this week that \"every publicly-held company in the state\" made similar donations and that they were made to \"candidates who supported a positive business environment\".</p> <p>Mr Brackpool was appointed co-chairman of the Agriculture and Water Transition Task Force when Mr Davis took office and was appointed to the Commission on Building for the 21st Century. He is bullish about the importance of the Cadiz project and said this week: \"Experiencing massive population growth and severe cutbacks on existing water supplies, the state risks its future viability and economic prosperity without efforts such as the Cadiz Programme.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Davis said the governor took advice from \"a wide variety of contacts\" of whom Mr Brackpool was one, but that he was not influenced in any way by who had, or had not, contributed to his political campaigns. A spokesman for the MWD said there had been no attempt from the governor's office to influence its decision in any way and that it had not received a single call from him on the subject.</p> <p>Before the scheme can go ahead, environmental studies by the US Geological Survey and the National Parks Service have to be done, a process which could be completed in a few weeks. But the stage is already set for confrontation as the plan is being vigorously challenged by environmentalists.</p> <p>Steven Krefting of the National Parks Conservation Association, a major opponent of the plan, says that the environmental impact studies done so far have been flawed and that the project could seriously damage both the wildlife and the atmosphere in the desert. \"The desert is quite pristine and clear, you expect to see lots of stars at night.

She says that the scheme would only go ahead if it passed strict environmental tests. The company argues that underground water storage has less environmental impact than reservoirs and dams, and that the project will create local jobs.</p> <p>None of which will satisfy Elden Hughes of the environmental organisation the Sierra Club, who believes that the scheme should be halted because it could destroy the habitat of the desert tortoise, an endangered species, and bighorn sheep in the vicinity, as well as creating the possibility of dust storms.</p> <p>Mr Hughes says that the scheme is flawed on both economic and environmental grounds and that the MWD might find they had lost $200m before \"they find out the truth... they're taking on a very bad bet.

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook was embroiled in a fresh row over arms sales yesterday after giving the go-ahead for a \u00a33.5m contract to supply artillery spare parts to a north African war zone. The contract is to restore 30 105mm guns of the Moroccan army, which has been involved in a 26-year-old dispute with Western Sahara. The Foreign Office confirmed last night that ministers had initially rejected the application for a licence from Royal Ordnance, owned by BAE Systems formerly British Aerospace, in August 1998. At the time, the ministers decided that such a contract could be in breach of the European code of conduct on arms sales, which forbids sales to countries that could use them for aggressive territorial gain. Morocco occupied part of Western Sahara in 1975 and has been engaged in conflict with Polisario guerrillas fighting for independence. The UN is policing a ceasefire. The Foreign Office said that ministers changed their mind and granted the licence in June 1999. A spokeswoman said that they had done so after advice from the UN that refurbish ment of guns was within the terms of the ceasefire arrangements. The row was sparked on Tuesday when Mr Cook disclosed the contract while giving evidence to a Commons select committee. Mr Cook, speaking just before the committee went into private session, said that the grounds for the original refusal were made irrelevant by the UN's position on the Western Sahara dispute. A spokesman for the UN said yesterday: \"The UN advice was that there was no violation of the ceasefire agreement in this specific instance.\" There are no UN sanctions in force against Morocco. Tess Kingham, a Labour member of the committee, said yesterday: \"This is astonishing. At the bottom of this is the staggering admission that we have granted licences for spare parts to refurbish big guns in Western Sahara. \"This plainly goes against our ethical criteria, which state that if there is clear evidence that weapons could be used by a government to enforce a territorial claim, we should refuse the licence. \"What more evidence do you want than the fact that these weapons are actually in the disputed territory.\" Steve Tibbett, a spokesman for the campaign War on Want, said: \"If these assurances [by the Foreign Office] are true, we are very concerned that the UK government is being forced into endorsing arms exports to a disputed territory. The UN are supposed to be peacemakers in the region.\" Coordinator of the Western Sahara Campaign, Richard Stanforth said: \"It is a disgrace. The UN is mandated to organise a referendum in Western Sahara, not to help the Moroccans build up their military might in preparation for another war.\" There was initial confusion at the Foreign Office over whether Mr Cook's remarks had been made in a private or public session. Mr Cook was under the impression he had been speaking in private. The Foreign Office confirmed that he had in fact been speaking during the open public session, and the private session began only after the exchanges on the Western Sahara. Campaigners against the arms trade said last night they were suspicious about a delay in publishing a transcript of Mr Cook's remarks to the committee about the involvement of the UN. The transcript would normally have been available on the internet by now, although ministers and MPs do have access to make \"corrections\".",

      "body": "<p>The Commons has spent much time over the past few weeks being united - over the bodies in the chapel of rest, the Alder Hey scandal, and the sacking of Peter Mandelson - which has brought everyone such warmth and happiness on these freezing winter days.</p> <p>Yesterday they were united in their rage against Corus, the steel company which is sacking 6,000 people. (Why \"Corus\" instead of \"British Steel\"? Did they imagine their Welsh employees might think it was really a male-voice choir?)</p> <p>The unity in the Commons was lucky for Stephen Byers, the secretary for trade and industry, a man who appears constantly baffled by the peculiar ways of those who work in trade and industry. You may remember that BMW caught him entirely by surprise over Longbridge.</p> <p>He reminds me of our cat. Every day when I leave for work I lure her away from the radiator and into the kitchen by putting a tiny bit of food on her dish. Every day, as I close the door, she looks up in pained astonishment. Curses, fooled again, and for the 1,853rd time! Mr Byers would sympathise.</p> <p>He sounded hurt as well as surprised by Corus's sheer wickedness. Relevant information had been withheld. They had been \"resistant to meaningful dialogue\". He begged them to reconsider. Mr Byers being passionate resembles an angry gerbil: you appreciate the strength of his feelings, but can't take them very seriously.</p> <p>Anyway, there seems to be a fat chance of Corus doing any such thing. Why should they? According to the Thatcherite ideology eagerly embraced by this government, the market is always right. The steelworkers will find jobs at the local Berlei ladies' underwear factory, or designing computer games, or at lawn care centres. Until then, tough.</p> <p>Mr Byers was also lucky in his chief opponent. The Tories' feeble Angela Browning was replaced by David Heathcoat-Amory, a more coherent fellow, but not one who stirs any more passion than the minister.</p> <p>Listening to his bloodless speech (he put the crisis down to a \"general malaise\", as if the economy just needed a walking holiday), watching him peer over his fine-rimmed glasses, seeing the lights glint on his silvery hair, I was minded of the old Heathcoat-Amory mill, in northern Lancashire.

      "bodyText": "The Commons has spent much time over the past few weeks being united - over the bodies in the chapel of rest, the Alder Hey scandal, and the sacking of Peter Mandelson - which has brought everyone such warmth and happiness on these freezing winter days. Yesterday they were united in their rage against Corus, the steel company which is sacking 6,000 people. (Why \"Corus\" instead of \"British Steel\"? Did they imagine their Welsh employees might think it was really a male-voice choir?) The unity in the Commons was lucky for Stephen Byers, the secretary for trade and industry, a man who appears constantly baffled by the peculiar ways of those who work in trade and industry. You may remember that BMW caught him entirely by surprise over Longbridge. He reminds me of our cat. Every day when I leave for work I lure her away from the radiator and into the kitchen by putting a tiny bit of food on her dish. Every day, as I close the door, she looks up in pained astonishment. Curses, fooled again, and for the 1,853rd time! Mr Byers would sympathise. He sounded hurt as well as surprised by Corus's sheer wickedness. Relevant information had been withheld. They had been \"resistant to meaningful dialogue\". He begged them to reconsider. Mr Byers being passionate resembles an angry gerbil: you appreciate the strength of his feelings, but can't take them very seriously. Anyway, there seems to be a fat chance of Corus doing any such thing. Why should they? According to the Thatcherite ideology eagerly embraced by this government, the market is always right. The steelworkers will find jobs at the local Berlei ladies' underwear factory, or designing computer games, or at lawn care centres. Until then, tough. Mr Byers was also lucky in his chief opponent. The Tories' feeble Angela Browning was replaced by David Heathcoat-Amory, a more coherent fellow, but not one who stirs any more passion than the minister. Listening to his bloodless speech (he put the crisis down to a \"general malaise\", as if the economy just needed a walking holiday), watching him peer over his fine-rimmed glasses, seeing the lights glint on his silvery hair, I was minded of the old Heathcoat-Amory mill, in northern Lancashire. Josiah Heathcoat-Amory built it up from nowt. He's a hard man, but an honest man, and he knows the business from top to bottom. His son, young Mester David, is more of a bookish sort. He is courteous but rather vague, and the hands mutter respectfully when he tours the mill, asking questions such as \"What does this little, er, thingy do?\" Or, \"I say, that's a jolly good, um _\" When he's gone they roll their eyes and raise their brows, and hope fervently that the Old Man will last a few more years. (Mr Heathcoat-Amory was also hamstrung by the fact that the real reason for the debacle is the strong pound. But saying this might sound like support for the euro.) So he blamed the closures partly on petrol prices. Mr Byers said this had nothing to do with it. Mr Heathcoat-Amory held up a paper on which, presumably, this allegation appeared. The Speaker rose for one of his strange, surreal interventions. \"The Rt Hon member must let the minister reply!\" he said, as if in some way the waving of a piece of paper might strike Mr Byers dumb. It was left to the back-bench awkward squad to express the anger. Paul Flynn produced a controlled explosion of real rage. And a red-faced Ronnie Campbell bellowed: \"Re- nationalise them! Give 'em tuppence halfpenny!\" Mr Byers was off the hook.",

      "body": "<p>The Rt Rev Simon Phipps, who has died aged 79, was a classic example of a senior Anglican cleric who made it to the top on his own merits despite being well-born, well-connected and well off. His father, a naval officer, had been appointed to the Royal Victorian Order. Phipps was educated at Eton and, while still a young subaltern, was picked out by the then Queen Elizabeth (now the Queen Mother) as a suitable escort for her younger daughter, Princess Margaret. He went on, in 1968, to be appointed Suffragan Bishop of Horsham, and, in 1974, to become Bishop of Lincoln.</p> <p>As for many of his generation, the second world war meant instant transference from boy to man, and Phipps joined the Coldstream Guards straight from school. By the age of 25, he had attained the rank of major, and, in the last year of the war, was awarded the Military Cross.</p> <p>When finally released from brief spells as an ADC in India and a staff officer at the War Office, he arrived belatedly at Trinity College, Cambridge, to read history, graduating in 1948. He became a star turn in the Footlights review, and, in 1949, was elected the club's president. His amateur theatricals appealed to Princess Margaret, herself no mean mimic, and, on one memorable visit to Balmoral, he was roped in to play charades by the then Queen Elizabeth, the future bishop being obliged to march around ahead of King George VI carrying an umbrella in imitation of a crozier.</p> <p>After training for the ministry at Westcott House, Cambridge, Phipps was ordained in 1950, and served his title as assistant curate at Huddersfield parish church. In 1953, he was invited back to Trinity College as chaplain. This was the year when Princess Margaret fell in love with the divorc\u00e9 Peter Townsend, and it was to Phipps that, during the next three years, while struggling with her conscience and the constitutional issues, the princess turned for spiritual advice. At one time, they were in almost daily contact. Later, he became godfather to her son, Lord Linley, after her marriage to Anthony Armstrong-Jones.</p> <p>While still at Trinity College, Phipps also forged, with Mervyn Stockwood, one of his warmest episcopal friendships. He and his wife, Mary, remained loyal and loving friends to the future Bishop of Southwark throughout his lonely years in retirement.</p> <p>In 1958, Phipps moved into an area of work for which he seemed least suited but became best known, serving for a decade as industrial chaplain to the Coventry diocese. He played a major role in the sociological development of the new Coventry Cathedral, and always said that the people he felt sorry for were the men who found themselves sitting next to him in the works canteen. Determined to give 10 years to the Coventry post, in 1963 he turned down the prestigious living of the Cambridge University church.</p> <p>In 1965, Phipps was made an honorary canon of Coventry, and three years later, with Princess Margaret in the congregation at Southwark Cathedral, he was consecrated as Suffragan Bishop of Horsham. He used to recount an amusing story about his night at Lambeth Palace on the eve of his consecration.</p> <p>He imagined that the Archbishop of Canterbury, Michael Ramsey, would pass on some sage advice. But the time went by in silence. Eventually, Phipps suggested they should go to bed. \"The only advice the archbishop had given me,\" he recalled, \"was to take every fifth Sunday off, and to leave a space in my diary every week for the crisis which was likely to emerge. I thought it was wonderfully characteristic of him to say two completely mundane things, and to leave the rest to God.\"</p> <p>It was in 1973, while still in the Chichester diocese, aged 52 and seemingly a confirmed bachelor, that Phipps surprised and delighted his friends by getting married. His wife, Mary Welch, was a daughter of Sir Charles Palmer, of the biscuit manufacturers, Huntley &amp; Palmer, the widow of a clergyman, and a practising psychiatrist.</p> <p>The following year, Phipps accepted the bishopric of Lincoln. Strictly speaking, he was no academic or intellectual, and was chosen for his pastoral qualities, his unshockability and innate comprehension of human frailty. He retained his interest in industrial affairs by serving on the council of the Industrial Society, and by speaking out in the House of Lords on the dangers of unemployment. He was also a member of the home secre tary's inquiry on liquor licensing laws, coming down in favour of more flexible opening hours for pubs.</p> <p>For some reason, his relations with his dean had not been too harmonious, but when he resigned the see in 1986, Phipps left it in pretty good shape. In retirement, however, he watched with increasing dismay the unfolding of dramas and scandals under a future bishop and dean, which were to rend the cathedral chapter asunder.</p> <p>He retired to his wife's enchanting Sussex home, with views to Chanctonbury Ring, being invited, most unusually, to act as an honorary assistant bishop in two dioceses, Southwark and Chichester. He always said he enjoyed carrying out duties in Southwark because the people there were fun, whereas in Chichester he was regarded as unsound.</p> <p>This was hardly surprising. Phipps was in favour of the ordination of women, and, in a paper written for the Association of Pastoral Care and Counselling, accused the House of Bishops of abrogating its vocation to prophecy by attempting to force celibacy upon homosexual clergy who themselves had no vocation to celibacy.</p> <p>He always extended unqualified affection and support to those of his friends, clergy and lay, who were homosexual, and rejoiced in successful permanent gay relationships.</p> <p>While undeniably an est- ablishment figure, Phipps lacked the pomposity or condescension typical of some senior clergy of his generation, retaining always an easy familiarity. Late in life, he discovered a talent for painting. He was also an excellent cook.</p> <p>His wife died last June, aged 89. \u0095 Simon Wilton Phipps, clergyman, born July 6 1921; died January 29 2001</p>",

He says he converted to Jesus after meeting Billy Graham in 1985.</p> <p>But political enthusiasm for social action by the churches is not confined to America. Compare Hilary Armstrong, the Labour minister for regeneration: \"Faith leaders should press local authorities to make more use of the resources faith communities can offer in regeneration.\"</p> <p>Or Tory leader William Hague last November: \"I want to denationalise compassion where the state is failing to deliver results. I want to roll back the frontiers of the state so that more work of faith and secular community-based initiatives can flourish.

Religious people are more caring and benevolent, aren't they? Charities operating under their ethos are more likely to inculcate spiritual values and social concern. They have been at it for years too - some since Victorian times.

The idea of being drafted has left them less than ecstatic. \"We are in danger of being used as pawns. Christian groups, even those which are sympathetic, need to look carefully at who they are getting into bed with,\" says Rob Taylor, of the evangelical charity Adullam Homes, which runs centres offering support and accommodation for drug addicts, ex-offenders and others in 33 local authority areas across the Midlands and north of England.

      "bodyText": "New squads of dairy detectives could soon track down fraudsters who fool consumers that they are eating some of Britain's favourite cheeses instead of cheap imitations. Tests of the authenticity of famous EU foods are being developed by an international team of scientists who have already trapped German and Dutch companies involved in a cross-border butter scam. They are investigating a potential cheese conspiracy in Italy and hope soon to be able to refine the techniques to establish whether cheeses labelled as protected products, such as single Gloucester, Buxton blue, or West Country farmhouse cheddar cheeses, really do originate from where the name suggests. Scientists from Britain, Germany, Austria, France, Spain and Italy have been collecting data on the chemical content of soil in pastures used by dairy herds, and of other aspects of the herds' diets, to establish models against which milk, butter and cheese claiming to come from particular regions can be measured. The characteristics of the soil in which cattle feed is grown are important since they pass into the diary products. A three year, \u00a31m research project includes the government's central science laboratory in York, and similar techniques could prove the origins of foods and drinks such as rice, shellfish, meats, wines and beers. Those who pass off false claims in this country would be liable to \u00a35,000 fines and heavy costs. The food standards agency said the EU was concerned that fraudsters were charging premium prices for fake products. \"We have to ensure that if consumers are paying a certain price, they are paying for the genuine article and not being conned,\" a spokesperson said. The methods, still in their infancy, have already uncovered butter fraud in Europe. Butter imported by Germany from Estonia was in fact EU-produced butter that had attracted subsidies on the way out and had then been rela belled to take advantage of Estonia's access to EU markets without paying high tariffs. Tests revealed that the butter had traces of maize, fed to herds in the EU but not to those in Estonia. The German and Dutch companies involved were ordered to pay DM1.4m (\u00a3500,000) in import duty. Tests on more than 100 elements are under way to check that some producers of Italian Alpine cheeses such as Grana Padano and Grana Trentino really are using the appropriate milk and not inferior alternatives from Germany or Austria.

The blow finally came on a day of unending fog and drizzle, bringing fury and despair. </p> <p>Many of the older workers had already taken early retirement packages as the steelworks \"slimmed down\" in previous years. The employees losing their jobs now are the younger and middle-aged men with young families. </p> <p>No-one received a redundancy notice yesterday - that will not happen for some months - but everyone was prepared for the worst. </p> <p>Llanwern worker Kevin Williams, 32, a father of two girls, said: \"Corus have been so underhand. They said we'd be the first to know. Most of us found out from watching the news this morning. </p> <p>\"It's a sign of the times. They've got to keep the shareholders happy and they don't seem to care for the working man.\" </p> <p>Fellow employee Steve Williams, 39, a father of a 13-year-old boy, said: \"The share price went up this morning - what's that supposed to tell us? We've been told we're the most productive steel plant in Europe.\" </p> <p>The impact on his family is perhaps the hardest part of this. \"My son knows that for the next few months we've got to watch what we're doing and take it as it comes, but it's difficult to tell kids they can't have what they had before.\" </p> <p>The trouble is that for the men who toiled in the heat and glare of the forge, turning molten steel into slabs of metal, Llanwern has been a nice earner. </p> <p>It may have been a semi-skilled job, but it paid better than some trades, with workers typically taking home around \u00a330,000. In this part of South Wales that meant a semi-detached house in a pleasant location, the toys the children wanted and holidays in the sun. </p> <p>Now they're at the mercy of the marketplace, in an area where male unemployment stands higher than the national average at 4.8%. </p> <p>Andy, 33, who declined to give his surname said:\"We are all out of our jobs in one go. The employers are going to recognise that and start paying less because there's going to be a glut of people.\" </p> <p>In its leader comment, the local evening newspaper, the South Wales Argus, declared: \"The name of Corus and its chairman Sir Brian Moffat will be for ever tainted in this area ... Corus has shown a callous disregard for its workforce, doing nothing to deny rumours in the media of job losses and plant closures.\" </p> <p>Steve Down, councillor for the Llanwern ward with Newport county borough council said: \"I live in a village called Underwood that was built specifically to house people when they were starting up the works in the early 60s. </p> <p>\"We exist because of Llanwern. Up until today there has been extreme frustration because nobody knew what was going to happen. </p> <p>\"Today there is anger - people are saying what do we do now?\" </p> <p>Paul Collier, regional official for the AEEU union said: \"It is a fairly small community around here and certainly every family will be affected by this.\" </p> <p>The day before the axe fell at Corus came the news of the closure of the Unigate Dairy Crest milk processing plant at Newport, with the loss of 275 jobs. </p> <p>\u0095The jobs of 319 workers at Shotton steelworks, near Chester, are also to be axed. The steelworks once employed more than 13,000 people but numbers dramatically reduced in the 1980s, when 8,000 jobs were shed in one day, writes Helen Carter. </p> <p>Barry Jones, MP for Alyn and Deeside, said: \"I have looked into the eyes of young steel workers who have large mortgages, car hire purchase payments to make and school uniforms to buy, who now have no way of paying for these things. </p> <p>\"There is a feeling of intense anger among the workforce. </p> <p>\"These cruel Corus cuts are unacceptable. They are bad for Britain, Wales and the Shotton works.\" </p> <p>The move was also condemned by Flintshire county council. </p> <p>Councillor Derek Butler, the council's member for economic development and tourism, said they were bemused and appalled by Corus's decision, as Shotton was one of the most highly productive plants in Europe. </p> <p>\"The reality is that this latest round of job cuts will affect many more than the 319 job losses identified. Corus employs many contractors at the plant and it is possible that the announcement could affect up to 1,000 people employed directly or indirectly by the company.\"</p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,431802,00.html\">01.02.2001: 5,000 jobs go in steel closure plan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,431290,00.html\"> 31.01.2001: Union will press on with Llanwern bid </a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,430948,00.html\"> 31.01.2001: Anger as Corus rejects takeover bid</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,430694,00.html\">30.01.2001, comment: Smeltdown</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.corusgroup.com/ \">Key player: Corus</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.istc-tu.org/\">Key player: ISTC (Iron and Steel Trades Confederation) trade union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk/\">Key player: DTI</a></p>",

We've been told we're the most productive steel plant in Europe.\" The impact on his family is perhaps the hardest part of this. \"My son knows that for the next few months we've got to watch what we're doing and take it as it comes, but it's difficult to tell kids they can't have what they had before.\" The trouble is that for the men who toiled in the heat and glare of the forge, turning molten steel into slabs of metal, Llanwern has been a nice earner. It may have been a semi-skilled job, but it paid better than some trades, with workers typically taking home around \u00a330,000. In this part of South Wales that meant a semi-detached house in a pleasant location, the toys the children wanted and holidays in the sun. Now they're at the mercy of the marketplace, in an area where male unemployment stands higher than the national average at 4.8%. Andy, 33, who declined to give his surname said:\"We are all out of our jobs in one go. The employers are going to recognise that and start paying less because there's going to be a glut of people.\" In its leader comment, the local evening newspaper, the South Wales Argus, declared: \"The name of Corus and its chairman Sir Brian Moffat will be for ever tainted in this area ... Corus has shown a callous disregard for its workforce, doing nothing to deny rumours in the media of job losses and plant closures.\" Steve Down, councillor for the Llanwern ward with Newport county borough council said: \"I live in a village called Underwood that was built specifically to house people when they were starting up the works in the early 60s. \"We exist because of Llanwern. Up until today there has been extreme frustration because nobody knew what was going to happen. \"Today there is anger - people are saying what do we do now?\" Paul Collier, regional official for the AEEU union said: \"It is a fairly small community around here and certainly every family will be affected by this.\" The day before the axe fell at Corus came the news of the closure of the Unigate Dairy Crest milk processing plant at Newport, with the loss of 275 jobs. \u0095The jobs of 319 workers at Shotton steelworks, near Chester, are also to be axed. The steelworks once employed more than 13,000 people but numbers dramatically reduced in the 1980s, when 8,000 jobs were shed in one day, writes Helen Carter. Barry Jones, MP for Alyn and Deeside, said: \"I have looked into the eyes of young steel workers who have large mortgages, car hire purchase payments to make and school uniforms to buy, who now have no way of paying for these things. \"There is a feeling of intense anger among the workforce. \"These cruel Corus cuts are unacceptable. They are bad for Britain, Wales and the Shotton works.\" The move was also condemned by Flintshire county council. Councillor Derek Butler, the council's member for economic development and tourism, said they were bemused and appalled by Corus's decision, as Shotton was one of the most highly productive plants in Europe. \"The reality is that this latest round of job cuts will affect many more than the 319 job losses identified. Corus employs many contractors at the plant and it is possible that the announcement could affect up to 1,000 people employed directly or indirectly by the company.\" Related stories 01.02.2001: 5,000 jobs go in steel closure plan 31.01.2001: Union will press on with Llanwern bid 31.01.2001: Anger as Corus rejects takeover bid 30.01.2001, comment: Smeltdown Useful links Key player: Corus Key player: ISTC (Iron and Steel Trades Confederation) trade union Key player: DTI",

      "body": "<p>That innocent sweetie Alastair Campbell, the Downing Street spokesman, was huffing and puffing this week over the apparent rudeness of Corus boss Sir Brian Moffat. \"It's a pretty extraordinary state of affairs where, as the government, if you were to ask us when is this decision [to sack umpteen steel workers] going to be announced we would say we don't know,\" he stated, angrily. </p> <p>Setting aside the pain and perversity of the Corus announcement (if the company was planning to cut British steel production it would have made more sense to do it when the euro was going down rather than up), it should be pointed out that Sir Brian's silence on the timing of the announcement was dictated by City legislation. This states, in the harshest terms, that any price-sensitive announcement by a publicly listed company has to be first broadcast formally to the City community, so its members can make decisions on whether to buy or sell the shares. </p> <p>The rules are designed to create a so-called level playing field among investors, even though such a financial pitch does not, and never will, exist. </p> <p>\"Real\" price-shifting information - such as takeover plans, rights issues or better than expected trading figures - tends to leak in advance. Job cuts, such as those being imposed by Corus, are also routinely predicted by analysts or commentators covering particular business sectors. </p> <p>Yet the legislative culture dictates that, when it comes to formal announcements, corporate - not Whitehall - bureaucrats rule the roost. </p> <p>It is a crass system. The regulations should be amended to allow all companies the freedom to deal with the human pain of sacking people without having to worry about esoteric danger of creating a false market in their stock. </p> <p><strong> Shell shock </strong><br> </p> <p>At the height of the dot.com boom, the Just2Clicks flotation story had it all. </p> <p>First there was the board. On a non-executive level alone it boasted a former director of a blue-chip technology firm, a professional investor whom punters watched like a hawk for signs of where the next big killing was coming from and a high-profile member for the European parliament who three months after quitting as a euro-public servant found himself sitting on a multi-million pound paper fortune. </p> <p>Then there was the chief executive - a fast-talking, thoroughly engaging and successful businessman who had become something of a local hero in his native north-east. </p> <p>Finally there was a business model which, with both pre-sight and hindsight, amounted to little more than new-economy e-guff. </p> <p>Two days after Valentines Day last year Just2Clicks shares went on sale to a love-struck public, almost doubling on their first day's trading. A year on, the affair is well and truly over; the tale of the \u00a3200m company turned out to be lacking a chapter or two. Revenue was thin on the ground, there were no profits and no sign of a dividend. </p> <p>Just2Clicks now has cash in the bank but little idea how to spend it. Its management now suggest the business might be best described as a \"cash shell\".

      "bodyText": "That innocent sweetie Alastair Campbell, the Downing Street spokesman, was huffing and puffing this week over the apparent rudeness of Corus boss Sir Brian Moffat. \"It's a pretty extraordinary state of affairs where, as the government, if you were to ask us when is this decision [to sack umpteen steel workers] going to be announced we would say we don't know,\" he stated, angrily. Setting aside the pain and perversity of the Corus announcement (if the company was planning to cut British steel production it would have made more sense to do it when the euro was going down rather than up), it should be pointed out that Sir Brian's silence on the timing of the announcement was dictated by City legislation. This states, in the harshest terms, that any price-sensitive announcement by a publicly listed company has to be first broadcast formally to the City community, so its members can make decisions on whether to buy or sell the shares. The rules are designed to create a so-called level playing field among investors, even though such a financial pitch does not, and never will, exist. \"Real\" price-shifting information - such as takeover plans, rights issues or better than expected trading figures - tends to leak in advance. Job cuts, such as those being imposed by Corus, are also routinely predicted by analysts or commentators covering particular business sectors. Yet the legislative culture dictates that, when it comes to formal announcements, corporate - not Whitehall - bureaucrats rule the roost. It is a crass system. The regulations should be amended to allow all companies the freedom to deal with the human pain of sacking people without having to worry about esoteric danger of creating a false market in their stock. Shell shock At the height of the dot.com boom, the Just2Clicks flotation story had it all. First there was the board. On a non-executive level alone it boasted a former director of a blue-chip technology firm, a professional investor whom punters watched like a hawk for signs of where the next big killing was coming from and a high-profile member for the European parliament who three months after quitting as a euro-public servant found himself sitting on a multi-million pound paper fortune. Then there was the chief executive - a fast-talking, thoroughly engaging and successful businessman who had become something of a local hero in his native north-east. Finally there was a business model which, with both pre-sight and hindsight, amounted to little more than new-economy e-guff. Two days after Valentines Day last year Just2Clicks shares went on sale to a love-struck public, almost doubling on their first day's trading. A year on, the affair is well and truly over; the tale of the \u00a3200m company turned out to be lacking a chapter or two. Revenue was thin on the ground, there were no profits and no sign of a dividend. Just2Clicks now has cash in the bank but little idea how to spend it. Its management now suggest the business might be best described as a \"cash shell\". Did they every believe it was anything else? Carat and stick The $16bn takeover of De Beers planned by Anglo-American and the mega-rich Oppenheimer family was welcomed yesterday by City analysts and investors. The diamond cartel has long been shunned by investors. They did not like the complex cross-shareholdings with Anglo-American, or its South African listing. The net result has been a stock market valuation that vastly underrates the true value of the company, which still controls 60% of the world market in uncut diamonds. The De Beers/Anglo move comes in the wake of similar action taken by blue-chip groups such as South African Breweries, mining group Billiton, insurer Old Mutual and software group Dimension Data, which have all transferred their primary listings away from Johannesburg. Under the terms of the deal proposed - which analysts reckon is generous - the cross-shareholdings will be unravelled and De Beers will almost be a normal company. If investors want a slice of De Beers, which following a deal with LVMH last month will include a new, joint-venture, luxury goods business to cash in on the famous name as well as exposure to the uncut diamond market, they will simply have to invest in Anglo-American on the London Stock Exchange. The only downside is that they won't be able to punt on diamonds alone - but will have to take a stake in the rest of Anglo-American's decidedly unglamorous assortment of businesses, which include coal mining and Tarmac.

An accident and emergency specialist, Paul Temple, said: \"If just one package breaks or leaks you will initially get the best trip of your life, but that can rapidly turn to death.\" Mr Shardlow added: \"We will stay at his bedside until the drugs are recovered or he dies.\" He said the boy had been arrested on suspicion of possessing Class A drugs, but officers might have to wait as long as 10 days to take the case further.

Ten nail bombs have been sent through the post to businesses across the north of England and the west midlands since December last year. Recipients include a chip shop, an estate agent, a pet shop and a farmer in Ripon, North Yorkshire. The number of incidents in volving suspect packages have been increasing despite the home secretary, Jack Straw, declaring a crackdown on extreme animal rights activists. Earlier this week a judge in Peterborough sentenced a prominent animal rights activist, Charlotte Lewis, to six months in jail after she admitted sending threatening letters to employees of the animal research company Huntingdon Life Sciences. In parliament on Wednesday the Liberal Democrat peer Lord Taverne asked the junior home office minister, Lord Bassam, if the government agreed that some of the actions of animal rights groups were among \"the most dangerous forms of terrorism in the UK at the moment\". Lord Bassam told the Lords: \"It is an appalling form of terrorism and the home secretary raised the issue in the criminal justice and police bill.\" The proposed legislation has failed to halt the pace of attacks. No group has claimed responsibility for any of the recent attacks. Greater Manchester police said yesterday that they had so far made no connection between the Salford device and the nail bomb attacks.

Lance Bombardier Cochrane was attached to the United Nations force patrolling the border with Turkish-occupied Cyprus. Army regulations give army commanders a wide degree of descretion on personnel going AWOL. Those found guilty could face \"administrative action\" by the commander or a court martial. They could also face a period in custody at the army's correctional training centre at Colchester, Essex, followed by a discharge. There are about 380 personnel absent without leave across the three services, the ministry said.

      "body": "<p>The folks at <strong> Horizon</strong> (BBC2) are trying way too hard to live up to the tagline \"Pure science. Sheer drama\". There's no other explanation for the hyperbole, melodrama and downright daftness featured in The Missing Link. While you or I would simply describe it as the story of how fish evolved into land-dwelling creatures, Horizon's narrator gushes dramatically, \"Of all the tales of life on earth, one is more fabulous than the others. The story of how we got our legs!\" </p> <p>Really, though? Is it the most fabulous of all stories? Isn't How Life Began At The Very Beginning the most fabulous story? Shouldn't How Richard Blackwood Continues To Be Mistaken For Someone Talented be regarded as a more fabulous - not to mention perplexing - tale? And besides, didn't they say that last week? Or maybe that was the week before. Apparently not. </p> <p>Here was a 360-million-year-old detective story, the quest for the ultimate missing link, a mystery which, if solved, would prove Darwin's theory of evolution: how fish grew legs. DA DA DAAA! Hence Horizon had toddlers, ballet dancers and lizards all moving to a soundtrack of portentous kettle drums and bracing cymbals. It had the Nordic Dr Per eyeing up old fossils. It had jolly scientists proclaiming, \"We are modified fish!\" (He himself looked like a modified cod.) And, on her motorbike, it had \"palaeontology's avenging angel\" coming to save the day by saying things like \"We have to go to Greenland!\" </p> <p>There were more exclamation marks in Horizon than at an Ann Summers party in a convent. All the fuss was about finding a \"transitional form\" which could link fish with the first tetrapods. Tetrapods aren't types of orange juice cartons but air-breathing creatures with spines and spurs, pelvises, ribcages and fingers. \"Every dog and cat and mammal,\" Dr Cod helpfully explained, just in case we hadn't quite got the message. Find this transitional form and the mystery would be solved. Fail and let the creationists win, and \"we'd descend into another Dark Age\". (I told you they were melodramatic.) </p> <p>So the hunt was on for a fossil of a half-fish, half-tetrapod mutant. Naturally, it wasn't easy. Such creatures are hard to find as they all died out quite quickly when they were superseded by whatever higher life form they were transitional to. A dinosaur with feathers (Shirley Bassey) marking the lizards' transition to birds had been found, but a fish with legs proved more elusive.</p> <p> Eric Jarvik seemed to have found one though. He was tall, dour and \"the least loved figure in all palaeontology\" - imagine the competition for that accolade. He took 48 years to analyse his fossil and came to the conclusion that he'd found the missing link. Unfortunately, he got the analysis wrong but didn't tell anyone. \"We'll never know why!\" boomed Mr Narrator. </p> <p>Eventually, after much humming and hawing and rewriting of textbooks, Dr Per found the answer. Sifting through a selection of drawers that hadn't been examined in 30 years he discovered the missing link in a Latvian museum. We evolved legs - pause for dramatic effect - to cope with the vegetation-strewn swamps millions of years ago, Horizon concluded. Phew. The kettle drums and cymbals can be packed away, because the most fabulous of all the tales of life on earth had been resolved. </p> <p>Until a new one pops up next week. </p> <p><strong> The Riddle Of Pompeii </strong> (Channel 4) ploughed a similar furrow. The programme asked what had killed the people of the Roman town in AD79. Technically, you'd be correct with \"a volcano\", so, like Anne Robinson on The Weakest Link, \"I'll accept your answer\" (because it's right). Of course, with an hour to fill, the whole Vesuvius thing was a tad more complicated for this cheapo documentary, in which the poor old male narrator had to voice the translations himself, even when it was a woman speaking. </p> <p>The Riddle Of Pompeii was rather like watching the titles of Hong Kong Phooey. Was it the pumice raining from the sky? Could be. Was it poisonous gas? Could be. Was it the switchboard operator Rosemary, the cutie beauty who's always on duty? Could be. </p> <p>In the end it was none of the above, but a cloud of red-hot ash and dust travelling at 300mph which seared the Pompeiians' skin, burnt inside their mouths and noses, and left them to die an excruciating death. </p> <p>The volcano, then.</p>",

The continent's biggest glacier, which has been systematically measured for the last eight years, has lost a 10 metre thickness of ice and retreated 5km inland. If the thinning goes on at that rate, the entire glacier could disappear into the ocean within a few hundred years. There have been fears for more than a decade that the west Antarctic ice sheet could be unstable. The region holds enough ice to raise worldwide sea levels by 5 metres, flooding coastal cities such as London, New York, Tokyo, and Calcutta. An international panel of climate scientists last week confirmed that the Arctic ice sheet had thinned by 40% because of global warming in the northern hemisphere - but said there were so far no signs of similar thinning near the south pole. But researchers from University College, London and the British Antarctic Survey report in Science magazine today that the Pine Island glacier, the largest in the west Antarctic, has lost 32 cubic kilometres of ice over a 5,000 sq km area since 1992.

      "body": "<p>You get an impression of the scale of Llanwern steelworks when you enter Newport by train. It begins soon after you emerge from the Severn Tunnel and continues to the edge of Newport - miles of tangled, starkly beautiful concrete and metal. Llanwern says welcome to Wales, with all its industrial pride - and pain. For, after yesterday's announcement by the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Corus, it is to be reduced to a shell, steel making is to end, and generations of endeavour will be laid to rest.</p> <p>The closure of a factory (and that is what, within 18 months, is likely to happen) is just a statistic, unless you have lived with it all your life. All through my childhood, I could see the blast furnaces of Llanwern from my bedroom window. We used to fish in a stream that ran on to the land it occupies. Amazingly, it was crystal clear. Somebody was taking care. My father - and the fathers of most of my friends - worked at Llanwern, which kept the town afloat, was its beating heart.</p> <p>The factory was completed in 1961 and almost my first memory is of the Queen coming to pronounce it open a year or so later. The whole town turned out to cheer her as the procession crawled along the high street. She was young and hopeful then, and so were we. Llanwern symbolised the future and ushered in a period of prosperity and self-confidence. Large estates were built to house the families of the 10,000-plus men employed there; young families in decent, well-planned houses buying their first washing machines and Ford Cortinas.</p> <p>We took it all for granted at the time, but now it seems a period of extraordinary optimism and self-belief. Crime was low; drugs barely heard of; and people had jobs. My secondary school, Hartridge, was less than a mile from Llanwern, on the other side of the London to Swansea railway line; watching the trains and the smoke belching from the giant blast furnaces was a welcome distraction from conjugating German verbs.</p> <p>I think of the school now, a comprehensive whose intake was drawn mainly from the huge working class estate of Ringland, as having achieved something almost miraculous. It had 2,000 pupils, making it one of the largest schools in the country; covered almost 50 acres; and taught everything from Oxbridge entrants to forestry. It had a large, buoyant sixth form, as well as several villains who were definitely not there to conjugate German verbs. Yet this amazing educational enterprise succeeded. The teachers inspired and the pupils aspired. Somewhere down the line, some thing has been lost.</p> <p>The school worked because the people worked. Llanwern supplied the money, the belief, the vision of the future - 10,000 men in steady, stable, decently paid employment meant 25,000 children getting by and getting on. Many other thousands of jobs in factories and shops and the busy port fed Llanwern, which in turn fed them. In the white-hot Wilsonian 60s, all that was taken as read. There was such a thing as society, and it was pretty good.</p> <p>In Newport yesterday, nothing was taken as read. The young men who work there - most of the older ones took early retirement long ago - were still absorbing the news. They knew it was coming, but they seemed, to the last, to believe it could be averted. They earned good money at Llanwern, they said, \u00a322,000 basic - enough to feed a family, run a car, buy a house. Now what: become a security guard for \u00a34 an hour, drive a minicab, sign on the dole? A steelworker's skills are not transferable.</p> <p>Mostly, they worried about their children, who henceforth would not be able to have the things they were used to: computer games, football kits, proper holidays. These men are mostly in their 30s and 40s, the prime of life. Or not, given yesterday's news. The picture is just as bleak in Ebbw Vale, where the closure of the tinplate works and the loss of 800 jobs is a crushing blow for the town, whose factory once employed 13,000 people.</p> <p>Metropolitan politicians and New Labour lawyers should spend more time in the industrial constituencies to understand the extent to which life here has always revolved around work. Not content with spending most of their waking hours at work (my father used to more or less live there, working endless double shifts and weeks of night shifts), they then drink together in works-based pubs and clubs. Work provided not just the means to live, but the mode of life: a shared experience and identity.</p> <p>I left all this behind in 1975 to go to university, so perhaps it is hypocritical for me to laud the culture now, but it had a strength and vitality, a belief in the power of collective action, and a commitment to progress that we appear to have lost.</p> <p>As the men gathered in the pubs on the Ringland estate yesterday recognised, Llanwern is being sacrificed at the altar of market forces, the victim of an overvalued pound and a distant management that does not give a damn about the workforce, that did not even have the courtesy to tell them before it told the media.</p> <p>Another 1,340 people on the dole (plus contract staff), to add to the 7,000 jobs lost at Llanwern since Thatcher came to power. More would-be recruits to the growing army of low-paid shelf stackers and security personnel; more children with disaffected, bored, impoverished parents; more encouragement for alcoholism, drugs, depression and violence; another blow to a community denied a reason for being.</p> <p>Over the past 20 years, the workforce at Llanwern has been cut and labour systematically casualised. Stable jobs of the 60s and 70s have become contract-based; the sense of purpose of the workforce been lost; the right to a democratic role in the application of its labour has largely been denied. As unemployment in the town has risen - and jobs have become more short-term - Newport has changed in character, with rising crime, a growing drug problem, a reputation for violence, and poor educational performance. Only a fool would say that the two trends - the denial of decent jobs and the rise in social instability - were unrelated.</p> <p>Communities need to understand what they are. Newport, Ebbw Vale and the towns of the Welsh valleys did once, when mining and steel making gave them their raison d'etre. They had enormous pride and passion for the jobs they did, the products they made. Think of the brass bands and the choirs and the great rugby teams produced in south Wales. In 1963 Newport beat the All Blacks, the most powerful rugby nation in the world. That was the town's field of dreams, and dreams could come true.</p> <p>Culturally, south-east Wales is a confused place: certainly not English, but highly suspicious of Welsh-speaking Wales. Plaid Cymru hardly registers here (though it might now); the region did not vote for the assembly; the number of Welsh speakers is low. The resurgence of the Welsh language over the past 30 years that has given new strength to west and north-west Wales has let in no light here. All it had was its industrial might; now that has gone too. Llanwern was a symbol as well as a practical provider of jobs, and symbols matter.</p> <p>It was wet and bleak in Newport yesterday, as it often is. When I first moved away, I could not understand why it no longer rained every day. The older men in the club looked on, believing nothing could be done to save the jobs or the plant. \"It'll be closed in 18 months,\" said one. \"There'll be nothing left.\" They had seen it all before, lost their jobs or been pensioned off in the Thatcher years. Now their sons were getting the same treatment. \"Will you take industrial action?\" the young men were asked. \"What's the point?\" said one. \"That would just be playing into their hands.\"</p> <p>In 1839, the people of south-east Wales, tired of political marginalisation and economic exploitation, marched on Newport. The aim of what came to be called the Chartist Rising was to seize the town and trigger a series of insurrections across Britain that would result in the implementation of the movement's demands for democracy.</p> <p>Planning was rudimentary, the dragoons positioned in the Westgate Hotel were ruthless (20 bodies were left in the high street when the marchers were put to flight), and the nascent revolution failed. The marchers were led by John Frost, a former mayor of Newport, who was sentenced to death but ultimately transported for his part in the uprising.</p> <p>The main square in the town centre is today named after Frost, but it is a fair bet that not one in a hundred of the shoppers in the square who hurry past the town's museum on their way to the discount shops in the John Frost Centre know who he was, or why civic leaders once thought that his protest should be remembered so publicly.</p> <p>A more appropriate target for anyone who might wish to raise a squeak of protest on this occasion would be the monstrously ugly 400-room Celtic Manor Hotel, with its three championship golf courses and \u00a310m luxury clubhouse. Presumably, the dragoons would this time be strategically positioned to guard the impeccably kept greens. Sadly, I do not think they will be needed: there is no Frost to lead, and no apparent will to follow. The fight went out of the town in 1981, when the long steel strike in opposition to job cuts finally crumbled.</p> <p>The Labour MP for Newport East is Alan Howarth, who became the Conservative MP for Stratford-on-Avon in the Thatcher landslide of 1983 and served the Tories for 12 years before crossing the floor in 1995. Newport, a Labour pocket borough for 60 years, was his reward for having defected. Perhaps at the next election his constituents will wish to pass comment on his support for Lady Thatcher and her New Labour offspring. It isn't insurrection, but it's a start.</p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/story/0,3604,431802,00.html\">01.02.2001: 5,000 jobs go in steel closure plan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,431290,00.html\"> 31.01.2001: Union will press on with Llanwern bid </a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,430948,00.html\"> 31.01.2001: Anger as Corus rejects takeover bid</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,430694,00.html\">30.01.2001, comment: Smeltdown</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.corusgroup.com/ \" target=\"_new\">Key player: Corus</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.istc-tu.org/\" target=\"_new\">Key player: ISTC (Iron and Steel Trades Confederation) trade union</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Key player: DTI</a></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Films</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Woman Of The Year</strong><br> (George Stevens, 1942) <br>9.55pm, TCM <br>The first inspired pairing of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. He's a sports hack, she's a high-flown political columnist pontificating on the banning of baseball. The gender politics don't bear close examination (when will she settle down?) but the pair clash beautifully and comically, thanks to Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner Jr's Oscar-winning script. </p> <p><strong> Armored Car Robbery </strong><br> (Richard Fleischer, 1950) <br>6pm, FilmFour <br>Taut, semi-documentary-style heist movie that helped set the tone for any number of thrillers, from Kubrick's The Killing to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. Charles McGraw stars as Cordell, the determined cop seeking revenge when his buddy is killed in a shoot-out, with an armed gang escaping with the loot. He almost meets his match in William Talman's calculating criminal mastermind, Pervus. </p> <p><strong> City Of Angels</strong> (Brad Siberling, 1998)<br> 6pm, Sky Premier <br>A loose reworking of Wim Wenders' marvellous Wings Of Desire, Siberling's sweet romance has Meg Ryan as a down-to-earth surgeon being wooed by Nicolas Cage's angel: he's one of many roaming Los Angeles doing good deeds, but now he's prepared to hand in his wings for love. An intelligent, funny and appealing film, despite the pedestrian climax. </p> <p><strong> Once Upon A Time In America (Part I) </strong> <br>(Sergio Leone, 1984) <br>10pm, Sky <br>Cinema Leone's homage to America and its movies is a sprawling gangster saga spanning nearly 50 years in the lives of five Jewish hoods. Like his westerns, it's a potent mix of grand vista, intense violence and reflection. Robert De Niro is compelling as Noodles, a powerful man eaten up by the guilt of a betrayed friendship; James Woods highly charged as a manic crook. There's also an swirling Morricone score. </p> <p><strong> Meet The Applegates</strong><br> (Michael Lehmann, 1990)<br> 2.15am, FilmFour<br> There's at least a chuckle a minute in this sci-fi horror spoof from the director of the wickedly funny Heathers. The Applegates are in fact giant intelligent bugs who have left their threatened Brazilian rainforest community to pose as humans in Median, Ohio. Their mission: to destroy the local nuclear power plant. Except that the insects are quickly subsumed into the smalltown rat-race, mum Stockard Channing hooked on shopping, the kids on dope and sex - daughter Cami Cooper having a disconcerting tendency to revert to her true form when over-excited. Mandible-sharp parody.<br> <strong> Paul Howlett </strong></p> <p> <strong>Sports </strong></p> <p><strong> Live Golf</strong><br> 8pm, Sky Sports 3<br> The first day of the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, a tournament so popular they need three courses to accomodate the golfers. Among the Ams this year are Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood and Joe Pesci and, less predictably, the ageing but still noisy hellraiser Alice Cooper. All the US PGA Tour regulars will be there too, although Tiger Woods' knee injury makes him doubtful to start. <br><strong> Simon Burnton</strong> </p>",

      "bodyText": "Films Woman Of The Year (George Stevens, 1942) 9.55pm, TCM The first inspired pairing of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. He's a sports hack, she's a high-flown political columnist pontificating on the banning of baseball. The gender politics don't bear close examination (when will she settle down?) but the pair clash beautifully and comically, thanks to Michael Kanin and Ring Lardner Jr's Oscar-winning script. Armored Car Robbery (Richard Fleischer, 1950) 6pm, FilmFour Taut, semi-documentary-style heist movie that helped set the tone for any number of thrillers, from Kubrick's The Killing to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. Charles McGraw stars as Cordell, the determined cop seeking revenge when his buddy is killed in a shoot-out, with an armed gang escaping with the loot. He almost meets his match in William Talman's calculating criminal mastermind, Pervus. City Of Angels (Brad Siberling, 1998) 6pm, Sky Premier A loose reworking of Wim Wenders' marvellous Wings Of Desire, Siberling's sweet romance has Meg Ryan as a down-to-earth surgeon being wooed by Nicolas Cage's angel: he's one of many roaming Los Angeles doing good deeds, but now he's prepared to hand in his wings for love. An intelligent, funny and appealing film, despite the pedestrian climax. Once Upon A Time In America (Part I) (Sergio Leone, 1984) 10pm, Sky Cinema Leone's homage to America and its movies is a sprawling gangster saga spanning nearly 50 years in the lives of five Jewish hoods. Like his westerns, it's a potent mix of grand vista, intense violence and reflection. Robert De Niro is compelling as Noodles, a powerful man eaten up by the guilt of a betrayed friendship; James Woods highly charged as a manic crook. There's also an swirling Morricone score. Meet The Applegates (Michael Lehmann, 1990) 2.15am, FilmFour There's at least a chuckle a minute in this sci-fi horror spoof from the director of the wickedly funny Heathers. The Applegates are in fact giant intelligent bugs who have left their threatened Brazilian rainforest community to pose as humans in Median, Ohio. Their mission: to destroy the local nuclear power plant. Except that the insects are quickly subsumed into the smalltown rat-race, mum Stockard Channing hooked on shopping, the kids on dope and sex - daughter Cami Cooper having a disconcerting tendency to revert to her true form when over-excited. Mandible-sharp parody. Paul Howlett Sports Live Golf 8pm, Sky Sports 3 The first day of the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, a tournament so popular they need three courses to accomodate the golfers. Among the Ams this year are Kevin Costner, Clint Eastwood and Joe Pesci and, less predictably, the ageing but still noisy hellraiser Alice Cooper. All the US PGA Tour regulars will be there too, although Tiger Woods' knee injury makes him doubtful to start. Simon Burnton",

      "body": "<p>In room 31 of Helsinki district courts, Tuomo Tapani-Salo is in trouble. Three years ago, on a ferry trip from Sweden, he was found with a bag full of cigarettes, alcohol and perfume stolen from the ship's duty-free shop. The short, barrel-shaped skinhead insists he was carrying the bag for a friend, Johannes. Johannes cannot be prosecuted because he was under 15 at the time. But he is in court to back up Tuomo's story, wearing two black eyes and army fatigues, courtesy of his national service.</p> <p>Outside you could be in any courthouse in Britain. Anxious parents in their frayed Sunday best, the accused affecting studied nonchalance, bored policemen in uniform and lawyers carrying battered briefcases; all wait, whisper and walk in expectant circles on polished floors that smell of cheap disinfectant.</p> <p>But inside, the room is a bare setting of wooden panelling and fluorescent glare. No emblem, crest or Latin scripture is embossed on the wall laying claim to the higher ideals of truth and justice. Just the sign of a cellphone inside a red circle with a red line through it - a sign of the times in a country where there are more mobiles than people.</p> <p>Tuomo stands to hear the verdict. Not guilty, says the judge, and he and Johannes head out for a smoke with a smile. Next door, in room 32, six people have been tried. Two for possession of drugs, three for violent assault and one on 17 different charges ranging from possession of an illegal firearm to twice driving under the influence of drugs. Only the latter goes to prison, for an eight-month stretch. The rest are fined.</p> <p>Seven cases, six guilty verdicts; one imprisoned, six walk free. Another morning in the Finnish judicial system - a country with the lowest prison population in the European Union. Here they have made it a point of principle to keep criminals out of prison, unless they are believed to pose a risk to society.</p> <p>\"I don't believe longer prison sentences help our real safety,\" says Markku Salminen, general director of the Finnish prison administration. \"If you put someone in prison, then it is almost certain that they'll be released and go back again. Prison is like university - the university of crime.\"</p> <p>This, the Finns believe, is particularly true of the young, who are only incarcerated for the harshest crimes.</p> <p>This liberal approach can produce what looks like very illiberal results. Rapists can sometimes walk out of a Finnish court with a conditional sentence - depending on the circumstances in which the crime was committed, and whether it was a first offence.</p> <p>It wasn't always like this. As recently as the 70s, Finland had one of the highest prison populations in western Europe. But since then the number of prisoners has been falling dramatically, to just below the rest of Scandinavia, even as the rates and patterns of crime have kept in line with its Nordic neighbours.</p> <p>The move to cut the prison population began not with politicians but academics during the late 60s. Inspired by the radicalism of the age, intellectuals insisted that criminal policy should be part of an overall social policy, related to employment and educational opportunities, and proclaimed that there was no evidence of a link between long prison sentences and less crime. \"The outcome of all this was a criminal political ideology - humane neo-classicism - which stressed both legal safeguards against coercive care and the objective of less repressive measures in general,\" says the head of the national research institute of legal policy in Finland, Tappio Lappi-Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. \"Instead of direct or simple deterrence, the theory speaks of indirect general prevention or - more often - the moral-creating and value-shaping effect of punishment.\"</p> <p>Gradually but consistently these abstract principles began to be translated into action by a mixture of decriminalising some offences (such as public drunkenness), relaxing sentencing on others, and reducing the minimum prison sentence from four months in 1976 to just 14 days in 1989.</p> <p>The most dramatic changes were in the sanctions for two specific crimes - drink-driving and theft. During the mid-70s, judges were allowed greater scope to impose conditional sentences and fines instead of imprisonment. In the 90s community service also became a popular punishment for both, leaving only repeat offenders and rare cases ending up behind bars.</p> <p>The results, in terms of prison population, were startling. In 1971, 38% of those sentenced for theft went to jail; in 1991, it was 11%. Similarly, in 1971, 70% of drink-drivers were sentenced to prison; in 1981, it was 12%. There was no commensurate increase in rates of theft or drink-driving.</p> <p>Remarkably, given the high and permanent profile that law and order has attained in British political culture, this ideologically inspired sea-change was introduced without any political comment or interference. So while crime has been extensively theorised, it has not been politicised for electoral advantage. \"Finnish criminal policy is exceptionally expert-oriented,\" says Lappi-Sepp\u00e4l\u00e4. \"In a small country like this, reforms have been prepared and conducted by a relatively small group of experts. So far, Finnish politicians have been able to resist the temptation of low-level populism on this issue.\"</p> <p>\"I was relieved when I was sentenced to community service,\" he says. \"I've been to prison a few times before and it isn't useful for me. Many of my friends think it was too soft a sentence but they don't know what it's like. I think this will be my last time, where crime is concerned.\"</p> <p>If Jarmo succeeds, it will be against the odds. Whatever community service in Finland does achieve, it does not stop people getting into trouble. Three-quarters of those given community service, which usually involves menial work or helping the disabled or the elderly, reoffend, compared with 80% who are released from prison.</p> <p>Maija Kukkonen, head of the probation service, says the rate is high but does not denote a failure of the system. \"So long as the rate is lower than those who are released from prison, or even if it was the same, then I would say it is a success. Because so long as they are on community service, they are still with their family, they can keep their house and job, pay their taxes and they remain in society. When people come out of prison, they often have nothing.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is convinced. As he begins the Wednesday night police patrol through central Helsinki, Markku Salminen says that without the threat of prison, it is difficult to enforce the law. But five hours into his shift, there does not seem to be that much law to enforce: he has yelled at a jay walker, and dealt with one parking incident, a woman who could not turn off her car alarm, a man who would not pay his restaurant bill, and an elderly couple who have been terrorised by their violent son (who hit his father over the head with his shoe).</p> <p>Finland remains a relatively safe country. Polls show that police are regarded as more trustworthy than priests. And they have earned it. The detection rate for murder is around 96%, compared with 26% in America. It is this, not prison, that prevents crime, says Salminen, who used to be a detective. \"People never think about what kind of punishment they are going to receive when they commit a crime. They worry about getting caught.\"</p> <p>Ronja Siren was dealing in drugs, guns and explosives, in a gang of 50, when she was caught. Sitting in the H\u00e4meenlinna closed prison, where she is serving a nine-year sentence, she says she uses the gym as a physical outlet for the emotional stress of being separated from her two young children and husband, who is also in prison. \"The gym is very important to me. I go there every evening that I can. If I am going to get myself out of this situation, it will be down to myself,\" she says.</p> <p>The regime in H\u00e4meenlinna, just over 60 miles from Helsinki, is strict but not oppressive. Prisoners are locked up from 10 at night to six in the morning, when they must slop out the buckets they use for toilets. Most have televisions and videos in their rooms and, on each wing, there is a communal area where they can eat and relax. But the rest of the time there is a range of work and study activities which they can do if they wish.</p> <p>Siren's offence shows just how crime patterns in the region are changing. With Russia and Estonia now opened up, Finland, like the rest of Scandinavia, has become vulnerable to drugs smuggling and small-scale mafia activity, which has prompted both a rise in foreign prisoners and a more hardened, desperate type of criminal.</p> <p>For with more serious crime comes stiffer sentences, which means the average time spent in prison is growing. Last year, for the first time in a long time, the prison population increased by 8%.</p> <p>Moreover, by adding heroin and amphetamine to the nation's favourite drug, alcohol, a growing number of drug-abusing inmates have created a sub-culture in prison which is demanding a more repressive response from guards. \"Prisoners trade drugs, which leads to a debt system where one prisoner owes another money or cigarettes which can then lead to violence,\" says Anna-Kaarina Gr\u00f6nholm, the governor of Helsinki prison. \"So we have to continually have checks, urine tests and raids, which does change the atmosphere within a prison.\" Those with serious drug or alcohol dependency are also less likely to be suitable for community service, thereby compounding the likelihood of them going to jail.</p> <p>In the nearby open prison of Vanaja, the atmosphere is more relaxed but the sanctions for transgression more severe. Prisoners here are free to come and go as they please, so long as they check in at night, and have access to a sauna, skis and a tennis court. Some work at sewing, weaving or gardening within the grounds. Others commute to colleges in the area.</p> <p>One woman, convicted of white-collar crime, drives the 60 miles to Helsinki every day to a regular job and is monitored with the use of a special kind of mobile phone. They are paid a wage or grant from which they pay taxes. Most are being prepared for release, and any breach of the rules would put them back in the closed prison.</p> <p>Hessu, 70, who killed his wife 10 years ago, came to Vanaja recently after a spell in a closed prison, and works in the library. \"It's not hard to get used to here because you can freely come and go so I feel like I'm half-way to civilian life already,\" says the former merchant seaman.</p> <p>But there is evidence that the consensus that produces this comfort may be showing signs of strain. The expert-led approach to prison policy has partly been able to work because it has been shielded from the popular scrutiny. When it was formulated Finns had just a couple of state television channels and an exclusively broadsheet print media, and were primarily preoccupied with Russian foreign policy.</p> <p>Now the Finns are members of the EU, there are several cable channels and two vibrant tabloids. So perception of crime has increased, even when crime has not; between 1992 and 2000, the purchase of burglar alarms almost trebled, and special windows and door protection rose nine fold.</p> <p>Moreover, the political consensus which produced it was underpinned by an economic cohesion that no longer exists, with some families already into a second generation which has not known work. The time may be ripe for a populist demagogic attack on perceived leniency.</p> <p>The fragility was shown a few years ago when a paedophile and murderer, Yamu, was up for release. With a culture where tabloids could now set the agenda, the prospect of his release sparked great public interest. On the website of one of the red-top papers were two questions.</p> <p>The first: \"Do you think Yamu should be released?\"</p> <p>The second: \"Do you think our prison sentencing is tough enough?\"</p>",

Hessu, 70, who killed his wife 10 years ago, came to Vanaja recently after a spell in a closed prison, and works in the library. \"It's not hard to get used to here because you can freely come and go so I feel like I'm half-way to civilian life already,\" says the former merchant seaman. But there is evidence that the consensus that produces this comfort may be showing signs of strain. The expert-led approach to prison policy has partly been able to work because it has been shielded from the popular scrutiny. When it was formulated Finns had just a couple of state television channels and an exclusively broadsheet print media, and were primarily preoccupied with Russian foreign policy. Now the Finns are members of the EU, there are several cable channels and two vibrant tabloids. So perception of crime has increased, even when crime has not; between 1992 and 2000, the purchase of burglar alarms almost trebled, and special windows and door protection rose nine fold. Moreover, the political consensus which produced it was underpinned by an economic cohesion that no longer exists, with some families already into a second generation which has not known work. The time may be ripe for a populist demagogic attack on perceived leniency. The fragility was shown a few years ago when a paedophile and murderer, Yamu, was up for release. With a culture where tabloids could now set the agenda, the prospect of his release sparked great public interest. On the website of one of the red-top papers were two questions. The first: \"Do you think Yamu should be released?\" The second: \"Do you think our prison sentencing is tough enough?\"",

      "body": "<p>The writer, raconteur and world educator Ninian Smart, has died aged 73. He was an inspirational professor of religious studies over more than four decades, and a powerful advocate of the study of religion for the enrichment of common humanity. </p> <p>From beginning to end, he enjoyed a high academic profile. His father was professor of astronomy at Glasgow University, and he had two brothers who also reached professorial rank. Educated at Glasgow Academy, he was in the British Army Intelligence Corps from 1945-48, where he learned Chinese (via Confucian texts) and had his first extended contact with Sri Lankan Buddhism. He established his prowess in philosophy at Oxford University, graduating in 1949, and subsequently in Sanskrit and Pali, the language of the Buddhist scriptures, at Yale. </p> <p>After lectureships at University College, Aberystwyth, and London University, he was appointed professor, successively at the universities of Birmingham (1961-66), Lancaster (1967-82) and California (1976-98). He was also visiting professor at Yale, Wisconsin, Princeton, Banaras, Queensland, Otago, Cape Town, Bangalore and Hong Kong. </p> <p>In Britain, in the 1960s, Smart began challenging what he saw as the intellectual hegemony of much contemporary Christian theology. This was done in lectures and publications but, above all, in his appointment, in 1967, to the first professorial chair of religious studies at Lancaster. With his colleagues, he developed this new department, which, unusually, made no assumptions about the religious convictions of its staff, into a teaching and research centre of world renown, attentive to diverse religions and multi-disciplinary in approach, drawing on the full range of social sciences. </p> <p>Smart also promoted this spirit of critical openness in relation to religious education in schools. He set out the agenda in Secular Education And The Logic Of Religion (1968), and, in 1969, was a founding co-chair of the Shap working party on world religions in education. At the same time, he was appointed director of the influential Schools Council religious education projects (primary and secondary). For the best part of a decade, these projects set about demonstrating a dimensional model for religious education whose academic integrity would outflank the abolitionists. The model became imitable in places as far afield as Australia, Canada, New Zealand and southern Africa. </p> <p>For much of the last 20 years, Smart was based firmly in the department of religious studies at Santa Barbara, for part of the time acting as chair and latterly serving as elected president of the American Academy of Reli gion. His own liberal spirit and sense of justice found a match in the vibrancy of living in America. Thousands of teachers and scholars would acknowledge his inspiration. </p> <p>The flower-in-buttonhole and smiling anecdote, the rapier mind, the warmth and generosity were his hallmarks. Though he wore his learning lightly, he was the prolific author of more than 30 books, and the epic television series exploring world religions, <strong>The Long Search</strong>, originally shown in 1977. </p> <p>Genuinely understanding the world as seen by others was a major priority for Smart, but he was not content to leave descriptive representation without acknowledging its challenge for the starting point of others. Thus his engagement with Buddhism was always acknowledged as raising questions for and providing insights into Christianity, and, almost incidentally, in relation to his own Anglican/ Episcopalian faith. </p> <p>Just as no religion is an island, so Smart also argued that no culture and civilisation is without its religion or world view. Failure to realise this can be a threat both to peace and the human imagination. Accordingly, he was keen to demonstrate the loss to philosophy and political science which can arise if religion is not fully understood in its own terms. This is evident from his book, <strong>World Philosophies (1999)</strong>, and his writings on nationalism, Mao, ideologies and modern India. </p> <p>After his years in California, Smart had just returned to Lancaster with his Italian wife Libushka (they married in 1954) when he collapsed and died. There had been no promise to reintroduce the peacocks, as in their earlier Lancastrian base (in what he claimed to be the first house ever built of concrete); nor had he made any renewed commitment to stand in Lancaster for the SNP. But he was an inveterate doodler, ever tempted to pen the mischievous haiku, or the article before breakfast on the aesthetics of cricket. He had not grown weary with the world. </p> <p>He is survived by Libushka, two daughters and a son. </p> <p> Roderick Ninian Smart, academic, born May 6 1927; died January 29 2001</p>",

This is evident from his book, World Philosophies (1999), and his writings on nationalism, Mao, ideologies and modern India. After his years in California, Smart had just returned to Lancaster with his Italian wife Libushka (they married in 1954) when he collapsed and died. There had been no promise to reintroduce the peacocks, as in their earlier Lancastrian base (in what he claimed to be the first house ever built of concrete); nor had he made any renewed commitment to stand in Lancaster for the SNP. But he was an inveterate doodler, ever tempted to pen the mischievous haiku, or the article before breakfast on the aesthetics of cricket. He had not grown weary with the world. He is survived by Libushka, two daughters and a son. Roderick Ninian Smart, academic, born May 6 1927; died January 29 2001",

Why, exactly, I ask? Because, they say, Adrian Mole is the ultimate loser. But I don't agree. And I should know: Adrian and I have grown up together, ever since I read the then newly published Secret Diary of Adrian Mole Aged 13 3/4, back in 1983, when I was 13 3/4. </p> <p>We didn't hit it off immediately. For a start, I had a problem with the title: at that age, boys have dropped the precious practice of adding fractions to their age. It seemed patronising. And I never lost the sense that I was reading something written by a woman who hadn't quite got into a boy's head (most of us at that age are not obsessed by the size of their \"things\"). </p> <p>He may not have been entirely convincing as an individual but then Adrian and his family were created specifically to sit on the fault line between the disfranchised working classes and those destined to be sucked into Thatcher's social revolution. That is why it was an inspired move by Sue Townsend to set her kitchen-sink drama during the great upheaval. </p> <p>But the stroke of genius was to turn it into a slapstick comedy. In truth, the first time I read the books, they didn't seem that funny. But returning to them 20 years later, I can see how wrong I was. They are hilarious. Perhaps at the time I was just a little too close to the material. </p> <p>And perhaps they have actually improved with age, sitting very comfortably as period pieces. (It is astonishing how little has changed from Adrian's world: in the first book, Ken Livingstone is running London, the railways are a mess and the Guardian even drops the odd clanger.) </p> <p>Despite all this, Adrian and I understood each other as only two 13-year-old schoolboys could have done. And we were bonded by our shared horror of the comprehensive school system - the teaching methods had changed little since the war. His account of the rock-hard rugby pitch on January mornings still makes me wince. </p> <p>I have no idea how Townsend managed to capture that time but it rang utterly true. Like all of us, Adrian's true place in the world was defined by how he first conducted himself at school. Both of us found that world alienating. And although I swam and he sank, we were both formed by the experience, although one of my old schoolfriends admits that I reminded him of Adrian Mole at the time \"in some of the nerdy aspects\". </p> <p>But it went horribly wrong for Adrian after he left school: Townsend made a mistake by keeping him out of university. The higher education system was expanding at an explosive rate at the time and you could nearly always find somewhere that would take you. I have no idea why Townsend decided to keep Adrian out of that. Maybe she didn't relish the challenge of entering a world already so expertly portrayed by Malcolm Bradbury and David Lodge. </p> <p>But Adrian Mole: The Redbrick Years would have been a triumph. Imagine: the missing grant cheques, the deranged tutors, the tales of Pandora's string of Oxbridge successes. I feel I could sit down and write it myself. </p> <p>The real tragedy of Adrian's failure to grapple with higher education, though, is that it marked the point when he and I parted company. After that moment, if we were to meet in the pub there would always be something separating us: that system I went through that he never did and now never could. Perhaps that was why Townsend did not send him to university: Adrian's comedy always came out of tragedy. There was more to be gained from contemplating the implication of what might have been, rather than what was. </p> <p>But that failure to go on to university marked the moment that the books lost their edge. The Wilderness Years, which saw Adrian at 23 and working in a local government office in Oxford, were not what they should have been - they were the juvenile jottings of an insecure adolescent rather than the diaries of a young man trying to make his way in the world. </p> <p>Part of me wishes the books had left Adrian in childhood. At the end of The Growing Pains it would have been so easy to imagine that it all could have turned out so well. How painful to discover that in fact, when we reconvened, it had all gone horribly wrong. By time of the time of The Wilderness Years, Adrian had stopped being confused and naive. He was stupid. </p> <p>The fine line between the brilliance of the early Mole books and mere eccentricity was clearly demonstrated in Townsend's 1987 Rebuilding Coventry, which followed a 40-year-old woman's midlife crisis: without the filter of Adrian's naivety, it came across as an oddly surreal affair. </p> <p>I suspect that, on some level, Townsend already knew Adrian was running into trouble. In 1986, when asked by the Times whether she would take Adrian into adulthood, she admitted: \"There's something almost distasteful about it because I know it would sell and I would feel I was cashing in on it. It's an easy thing for me to do now and I just want to do something different.\" The Cappuccino Years - the latest book, adapted for the new television series - reveals most brutally the problems of sticking with Adrian. It covers the period when New Labour has just come to power. Adrian is living in London with an estranged wife and two estranged children, and forced to watch Pandora's ascent as a Blair babe. The satirical jokes hit the mark, but Adrian himself seems somehow incidental to the business of landing as many blows on New Labour as possible. The fact is that he is inextricably linked to Margaret Thatcher and her era. When she went so, to some extent, did he. </p> <p>But there is a delicious irony in the fact that Adrian has ended up here in the pages of the Guardian, after having viewed it with awe for so many years. And it has given him a new lease of life. I only hope Townsend has a happy ending planned for Adrian. He has had his ups and downs (mostly downs) but he deserves his shot at happiness. I have a horror that one day she will kill him off. And if that happens something inside me will die as well. </p> <p>\u0095 Adrian Mole: The Cappuccino Years, tonight on BBC1 at 9.30pm, except Scotland where it begins on Monday at 10.35pm.

The Aston Villa manager John Gregory last night confirmed he wants to sign the Colombia midfielder Mauricio Serna from the Argentine side Boca Juniors. Gregory hopes to fly Serna into England this week to thrash out a deal for the 33-year-old. Arrigo Sacchi has resigned as Parma's coach after only 23 days, citing \"personal problems\". The club announced his departure minutes after the 2-1 Italian Cup defeat at Udinese yesterday evening and said Renzo Ulivieri would take over immediately. It is believed that since Sacchi, the 54-year-old former Italy coach, took over at Parma he has discovered health problems. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

That traditional male reply to Freud's famous question turns out to be a significant part of the answer proposed by this Mel Gibson rom-com, with its incidental emphasis on a considerate, intelligent response to a woman's needs in the bedroom department. At any rate, both Sigmund's question and Mel's movie assume that what men want is clear and unproblematic - that's not a mystery. Is it? </p> <p>Produced and directed by Nancy Meyers (an industry veteran and author of Private Benjamin, but a relative newcomer to the director's chair), this is a genial, reasonably entertaining date movie about Nick, an ageing, defiantly non-PC ladies' man, played by Gibson, whose bedpost is a veritable forest of notches. He's an ad exec, specialising in campaigns featuring attractive young women in thongs, a swingin' kind of guy who plays Frank Sinatra records in his apartment. </p> <p>But his world is inverted, in the time-honoured manner, by a woman. Gibson's boss, worldly Alan Alda, tells him that women are making the buying decisions nowadays, and therefore he is being passed over for the creative director's job in favour of someone who can intuit female consumers' desires: the ubiquitous Helen Hunt, here in professional glam mode, but, as ever, trading on what Hollywood sees as her non-threatening ordinariness. </p> <p>Struggling to get his head round the whole woman thing, Mel is accidentally electrocuted in his bathroom and subsequently discovers that he has the ability to hear what women are thinking: he is Empathy Man with X-Ray Hearing, and uses his superpowers to undermine Helen in the office and ratchet up his already sky-high strike rate with the ladies. </p> <p>This might have been more interesting, and certainly more daring, if it had been ambiguous: if we could never be sure if Nick can really hear what women are thinking, or if it is just a kind of paranoid psychosis - which would explain why all the remarks he hears are superficially embarrassing, but fundamentally flattering. </p> <p>The film's unspoken premise is that we always know what Mel wants: we don't need weird powers to know what he is thinking. With adorably candid Mel, what you've got on the label is what you've got in the can. It's just these pesky women who are so sphinx-like. But this is the ultimate seduction. In getting inside their heads, instead of just their pants, Mel is enjoying a bit of The Other in a very real sense. </p> <p>What Women Want could have been an exquisitely nasty black comedy - something that Neil LaBute might have directed. But, naturally, something that makes Mel look like a bad guy is out of the question. From the outset, it is made crystal clear that he is supposed to be lovable. His character is similar in some ways to Nicolas Cage's in The Family Man: a shallow lothario in need of a woman's redemptive presence. But that film, however execrable, was sharper and tougher on the boorishness of the single professional good-time guy. </p> <p>In this, Mel is just a doll. When he wakes up of a morning, he playfully slaps his maid's bum, while she chuckles indulgently. When he overhears women thinking about him, it is all pretty complimentary stuff. For example, he never hears anyone think: \"Jesus, look at the dye-job on that.\" </p> <p>On getting Marisa Tomei into bed, he is momentarily put off his rhythm by hearing her think his pork truncheon is not quite as massive as she'd like - oo-er! - but nevertheless uses his powers to hear what women really want in bed, and their congress ends with her gasping what a total love machine he is. (Incidentally, the film primly withholds the details, but Mel starts jabbering to his buddy about how penis envy is nonsense: \"Half of them don't even like them!\" It's a bit of a way from the witty exclamation in Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot: \"It's a whole different sex!\") </p> <p>So what do women want? Well, the idea is given a specifically consumerist slant by Helen's job as someone hired to figure out what they want in the way of goods and services. But here they turn out to want professional parity with men; and they also want a caring and sensitive partner. And from his 15-year-old daughter by his previous marriage, Mel learns that they want a father who is There For Them. These timeless emotional issues eclipse the fact of women wanting to break through the glass ceiling and take more of the finite number of top jobs available, and the harsher zero-sum realities of this question are passed over in favour of the cuteness of Helen and Mel falling for each other. </p> <p>What Women Want is a picture that tries to have its cake and eat it by appearing to let Mel cede some of his sexual and professional status to women, and yet remain a 100% successful hunk. But it does this with a certain amount of brio, and a watchable performance from Ashley Johnson as Alex, Mel's daughter. You could do worse on a Friday night than see this.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Here is a deeply bizarre black horror- comedy about the Nosferatu vampire legend, with preposterous performances from John Malkovich and Willem Dafoe which are as ripe as melting old slabs of Brie. Malkovich plays Friedrich Murnau, the great German film director and creator of the 1922 silent classic Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens (or Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horror, a pleasingly chilling subtitle sadly unmentioned in this film). Willem Dafoe is Max Schreck, the creepy, weird, bald, pallid man who played the vampire, and whose dedication to the role in this film seems to go horrifyingly beyond mere method acting. </p> <p>Murnau is fastidious, demanding, cruel; he wears a white coat and goggles during filming, like a mad scientist. Malkovich's feathery voice is always threatening to snap down into his habitual basso- profundo roar of rage; Dafoe is perpetually snuffling, growling, gibbering and leering like nothing so much as a rabid hamster. </p> <p>The mad-visionary-director-plus-wildman-actor template is clearly inspired by the legendary relationship of Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski, responsible for the 1979 Nosferatu remake. But the working dynamic between Malkovich and Dafoe is actually much more reminiscent of Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman in Young Frankenstein. When Dafoe suddenly grabs a bat out of the night air and crams it in his greedy gob, it's impossible not to imagine Marty munching away while Gene shrilly complains: \"D-don't do that.\" </p> <p>So are we supposed to laugh at Malkovich and Dafoe, or with them, or what? How funny is it all supposed to be? I suspect it's being sold as a comedy to excuse the unintentional absurdity. The problem is that in making Max Schreck a genuine vampire, playing an imaginary vampire in a film, director E Elias Merhige and screenwriter Steven Katz are giving us twice as much vampire as we really need, and making it difficult either to suspend our disbelief for a real vampire yarn, or to see it as a culturally and psychologically revealing myth. </p> <p>After all, there is a good deal of revelation to be done. Vampirism can function as a metaphor for the parasitism in the madness of film-making. But any story about the genesis of a fascinating, charismatic figure of evil in 1920s Germany must call to mind, however indirectly, political realities outside the movie studio. Interestingly, Nosferatu sprang from the brain of F W Murnau when he was refused permission by the Bram Stoker estate to make a film about Dracula. But it was not simply a matter of changing the names - by making the principals German and transferring the action to Bremen, his vampire myth was an explicit Teutonisation of the story. This was happening at a time when National Socialism was beginning to cobble together bits of Ring-Cycle pseudo-myth and ersatz-legend to give a giant historical authenticity to its tinpot political opportunism. There is a submerged parallel in Murnau's satisfaction with the flowering of his terrible creation and Germany's secret thrill at the virility of evil and the machismo of power. </p> <p>So much for the cultural pre-history of Nazism. But is it possible to take these undercurrents, or indeed anything, seriously, in a film as wildly over the top as this? The sheer, unflinching chutzpah of these two actors as they gurn and stare like the heroes of the silent cinema is arguably impressive.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you stand outside the perimeter of HMP Grendon on an icy grey winter's morning, it's not that different from any other modern prison. It's not Pentonville or Wormwood Scrubs - it's 60s brutalist, rather than Victorian monolith - but there are the same blank walls, not as high, not as austere, but faceless, windowless, topped with the same loops of razor wire that keep the community inside apart from us outside. </p> <p>There are the same Porridge-style prison gates with a spyhole; the same prison staff in the same uniforms, carrying the same jangling keys, with which they methodically unlock and lock, unlock and lock, day in, day out, all day, every day. </p> <p>It's not until you are inside that you start to notice the difference. At first it is subtle, it creeps up on you: an unexpected camaraderie between inmates and prison staff. They chat about forthcoming events in the prison; they call each other by their first names; there is a mutual respect. The prisoners seem relaxed, the atmosphere is calm. There is none of the edgy us-and-them atmosphere that pervades other prisons - there is no sense of imminent danger. It is more like a student hall of residence than a category B prison. </p> <p>On the governor's walls hang Christmas cards from inmates, former and current. \"Thank you for giving me this chance to change,\" reads one. \"I don't have that long to go now until I'm released. I'm very confident about me and my future.\" Also posted on the wall are these words: \"If you want to know what someone is really like, give him some authority.\" </p> <p>For the old lag who has spent his entire life in and out of prison, Grendon must come as a dramatic culture shock. Inmates move around with comparative freedom: their cells are unlocked at 8am, they remain open all day, prisoners eat together and talk together, with lock-up at 9pm. Most crucially they attend daily group therapy sessions. There they confront their crimes, take responsibility for their actions and explore their lives, their pasts, their childhoods, to try to uncover why they have done what they have done and how to avoid doing it again. </p> <p>For Grendon is a therapeutic prison - the only one of its kind in the country. It opened in 1962 as an experiment in the psychological treatment of prisoners, and today it is proof that prison can be humane, constructive and life-changing. It is proof that prison can be more than sheer containment, benign or otherwise. It is proof that prison can work. </p> <p>Mark Leech served almost 20 years in 62 prisons, but since Grendon he has become an award-winning journalist, author and leading campaigner for penal reform. \"It certainly worked for me. Once you get locked into being a criminal, you just accept it. Grendon made me realise there were other options I could choose.\" </p> <p>Not everyone will leave Grendon a model citizen, but many prisoners undergo radical change. When they walk out of the gates, the hope is that they will be at least a little less aggressive, a little less hostile, a little less dangerous and a little less likely to reoffend. </p> <p>The reconviction rates are encouraging. For those prisoners serving life sentences elsewhere, there is a 24% reoffending rate; at Grendon it is 8%. For non-lifers the reoffending rate is 10% lower at Grendon than elsewhere, and if prisoners complete the therapy, which ideally runs for at least 18 months, reoffending is slashed by 20-25%. </p> <p>Set in the rolling Buckinghamshire countryside near Aylesbury, Grendon houses some of the most dangerous criminals in Britain, many of whom have severe personality disorders - 95% of inmates have committed offences of violence against the person, 27% have committed sex offences. Out of the 200 current inmates, 94 are lifers, and many have come to Grendon because traditional prisons, or \"the system\", as it is called, cannot deal with them. </p> <p>The prison is divided into therapeutic wings. Each wing is a democratised community that selects its own officials and sets its own rules. There are three key policies that everyone is expected to observe - no drugs, no sex, no violence. If you breach any of the three, your peers can decide whether you should be allowed a second chance or be kicked out. </p> <p>Sean, 37, is 10 years into a life sentence for rape. He has done time in prisons all over the country; now at Grendon, he is determined to turn his back on crime. \"I led a very active criminal lifestyle. That's been one of the things I've struggled with. It's trying to switch that off and not see things in a criminal way. </p> <p>\"I committed the rape. That was the point in my life when I thought, I've got to do something. I can't go on like that. The first six months I was put on remand I thought, I can't go on - no more hurting people and totally destroying another human's life. I needed to stop.\" </p> <p>He, like all of Grendon's inmates, had to volunteer to go there - motivation is crucial. Prisoners have to want to change. \"Grendon has taught me how to deal with people, how to communicate. Four years ago I would not have known how to communicate properly. I would have been quite intimidated, but now I feel quite confident about who I see I am as a person. </p> <p>\"I can't do with having the victims on my conscience any more. Before I could not see the victims. Now I can. I feel when I'm in other prisons that it's just reinforcing my old behaviour - me against the system. In other prisons I feel like I'm an inmate. Here I feel I'm part of a team who are working towards my progress.\" </p> <p>If Grendon works, Sean benefits, the taxpayer benefits, society benefits - arguably even his victims benefit, by knowing he is not hurting anyone else in the way they have been hurt by him. </p> <p>Daryl, 35, is serving 10 years for conspiracy to commit an armed robbery. \"I'd been a thief all my life. When I got nicked for this I thought to myself, I've got to try and sort my life out. I was sick of my own behaviour but I didn't know how to break away from it.\" </p> <p>Grendon gave him the chance. To some it looks like a cushy number - more freedom, a softer regime, an easy way to do your time. Others in the prison system can be scornful (prison officers at Grendon are called the Care Bears by colleagues elsewhere). But staff and inmates at Grendon insist it's the toughest way \"to do your bird\". The therapy is intensive, gruelling, demanding work. </p> <p>\"This has been one of the hardest things I've done,\" says Daryl. \"If you are really determined to change all aspects of your life, you have to do things you never thought you would do here. It's hard. You've got all sorts of peer pressures going on. People thinking you are a grass. It's hard to live with all that. Here you've got a chance to change your life. You just couldn't do this in a normal establishment. I believe in myself this time. I want it. That's the most important thing. You've got to want it.\" </p> <p>But what of Gary Watkins, who spent time in Grendon after being convicted of a vicious sex attack? He volunteered for Grendon; perhaps he too was determined to change. Within a month of his release on parole he kidnapped a 17-year-old girl at knifepoint, dragged her into his car, bound her with ropes and sexually assaulted her. He told Oxford crown court that he had maintained fantasies of assaulting and killing a young girl throughout his treatment. </p> <p>John Shine, Grendon's director of research and development, is realistic about the prison's achievements. \"Some people here make enormous changes. Other people we have to be extremely cautious about when assessing the real impact of therapy. We don't know what goes on in their head.\" </p> <p>Mark Morris, the prison's director of therapy, adds that the Grendon way is not necessarily the right way for every prison or every prisoner. \"One of the problems we have is the issue of people who are here to genuinely work on themselves and people who are here because they see it as an easy route. There are people trying to manipulate the structure, trying to get on top of the therapeutic community process to work in their own nefarious ways. Where that manipulative, destructive impulse is at its height, we need settings which are more control-focused.\" </p> <p>A second therapeutic prison is finally opening later this year, almost 40 years after Grendon began taking in prisoners. HMP Dovegate, at Marchington, east Staffordshire, will offer a further 200 places for prisoners who want to undergo therapy (there are currently 200 prisoners on a waiting list at Grendon), but unlike its role model it will be attached to a 600-bed traditional prison and run by a private company. </p> <p>Maybe that is progress, but it is abysmally slow, and it is against a backdrop of a spiralling prison population and a persistently punitive atmosphere. The prison officer who shows me round Grendon tells me at the end of my visit that he is in favour of bringing back hanging. Perhaps he is kidding. </p> <p>\"How can you think that when you work in a place like this?\" I ask. \"I'm a professional,\" he says. He does his job according to the rules of Grendon and he does it very well. \"But I read the reports; I see what these people have done.\" </p> <p>Grendon is humane; it is positive; it treats prisoners as human beings, no matter how heinous their crime, and it offers them an alternative. \"If you have to have prisons then this is the best way to run them,\" says Grendon's governor, Tim Newell. </p> <p>But there are those who fear that Grendon is used as a fig leaf to cover up the overwhelming failure of our prison system. While Grendon is a success story, it should not distract us from the bigger question: why do we keep on expanding our prison population when we know it is costly and inefficient, and creates more problems than it solves?</p>",

In Nicosia, players' dressing rooms are besieged and a stadium is severely damaged after a referee ends a derby half a minute before the end of the indicated stoppage-time. In the Netherlands, Den Bosch supporters riot for three days and nights after the cancellation of a match following the shooting of a fan by police. In Johannesburg, the African women's championship final is abandoned after rioting by supporters of South Africa when the referee ignores an offside flag and allows a goal by Nigeria to stand.

A few weeks ago several hundred fans of Manchester United and Leeds United, en route to matches at Bradford and Maine Road respectively, met in Rochdale for a Saturday morning head-to-head that seemed to have been prearranged. Pitched battles in the centres of Sheffield and Burnley, with associated damage to property, have followed recent bitterly contested derbies. On the internet, gangs associated with Queens Park Rangers and Arsenal exchanged taunts about last weekend's fighting in the streets around Loftus Road. Coventry supporters reacted to losing a Cup match in injury-time at Maine Road last Saturday by attacking their Manchester City counterparts in the main grandstand. And at the other end of the scale the officials of Burton Albion, unused to trouble in the Dr Martens Premier League, were shocked this month by the behaviour of two coachloads of visiting Bishop Auckland supporters, who staged two pitch invasions and fought with police during an FA Trophy tie. </p> <p>These events appear to contradict the image that football is trying hard to create. After several decades spent skulking in society's shadows, the game seemed to emerge during the 90s into a world of light and joy and festivity, a world in which Thierry Henry could perform pirouettes that would not shame Sylvie Guillem while David Beckham got in touch with his feminine side. If Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch provided the prologue to this new football culture, then its defining event was surely the party on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es on a summer night in 1998, when more than a million citizens of France celebrated the winning of the World Cup. When English fans rioted in Marseille during that tournament and again in Charleroi two years later, their misbehaviour was dismissed as a mere echo of the past, an aberration that could occur only in special circumstances. </p> <p>But the catalogue of recent events suggests that football's social makeover may have been less than entirely successful. The new image may, in fact, be no closer to the truth than the old vision of uninterrupted mayhem which made it a pariah sport in the 80s. And if football has indeed been enjoying a period of relative calm, in which the increasing affluence of the players seemed to exist in a direct inverse ratio to the decreasing violence of the spectators, then it seems to be over now. From places as far apart as Hong Kong, Kurdistan, Leipzig, Brunei, Palo Alto, Shiraz and Nairobi, reports of violence suggest that the game has once again become a focus for people who want to fight and need an excuse. </p> <p><strong> Terraced streets</strong><br> But weren't we supposed to have outgrown all that?

The FRS figures could ignite the debate surrounding Lloyds TSB's \u00a320bn bid, tabled earlier this week for Abbey. It is yet to receive clearance. A decision is expected on or before February 23 and has been clouded by speculation that it might be referred, delaying the bid by up to six months, because of the more than 25% share of current accounts a combined Lloyds TSB and Abbey would hold. Abbey is trying to position itself as a competitor to the big four. In yesterday's press it took out full page ads claiming it had attracted more than 6,000 current account customers from Lloyds TSB, Bar clays, NatWest and HSBC in January. Yet, the FRS data, which contains last year's data, shows that last year it lost 4% of its current account customers -more than any of its rivals. Abbey said last night: \"We have been advertising since the end of December and since bringing in the 0% overdraft.\" The data also shows Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland were more successful than any other current account providers in attracting new business, closely followed by institutions outside the \"big four\", including Nationwide building society, First Direct, the arm of HSBC, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Woolwich, now owned by Barclays. According to FRS, Lloyds TSB has the biggest share of current accounts - 22% - but took in 18.5% of new business. Halifax, which is widely advertising its new current account, took in 4.9% of new accounts compared with its historic market share of 4.7%.",

      "body": "<p>When Vladimir Stroguine boasted a forged credit card could be produced within hours it was to impress a new contact. The Russian con man was convinced that his new \"friend\" would become an important customer and a potential route to riches. </p> <p>Over a six-month period he had grown to trust the quiet, unassuming man whose interest initially centred on bulk buying counterfeit CDs but had suddenly switched to purchasing hi-tech \"skimming\" machines capable of copying credit card details within seconds. </p> <p>The client soon became a regular visitor to the Russian's west Hendon home and privy to details of his criminal empire which, he was to discover, included a key role in a \u00a35m credit card fraud, dubbed the most sophisticated ever seen in Britain. </p> <p>In reality Stroguine's new friend was not a businessman but an undercover investigator who was secretly recording all conversations and compiling a dossier on behalf of the City of London police. </p> <p>The plant, an ex-policeman whose identity is a closely guarded secret, infiltrated the gang on behalf of the IFPI, a body representing the international recording industry, after being tipped off about Stroguine's leading role in importing counterfeit CDs from Russia. Once inside it became clear to him that the operation was far bigger than had first been imagined. </p> <p>\"[Vladimir] was a very good salesman and happy to tell our man exactly what was on offer,\" said one police source. \"This guy had become well trusted by Vladimir as they had been talking for months.\" </p> <p>Today those confident claims will come back to haunt the tall, 44-year-old Russian when he appears at Southwark crown court for sentencing, alongside fellow countryman Alexandre Tanov, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud. </p> <p>In covertly recorded conversations, Stroguine said he could supply forged credit cards, to order, for \u00a3300 each and also admitted distributing hi-tech skimming machines - the size of a cigarette pack and able to be easily clipped on to belts. </p> <p>Stroguine was - in police parlance - a middle man fixer. He sold the fake cards and controlled a network of eastern European waiters, working at top London restaurants including Caravaggio, who were equipped with skimming machines. </p> <p>On one occasion officers tracked one group who had visited Stroguine's home and were equipped with counterfeit cards. The gang were watched enjoying a spending spree in the west end with at least three being dispatched to buy clothes in Harrods. </p> <p>Investigators were anxious to find where the cards were produced. They did not have to wait long. The undercover agent returned a skimming machine to Stroguine and Tanov arrived to take it away and download the information. Officers staking out the house then followed Tanov on an exhaustive five-hour journey across London, by taxis, trains and buses, as he travelled from Kings Cross to Seven Sisters and finally to Streatham, SW16. </p> <p>He was tracked to his front door and the pieces of the jigsaw had finally come together in late January last year. </p> <p>Confident they now had enough information, officers carried out dawn raids on addresses across London, including those of the two main suspects, but even they were surprised by what was found at Tanov's home. </p> <p>The 33-year-old Russian had turned a small bedroom into a credit card factory, at a cost of no more than \u00a33,000, complete with computers, embossers and hologram making equipment, capable of producing near perfect replicas of Visa, Amex and Master Card. </p> <p>The raids also recovered a quantity of false passports, national insurance cards and thousands of fake CDs from artists such as Mary J Blige, Boyzone and Melanie C. </p> <p>The pair were immediately arrested and stood trial towards the end of last year at Southwark crown court in south London.

      "bodyText": "When Vladimir Stroguine boasted a forged credit card could be produced within hours it was to impress a new contact. The Russian con man was convinced that his new \"friend\" would become an important customer and a potential route to riches. Over a six-month period he had grown to trust the quiet, unassuming man whose interest initially centred on bulk buying counterfeit CDs but had suddenly switched to purchasing hi-tech \"skimming\" machines capable of copying credit card details within seconds. The client soon became a regular visitor to the Russian's west Hendon home and privy to details of his criminal empire which, he was to discover, included a key role in a \u00a35m credit card fraud, dubbed the most sophisticated ever seen in Britain. In reality Stroguine's new friend was not a businessman but an undercover investigator who was secretly recording all conversations and compiling a dossier on behalf of the City of London police. The plant, an ex-policeman whose identity is a closely guarded secret, infiltrated the gang on behalf of the IFPI, a body representing the international recording industry, after being tipped off about Stroguine's leading role in importing counterfeit CDs from Russia. Once inside it became clear to him that the operation was far bigger than had first been imagined. \"[Vladimir] was a very good salesman and happy to tell our man exactly what was on offer,\" said one police source. \"This guy had become well trusted by Vladimir as they had been talking for months.\" Today those confident claims will come back to haunt the tall, 44-year-old Russian when he appears at Southwark crown court for sentencing, alongside fellow countryman Alexandre Tanov, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to defraud. In covertly recorded conversations, Stroguine said he could supply forged credit cards, to order, for \u00a3300 each and also admitted distributing hi-tech skimming machines - the size of a cigarette pack and able to be easily clipped on to belts. Stroguine was - in police parlance - a middle man fixer. He sold the fake cards and controlled a network of eastern European waiters, working at top London restaurants including Caravaggio, who were equipped with skimming machines. On one occasion officers tracked one group who had visited Stroguine's home and were equipped with counterfeit cards. The gang were watched enjoying a spending spree in the west end with at least three being dispatched to buy clothes in Harrods. Investigators were anxious to find where the cards were produced. They did not have to wait long. The undercover agent returned a skimming machine to Stroguine and Tanov arrived to take it away and download the information. Officers staking out the house then followed Tanov on an exhaustive five-hour journey across London, by taxis, trains and buses, as he travelled from Kings Cross to Seven Sisters and finally to Streatham, SW16. He was tracked to his front door and the pieces of the jigsaw had finally come together in late January last year. Confident they now had enough information, officers carried out dawn raids on addresses across London, including those of the two main suspects, but even they were surprised by what was found at Tanov's home. The 33-year-old Russian had turned a small bedroom into a credit card factory, at a cost of no more than \u00a33,000, complete with computers, embossers and hologram making equipment, capable of producing near perfect replicas of Visa, Amex and Master Card. The raids also recovered a quantity of false passports, national insurance cards and thousands of fake CDs from artists such as Mary J Blige, Boyzone and Melanie C. The pair were immediately arrested and stood trial towards the end of last year at Southwark crown court in south London. The case, which was initially disrupted after Stroguine's son Andrei was found dead on the opening day, heard their actions had defrauded cardholders of more than \u00a3200,000 but would have reached \u00a35m. Both men decided to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge, with Stroguine admitting a second trademark charge relating to the CDs, but legal sources believe they may still walk free from court today owing to the time spent on remand. The final hearing held last month, at which stringent reporting restrictions were lifted, was adjourned for medical reports after the court heard Stroguine, who claimed to have worked for the military missile division in the former Soviet Union, suffered from a heart condition. The Guardian reported on Monday that two waiters, who went under the names of Sorin Lasculescu and Ivan Guzun at the time of their arrest, were wanted in connection with this inquiry after both jumped bail. Lasculescu, aged 30, was charged with conspiracy to defraud but jumped bail. Guzun, who is also believed to use the name Ronny Gundersen, was questioned but released on bail without charge. Swiped - your card details and your cash To steal account holders' information, the Russians employed waiters who wore swipe machines while they worked in restaurants, hotels and wine bars across London. The waiters would carry a tiny machine, often on their belts, which they would use to reswipe a customer's credit card after they had been used to pay the original bill. The data in the black boxes was downloaded through a computer and sent to a blank card's magnetic strip. The fake was embossed and, using a hologram stamp imported from Russia, the gang were able to produce near-perfect replicas of Visa, Amex and MasterCard. Experts say that the interlocking globes and flying dove marks used by MasterCard and Visa were said to be of such high quality that they were almost impossible to detect. The fake cards could be hawked on the black market for \u00a3300, anticipating a month's leeway before the cardholder noticed and reported the fraud.",
