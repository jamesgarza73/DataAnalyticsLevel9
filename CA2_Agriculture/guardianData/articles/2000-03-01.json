Scholes is unfit and his natural replacement Butt starts the game. The dangermen for the visitors are playmaker Micoud, and the two strikers Laslandes and 'Mr. W' as he likes to be known, Sylvain Wiltord. Like Chelsea yesterday, United are expected to roll over their supposedly weaker French opponents.<br><strong>4</strong> Both teams taking a little while to settle, but Bordeaux have started positively - they were expected to come here and defend but they appear very comfortable coming forward and Stam has already made a couple of timely interceptions.<br><strong>6</strong> Irwin sends a delightful long ball from the left to Giggs running into the Bordeaux area. His cushioned back-header finds Sheringham outside the area, who holds and passes back to Giggs now in a more central position 15 yards from goal. His shot is scuffed and Rame makes the save.<br><strong>10</strong> Showing the increased confidence that brought him assists for two Premiership goals at the weekend, Ryan Giggs is primed to race down the left wing - only the offside trap stops him on this occasion, though not by much.<br><strong>12</strong> A perceptive through-ball from Beckham spots the run of Butt, who wrestles with Grenet whilst both hare towards the ball. Grenet loses the tussle and goes down and the referee's sympathies are with him.<br><strong>15</strong> Micoud picks up the ball in the centre circle and as the United defence back off <em>en masse</em>, he draws back the right leg and has a dig. His shot deflects to Martins on the right wing, who hits the looping ball on the volley straight into Irwin's midriff and off for a corner. Nothing comes from the set-piece but some encouragement for the visitors.<br><strong>16</strong> United break and Giggs wins a free kick on the centre-left, about 30 yards out. Beckham, who hasn't been putting these away recently, sets himself and... bends his effort up over the wall and his powerful, curling effort cannons off Rame's crossbar and back into play. The ball is cleared upfield by a relieved Alicarte.<br><strong>23</strong> After a lapse in the tempo of the game, Bordeaux break quickly down the left wing, with Diabate playing in Wiltord. His first touch is poor and his second poorer still. Martins collects on the right and crosses to Wiltord again. His first-time shot is well struck but wide of Van Der Gouw's left-hand post.<br><strong>26</strong> Bordeaux have settled into a counter-attacking strategy. So far they have held United quite effectively in defence, and have also proved proficient at working the ball upfield to Micoud and Martins.<br><strong>29</strong> A floated ball from Butt releases Sheringham through the middle and no offside flag. Rame comes outside his area to clear with his feet and his timing is perfect as he thrashes the ball away into touch.<br><strong>32</strong> Andy Cole uses his strength against Afanou through the middle and succeeds in laying the ball off to Giggs. After a few jinks and turns the Welshman twists and hits a shot across the face of goal that the Bordeaux keeper does well to grasp and hold as Cole watches for any mistakes.<br><strong>34</strong> A corner to United on the right. Beckham's cross is a high, floated delivery that Keane nods down to Cole in front Rame in the goal. As he turns and shoots, the linesman is already waving his flag to signify offside.<br><strong>41 GOAL Manchester United 1 - 0 Bordeaux</strong> Finally United provide enough imagination to break down this Bordeaux defence. Beckham in space on the right has time to measure his delivery to mesh with Giggs' run into the centre of the area. The Welsh winger meets the cross on the half-volley with his left foot and Rame has no chance.<br><strong>43</strong> Acres of space on the left for Giggs as he cuts in a delivers a high outswinger that sails over Cole's head. Butt is behind him but can only direct his header wide.<br><strong>45</strong> It's Beckham's turn this time as Cole plays a crisp one-two on the right. Beckham brings the ball inside and squares, but Afanou has rushed back and is happy to concede the corner. The set-piece is punched away and then cleared. The half-time whistle cannot come quick enough for Bordeaux.<br><strong>46</strong> The visitors get their wish. Half time.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> The match restarts. Can United rip into the French champions now that they've made the breakthrough?<br><strong>47</strong> An early chance for Bordeaux as Martins is fouled by Nicky Butt by the right cornerflag. Martins takes and Alicarte has a clear header at Van Der Gouw's near post, but his timing is off and the ball trickles out of play. Goal kick.<br><strong>50</strong> Gary Neville and Wiltord enjoy a tussle by the left-corner flag. Neville halts the Frenchman's run and is fouled for his trouble. Mr. W does seem equally at home through the middle or down the flanks.<br><strong>53</strong> Butt lunges in on Wiltord and the Frenchman skips away from his challenge. The ball is rolled out to Martins on the right side of the United area, but his touch lets him down. Van Der Gouw gathers and clears.<br><strong>55</strong> A corner for the visitors and Martins takes from the right. Alicarte has another free header and performs better than his first half effort. Beckham heads away from Van Der Gouw's left-hand post. United can clear and the ball is hoofed upfield.<br><strong>58</strong> Laslandes beats the offside trap as Jaap Stam is half a yard short on his marker. Laslandes brings it and brings it and brings it until Van Der Gouw is looming and then it's squared to Wiltord. The French international meets the ball with a relatively narrow angle to aim at, but can only hit the side netting on an open goal.<br><strong>64 Bordeaux substitution:</strong> Ziani for Martins<br><strong>66</strong> United are finally looking like coming back into this game as Bordeaux have controlled the first 20 minutes of the second half. A through-ball from Butt releases Keane on the left of the area. Rame comes out and upends the United captain. One yellow card later David Beckham steps up and bends the ball over the Bordeaux wall towards rame's right-hand post. The keeper makes up the ground well and turns the free kick around the post for a corner.<br><strong>69</strong> A shorter corner sees Beckham change the angle of attack and hit an easy centre into the unmarked Andy Cole, who controls it with two touches and then rolls it gently into the arms of Rame from 5 yards out.<br><strong>74</strong> The last fifteen minutes should prove to be a more open contest as Bordeaux need to improve on their appalling European scoring record. Van Der Gouw throws out to Giggs on the left, half-way in his own half. The winger tears away from his marker and after 60 yards down the left flank finally decides to pass it to Cole, inch-perfect from 20 yards. One touch from Cole and United have lost possession.

      "body": "<p>English cricket will undergo a massive face-lift at Lord's today when the names of the players to be offered contracts by the England and Wales Cricket Board are revealed. Neither the international nor the domestic game will be the same again. </p> <p>The principle of such contracts, which make players responsible to England rather than their counties, was agreed a year ago but it was not until the autumn that the details began to emerge. </p> <p>Up to 16 players can be contracted for this summer. At first it seemed that only 10 or 11 would be recruited at this stage, but some one-day specialists have been included as well, which may swell the numbers to the original target figure. </p> <p>The venture had been allocated \u00a31m, although because of financial difficulties this sum has already been slashed by a quarter. </p> <p>Players will continue to be paid by their counties, as well as by the ECB. The ECB will pay compensation to the counties - amounting, it is believed, to 80% of the player's salary - for the loss of the player's services. Players will be allocated to one of three salary bands according to their international experience. </p> <p>The counties will have first call on their players' services for Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and NatWest Trophy matches, but for the remainder of the sea son the players will be available only at the discretion of the England coach Duncan Fletcher. </p> <p>David Graveney, the chairman of the England selectors, said: \"The main point is the realisation that the international cricketer cannot fulfil everything in a 12-month period in terms of playing all the domestic and international cricket. </p> <p>\"The bowlers in particular aren't going to be around for county cricket. I think that has been accepted by everyone now.

      "bodyText": "English cricket will undergo a massive face-lift at Lord's today when the names of the players to be offered contracts by the England and Wales Cricket Board are revealed. Neither the international nor the domestic game will be the same again. The principle of such contracts, which make players responsible to England rather than their counties, was agreed a year ago but it was not until the autumn that the details began to emerge. Up to 16 players can be contracted for this summer. At first it seemed that only 10 or 11 would be recruited at this stage, but some one-day specialists have been included as well, which may swell the numbers to the original target figure. The venture had been allocated \u00a31m, although because of financial difficulties this sum has already been slashed by a quarter. Players will continue to be paid by their counties, as well as by the ECB. The ECB will pay compensation to the counties - amounting, it is believed, to 80% of the player's salary - for the loss of the player's services. Players will be allocated to one of three salary bands according to their international experience. The counties will have first call on their players' services for Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and NatWest Trophy matches, but for the remainder of the sea son the players will be available only at the discretion of the England coach Duncan Fletcher. David Graveney, the chairman of the England selectors, said: \"The main point is the realisation that the international cricketer cannot fulfil everything in a 12-month period in terms of playing all the domestic and international cricket. \"The bowlers in particular aren't going to be around for county cricket. I think that has been accepted by everyone now. I think we have to pencil in names we think will be the backbone of the team to play against Australia next year.\" At present too many of England's pace bowlers are susceptible to long-term injury; Darren Gough has been sidelined for lengthy periods and last winter England were deprived of Dean Headley for virtually the entire tour and Alan Mullally for a significant period of it. Quality practice, rest, treatment and advice will be the order of the day. Among the contracted players may be youngsters such as Surrey's Alex Tudor and Durham's Steve Harmison, who have the potential to generate authentic pace but whose development requires careful monitoring. Spinners will be sparse on the list, a comment on the state of that art in the domestic game; the young Lancashire leg-spinner Chris Schofield may find himself the sole representative. With the England captain Nasser Hussain's declaration that several experienced performers are sure to return, it will be interesting to see which of Graham Thorpe, Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash are included. Whispers suggest that only the last may miss out, but in view of the vacancy at the top of the order this would seem bizarre.",

Ramps recovered from an awful, nervous, fragmentary start to his Test career to become England's most consistent batsman in the 18 months from March 1998 to last August. He was dropped, as he himself openly complained, because a scapegoat was needed after the shock defeat by New Zealand, although a tendency to volcanic behaviour in the dressing-room may have played a part. The selectors could have waited and demanded that he show some county form, as if that would prove anything. Instead they have been big enough to admit that they were wrong to leave him out in the first place. They have also said that he may open the batting, which would mean renewing a successful partnership with Mike Atherton that began back in the mists of 1986-87, in the England Under-19s.</p> <p><strong>Thorpe left out in the cold</strong></p> <p>Tricky one. Graham Thorpe missed the Test series in South Africa at his own request, which seemed fair enough after 10 successive tours with England or England A. He was avilable for the one-day series, but the selectors preferred to stick with Adams and Co - a decision which probably cost England the triangular trophy. Now he is being punished again. Who has more Test runs left in him, Thorpe or Atherton? Surely Thorpe. In his absence, the selectors seem to have forgotten that he is a lefthander. Their squad contains not a single player who either bats or bowls left-handed.</p> <p><strong>Hick recalled again</strong></p> <p>Hmmm. He's a better player than his detractors make out. On the other hand, should he be recalled just because he had two excellent one-day games in Zimbabwe (following several bad ones in South Africa), and because he and Duncan Fletcher go way back? His catching is useful, and his bowling may have been a factor in a party that contains not a single specialist finger-spinner. But just as he has often been unluckily dumped, so now he is fortunate to be included. Worcestershire certainly weren't expecting it, or they wouldn't have made him their new captain.</p> <p><strong>Only three fast bowlers</strong></p> <p>Baffling. Half the point of central contracts is to stop the Test seamers being flogged into the ground by their counties. The newspapers confidently expected to see five or six fast bowlers given contracts. Instead the two automatic selections, Gough and Caddick, have been joined only by Dean Headley. So we have three seamers, two of whom are injury-prone, and all of whom are the wrong side of 29. The suspicion is that the selectors couldn't agree on who was fourth in the pecking order: Tudor, Silverwood, Mullally, or someone from outside the winter tour party, such as Dominic Cork (still the best swing bowler in the country), Angus Fraser or Ed Giddins. The end result is plain silly. Almost any Test XII or XIII these days contains four front-line seamers: sometimes there are six. So why only three? Perhaps because Silverwood is from Yorkshire, and the ECB didn't want to take four players from one county. But that doesn't explain the cursory handling of Tudor, who has made major contributions in two of his three Tests and needs exactly the sort of nursing that central contracts are intended to bring.</p> <p><strong>Schofield the sole spinner</strong></p> <p>A bold move. It's good to have someone of 21 in a squad in which eight players are past 30 and Darren Gough, at 29, is the fourth-youngest member. It's good to see the selectors recognising that orthodox finger-spin is now a thing of the past. But there are signs that they haven't thought this through. An attack of Gough, Caddick, Headley and Schofield, with Flintoff or White as back-up, would take wickets, but at a price: only Caddick can be relied upon to keep the runs down. Both England's existing stock bowlers, Mullally and Tufnell, have been dropped, and the selectors have mysteriously not taken up wisden.com's preferred choice to replace them - Mark Ealham, who is equally economical and a far better batsman. Schofield may just be the new Shane Warne but he is more likely to be the new Ian Salisbury, going for four an over. Brian Lara, freed from the shackles of captaincy, might decide to break one of his own records. Schofield is a good pick, but surely didn't need to be given a contract - especially as his new boss at Lancashire is Bob Simpson, who nurtured Warne to greatness and almost certainly has more wisdom to impart to a young legspinner than Fletcher does.</p> <p><strong>No dud batsmen</strong></p> <p>In their last home Test, England had three No.11s: Mullally, Tufnell, and Ed Giddins. In their next one, they may have none, unless you count Darren Gough, whose considerable batting ability vanished without trace about three years ago. England's weakness as a batting team has not been the top six, contrary to the view held by Hussain and most of the press box. The top six, playing on some dodgy pitches, have done no worse than their opposite numbers. It's the tail that has been massively outgunned. If your name is Glenn McGrath, you can afford to be an idiot with the bat, but no English bowler is that good. The fringe bowling places must go to people who can bat at least a bit. Fletcher has worked miracles with the fielding; now he must shorten the tail. The task would be less daunting if this squad had included one more bowler-who-can-bat, such as Ealham or Cork.</p> <p><strong>The return of Craig White</strong></p> <p>In one-day tournaments in Australia or the subcontinent, the man of the series sometimes wins a car. Craig White has gone one better: his reward for coming in as a late replacement and turning in a string of goodish displays in South Africa and Zimbabwe is a contract worth at least \u00a320,000. What those performances have to do with Test cricket is not clear. White is a handy change bowler and apparently impressed Duncan Fletcher with his attitude, but he is injury-prone, was well out of his depth in his previous eight Tests, and he is 30. Mark Ealham is a better bet in the short term; Ben Hollioake or Paul Franks in the long term. Born near Leeds, brought up near Melbourne, White is now officially the luckiest man in England.</p> <p><em>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com and Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Officially, the death toll stands at 200, but that bureaucratically contrived figure is certain to be dwarfed when the flood recedes and yields its ghastly evidence of death.</p> <p>Though the rains have eased, torrents of water are still flowing into the worst stricken areas of Mozambique from saturated parts of South Africa, Zimbabwe and neighbouring nations.</p> <p>Slowly and belatedly international aid is coming in. Britain announced today that it will send two heavy transport aircraft with 30 trained rescue workers, 69 inflatable motorboats, 39 life rafts and emergency vehicles. The aid pledged by London now stands at \u00a34.5m.</p> <p>The US, which this morning had offered just \u00a3600,000, now says it will give 10 times that figure. An American C-17 Hercules plane arrived in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, carrying blankets, food, and other emergency supplies.</p> <p>Distribution of emergency aid has been slowed by the diversion of scarce helicopters and other aircraft to the more urgent task of rescuing stranded flood victims, many of whom have been without food or clean water for more than a week. The British government announced that it will send five more helicopters, chartered in South Africa, to join the rescue effort.</p> <p>Total international aid is now estimated to have reached some \u00a313.5m. Though that figure is steadily rising, it is only a fraction of what is needed to rescue and sustain the flood victims. And rehabilitation of the stricken landscape will cost infinitely more.</p> <p>Last week, Mozambican foreign minister Leonardo Simao appealed for some \u00a340m for reconstruction of vital services and facilities.

      "bodyText": "Hour by hour the horrors grow. It is now known that 1m people have been displaced by the Mozambique floods, and that 200,000 have lost their homes in the surging waters. Officially, the death toll stands at 200, but that bureaucratically contrived figure is certain to be dwarfed when the flood recedes and yields its ghastly evidence of death. Though the rains have eased, torrents of water are still flowing into the worst stricken areas of Mozambique from saturated parts of South Africa, Zimbabwe and neighbouring nations. Slowly and belatedly international aid is coming in. Britain announced today that it will send two heavy transport aircraft with 30 trained rescue workers, 69 inflatable motorboats, 39 life rafts and emergency vehicles. The aid pledged by London now stands at \u00a34.5m. The US, which this morning had offered just \u00a3600,000, now says it will give 10 times that figure. An American C-17 Hercules plane arrived in Mozambique's capital, Maputo, carrying blankets, food, and other emergency supplies. Distribution of emergency aid has been slowed by the diversion of scarce helicopters and other aircraft to the more urgent task of rescuing stranded flood victims, many of whom have been without food or clean water for more than a week. The British government announced that it will send five more helicopters, chartered in South Africa, to join the rescue effort. Total international aid is now estimated to have reached some \u00a313.5m. Though that figure is steadily rising, it is only a fraction of what is needed to rescue and sustain the flood victims. And rehabilitation of the stricken landscape will cost infinitely more. Last week, Mozambican foreign minister Leonardo Simao appealed for some \u00a340m for reconstruction of vital services and facilities. That figure now looks woefully inadequate as aid and rescue workers talk of wholesale destruction of roads, bridges, rail links and other infrastructure. More immediate is the threat of starvation and disease. At least one third of the country's emergency supplies of food has disappeared beneath the flood waters. As cyclone Eline recedes and the floods subside, there is a risk of infection from the thousands of corpses feared trapped in the debris. Domestic and wild animals too have perished in incalculable numbers, and international animal welfare charity Vetaid is urgently appealing for funds for an emergency clean-up and to replace vital farm stock and draught animals.",

She is so determined that she has printed wanted posters showing the injuries to her boyfriend's face and appealing for information on his assailants.</p> <p>Angry at what she saw as a lack of action by Wiltshire police after the attack, she plastered Swindon town centre with the posters naming two of the men she believes were involved in the attack.</p> <p>Ms Myers, 34, is white. Her boyfriend, Hardip Samra, 25, is Indian. She firmly believes he was the victim of a racist attack: provoked by the news that the couple may soon become engaged.</p> <p>Mr Samra had been at an all day Indian party on the day of the assault, where he told friends he planned to propose to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day. But outside the club, as he stood in the queue at a kebab van, he was attacked by six Asian men who had also been at the party. Mr Samra lost consciousness as the men punched, kicked and stood on his face. His nose had to be reset in hospital.</p> <p>It was the state of his face and frustration that provoked Ms Myers into action. \"I was desperate. It just seemed that nothing was being done. I had gone to the police station with his bloodstained jumper. After the assault, I received threatening phone calls and the numbers were still on the phone. But the officer was too busy,\" she said.</p> <p>Mr Samra told Ms Myers he believed he had been attacked because of his intention to propose to a white woman.</p> <p>Police are investigating the attack and have called it a serious assault, although it is not known whether they are treating it as a racial attack.</p> <p>Ms Myers, who is unemployed, said she had been in hiding since speaking out.

      "bodyText": "Kasia Myers is determined to track down the six men who attacked her boyfriend the night before Valentine's Day, leaving him with footprints all over his face. She is so determined that she has printed wanted posters showing the injuries to her boyfriend's face and appealing for information on his assailants. Angry at what she saw as a lack of action by Wiltshire police after the attack, she plastered Swindon town centre with the posters naming two of the men she believes were involved in the attack. Ms Myers, 34, is white. Her boyfriend, Hardip Samra, 25, is Indian. She firmly believes he was the victim of a racist attack: provoked by the news that the couple may soon become engaged. Mr Samra had been at an all day Indian party on the day of the assault, where he told friends he planned to propose to his girlfriend on Valentine's Day. But outside the club, as he stood in the queue at a kebab van, he was attacked by six Asian men who had also been at the party. Mr Samra lost consciousness as the men punched, kicked and stood on his face. His nose had to be reset in hospital. It was the state of his face and frustration that provoked Ms Myers into action. \"I was desperate. It just seemed that nothing was being done. I had gone to the police station with his bloodstained jumper. After the assault, I received threatening phone calls and the numbers were still on the phone. But the officer was too busy,\" she said. Mr Samra told Ms Myers he believed he had been attacked because of his intention to propose to a white woman. Police are investigating the attack and have called it a serious assault, although it is not known whether they are treating it as a racial attack. Ms Myers, who is unemployed, said she had been in hiding since speaking out. She claimed she had been followed, had people battering at her ground floor flat windows in the middle of the night and had been verbally abused. She said: \"The point is that me and Hardy are lying low, and the people involved are out all over town.\" Sitting in a pub in a village near Swindon, Ms Myers had tears in her eyes as she realised her actions had jeopardised the future of her three-and-a-half year relationship. However, she had no regrets. \"From the beginning our relationship has been about what everyone else thinks. It's all right ignoring that but not this. When someone does this kind of physical damage, I just can't sit back,\" she said. She went to the Swindon Evening Advertiser and told her story.

And there they lay, all but forgotten, until yesterday when the Israeli state archives handed out a limited number of copies of the manuscript on computer disk. </p> <p>Despite misgivings about the surfacing of so self-serving an account of the Nazi holocaust by one of its main perpetrators, the justice ministry felt moved to intervene in a libel trial now under way in London. Lawyers for an American academic and Penguin Books, had requested the document for their defence in a libel suit brought by the writer David Irving. </p> <p>The memoir is a rambling and often repetitive account of Eichmann's life and the Nazi killing machine. Replete with philosophical meanderings and references to the Fatherland, duty and service, it stretches to some 1,300 pages. While Eichmann does not flinch from using the German word for genocide - v\u00f6lkermord - he never admits to his own guilt or betrays any sign of personal remorse. Instead, he portrays himself as a man caught up by powers beyond his control. </p> <p>Written in longhand, and in out-moded script in a series of A4-sized notebooks that have barely yellowed with time, the manuscript is divided into chapters and includes footnotes. Each page contains Eichmann's signature along the left margin, the final \"n\" of his surname trailing into oblivion. It also contains Eichmann's last will and testament with elaborate instructions for the disposal of his mortal remains. Eichmann wanted to be cremated along the Danube, at Linz, and his ashes divided into seven piles - one to be put into his parents' grave in Linz, one to be buried in his garden in Argentina, and one each to go to his wife and four sons. He adds: \"Death is no worse than birth, and a thousand times a thousand lives await us after ours.\" He dates the passage August 15 1961 and notes that is the 30th anniversary of his engagement to his wife, Vera. </p> <p>It is unclear how the memoirs will serve in defending the libel suit brought by Irving. In a book published in 1993, Professor Deborah Lipstadt of Emory University, the academic who is being sued, calls him a \"Nazi partisan\" for denying the systematic slaughter of Europe's Jews; Irving insists he is not a denier of the holocaust. </p> <p>Israeli scholars say the memoirs add little to the volume of evidence accumulated during Eichmann's trial in Jerusalem - which runs to some 3,000 pages. \"It restates all the things Eichmann said at the trial, including the statement that the annihilation of the Jews is the worst crime in recorded history,\" says Professor Yehuda Bauer, director of research at the Yad Vashem holocaust memorial museum in Jerusalem. \"He says he and Hitler were responsible and he talks about pagan gods whom he, unfortunately, came to believe in.\" </p> <p>However, Evytar Friesel, Israel's state archivist, says the manuscript is valuable for the insight it offers into Eichmann's psychology. \"There is an interesting insight into the personal aspect of the matter. Eichmann has become a kind of symbol and here there is someone who is dealing with him as a very, very ordinary normal man.\" </p> <p>Throughout the memoir, which begins with Eichmann's birth at Solingen, Germany, in 1906, there are references to his family life. It describes his childhood, and years as a young man, trips to the mountains and beer parlours, and flowers for his girlfriends - an idyll that was interrupted when the \"False God\" of National Socialism beckoned in 1931. </p> <p>Eichmann was entranced by the symbols of the Fatherland, and the promise of renewal. \"I served the gods with my whole being and faith. There was nothing I wouldn't do for them,\" he writes. Much later the memoir describes in detail the system of ghettoes, cattle trains and death camps that Eichmann devised for the slaughter of the Jews. </p> <p>\"In January 42 I was given orders by Mueller to drive to Posen and give him a report on the killing of Jews. Before that, I had read some secret circulations [memos] of shooting of Jews in the East. But it was not real for me, I couldn't imagine it. What I got to see now was horror personified, nothing like last autumn in Lublin. I saw naked Jewish men and women entering an omnibus without windows. The doors closed and the motors started. The exhaust gases did not escape on the outside, they were directed inside. A doctor in a white coat pointed out a little spyhole in the driver's window and asked me to watch through it, but I couldn't. Everything seemed unreal. I couldn't stop the killing in any case. I would not have been able to, physically.\" </p> <p>And in his foreword, which was appended to his memoir, he admits: that the Nazi ideology was responsible for \"the greatest crime committed in the history of humanity.\" But throughout the diary, details of Eichmann's personality constantly intrude. </p> <p>He talks about coffee houses, and the difficulty of negotiating highly polished floors in heavy boots. He describes his irritation with desk duty, and with initially being assigned to the wrong corps of the SS, and the strange ceremony at which he was inducted into the Nazis' elite unit. During the oath-taking, he describes seeing a human skeleton in a coffin. \"Strange, I thought, very strange, all of it, but perhaps this corpse was housed in a museum.\" </p> <p>The manuscript's value to scholars lies in such details - along with Eichmann's later descriptions of the horror he created. </p> <p>\"You have a human being, there is no doubt, you do not have a monster,\" says Friesel. \"You have a man, living and talking like a human being who is beginning to recognise he is part of a terrible crime, but is saying: 'what could I do'.\" </p> <p>On that crucial point all the scholars who have seen the memoirs agree: it is utterly self-serving. Eichmann repeatedly describes himself as one in a team of horses, driven by a relentless coachman. \"Regarding his own role, he lied through his teeth,\" says Bauer. </p> <p>It is perhaps Eichmann's efforts to minimise his personal guilt in the annihilation of the Jews that guided the decision of David Ben-Gurion, the Israeli prime minister at the time of his trial, to order the memoirs to vanish into a locked safe at the state archives. Although Ben-Gurion wanted Eichmann's prosecution to be highly public - it was the world's first televised trial - there was concern that the memoir would confuse the truths established there. </p> <p>And so the mansucript lay in the state archives, stacked up in manila envelopes and a medium-sized cardboard box. The Israeli authorities were reminded of the existence of the memoirs last August, when Dieter Eichmann, one of his four sons, approached the attorney general and requested the manuscript. After much deliberation, the Israeli justice ministry decided to hand it over. But for the urgency of Liptstadt's case, the process would have taken months. </p> <p>Holocaust scholars would also have preferred the text to have appeared in edited form, so that Eichmann's assertions that he was powerless to stop the killing would not have gone unchallenged. But as the copy right of the memoirs rests with Eichmann's survivors, that option was not legally possible. Now, with its reappearance, among the striking aspects of the memoir - excluding of course the mendacity in his denial of his own guilt - is its sheer vanity. </p> <p>In his foreword, Eichmann frets about his abilities as a writer, fearing that his explanation of the horrors that he orchestrated may be \"empty and superficial\", and that his writing style would be more suitable to humorous, light-hearted stories. </p> <p>He stipulates that he would like his version of the Nazi horrors to be bound in dove grey, or pearl, with a simple typeface on the cover and dictates the inscriptions to be made on the copies to be given to his four sons: \"This is the way it was.\" He does not want the work to be published under a pseudonym and, although he must have known he could be hanged for his crimes, he asks to be consulted in case future editors deviate from his two suggested titles: False Gods, or a Greek maxim meaning Know Thyself. Eichmann turns to the classics again for the quotation to be placed on the frontspiece of his memoir, suggesting a passage from Plato's cave parable: \"And he would consider his shadow world as true, but the real world as an illusion.\" </p> <p>Above all, Eichmann seems to be writing from a sense of mission. Although the text was never admitted as evidence during his appeal, it seems clear that he wanted to set out his version of the hell he helped to create. </p> <p>\"I have therefore decided, to use time until the sentence is handed down, rather to make use of it, and to put into action what I declared. It cannot hurt; rather it can make people think what life can throw at a person,\" he writes in the foreword. \"I was inspired by a thousand ideals and like many others I slid into something from which I could not extricate myself. Today, I have a distance of time from the events. Much that was valid then has become invalid. Previous 'philosophical values' I have discarded as obsolete junk and thrown overboard in the course of the years one by one. </p> <p>\"Because I saw hell, death and the devil, because I had to witness the insanity of annihilation, because I was reined in as one of the many horses and could not break out either to the right or the left because of the will of the coachman and his orders, I feel called to, and I have the desire to, recount here and to give account of that which transpired.\" </p>",

For not only the fields of death did I have to see with my own eyes, the battle fields where life itself died, I saw much worse. I saw how, by a few words, through a single, abrupt order of one individual, whom the regime empowered, fields of annihilation were created. I saw the eeriness of the death machinery; wheel turning on wheel, like the mechanisms of a watch. And I saw those who maintained the machinery, who kept it going. I saw them, as they rewound the mechanism; and I watched the second hand, as it rushed through the seconds; rushing like lives towards death.

Sadly, this harmless pursuit has landed the veteran striker in a spot of trouble, because the FA has charged him with misconduct after an alleged breach of its betting rules.</p> <p>Claridge has admitted placing a bet on Portsmouth to win their home game against Barnsley on January 29. Seeing as he plays for Pompey and scored all the goals in their 3-0 win, we're not too sure what the problem is (and neither is Claridge, who claimed he did not know it was against the rules for players to bet on football matches). Luckily, here's Steve Double of the FA to tell us what he's done wrong:</p> <p>\"Players, managers and directors have to realise,\" began Double in a monotone nasal whine, \"that even betting on their own team to win is a breach of football rules on betting.

Erm, hold on...</p> <p><strong>BENI'S TROUBLE AND STRIFE</strong></p> <p>As many a manager knows, their troubles are only just beginning when their star player cuts out the 5am Red Bull, vodka and bevy-of-busty-glamour-model benders and settles down with a wife in a mock-tudor mansion. John Gregory is the latest boss left scratching his head at the power of players' wives as Mrs Carbone joins Mrs Beckham, Mrs Barmby, Mrs Emerson, Mrs Unsworth and Mrs Zidane in the ranks of missuses not to be messed with.</p> <p>Poor Mr Carbone is sick with worry about Olga. \"I have a big problem with my family. My wife hasn't spoken to anyone for three years. She doesn't know anybody,\" Beni confided to Match of the Day magazine. \"I go training all the time, so I'm talking all the time and it's easier to learn [English]. She doesn't talk to anyone, and when she does it's only in Italian. For her it's so, so difficult.\"</p> <p>It is not in quite the same class as Andrea \"Middlesbrough is a strange and terrible place\" Emerson - who dragged Mr 'Emerson' Emerson back to Brazil - but clearly Olga's silent treatment calls for Gregory to flex his famed people-management muscles. When David Unsworth signed for Villa only to flee to Everton six days later, ever-understanding Gregory said: \"I think his wife said he had to be home at 1pm for his dinner.

BET LYNCHED \"Bet you'll be bored rigid by this anecdote about John Beck and a bucket of cold water!\" \"A tenner says my socks will be round my ankles before the first five minutes are up!\" \"Double or quits on me winning us promotion just by using my shin!\" Three things the Fiver wouldn't be surprised to find out Steve 'Tramp' Claridge had once said - after all, he famously likes a flutter. Sadly, this harmless pursuit has landed the veteran striker in a spot of trouble, because the FA has charged him with misconduct after an alleged breach of its betting rules. Claridge has admitted placing a bet on Portsmouth to win their home game against Barnsley on January 29. Seeing as he plays for Pompey and scored all the goals in their 3-0 win, we're not too sure what the problem is (and neither is Claridge, who claimed he did not know it was against the rules for players to bet on football matches). Luckily, here's Steve Double of the FA to tell us what he's done wrong: \"Players, managers and directors have to realise,\" began Double in a monotone nasal whine, \"that even betting on their own team to win is a breach of football rules on betting. Players and officials have access to information which those outside the game do not,\" he went on (and on). \"For instance, only those inside a club may know that the team's top scorer has returned to full...\" Actually, have you got any more of those stories about John Beck's management methods, Tramp? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I will not be leaving Cuba until my heart problems are cured, and that is going to take time. When I do leave, it will be with a passion to both work and play football.\" - Diego Maradona, undergoing treatment in Havana for cocaine addiction and heart problems, reveals a new-found confidence. Erm, hold on... BENI'S TROUBLE AND STRIFE As many a manager knows, their troubles are only just beginning when their star player cuts out the 5am Red Bull, vodka and bevy-of-busty-glamour-model benders and settles down with a wife in a mock-tudor mansion. John Gregory is the latest boss left scratching his head at the power of players' wives as Mrs Carbone joins Mrs Beckham, Mrs Barmby, Mrs Emerson, Mrs Unsworth and Mrs Zidane in the ranks of missuses not to be messed with. Poor Mr Carbone is sick with worry about Olga. \"I have a big problem with my family. My wife hasn't spoken to anyone for three years. She doesn't know anybody,\" Beni confided to Match of the Day magazine. \"I go training all the time, so I'm talking all the time and it's easier to learn [English]. She doesn't talk to anyone, and when she does it's only in Italian. For her it's so, so difficult.\" It is not in quite the same class as Andrea \"Middlesbrough is a strange and terrible place\" Emerson - who dragged Mr 'Emerson' Emerson back to Brazil - but clearly Olga's silent treatment calls for Gregory to flex his famed people-management muscles. When David Unsworth signed for Villa only to flee to Everton six days later, ever-understanding Gregory said: \"I think his wife said he had to be home at 1pm for his dinner. We told him to try and sort his head out.\" So come on John, can't you see Beni and Olga need your liberal hand to guide them? THE RUMOUR MILL According to Teamtalk, Leicester are interested in West Ham striker Paulo Wanchope. Newcastle are willing to pay \u00a35m for Sheffield Wednesday's Niclas Alexandersson. Fulham want Bradford's Lee Sharpe for \u00a31m. Aston Villa centre-back Colin Calderwood could be in line for a move to Portsmouth for a nominal fee. NEWS IN BRIEF Birmingham defender Michael Johnson has been issued with a death threat by neo-Nazi group Combat 18. Two Chelsea fans are being detained by police as a result of crowd disturbances during the Big Cup match in Marseille last night. \"Two people are still in custody - one for carrying a knife-lighter, and the other was arrested because he hit one of the match stewards,\" a spokesman said. Marc Overmars is fully fit again and looks set to start for Arsenal for the first time in seven weeks in tomorrow's Uefa Cup fourth round first leg tie against Spanish League leaders Deportivo La Coruna at Highbury. Real Madrid have been ordered to pay their former head coach John Toshack \u00a3590,000 in compensation for his sacking last November. The payout is based on both breach of contract by Real and unpaid wages. Real are to appeal against the decision. The route for Sir Stanley Matthews' funeral cortege on Friday will begin at Stoke City's Britannia Stadium before moving off at 11.30am on to Stanley Matthews Way.

He then claimed that the government's waiting list initiative had ignored clinical priorities.</p> <p>Mr Blair said that in one clinical area, cardiac treatment, the principal problem was the shortage of specialists doctors and nurses. He said 400 extra cardiac specialists were in training, which would mean a 50% increase by 2005.</p> <p>Mr Blair replied that the government saw NHS problems as \"a reason for action\", while the Tories viewed them as \"an excuse for undermining the NHS in principle\".</p> <p>He said that NHS funding could only increase if the economy continued to grow.</p> <p><b>Cash machines:</b> There are \"legitimate concerns\" about the decision by banks to charge customers for using cash machines, the prime minister said, and there was a \"need to know\" how charges would affect pensioners, low-income families and rural communities where there may only be one cash machine.</p> <p><b>London mayor:</b> Mr Blair said he could not comment on rumours sweeping the House that Frank Dobson had stepped down as Labour's mayor candidate. In later questions Mr Hague said that neither Mr Dobson or his rival Ken Livingstone supported the government plans for partial privatisation of the London Underground.</p> <p><b>Volunteers:</b> The prime minister will spend one day working as a volunteer. A number of major companies intended to back a scheme which would allow employees to take a paid day off, once a year, to work in the voluntary sector.</p>",

He said Tony Blair did not dare give waiting list figures to the Commons and attacked the Labour leader as a \"Polaroid prime minister\" who \"turns up for photo calls at hospitals but does not listen to what is happening\". The Tory leader quoted a department of health briefing for a previous prime minister's questions, which, he said, showed that at the end of September last year 264,000 more patients were waiting over 13 weeks for operations than at the end of March 1997. Mr Hague said the prime minister had not volunteered this information to the Commons when asked. He then claimed that the government's waiting list initiative had ignored clinical priorities. Mr Blair said that in one clinical area, cardiac treatment, the principal problem was the shortage of specialists doctors and nurses. He said 400 extra cardiac specialists were in training, which would mean a 50% increase by 2005. Mr Blair replied that the government saw NHS problems as \"a reason for action\", while the Tories viewed them as \"an excuse for undermining the NHS in principle\". He said that NHS funding could only increase if the economy continued to grow. Cash machines: There are \"legitimate concerns\" about the decision by banks to charge customers for using cash machines, the prime minister said, and there was a \"need to know\" how charges would affect pensioners, low-income families and rural communities where there may only be one cash machine. London mayor: Mr Blair said he could not comment on rumours sweeping the House that Frank Dobson had stepped down as Labour's mayor candidate. In later questions Mr Hague said that neither Mr Dobson or his rival Ken Livingstone supported the government plans for partial privatisation of the London Underground. Volunteers: The prime minister will spend one day working as a volunteer. A number of major companies intended to back a scheme which would allow employees to take a paid day off, once a year, to work in the voluntary sector.",

      "body": "<p>Miranda is 16 months old and has been walking for four of those. I thought my daughter might be ready for her first pair of shoes. It is essential that children's shoes fit properly, not just so that they can walk comfortably but because their bones are soft and must have room to develop and grow to maturity straight and strong. However, children's shoe shops can be a maze of conflicting information about sizes and width fittings, as Miranda and I found on a shopping trip in London. </p> <p>At InStep in Wandsworth, which is part of a small chain, there was a queueing system which dispelled some of the stress of a long wait. The fitter asked how long Miranda had been walking and said she would be ready for shoes. She judged her feet to be size 4F although a 4E seemed to fit better. We tried two pairs of Start-Rite and a pair of Clarks, but didn't buy. </p> <p>We fared less happily at Daisy and Tom's on King's Road where, on a quiet afternoon, we had to wait 50 minutes before the one assistant was free to measure. The shop has no queueing system, an advertised puppet show never materialised and Miranda kept disappearing into the adjacent book department through an interconnecting door which, irritatingly, was jammed open. Miranda was finally measured as a 4F, but the pair I wanted her to try on - Start-Rite Mary Janes in blue - wasn't available. </p> <p>Next we went to our local Clarks branch which, while full of shoes, was empty of people so easier to get a fitting done. Here, we had a surprise: according to the fitter, Miranda was a 5E which left me wondering whether manufacturers use a different scale. The answer is that they do, so if you're offered various makes, check that the fitter measures for each kind. </p> <p>Finally we tried Peter Jones, part of the John Lewis empire. It was now nearly closing time, which accounted for the rare spectacle of a deserted children's shoe department, so Miranda had the benefit of not one assistant but three - two fitters and the manager. I was instructed to take off her socks and allow her to run around. All three were in no doubt - Miranda was still curling her feet when she walks so I was advised to wait at least another month. </p> <p>How does the confused mother make sense of this? According to Laura West, of the Society of Shoefitters, Peter Jones may have had a point - some children do curl their toes for a while and it's usually best to put off buying shoes as long as possible. Many parents seem to see getting the first shoes as, literally, a step forward in a child's development but it is better to let them go barefoot or in socks or padders. \"The bones in a child's feet are very soft and can be easily damaged. Damaged feet can affect all sorts of things - as well as painful feet in later life, you may develop a bad back, posture problems, even migraine. \"Have your children's feet properly measured and don't skimp on quality.\" she says. </p> <p> <strong> Clarks</strong> </p> <p>The best known name in children's shoes in the UK. They come in half-sizes, giving a better fit, and all seem hard-wearing and well-designed, with a bar or laces, which all young children need. Lots of pretty \"girly\" styles: flower and heart-encrusted offerings, for example, but boys are well served, too, with a range of multi-coloured kickers. Prices are around \u00a320-25. </p> <p><strong> Rating: 9/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Start-Rite</strong> </p> <p>The Rolls-Royce of children's shoes - extremely well-made. Like Clarks, available in half-sizes and a wide range of width. Best known for \"traditional\" shoes: these are the ones most often available in shops. But the company's brochure lists a much wider range, including boots in gunmetal and floral-patterned lilac and raspberry, as well as styles in hot fuchsia, and inspired by Prada. The only gripe is cost - most are around \u00a330. </p> <p><strong> Rating: 8/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Early Days</strong> </p> <p>Early Days only makes shoes in full sizes and F fittings, so you can't be sure of finding a pair that will fit perfectly - you'll need advice from a fitter. But if a pair is a perfect fit, you've got a bargain - this navy lace-up boot, which would be equally cute on a boy or girl, is around \u00a315. All the shoes have synthetic uppers, but on the plus side these are lightweight and easy to clean - some can be machine-washed. </p> <p><strong> Rating: 8/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Elefanten</strong> </p> <p>Vibrant colours are a trademark of these German shoes - the lovely multi-coloured boots (\"Jeff\") are perfect for new walkers. Lots of the shoes are lace-ups, which are a better buy than Velcro fasteners because Velcro sometimes loses its adhesion. Continental sizings so it's essential to buy from a shop with a fitter. Prices are steep, however, at around \u00a335. </p> <p><strong> Rating: 7/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Baby Deer</strong> </p> <p>Limited range of classic first-walker styles. These are nice-looking shoes which don't have fancy names, but include plain bar shoes for girls which come in white, navy and black patent. Also available are nubuck closed-toe sandals in brown and blue. No half sizes, however, and F fitting is standard. Good value at around \u00a318. </p> <p><strong> Rating: 7/10</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Buckle My Shoe</strong> </p> <p>If your toddler is a fashion victim, Buckle My Shoe is probably the range for her (or him). Mini Erika is a funky 70s-inspired girl's shoe which combines high fashion with a sensible, healthy bar-style; Mini Pedal is a great-looking kicker in five earthy colours. But the prices! You'll pay around \u00a340 for the Erikas, and a whopping \u00a347 for the Pedal. Probably best to avoid fashion shoes until the kids ask for them. </p> <p><strong> Rating: 5/10</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 For a list of qualified fitters of children's shoes and a leaflet on children's foot health, send \u00a35 plus an SAE to the Society of Shoefitters, The Anchorage, 28 Admiral's Walk, Hingham, Norfolk NR9 4JL.</p>",

And what does it say about the other pop star in the Manchester United manager's life - Victoria's husband, David - that he has Brooklyn's moniker tattooed upon his boyish back? Are these glittering parents simply ghastly? Or are they absolutely fab? </p> <p>The only proper answer is, of course, the latter. Yes, yes, you might have quibbles about Mr and Mrs Becks, what with the massive mountains of money they seem so keen to keep all to themselves, and their not-always-welcome talent for being the centre of national attention. And, yes, many will consider their wish to be emblazoned with their infant's name as final confirmation that David and Victoria are a truly gruesome twosome, the viziers of vulgarity, the nabobs of naff. But soft. Just because their style may be un soup\u00e7on ostentatious, it doesn't mean the sentiments behind it are unworthy. Before rushing to judgment, it might be worth reflecting that all sorts of parents advertise their adoration of their children to the world in all sorts of ways, some of them embarrassing, most of them sentimental, and nearly all of them entirely forgivable. </p> <p>The thing about Posh and Becks is that they do parenting their way; and their way is the way of many doting Essex Boys (as Becks is, in spirit) and Hertfordshire Girls (that's Posh). The difference with Mr and Mrs Becks being that they have more to spare than most. When baby comes, there's big, big, prams; big, big cot; very expensive clothes from Baby Versace (or whatever); and, hey, why not a T-shirt or tattoo to mark the miracle of a birth and announce to the world their enduring dedication to the newborn in their arms? </p> <p>Other sorts of people also do such things, but do them in other ways. Conventional, white-collar men who spend most of their working lives keeping soppiness at bay, cram their desks with framed photos of their broods, not just for their own delectation, but for every chief executive or underling to see as well. </p> <p>Other folk use images of their kids as computer screen savers. Or they incorporate their nippers' names into their email addresses. Or, back in the brick-and-mortar world, they concoct little composites to adorn the front of their homes. I grew up near a house named \"Kenessa\" - Kevin, Neil, and Vanessa. </p> <p>With such offspring-inspired nomenclature, buildings are just the beginning. The boat from which Robert Maxwell plunged to his death was named the Lady Ghislaine, after his youngest daughter. Whole businesses may bear the names of their proprietors' progeny. When my in-laws ran a mini-cab firm they pondered which of their 10 children to name it after. In the end, they christened the enterprise after their firstborn, thereby enjoying the benefits of alliteration: Carmel Cars. </p> <p>Of course, there is a fine line between admirable pride and unpleasant boastfulness. But it's better that parents overdo it than never feel moved to do it at all. I've gone in for a bit of showboating myself. All the books I've written are dedicated to my children. Pretty gushing some of it, I guess. But let's live with a bit of gushing if it's in the name of love.</p>",

The difference with Mr and Mrs Becks being that they have more to spare than most. When baby comes, there's big, big, prams; big, big cot; very expensive clothes from Baby Versace (or whatever); and, hey, why not a T-shirt or tattoo to mark the miracle of a birth and announce to the world their enduring dedication to the newborn in their arms? Other sorts of people also do such things, but do them in other ways. Conventional, white-collar men who spend most of their working lives keeping soppiness at bay, cram their desks with framed photos of their broods, not just for their own delectation, but for every chief executive or underling to see as well. Other folk use images of their kids as computer screen savers. Or they incorporate their nippers' names into their email addresses. Or, back in the brick-and-mortar world, they concoct little composites to adorn the front of their homes. I grew up near a house named \"Kenessa\" - Kevin, Neil, and Vanessa. With such offspring-inspired nomenclature, buildings are just the beginning. The boat from which Robert Maxwell plunged to his death was named the Lady Ghislaine, after his youngest daughter. Whole businesses may bear the names of their proprietors' progeny. When my in-laws ran a mini-cab firm they pondered which of their 10 children to name it after. In the end, they christened the enterprise after their firstborn, thereby enjoying the benefits of alliteration: Carmel Cars. Of course, there is a fine line between admirable pride and unpleasant boastfulness. But it's better that parents overdo it than never feel moved to do it at all. I've gone in for a bit of showboating myself. All the books I've written are dedicated to my children. Pretty gushing some of it, I guess. But let's live with a bit of gushing if it's in the name of love.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It's Sunday morning. Stretching out in bed, your toes touch your partner's leg. In that warm languid moment between dreaming and waking, you reach over for a kiss. But you never make it. A little voice at the end of the bed shrieks: \"Get up, mummy! Get up!\" </p> <p>However much you've longed for children by the man or woman of your dreams, their arrival disrupts romance and can destroy intimacy. In 1998, 145,000 couples divorced, according to the Family Policies Study Centre in London. These divorces involved more than 150,000 children under 16. One in four of these children were under four years old. </p> <p>While children might not wreck marriages, they make it harder for relationships to stay on track. In the heady days of early courtship not only do you find each other interesting and adorable most of the time, but when you do fall out you have a whole weekend to row about it. Try having any two-sentence discussion in the presence of a toddler. </p> <p>It has been said that a baby is a hand grenade thrown into the heart of a marriage. Steve Biddulph, father of two (15 and 8), psychologist, counsellor of children and parents, and childcare guru (he wrote the bestsellers Raising Boys and The Secret of Happy Children), agrees that the arrival of a child is potentially explosive. But in his latest book, How Love Works (subtitle: How to stay in love as a couple and be true to yourself . . . even with kids), he claims that couples can stop the bomb from going off. </p> <p>The first step is patience. Biddulph believes that most of us are in love with a fantasy when we get together. \"Learning to love another human being takes 10 years,\" he says. \"People are often just beginning that process when they have kids.\" All marriages (defined as any committed relationship) have make or break crises, he says. \"Our work as counsellors has made us believe that two thirds of divorces are preventable. Life is tough. You don't get a relationship that's life-enriching just fall into your lap; it's a long-term project.\" </p> <p>And central to this project are the arguments that many couples - particularly those with children - try so hard to avoid. You have to fight your way to closeness, Biddulph insists. Many couples go through a period of disengagement after having children. Broken nights, the social isolation of being at home with a child or the dual demands of working and childcare can make couples lose touch with each other. \"It happens by accident,\" says Biddulph. \"Often the couple used to argue but they become afraid to fight in front of the kids. You can achieve things by rowing, people are often willing to change their behaviour when they understand a person's view.\" </p> <p>Often the changes may be practical: a man may want to have more responsibility for the child without being supervised; a woman may feel that her partner works too hard. The golden rule of rowing is to focus on the specific, and don't be abusive. \"Research shows that couples who fight quite a bit are happier five years later, as long as they are not fighting abusively,\" says Biddulph. \"If you call each other names, that's death to a relationship. You have to fight clean in front of kids, but you can be upfront about your feelings. When I was a kid my parents would go into the bedroom and I'd hear some intense whispering but never know what was going on, and that was scary. Then, maybe, my dad would storm out to the car. When Shaaron [his co-author, partner of 25 years and wife for the past 16 of those] and I started rowing we had to have ground rules. Her family had been violent, so she needed us to agree that no one would hurt anyone and my need was to agree that neither of us would walk out. We had our first row 20 years ago and it was so intense that at one stage I lifted a door off its hinges. I can't remember what it was about. I'd say it's OK to throw crockery - just not at each other.\" </p> <p>Some of the difficulty in maintaining a relationship when couples have children is the lack of time they have to discuss how they feel about things. Partners may have different ideas about what mothers and fathers roles should be - often inherited from their own childhoods. \"You accumulate misunderstandings,\" says Biddulph. \"When we first managed to have a weekend away together without the children, we argued all the time. We had catch-up fighting to do. When you have little kids you can go for two years passing in the corridor, living on the memory of when you used to be in love. You need to ask each other, 'how's your life going?' \" </p> <p>Sex can become a minefield, too. \"Tiredness, especially for women, is often a barrier,\" says Biddulph. \"If a man takes his share of the childcare and housework, the couple are more likely to have sex. It's hard to feel loving towards someone who you are angry with for not pulling their weight. You have to be creative, too, just to have time together. I know couples who go home in the middle of the day to be together.\" </p> <p>While it might seem idyllic to do everything together as a family, Biddulph cautions against it. \"We find that couples with strong relationships, who have been together for a long time, often take a holiday separately once a year. Being separate for a while creates an electrical charge between you.\" </p> <p>David and Maureen are an example of such a couple. Both 40, they have been married for 15 years and have two children, aged nine and six. They spend a week or so apart each year; David playing golf, Maureen on work-related trips. \"You have to be terribly good friends for your relationship to work once you have kids,\" says Maureen.

      "bodyText": "It's Sunday morning. Stretching out in bed, your toes touch your partner's leg. In that warm languid moment between dreaming and waking, you reach over for a kiss. But you never make it. A little voice at the end of the bed shrieks: \"Get up, mummy! Get up!\" However much you've longed for children by the man or woman of your dreams, their arrival disrupts romance and can destroy intimacy. In 1998, 145,000 couples divorced, according to the Family Policies Study Centre in London. These divorces involved more than 150,000 children under 16. One in four of these children were under four years old. While children might not wreck marriages, they make it harder for relationships to stay on track. In the heady days of early courtship not only do you find each other interesting and adorable most of the time, but when you do fall out you have a whole weekend to row about it. Try having any two-sentence discussion in the presence of a toddler. It has been said that a baby is a hand grenade thrown into the heart of a marriage. Steve Biddulph, father of two (15 and 8), psychologist, counsellor of children and parents, and childcare guru (he wrote the bestsellers Raising Boys and The Secret of Happy Children), agrees that the arrival of a child is potentially explosive. But in his latest book, How Love Works (subtitle: How to stay in love as a couple and be true to yourself . . . even with kids), he claims that couples can stop the bomb from going off. The first step is patience. Biddulph believes that most of us are in love with a fantasy when we get together. \"Learning to love another human being takes 10 years,\" he says. \"People are often just beginning that process when they have kids.\" All marriages (defined as any committed relationship) have make or break crises, he says. \"Our work as counsellors has made us believe that two thirds of divorces are preventable. Life is tough. You don't get a relationship that's life-enriching just fall into your lap; it's a long-term project.\" And central to this project are the arguments that many couples - particularly those with children - try so hard to avoid. You have to fight your way to closeness, Biddulph insists. Many couples go through a period of disengagement after having children. Broken nights, the social isolation of being at home with a child or the dual demands of working and childcare can make couples lose touch with each other. \"It happens by accident,\" says Biddulph. \"Often the couple used to argue but they become afraid to fight in front of the kids. You can achieve things by rowing, people are often willing to change their behaviour when they understand a person's view.\" Often the changes may be practical: a man may want to have more responsibility for the child without being supervised; a woman may feel that her partner works too hard. The golden rule of rowing is to focus on the specific, and don't be abusive. \"Research shows that couples who fight quite a bit are happier five years later, as long as they are not fighting abusively,\" says Biddulph. \"If you call each other names, that's death to a relationship. You have to fight clean in front of kids, but you can be upfront about your feelings. When I was a kid my parents would go into the bedroom and I'd hear some intense whispering but never know what was going on, and that was scary. Then, maybe, my dad would storm out to the car. When Shaaron [his co-author, partner of 25 years and wife for the past 16 of those] and I started rowing we had to have ground rules. Her family had been violent, so she needed us to agree that no one would hurt anyone and my need was to agree that neither of us would walk out. We had our first row 20 years ago and it was so intense that at one stage I lifted a door off its hinges. I can't remember what it was about. I'd say it's OK to throw crockery - just not at each other.\" Some of the difficulty in maintaining a relationship when couples have children is the lack of time they have to discuss how they feel about things. Partners may have different ideas about what mothers and fathers roles should be - often inherited from their own childhoods. \"You accumulate misunderstandings,\" says Biddulph. \"When we first managed to have a weekend away together without the children, we argued all the time. We had catch-up fighting to do. When you have little kids you can go for two years passing in the corridor, living on the memory of when you used to be in love. You need to ask each other, 'how's your life going?' \" Sex can become a minefield, too. \"Tiredness, especially for women, is often a barrier,\" says Biddulph. \"If a man takes his share of the childcare and housework, the couple are more likely to have sex. It's hard to feel loving towards someone who you are angry with for not pulling their weight. You have to be creative, too, just to have time together. I know couples who go home in the middle of the day to be together.\" While it might seem idyllic to do everything together as a family, Biddulph cautions against it. \"We find that couples with strong relationships, who have been together for a long time, often take a holiday separately once a year. Being separate for a while creates an electrical charge between you.\" David and Maureen are an example of such a couple. Both 40, they have been married for 15 years and have two children, aged nine and six. They spend a week or so apart each year; David playing golf, Maureen on work-related trips. \"You have to be terribly good friends for your relationship to work once you have kids,\" says Maureen. 'We go out together at least once a week for a meal and to watch a film. It's an expensive way of maintaining a relationship - about \u00a3100 a night once we've paid the babysitter - but eating out is important because it makes you talk. The children need to know that we lead our own lives and we are together because we want to be.\" If you can't remember why you are together, Biddulph advises seeing a marriage counsellor and working at your relationship. \"It's not that I don't believe in romantic love but in most societies in history, people are thrown together and learn to love each other,\" he says. \"In our society, love starts as a blessing and continues as an accomplishment.\" \u0095 How Love Works is published by Thorsons at \u00a37.99.

But what will this new wave of net surfers find in the way of virtual public services? </p> <p>Precious little, it seems. Following last December's conclusion by the National Audit Office that central government's progress with the internet was \"patchy and slow\", a new survey, due out next week, shows that town halls are faring little better in their efforts at e-government. </p> <p>The survey, by the councils' IT body, the Society of IT Management (Socitm), provides a snapshot of local government on the web this winter. Its findings make grim reading. Some 401 or 86% of the 467 local authorities in the UK have websites. That is nearly 60 more than the same time last year and many sites have improved, but Socitm say that, overall, the content of the sites remains poor. Nearly 60% of sites are identified as merely promotional, concentrating on tourism and economic development. These sites make little use of email or on-line feedback and provide only limited information on local services. Instead, councils should be aspiring to transactional sites where citizens can pay council tax over the net or fill forms in on-line. Yet, while some councils are beginning to allow more interaction via the internet, not one site was judged to be transactional. </p> <p>The government targets for public service delivery - half of all the public's dealings with government to be deliverable electronically by 2005 and 100% by 2008 - are, officially, for central government. But, according to Barry Quirk, chief executive of the London borough of Lewisham, they are taken as de facto standards for the whole public sector. Quirk, part of a group helping the government to drive forward its modernisation agenda, says the survey results are not a surprise. </p> <p>\"The internet is producing a tidal wave of demand, and councils have to change or lose credence in the eyes of the public,\" says Quirk. He believes councils need to be far more ambitious in their use of the internet and become the focal point for all local information, including health services and travel. It is a vision that is a far cry from today's reality. </p> <p>The survey judged sites on how they coped with \"real life\" situations. For instance, it examined how web- sites helped a person needing to find long-term care for an elderly parent from another part of the country. Sites were examined to see if they included useful information about local residential homes, for contact information and for the ability to make an appointment by email. Only 9% were judged satisfactory. </p> <p>One of the simplest demonstrations of joined-up government for the public would be if changes of address could be notified to different parts of central and local government in a single transaction. That seems light years away when currently less than 10% of town halls allow address changes even for council tax purposes via the internet. Perhaps most startling was councils' response to a simple email, asking for details of disabled access to libraries and swimming pools. Over half the councils who could be contacted simply did not reply. Of those that did, over a quarter failed the five-day test deemed to be satisfactory by the research team and took up to three weeks to reply. </p> <p>Councils claim that investment is needed to make progress. Until then, councils argue, they will have to retain their traditional service out lets. John Serle, Socitm spokesman and head of IT at Lincolnshire county council, says local government has to move on from these \"stereotypical excuses\". </p> <p>In the real world of heavily constrained public sector expenditure, this could well mean closing traditional public service outlets. \"We are talking about models of service delivery - libraries and schools, for instance - that are over 100 years old in some cases,\" Serle says. Breaking up the existing infrastructure will take \"managerial and political courage\", he says. But eventually the public's frustration at councils' failure to work electronically will overcome any nostalgic attachment to the old institutions. And that, says Serle, is when town halls' e-revolution will begin. </p> <p>\u0095 Socitm can be contacted on its website at <a href=\"http://www.socitm.gov.uk/\">www.socitm.gov.uk/</a></p>",

Sites were examined to see if they included useful information about local residential homes, for contact information and for the ability to make an appointment by email. Only 9% were judged satisfactory. One of the simplest demonstrations of joined-up government for the public would be if changes of address could be notified to different parts of central and local government in a single transaction. That seems light years away when currently less than 10% of town halls allow address changes even for council tax purposes via the internet. Perhaps most startling was councils' response to a simple email, asking for details of disabled access to libraries and swimming pools. Over half the councils who could be contacted simply did not reply. Of those that did, over a quarter failed the five-day test deemed to be satisfactory by the research team and took up to three weeks to reply. Councils claim that investment is needed to make progress. Until then, councils argue, they will have to retain their traditional service out lets. John Serle, Socitm spokesman and head of IT at Lincolnshire county council, says local government has to move on from these \"stereotypical excuses\". In the real world of heavily constrained public sector expenditure, this could well mean closing traditional public service outlets. \"We are talking about models of service delivery - libraries and schools, for instance - that are over 100 years old in some cases,\" Serle says. Breaking up the existing infrastructure will take \"managerial and political courage\", he says. But eventually the public's frustration at councils' failure to work electronically will overcome any nostalgic attachment to the old institutions. And that, says Serle, is when town halls' e-revolution will begin. \u0095 Socitm can be contacted on its website at www.socitm.gov.uk/",

      "body": "<p>There is, I'm convinced, a new community spirit in this country. It's a real shift away from the selfish individualism that dominated the 1980s and 1990s, with more and more people looking at ways of giving something back, of being part of something that is bigger than themselves. </p> <p>This week sees three events which are helping to underline the rebirth of this community spirit. </p> <p>Yesterday saw the launch of the TimeBank, an exciting initiative, developed by voluntary organisations with the BBC, to encourage more people to give their time. </p> <p>Today, a group of millennium volunteer ambassadors will commit themselves to bringing a new generation into volunteering. </p> <p>Tomorrow, nearly 3,000 people will gather in London to celebrate the best of what is happening in Britain's communities and to commit themselves to do more. </p> <p>It was this new spirit I spoke about a year ago to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. I said I hoped that the millennium would be marked with an explosion in giving - acts of community that touch people's lives. And I promised that government would play its part in helping put this goal into practice. </p> <p>Since then, we have been working hard with the voluntary sector to put together a comprehensive approach to volunteering. Gordon Brown last month described some of the major changes in support for the giving of money that he plans to announce in the budget; in particular, plans for simpler, more generous tax incentives for charitable donations. This week we will set out ways to help more people give their time as well. </p> <p>Millions of people are already active in their communities. But many are not. Barely one in five young people, and fewer than one in three of all adults, gave time last month. Yet many of those who aren't involved say that they would like to be, given the right encouragement and opportunities. </p> <p>I want it to become as natural to be involved in the community as it is to watch television or go to the cinema. But for that to happen we will need to bring about far- reaching changes in the ways in which volunteering and community involvement are encouraged, supported and managed. </p> <p>The first priority is to encourage people to become involved. Volunteering sometimes suffers from a rather fusty image. Yet when people do take part they often find it one of the most fulfilling parts of their lives. That is why, over the last year, we have been working with the media, voluntary organisations, business and a new charity, ONE20, on a long-term strategy that will use new methods to encourage people to volunteer. </p> <p>This week, some of the first signs of that collaboration are becoming visible with the launch of the TimeBank, which could in time become as much part of the scenery in Britain as the national lottery has. Later this year, the new Community Channel will go on air to provide the first ever dedicated broadcasting outlet for the voluntary sector. </p> <p>But we also need to modernise the ways in which people offering their time can be linked to opportunities in their community, whether it is a school needing people to help with reading, or an environmental charity wanting to create a nature reserve. At the moment, these links are at best haphazard and at worst non-existent. In most towns and cities, it is much easier to find out about what is happening in the local cinemas than what is happening in the community. </p> <p>To help put that right, we have provided support for The Site - a hugely impressive internet-based service which, by the summer, will have 90,000 volunteering opportunities online. </p> <p>Alongside this we are planning to fund local networks, centres and printed materials. Our long-term aim is that in every community there should be someone responsible for developing volunteering and for getting people involved - not just in the voluntary sector but also in schools, hospitals, prisons and residential homes. </p> <p>The third priority is to build up opportunities for people to get involved. Employers are already collaborating in 10 cities. Within three years, they - with the help of Business in the Community - aim to involve another 100,000 people in community projects. We will also give new support to volunteering in the public sector - such as those who help out in hospitals, running libraries, art classes, reading and befriending, the prison visitors and letter writers who help prisoners prepare for life back on the outside, and the parents who work alongside teachers to fill local schools with life and activity, as well as supporting new projects targeted at black and ethnic minority communities that have often been left out of mainstream volunteering in the past. </p> <p>We also need to draw in the next generation. Four thousand millennium volunteers are already active around the country in some remarkable projects, doing sports coaching, mentoring, peer mediation, improving the environment and helping out in music and dance projects. In 2002, we will go further as citizenship education becomes part of the curriculum, and David Blunkett is looking at new models of graduation that will give recognition to community activity, as well as formal academic achievements. </p> <p>At the other end of the age range, we also need to tap into the huge reservoir of skills, experience and enthusiasm among older people. They are already the mainstay of thousands of voluntary organisations, but many - for a variety of reasons, including the false belief they will not be wanted - do not. Fewer than one in three between 45 and 59 participate in voluntary work and that number falls to below one in four between the age of 60 and 69, even though they are likely to have more free time. We will shortly be announcing the details of an imaginative new programme that will draw thousands of older people into community activity. </p> <p>Taken together, these will, I hope, reinforce a new mood, giving community activity the recognition it deserves as one of the foundations of a fair and inclusive society. But they also signal something else: a recognition that government has to work as a partner with the volun tary sector if it is to be effective. In the first half of last century, we learned that the community cannot achieve its aims without the help of government providing essential services and a backdrop of security. In the second half of the century, we learned that government cannot achieve its aims without the energy and commitment of others - voluntary organisations, business and, crucially, the wider public. </p> <p>That partnership between active government and an active community is key to our success as a nation in dealing with everything from social exclusion to poor literacy, crime to ill-health. </p> <p>Both right and left often failed to appreciate this. Conservatives fell for the idea that people are only motivated by selfish interests, and that the private sector has a monopoly of efficiency and responsiveness. </p> <p> They still believe that a more active role for government necessarily means less space for voluntary initiative. The left sometimes belittled voluntary activity, seeing it as a poor alternative to direct state provision, and my party at times forgot its own roots in self-help, friendly societies, cooperatives and voluntary organisations, and the insights of Robert Owen and William Morris. </p> <p>I believe that the modern role of government is not to supplant voluntary activity or to dominate it, but rather to work with it. That new spirit of partnership informs everything we do. Voluntary organisations are much more involved now in making policy - for example, in the 18 policy action teams set up by the social exclusion unit, and in the new task force on social investment. They are also playing a leading role in delivering policy in programmes like the New Deal for communities, Surestart or the childcare strategy. And they will soon be benefiting from a new source of funding with the launch of a Children's Fund to help voluntary organisations play their part in tackling child poverty. </p> <p>These are a few examples of what I believe is a radically different approach to the voluntary sector. One that recognises its diversity, its necessary independence and its vital contribution to making Britain a fairer society. One that gives support to the quiet idealism of the millions who, through their daily actions, make this a better country to live in. </p> <p><strong> Treble chance</strong></p> <p> <strong> TimeBank:</strong> Launched yesterday, the initiative aims to create two national registers: an online register of volunteers, which will record their interests, skills, and the activity they would like to do, plus the amount of time they can give; and a second register of volunteering opportunities, provided by charities, community and voluntary groups. TimeBank has worked closely with the voluntary sector, though some local volunteer bureaux remain suspicious. But one obvious target is the 37% of people that the National Survey of Volunteering in the UK found were not currently volunteering but were willing to do so. Once registered, the potential volunteer is sent a list of opportunities in their own area linked to their own interests and time available. </p> <p>The charity behind TimeBank is ONE20, set up by Jane Tewson, co-founder of Comic Relief. It is being launched with dozens of programmes on BBC national, regional and local television and radio stations, highlighting the huge variety of volunteering currently available. More than 4,000 BBC staff are being given half a day's paid leave (to be matched by a half-day of their own time) to the venture. TimeBank is being funded by \u00a31.9m over three years from the home office. That figure has already been more than matched by sponsorship in kind from individuals and private companies. Individuals can register their interests either through the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/timebank\"> TimeBank website</a> or by telephoning 09065 540400. Recognised charities accredited by the National Centre for Volunterring can register their opportunities direct via the <a href=\"http://www.TheSite.org/do-it\">Site-org website</a> or by posting them to TimeBank, POBox 3000, Manchester M60 3LA. </p> <p> <strong> Millennium Volunteers:</strong> This is a new UK-wide initiative to encourage more 16-24 year olds to volunteer their time. It was launched by the prime minister in January, 1999, to reverse the 12% fall in youth volunteering between 1991-97. It has a \u00a315m budget from the windfall levy and a further \u00a335m in England from the department of employment. There are currently 100 projects, with another 80 under negotiation. About 4,000 young people have started volunteering and the aim is to recruit 100,000 over the next three years. </p> <p>Millennium Volunteer Ambassadors - famous names from the media, sport, music and entertainmen, who have all undertaken volunteering - will \"take the message\" to young people in the next two months of high profile promotion. </p> <p>Opportunities available to young people under the programme include sports coaching, mentoring, peer mediation, environmental projects, youth leadership, music and dance. Helpline: 0800 9178185. </p> <p> <strong> Active Community Awards:</strong> Launched last December, more than 1,000 nominations had been received by the closing date on January 11.

There is little to cheer when the report continues to gather dust on ministerial desks. </p> <p>As Sir Stewart Sutherland, vice-chancellor of Edinburgh university, cautioned a year ago, when a royal commission is established, the cynics believe it is because \"a difficult issue is being kicked into the long grass so that someone other than the government can take the blame for problems which are impossible to solve or unpalatable in their solution\". </p> <p>To date, there has been merely a debate on long-term care in the House of Commons last December, which fell a long way short of offering the government's response to the commission's recommendations. </p> <p>The essential issue remains that while we all expect or hope to grow old, some of us will need long-term care (the likelihood of needing residential care is estimated at one in five for men aged over 65 and one in three for women). The risk is spread unevenly, and so too are the costs. </p> <p>As the commission pointed out, someone who is ill with cancer or heart disease will be cared for free of charge by the NHS; but the position of someone needing care because they have severe dementia, for example, is quite different. This care is generally not seen as the province of the health service, but of local authority social care, and social services are means tested and carry charges for the service user. </p> <p>Anyone with capital assets (that is assets which include the value of their home) of \u00a316,000 or more is responsible for the total cost of care home fees, necessitating the sale of the house to make assets liquid. Those with fewer assets have to contribute towards the fees, and it is not until assets drop to below \u00a310,000 that no charge is made. </p> <p>The system at present, as the commission observed, \"helps people who are poor, demands that people of modest means make themselves poor before it will help, and affects people to a lesser degree the richer they are\". The system is inconsistent. Moreover, it fails to meet \"the reasonable expectations of old people\" who believe that they have already paid into the system through national insurance \"which they were led to believe would look after them in later life, whatever their needs\". </p> <p>The sense of unfairness and betrayal that older people feel is genuine and distressing. Few can have anticipated being forced to sell the family home and to part with money saved through a lifetime of making do in order to meet care fees - calculated by the commission at an average \u00a3275 per week in residential care and \u00a3350 per week in a nursing home. Estimates vary, but a widely quoted figure is that 40,000 homes are being sold every year to pay for long-term care. </p> <p>The political difficulties of this issue for all parties are clear. For the Conservatives, it was clearly at odds with the aspirations of a property owning democracy, and John Major's pledge that the right \"to own a home and pass it on is one of the most important rights that an individual has in a free society\". For Labour, too, there are problems. The prime minister himself is on record - in his 1997 conference speech - declaiming that his vision for Britain is not of a country in which old people are forced to sell their homes to pay for care. </p> <p>The alternative model presented by the royal commission attempted to break down the care bill into the constituents of living costs, housing costs and personal care costs. While the commission accepted that there could be a case for people contributing to the first two, subject to their means, they argued that the costs of personal care should be treated as something \"quite different\". </p> <p>\"These are the costs which, unpredictably and through no fault of their own, old people have to incur when they can no longer be looked after at home or cannot be sent home after hospital treatment. They reflect the true risk and 'catastrophic' nature of needing long-term care. In our judgment it is right for the state to exempt personal care from means-testing altogether. This is our key recommendation.\" </p> <p>The price tag on this proposal is significant. It could cost an annual \u00a31.1bn, rising to \u00a32.6bn by 2021 and \u00a36.4bn by 2051. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, has promised that the 2000 spending review \"will consider long-term care funding\" and will be followed by a white paper. He also acknowledged that \"we need to find a fairer way of fund ing long-term care for the future\". At the same time, this objective will be set alongside the underlying principle \"that people should provide for themselves where they are able to\". Such a circle will be hard to square. </p> <p>Milburn told the Commons that further work would include exploring \"with the financial services industry how it could best design long-term care insurance products and other financial products to see if they could be made attractive to a wider audience\". </p> <p>This is almost certainly not the road to go down.

La Mosquitia is about the size of Wales, has just two hospitals and is only accessible by boat or by plane. I work for Tearfund, which works with indigenous organisations. One of these is Mopawi, and I went to support them on a range of programmes including agriculture, education, forestry, women's projects and land rights' issues. </p> <p>This was my first experience overseas as an aid worker and it was an eye-opener to exchange the comforts of Britain for a home among people living in wood and straw houses. The tiny village of Belen, on Honduras's north coast, is situated on a narrow strip of land forming the outer curve of a large lagoon, virtually surrounded by water. It is an hour's flight from the nearest big town and only six feet above sea level; the village certainly felt vulnerable. </p> <p>I realised just how vulnerable we were when hurricane Mitch struck - the most powerful hurricane there for 300 years. Belen was just 60 miles from the epicentre. The village, its occupants and a rather shaken aid-worker survived, although much of the landward defence was destroyed. One important project undertaken by the local women was to replant a protective barrier of mangroves and trees along the lagoon edge. </p> <p>I quickly learned that men and women have clearly defined roles here. The women work long hours to provide for their families but earn very little income. The men often are away for weeks at a time and travel great distances to work in the lobster-diving industry or in agriculture growing the basic crops on which they depend for survival. Not surprisingly, it is the women who are the foundation of the village and it was with them that I worked most closely. Over 70% of the world's poor are women. </p> <p>Mopawi is working to redress this inequality and help women to increase their earning power by initiating projects that will help them in their move away from a subsistence economy towards a viable market economy. It does this by using sustainable, natural resources that can be exploited without causing damage. A butterfly farm as a tourist attraction, for instance, provides local women with employment opportunities. </p> <p>Many women have large families (nine children is average) and they are tied to their village, so we helped to set up businesses that they could run from home. These include bread and cake baking, agriculture and eco-tourism, which is providing a valuable source of income for women who are able to offer accommodation and simple meals. Mopawi has also helped to establish communal banks for women linked to these income- generating activities. This also gives them enough basic education to begin to use the banks to save their earnings for needs such as medical emergencies and to provide a more secure future for their families. </p> <p>Involving the whole community, Mopawi is also developing long-term plans to help the community to take responsible decisions about its future. Concerns include an influx of new people, the preservation and use of the UN world heritage site, the Rio Platano biosphere reserve (which covers almost half of La Mosquitia), and pressure on the rainforest from logging and cattle ranching. </p> <p>Mopawi's work continues. It is starting a community healthcare programme to reduce mortality rates, provide basic health education and introduce sanitation in order to avoid the risk of disease. </p> <p>After all these experiences, it's a delight to find that Tearfund has launched a new education pack on the role of women in the developing world, called Women Hold Up Half the Sky. It is a great opportunity for me to celebrate the role of the women I have met and worked with for the past four years. But it is also an opportunity for everyone to recognise the day-to-day struggle many women face around the world and to help to raise funds to change their lives in practical and sustainable ways - as Mopawi is attempting to do in La Mosquitia.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Community participation was flavour of the month way back in the late 1960s. But the oil crisis and then Thatcherism and the market put paid to that. It was business, not communities, who were to be the new partners. Now a range of new policies has put community participation, even perhaps community leadership, firmly back on the agenda. Will it be different this time? </p> <p>The New Deal for communities and the national strategy for neighbourhood renewal that will come out of the work of the social exclusion unit, are opportunities nobody can afford to miss. </p> <p>But it is one thing to apply the rose-coloured language of community and partnership to today's \"wicked\" issues. It's quite another to make it work, let alone keep it going after the initial fanfare of publicity has died down. </p> <p>On the other hand, it's easy to be cynical - to see it as inevitable that public sector cultures will resist change and to argue that it is in the nature of capital and of power that people will be repeatedly expected to manage their own deprivation. Parts of government have demonstrated an ability to do what they've always done in a different wrapping: despite all the rhetoric, performance measures, audit systems and incentives tend to focus attention inwards and reinforce a culture of control. But policy making and implementation is more complex than this. </p> <p>If local government is to be modernised, rather than re-engineered, then the rhetoric of partnership and governance needs to be driven home by those who have an investment in change. People who have lived and worked in what are variously called hard-to-let, deprived, disadvantaged estates know that there is no easy solution to social and political exclusion. </p> <p>There are real tensions involved in sharing power, in reconciling leadership, participation and democratic accountability and in meeting the needs of diverse communities which may be as alienated from each other as they are from society at large. </p> <p>Community participation must never be used as a substitute for addressing the economic forces that lead to exclusion. </p> <p>So what do I want to see change in the coming decade? Here are a few small things to start with:</p> <p>\u0095 A hands-off approach from the centre - a willingness to risk a few failures and admit to mistakes, because we can learn from them. <br> \u0095 New systems of professional training and accreditation which place a premium on enabling, rather than control, and which spread knowledge, rather than protect it. <br> \u0095 Politicians who are in the job because they want to give a voice to local people and who recognise that they need new skills to negotiate, broker, listen and mediate. <br> \u0095 Performance, budgetary and audit systems which are servants, rather than masters, and give the people who are supposed to benefit the opportunity to define how they will measure local needs, benchmark services and monitor progress. <br> \u0095 Funding programmes with language, rules, timescales and monitoring requirements that can pass a \"small organisations litmus test\" and reach those communities which always miss out. <br> \u0095 Patience on all sides. The alienation of decades won't be solved overnight, and rushing at fences to meet political deadlines will repeat the mistakes of the past, continuing to exclude the communities that are hardest to reach. <br> \u0095 A willingness to experiment with representative structures and find new ways of combining effective leadership with access, democratic accountability and participation. <br> \u0095 A new approach to benefits which allows people to be recompensed for their participation without prejudice or hassle when they are doing work that other people would be paid for. </p> <p>\u0095 Marilyn Taylor is professor of social policy at Brighton university. </p> <p> <strong>Help the rich to spend their money</strong><br> When the rapid increase in the gap between the income of the richest and poorest in society happened in the 1980s and early 1990s, we saw it as a direct consequence of the policies of the Thatcher years. Now we have a Labour government, but policies on this front don't seem to be changing. </p> <p>While the focus on work as a means of moving out of low income has many advantages, there are going to continue to be people who are not able to work for one reason or another. Whether we like it or not, there will always be some vulnerable people who need support, both financial and emotional, in order to lead a reasonable life. </p> <p>The issue of income disparities is not just a matter of assisting people who receive the least. The lifecycle changes that everyone experiences also put pressure on individuals and families at different stages. </p> <p>We know that children are very expensive - in income forgone by parents stopping work, as well as in direct expenditure. More costs are being shifted from the state to the family for higher education on the one hand, and to support unemployed 16 year olds on the other. We also know that many 70 and 80 year olds do not have the funds to pay for their long-term care. </p> <p>While more of the future generation of older people will have occupational pensions and housing equity, it will not be the majority for many years to come. The role of the state to help redistribute funds over the lifecycle seems to have been forgotten. In many ways, the arguments in favour of redistribution have not changed since Richard Titmuss was writing in the 1950s. </p> <p>But nowadays there are people whose annual earnings are huge - \u00a31m a year or more. If you are working long hours to earn your money - as these people are - how do you find the time to spend it? There must be limits to the amount of conspicuous consumption in which one can indulge. But, apart from the Sainsbury family, there is little evidence of this new wealth finding its way into philanthropy. </p> <p>The challenge I see for the future is to rediscover redistribution and to help the wealthy find constructive ways of spending their money. </p> <p>\u0095 Janet Lewis is research director at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. </p> <p><strong>Tell us about the floating voter of Essex</strong><br> I believe the biggest question facing domestic politics and every field of social policy is whether taxpayers are willing to pay more to fund public services. </p> <p>Politicians' belief that they are not is the reason why the NHS is in crisis, why the living standards of families on income support are still falling, why the national insurance system has been emasculated, why there is a teacher recruitment crisis in schools, why this government will fail to achieve most of its poverty reduction objectives and why our welfare state is becoming so divorced from the European norm - why we have public squalor in the face of private affluence. </p> <p>Indeed, it is arguable that this has been the main issue in social policy in the past 25 years. For almost the whole of that time, I have been reassuring my students that the empirical evidence (mainly British Social Attitudes surveys) is that a substantial majority supports increases in taxation in order to improve public services.

      "bodyText": "Community participation was flavour of the month way back in the late 1960s. But the oil crisis and then Thatcherism and the market put paid to that. It was business, not communities, who were to be the new partners. Now a range of new policies has put community participation, even perhaps community leadership, firmly back on the agenda. Will it be different this time? The New Deal for communities and the national strategy for neighbourhood renewal that will come out of the work of the social exclusion unit, are opportunities nobody can afford to miss. But it is one thing to apply the rose-coloured language of community and partnership to today's \"wicked\" issues. It's quite another to make it work, let alone keep it going after the initial fanfare of publicity has died down. On the other hand, it's easy to be cynical - to see it as inevitable that public sector cultures will resist change and to argue that it is in the nature of capital and of power that people will be repeatedly expected to manage their own deprivation. Parts of government have demonstrated an ability to do what they've always done in a different wrapping: despite all the rhetoric, performance measures, audit systems and incentives tend to focus attention inwards and reinforce a culture of control. But policy making and implementation is more complex than this. If local government is to be modernised, rather than re-engineered, then the rhetoric of partnership and governance needs to be driven home by those who have an investment in change. People who have lived and worked in what are variously called hard-to-let, deprived, disadvantaged estates know that there is no easy solution to social and political exclusion. There are real tensions involved in sharing power, in reconciling leadership, participation and democratic accountability and in meeting the needs of diverse communities which may be as alienated from each other as they are from society at large. Community participation must never be used as a substitute for addressing the economic forces that lead to exclusion. So what do I want to see change in the coming decade? Here are a few small things to start with: \u0095 A hands-off approach from the centre - a willingness to risk a few failures and admit to mistakes, because we can learn from them. \u0095 New systems of professional training and accreditation which place a premium on enabling, rather than control, and which spread knowledge, rather than protect it. \u0095 Politicians who are in the job because they want to give a voice to local people and who recognise that they need new skills to negotiate, broker, listen and mediate. \u0095 Performance, budgetary and audit systems which are servants, rather than masters, and give the people who are supposed to benefit the opportunity to define how they will measure local needs, benchmark services and monitor progress. \u0095 Funding programmes with language, rules, timescales and monitoring requirements that can pass a \"small organisations litmus test\" and reach those communities which always miss out. \u0095 Patience on all sides. The alienation of decades won't be solved overnight, and rushing at fences to meet political deadlines will repeat the mistakes of the past, continuing to exclude the communities that are hardest to reach. \u0095 A willingness to experiment with representative structures and find new ways of combining effective leadership with access, democratic accountability and participation. \u0095 A new approach to benefits which allows people to be recompensed for their participation without prejudice or hassle when they are doing work that other people would be paid for. \u0095 Marilyn Taylor is professor of social policy at Brighton university. Help the rich to spend their money When the rapid increase in the gap between the income of the richest and poorest in society happened in the 1980s and early 1990s, we saw it as a direct consequence of the policies of the Thatcher years. Now we have a Labour government, but policies on this front don't seem to be changing. While the focus on work as a means of moving out of low income has many advantages, there are going to continue to be people who are not able to work for one reason or another. Whether we like it or not, there will always be some vulnerable people who need support, both financial and emotional, in order to lead a reasonable life. The issue of income disparities is not just a matter of assisting people who receive the least. The lifecycle changes that everyone experiences also put pressure on individuals and families at different stages. We know that children are very expensive - in income forgone by parents stopping work, as well as in direct expenditure. More costs are being shifted from the state to the family for higher education on the one hand, and to support unemployed 16 year olds on the other. We also know that many 70 and 80 year olds do not have the funds to pay for their long-term care. While more of the future generation of older people will have occupational pensions and housing equity, it will not be the majority for many years to come. The role of the state to help redistribute funds over the lifecycle seems to have been forgotten. In many ways, the arguments in favour of redistribution have not changed since Richard Titmuss was writing in the 1950s. But nowadays there are people whose annual earnings are huge - \u00a31m a year or more. If you are working long hours to earn your money - as these people are - how do you find the time to spend it? There must be limits to the amount of conspicuous consumption in which one can indulge. But, apart from the Sainsbury family, there is little evidence of this new wealth finding its way into philanthropy. The challenge I see for the future is to rediscover redistribution and to help the wealthy find constructive ways of spending their money. \u0095 Janet Lewis is research director at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Tell us about the floating voter of Essex I believe the biggest question facing domestic politics and every field of social policy is whether taxpayers are willing to pay more to fund public services. Politicians' belief that they are not is the reason why the NHS is in crisis, why the living standards of families on income support are still falling, why the national insurance system has been emasculated, why there is a teacher recruitment crisis in schools, why this government will fail to achieve most of its poverty reduction objectives and why our welfare state is becoming so divorced from the European norm - why we have public squalor in the face of private affluence. Indeed, it is arguable that this has been the main issue in social policy in the past 25 years. For almost the whole of that time, I have been reassuring my students that the empirical evidence (mainly British Social Attitudes surveys) is that a substantial majority supports increases in taxation in order to improve public services. Hardly anyone, even Conservative voters, wants to cut taxation if it means cutting public services. It is for that reason that the Thatcher project to roll back the welfare state failed and why the Tories never got a majority of the popular vote. It is why public expenditure increased in real terms, as a proportion of GDP, and why taxation did not fall. In short, there is, in fact, massive political support for the welfare state. My students look sceptical and ask, with reason, why the Tories won four general elections in a row; why New Labour won only after it made a commitment not to increase public expenditure for two years nor increase direct taxation for the life of its first parliament. They question my analysis, pointing to New Labour policies cutting the standard rate of income tax, starving the public sector of resources and creating the lowest level of public expenditure as a proportion of GDP in living memory (more or less). In response I argue about the power of the floating voter, Essex Man, and about how the electoral system locks British politics into the aspirations of the lowest common denominator. But can such a deeply depressing conclusion really be true? I don't know and would like someone else to find out for me. \u0095 Jonathan Bradshaw is professor of social policy at York university.

Look not to the OECD conference in Edinburgh on GM safety, but to the US, where GM is liable to meltdown over the next few months as new research comes out - confirming all the scientific doubts - the tide of public opinion changes, farmers desert the new crops and the machinations of the companies in league with government are exposed. Even more to the point, a huge US lawsuit is being prepared against Monsanto and friends, which could blow their whole operation out of the water once and for all and leave Blair politically exposed come the next election. </p> <p>\u0095 But the chances of GM going away are slim. Witness the nuclear industry which has been rotten to the core for as long as anyone can remember yet has continued to operate after every imaginable disaster. The ousting of BNFL chief executive John Taylor is significant, but only because the former Exxon man was actually ready and keen to clean out the stables. </p> <p>\u0095 But how good to know that the OECD delegates at Edinburgh will be eating GM-free food. The caterers, Leith's, long ago took the decision to \"avoid the use of GM foods\". Did the OECD know this? It seems not. </p> <p>\u0095 And where's the Iolcos Grace, the grain ship that Greenpeace prevented coming in to Liverpool docks last weekend. Er, no one seems to know. She was last reported sailing into deep ocean. Cargill's, whose soya is aboard, says only that it will come into Liverpool when the tide is right, the coast-guard has no information and the ship itself is not contactable via the Inmarsat telephone service that BT operates. </p> <p>\u0095 For the first time in human history, the number of overweight people rivals the number of underweight people, according to the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington DC-based research group. While the world's underfed population has declined slightly since 1980 to 1.2 billion, the number of overweight people has surged to 1.2 billion. In the United States, 55% of adults are now overweight by international standards and almost one in four considered obese.

      "bodyText": "So what made Tony Blair change his mind, or rather distance himself from the pro-GM zealots, at the same time as pushing Mo Mowlam forward to deny his self-evident shift? Look not to the OECD conference in Edinburgh on GM safety, but to the US, where GM is liable to meltdown over the next few months as new research comes out - confirming all the scientific doubts - the tide of public opinion changes, farmers desert the new crops and the machinations of the companies in league with government are exposed. Even more to the point, a huge US lawsuit is being prepared against Monsanto and friends, which could blow their whole operation out of the water once and for all and leave Blair politically exposed come the next election. \u0095 But the chances of GM going away are slim. Witness the nuclear industry which has been rotten to the core for as long as anyone can remember yet has continued to operate after every imaginable disaster. The ousting of BNFL chief executive John Taylor is significant, but only because the former Exxon man was actually ready and keen to clean out the stables. \u0095 But how good to know that the OECD delegates at Edinburgh will be eating GM-free food. The caterers, Leith's, long ago took the decision to \"avoid the use of GM foods\". Did the OECD know this? It seems not. \u0095 And where's the Iolcos Grace, the grain ship that Greenpeace prevented coming in to Liverpool docks last weekend. Er, no one seems to know. She was last reported sailing into deep ocean. Cargill's, whose soya is aboard, says only that it will come into Liverpool when the tide is right, the coast-guard has no information and the ship itself is not contactable via the Inmarsat telephone service that BT operates. \u0095 For the first time in human history, the number of overweight people rivals the number of underweight people, according to the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington DC-based research group. While the world's underfed population has declined slightly since 1980 to 1.2 billion, the number of overweight people has surged to 1.2 billion. In the United States, 55% of adults are now overweight by international standards and almost one in four considered obese. And the trend is spreading to children as well, with one in five now classified as overweight.",

Ironically, their apparent fudge of the hunting issue now threatens to blow out of the water the government's well-earned reputation based upon all this progress. </p> <p>In Europe, too, there have been startling advances and the UK government helped to effect the major decisions to ban throughout the EU the keeping of calves in crates by 2006 and the use of battery cages for poultry by 2012. The UK was also a lead player in an amendment to the European Treaty signed in Amsterdam in 1997 requiring member states to \"pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals\" when formulating all agricultural, transport, internal market and research policies. This proposal also recognises animals as \"sentient\" beings. The implementation of EU legislation, however, is patchy and, in some states, derisory. One of the next steps forward for animals would be an effective EU inspectorate and enforcement agency to crack down on corrupt and callous hauliers, abattoirs, farms and laboratories throughout Europe, and to ensure that the now considerable body of EU welfare legislation is being put into effect.

The answer to this sounds chauvinistic but it was, in fact, the British as a nation that led the way. The whole movement against the slavery of animals started in 18th century London and was not so much a manifestation of typical British compassion as a reaction by the intelligentsia (Alexander Pope, Richard Steele, Joseph Addison, William Hogarth, Samuel Johnson and several of the poets, among others) against the exceptional cruelty of the British, displayed everywhere by the baiting of bulls and bears, dog fights, cock fights, the overdriving of horses, the appalling slaughter houses around Smithfield and the demonstrations of pointless vivisections for public entertainment. </p> <p>Foreign visitors were often shocked by what they saw. By the 1770s, according to Johnson, animal welfare was a much discussed topic and in 1789 the philosopher Jeremy Bentham attacked mankind's \"tyranny\" of the animals and included them within the moral community. \"The question is not can they reason?\" he said, \"nor can they talk, but can they suffer?\" </p> <p>Although the Napoleonic wars set back progress in this field, almost as soon as they were over, politicians began the battle to introduce the first legislation. </p> <p>Richard Martin and Thomas, Lord Erskine, both flamboyant and determined men, finally succeeded in 1822 with the passage of an act to protect cattle from cruelty - the first of its kind in the world.

Mr Larsson said: \"Considering the existing safety failures at Sellafield and the fact radioactive waste is still discharged into the North Sea, I see it as extremely unlikely that we will send more spent fuel to Sellafield.\" </p> <p>Nuclear power is highly contentious in Sweden and successive governments have pledged to close existing plants but several times postponed the decision. The government has supported other Nordic countries in a series of protests about the sea discharges of plutonium and other nuclear wastes. As the currents take Irish Sea waters round the Scottish coasts, some radionuclides are detectable on Swedish shores. </p> <p>Only last week the Icelandic environment minister was in London making another protest about Sellafield discharges on behalf of the Nordic block. Mr Larsson said the customer's decision to send the spent fuel had been taken before Sellafield's safety failures had become known: \"It shows that nuclear power is not the simple solution to the energy problem that many people claim. There are still unresolved problems with nuclear power.\" </p> <p>The decision shows that BNFL's troubles are a long way from over despite Monday's sacking of its chief executive, John Taylor, and a promise of a fresh start from its chairman, Hugh Collum. </p> <p>BNFL has lost a lot of business from Japan already, and Germany is claiming compensation because it has shut a reactor loaded with fuel for which there was false documentation.</p>",

The spent fuel was from a research reactor, and was to be dissolved in nitric acid in the Thorp reprocessing plant; in theory, the cleaned up uranium could then be re-used, though in fact this was unlikely to happen. BNFL confirmed last night that it had been told that a planned shipment had been suspended. \"The customer is still keen to send it but the politicians have intervened,\" the spokesman said. Swedish regulators passed the fuel for Sellafield last August but political approval was required. Mr Larsson said: \"Considering the existing safety failures at Sellafield and the fact radioactive waste is still discharged into the North Sea, I see it as extremely unlikely that we will send more spent fuel to Sellafield.\" Nuclear power is highly contentious in Sweden and successive governments have pledged to close existing plants but several times postponed the decision. The government has supported other Nordic countries in a series of protests about the sea discharges of plutonium and other nuclear wastes. As the currents take Irish Sea waters round the Scottish coasts, some radionuclides are detectable on Swedish shores. Only last week the Icelandic environment minister was in London making another protest about Sellafield discharges on behalf of the Nordic block. Mr Larsson said the customer's decision to send the spent fuel had been taken before Sellafield's safety failures had become known: \"It shows that nuclear power is not the simple solution to the energy problem that many people claim. There are still unresolved problems with nuclear power.\" The decision shows that BNFL's troubles are a long way from over despite Monday's sacking of its chief executive, John Taylor, and a promise of a fresh start from its chairman, Hugh Collum. BNFL has lost a lot of business from Japan already, and Germany is claiming compensation because it has shut a reactor loaded with fuel for which there was false documentation.",

Imran Khan said there was \"no constitutional impediment\" to prevent the Met's racial and violent crime task force removing responsibility from West Mercia police. The families of doorman Harold \"Errol\" McGowan, 34, and his nephew Jason, 20, believe they were killed by a racist mob after an extensive period of racial harassment in Telford, Shropshire. Outside Scotland Yard, where the family was due to meet the head of the task force, deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, Mr Khan said: \"The family have lost all confidence in West Mercia Police.\" He appealed to the task force to take over the case \"lock, stock and barrel\". He also called for \"a proper, thorough, impartial\" investigation and said the McGowan family had lodged two formal complaints against police. The families of the dead men last month demanded the inquiry be passed from West Mercia police to the task force, a request rejected by the West Mercia chief constable Peter Hampton. Mr Hampton, who earlier agreed to a joint re-investigation of both deaths, has said he has confidence in his own officers to conduct the new inquiry. But the McGowan family, which was meeting home secretary Jack Straw at the House of Commons today, was urging West Mercia police formally to invite the task force to take over the investigation. Harold McGowan's body was found hanging in a house in Telford last June. His nephew was found hanging from railings early on January 1.",

      "body": "<p>Three Kings may not be the only movie about the Gulf war, but it can claim to be the first movie that tries to present Operation Desert Storm for what it was: an exercise in confused motivations, undecided objectives, and media-fuelled political paranoia. And since director David O Russell spent some $48m of Warner Bros's money bringing Three Kings into existence, it also has some claim to being the most anti-American studio movie of its generation. </p> <p>At first sight, Russell cuts an unlikely figure as the standard-bearer of Hollywood agit-prop. Aside from Three Kings, he has two films to his name, Spanking the Monkey and Flirting with Disaster - both stand-up independent-movie success stories, but hardly indicative of a commitment to myth-demolishing film-making. He carries a reputation for being a difficult customer: a prickly interviewee; focused on-set to the point of being a browbeater; ostentatiously turning a video camera back on those hoping to inspect him and his movie. </p> <p>In the flesh, however, Russell turns out to be simply the kind of person who thinks before he speaks, who's wary of being dragged into much-ploughed side-issues (such as the vociferous arguments he apparently got into with lead actor George Clooney). He's also the very model of concise expression when a point demands it. </p> <p>This last quality, clearly, is what persuaded Warner Bros that Russell could hack it in the big leagues; besides, unlike practically every other major studio, Warner possesses no pseudo-independent feeder label that, like Miramax for Disney, tends to take care of maverick talent like Russell. </p> <p>\"When they welcomed me, I couldn't believe they would let me do anything ,\" he recalls. \"You may remember Warner Bros had just had a terrible two years. They'd done all these franchise movies - Lethal Weapon 4 and Batman and Robin - and all their movies had a certain flavour to them. The New York Times business section ran a piece that encouraged them to step up and start using more independent film-makers. Three Kings is now perceived as a new archetype: an independent-minded studio picture. I think it's seen as a hybrid. It was way too big to be a boutique independent film; it's not exactly the paint-by-numbers commercial film; it's somewhere in the middle.\" </p> <p>Three Kings is undoubtedly a unique proposition. Russell has harnessed all the slash-and-burn tropes of the modern war movie, creating expansive firefights, injecting pitch-black humour wherever feasible, and unleashing unambiguous disapproval of presidential foreign policy in the wake of Operation Desert Storm. Though Warners is still celebrated for its string of social-conscience movies in the Scarface: Shame of a Nation tradition, that was decades back, and studios these days hate to dabble in political hot water. </p> <p>\"The politics they never much debated,\" says Russell, of the greenlighting process. \"They were very deferential about the script. There were very few notes, very little discussion. There are projects that are studio driven, and projects that are writer-director driven; and this was clearly perceived as the latter. I think they felt it was an Oliver Stone movie - not literally , but that category. Or Scorsese. When I first set out to write it, I said, don't let me come back with a script and have it freak you out. I told them right up front what my intentions were. They said, no - we're not afraid of that, we've made films with these other guys before.\" </p> <p>As it happens, the political content of Three Kings is perfectly in keeping with Russell's pre- film-making career. A literature and political-science student in the early 80s, Russell spent four months teaching in Nicaragua as the Contra insurgency gathered steam. Back in the US, he continued working with immigrants, before turning to documentary-making at the Smithsonian institute. </p> <p>Russell isn't a firebrand, exactly; just an astute observer of American society in action. \"I think the war smelled a little funny to people at the time, and they'd just as soon not think about it. And that's why, when people see the movie, it hasn't created an uproar. I think it affirms what they feel in their guts, but just haven't wanted to deal with before. People felt it wasn't all that it was presented; there was something messy about it.\" </p> <p>Russell went about researching the Gulf war meticulously, soaking himself in the plentiful documentary material from this most media-infiltrated of conflicts. The complex torture techniques Three Kings shows were drawn from actual photographs and the testimony of US and British prisoners of war. At one point, he even contemplated crossing over into Iraq itself. \"I had a businessman friend from Kuwait, who was going to help me go in. Everyone said, you shouldn't do that; which made it all the more exciting to me. And then they started bombing again...\" </p> <p>Three Kings, Russell says, originated with \"a very two-dimensional\" Desert Storm-heist script that Warner Bros already owned, called Spoils of War. It was written by John Ridley, whose manuscript novel Stray Dogs had already been through Oliver Stone's mill, emerging as U Turn. Ridley soon turned sore, accusing Russell in the entertainment press of trying to \"grab credit\", and blocking the book publication of the screenplay. </p> <p>Ridley eventually got his \"story by\" credit, but Russell faced more difficulties even before the production got off the ground. \"There was one guy who was pretty high up at the studio,\" he says, \"who was, like, on a par with the chairman, but on the business side; and he was trying to cross over to the creative side. And when my head of production Lorenzo di Bonaventura, who was the champion of the production, was out of town on vacation for a week, he tried to get the plug pulled. He tried to convince Clooney to drop out, saying that the controversy, nationally and internationally, would mean trouble. Clooney, to his credit said, I don't believe you; so the whole coup attempt failed. Clooney at that point was pay-or-play, so the only way to pull the plug was to get the main pay-or-play guy to pull back.\" </p> <p> And there were well- documented troubles on the shoot, too. The studio shaved $10m off the budget Russell had requested, resulting in a schedule truncated by 12 days. The pressure got to the whole crew, with Clooney and his director facing off towards the end of their arduous stint in the desert - Arizona, as it happens, rather than the Middle East. Clooney, who swept into London last week to support the film, remains outspoken in his praise for Russell's talent. \"We had about three good screaming matches. Never a fist-fight. We had some good arguments. It was a much bigger film than David had ever been involved in, and we were having to trust that. I was in over my head too. </p> <p>\"David is really brilliant at this. His idea was to resensitise people to violence. He didn't just want to show the effect of the gunshot, he wanted to show it literally. He used to say to us: 'every bullet counts'. He said that every day.\" </p> <p>For his part, Russell remains grateful to Clooney - a real Hollywood liberal, if ever there was one - for sticking his neck out for the project. \"Yeah,\" he says. \"No movie star, no budget. I was actually talking to Nic Cage at first, but he ended up doing the Scorsese movie Bringing out the Dead. Clooney was very aggressive about pursuing it; but at the time I thought of Clooney as being more of a romantic leading man. After meeting him, I was persuaded that he really got the whole thing, and had the deadpan sensibility for it. Also he has, I think, a grizzled maturity that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise or even Cage don't exactly have.\" </p> <p>\"The main proposition,\" says Russell, with finality, \"is to have a cinematic experience that grabs you and doesn't let go of you until the end, and constantly surprises you. And then at the end you realise - jeez, there was this historical-political expos\u00e9 along the way. You want to put people in spin cycle.

Where they disagreed was in deciding whether the book actually worked (whatever that means). The words \"honourable failure\" played on many lips, but in the overcrowded world of literary biography that may be preferable to tedious success.</p> <p> <strong>John Carey</strong>, in the <strong>Sunday Times</strong>, was Motion's chief supporter. \"Brilliantly innovative, gripping, intricately researched, Motion's biography does justice to its subject at last,\" trilled Carey (that will sit happily on the paperback). Carey's analysis was itself rather brilliant, since it explored the cultural issue which makes writing about Wainewright worth while - the notion of the artist as criminal, the issue which had attracted the attention of Wainewright apologist Oscar Wilde.</p> <p> \"For champions of orthodoxy,\" wrote Carey, \"it was imperative to denigrate Wainewright's work as foppish and unhealthy, otherwise it might appear that good art and immorality could be compatible. Wilde, on the other hand, cited him specifically to prove that \"there is no essential incongruity between crime and culture\". This is a tricky issue for Andrew Motion. By accepting the job of Poet Laureate (murderers need not apply) he might seem to have committed himself to an institutional, social-service view of culture. So presumably he should reject Wilde's thesis. In the book he hedges his bets, telling the story twice, first with Wainewright innocent, then with Wainewright guilty.\"</p> <p> \"The first version is a memoir, ostensibly by Wainewright himself, imitating his showy, dreamy Romantic prose, and indignantly rebutting the slanders heaped on him by ignorance, malice and defaulting life-insurers. The second version, supplied in Motion's notes to each chapter, records suspicious circumstances that the memoir omits. The verdict of the notes is that Wainewright was almost certainly both a ruthless murderer and an outstanding painter and critic - far ahead of his time, for example, in his appreciation of Blake and Keats.\"</p> <p> Motion called his book an \"experimental biography\" - a memoir purporting to be by Wainewright himself. The experiment intrigued but on the whole failed to convince. The attractions of Wainewright as a biographical subject are clear, explained <strong>D J Taylor</strong> in the <strong>Guardian</strong>. \"There is the irresistibly seductive vision of the Romantic extremist, plunging Byronically through a world of strychnine and high aesthetics; there are the tantalising byways populated by all manner of contemporary curios such as the artists Henry Fuseli and Theodore von Holst, the latter responsible for some highly graphic erotica. And above all there is the beguiling sense of a blank canvas - writing a life of which so little is known that a satisfyingly large amount can be inferred gives the biographer an importance which is not allowed him in those lives already commemorated by a dozen fat volumes of letters. This is Motion's lure and his justification, but it is also his dilemma, and one which, despite all manner of graceful flourishes and a huge amount of lightly worn learning, I don't think he comes anywhere near to solving.\"</p> <p> \"Though Wainewright the Poisoner is neatly done and crammed with beguiling detail, to read these accounts of seedy continental exile and the indignities of his final years in Tasmania (Wainewright had expected a light sentence in return for admitting to two minor fraud charges, but was grievously disappointed) is to hear a constant undertow of ghost voices, a sense of what the material would have made as a novel by Peter Ackroyd or AS Byatt rather than an \"experimental biography\" by the Poet Laureate. This is not an insult.\" Oh, yes it is.</p> <p> <strong>Charles Saumarez Smith</strong>, in the <strong>Observer</strong>, also imagined what Ackroyd might have made of it. \"In the end,\" he concluded, \"[Motion's] book is clever, but not compelling, a brave attempt to re-invent the life and attitudes of an intriguing historical figure, but a book which falls between the different literary requirements of fiction and of history.\"</p> <p> <strong>Hilary Spurling</strong>, in the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, broadened the argument to make a point about the essential incompatibility of the two genres: \"The result is interesting but not wholly successful, because the art of biography consists precisely in animating the subject within his or her historical context. All true biographies (including Motion's own of Keats and Larkin) breathe life into accumulated factual research by an act of emotional and imaginative possession for which ventriloquism proves an inadequate substitute.\"</p> <p> <strong>Jonathan Bate</strong> (the Poet Laureate certainly brought out the heavyweights), writing in the <strong>Independent</strong>, thought Motion was trying to have it both ways: \"The book is a broken-backed compromise.

But they discovered that one box is being held back and will remain sealed until 2037.</p> <p>Earlier this week the historian Andrew Roberts forecast that the archive would reveal the true extent of the Queen Mother's involvement in the feud between the Duke of Windsor, who abdicated from the throne in 1936, and her husband, who became King George V1 in his stead.</p> <p>Mr Roberts said the papers could also at last solve the enduring controversy over how deeply the duke sympathised with fascism. But today Mr Roberts said: \"It would appear that the crown jewels are missing from this collection.\"</p> <p>The Oxford constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor said the papers disclosed today contained no spectacular revelations. \"This is part of history and part of the British constitution,\" he said. \"But it is also a personal family matter and a personal family wound. I don't believe the royal family want that wound constantly exposed.\"</p> <p>One document was a telegram from the Queen Mother's brother-in-law, the late Duke of Windsor, to Adolf Hitler just before the second world war broke out, Prof Bogdanor said. Hitler replied by saying peace depended on England, not Germany. There was no evidence in the files of any \"treasonable\" activity by the duke.</p> <p>\"The archive shows there was no responsibility to remove the king from the throne. It was inevitable from the start. It shows the king was determined to act constitutionally throughout,\" he said.</p> <p>Oxford university said the box was being kept closed in line with public record office policy. However, \"all but a small number of papers\" were being made available for research.</p> <p>Mr Roberts said it appeared that one or two letters from the Queen Mother to Sir Walter had been weeded out of some of the boxes made available today.</p> <p>He said one of the letters from the then queen to Sir Walter in August 1940 may have thrown light on the feud between Buckingham Palace and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. He said the letter related to the arrival of the Duke and Duchess in the Bahamas where the former king was to become governor.</p> <p>\"This letter could be terribly exciting and a real insight into the extent of the personal feud between the then Queen and the Windsors. By the time that the Duke of Windsor was on his way to the Bahamas it became evident that there were people at the palace, though we do not know whom, who were trying to ensure that the Duchess did not get royal treatment,\" he said.</p> <p>\"This letter may have told us something about this.\"</p>",

Earlier this week the historian Andrew Roberts forecast that the archive would reveal the true extent of the Queen Mother's involvement in the feud between the Duke of Windsor, who abdicated from the throne in 1936, and her husband, who became King George V1 in his stead. Mr Roberts said the papers could also at last solve the enduring controversy over how deeply the duke sympathised with fascism. But today Mr Roberts said: \"It would appear that the crown jewels are missing from this collection.\" The Oxford constitutional expert Vernon Bogdanor said the papers disclosed today contained no spectacular revelations. \"This is part of history and part of the British constitution,\" he said. \"But it is also a personal family matter and a personal family wound. I don't believe the royal family want that wound constantly exposed.\" One document was a telegram from the Queen Mother's brother-in-law, the late Duke of Windsor, to Adolf Hitler just before the second world war broke out, Prof Bogdanor said. Hitler replied by saying peace depended on England, not Germany. There was no evidence in the files of any \"treasonable\" activity by the duke. \"The archive shows there was no responsibility to remove the king from the throne. It was inevitable from the start. It shows the king was determined to act constitutionally throughout,\" he said. Oxford university said the box was being kept closed in line with public record office policy. However, \"all but a small number of papers\" were being made available for research. Mr Roberts said it appeared that one or two letters from the Queen Mother to Sir Walter had been weeded out of some of the boxes made available today. He said one of the letters from the then queen to Sir Walter in August 1940 may have thrown light on the feud between Buckingham Palace and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. He said the letter related to the arrival of the Duke and Duchess in the Bahamas where the former king was to become governor. \"This letter could be terribly exciting and a real insight into the extent of the personal feud between the then Queen and the Windsors. By the time that the Duke of Windsor was on his way to the Bahamas it became evident that there were people at the palace, though we do not know whom, who were trying to ensure that the Duchess did not get royal treatment,\" he said. \"This letter may have told us something about this.\"",

Every new mother in the designated areas gets a Unicef-MCH leaflet which explains how to rehydrate a child with diarrhoea and gives advice on everything from washing hands before meals to Aids. A pamphlet for local medical workers on health education is illustrated by cartoons.

Much progress has clearly been made in rural health in the last decade, at least in those trial areas, and, with a life expectancy of 71 and countrywide provision of basic services, China compares favourably with many other large developing countries.

      "body": "<p>Each year around 3,500 people are killed on our roads and 40,000 are seriously injured. In total, there are over 300,000 road casualties every year. That is an enormous toll of lives shattered, hearts broken.</p> <p>I have received countless letters from parents, brothers, sisters, friends of those killed and injured on our roads. Every one tells of a family devastated, lives blighted, of pain, sorrow and anger and the waste of it. And every one is painful to read.</p> <p>Just before last Christmas I met a delegation of children, parents and campaigners to talk about road safety. Many had travelled a considerable distance to tell me why they thought we should make road safety, and particularly child safety, a priority.</p> <p>I was very moved by their experiences and their commitment. And I promised that we would take action.</p> <p>Which is not to say we have a bad record on road safety. Britain has had remarkable success in reducing road casualties and we now have one of the best records in Europe, and indeed the world.</p> <p>But a good record isn't enough.</p> <p>That is why we have announced demanding new targets for reductions in the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads.</p> <p>And a particularly ambitious target for children.</p> <p>By 2010 we will aim to have achieved:</p> <p>* a further 50% reduction in the numbers of children killed or seriously injured;</p> <p>* a further 40% overall reduction in the numbers of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents; and</p> <p>* a further 10% reduction in the slight casualty rate.</p> <p>Although our overall record for child safety is relatively good, our child pedestrian record is poor in comparison.</p> <p>Last year, 103 children were killed as pedestrians on our roads - 103 too many.</p> <p>This is why we are setting a specific, much tougher target for children killed or seriously injured in road accidents.</p> <p>And drivers are far more likely to kill if they are travelling at speed.</p> <p>We will expect local authorities to take action to control speeds in areas where children are most vulnerable, particularly around schools.</p> <p>Our strategy is to target the problem and take effective action to deal with it. So:</p> <p>* we will ensure all local authorities conduct a child safety audit. I expect local authorities to introduce many more traffic-calmed 20mph zones, as a result, focussed on schools, on where people live and on children's routes to school;</p> <p>* we will improve the way we educate our children to be safer when using the road. It is not only about drivers taking care, or slower speeds, it is also about helping children and others to understand better the risks they face and how to deal with them;</p> <p>* and we will do more to target those who are particularly vulnerable - children in deprived areas, and children changing from primary to secondary school.</p> <p>Much has been said about speeds and speed limits. Research shows us that speed, more than anything else, is what is killing people. So controlling speed is at the heart of our strategy.</p> <p>When you realise that 85% of pedestrians hit at 40mph will die, compared to 45% at 30mph and 5% at 20mph. Speed kills just as effectively as drink driving. These are impressive and telling figures.</p> <p>Speed can make the difference between life and death.</p> <p>Speed limits are there for a specific purpose.</p> <p>With local authorities, we will take a long hard look at how we design roads and at the limits we set.</p> <p>To check that local authorities get speed limits right, we will provide detailed guidance.</p> <p>And we will take tough new steps to enforce speed limits and discourage dangerous driving, with tougher penalties set out in the major new review the Home Office is carrying out with the DETR.</p> <p>Our new strategy is a key element in our drive to improve transport safety generally. It has my very strong personal support. I believe it is possible to achieve the new casualty reduction targets. There is no doubt that measures taken in the last few years have had an effect. Our strategy will focus especially on speed. By working in partnership we can make a difference. With your help Britain can be a safer and more civilised place for everyone.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Each year around 3,500 people are killed on our roads and 40,000 are seriously injured. In total, there are over 300,000 road casualties every year. That is an enormous toll of lives shattered, hearts broken. I have received countless letters from parents, brothers, sisters, friends of those killed and injured on our roads. Every one tells of a family devastated, lives blighted, of pain, sorrow and anger and the waste of it. And every one is painful to read. Just before last Christmas I met a delegation of children, parents and campaigners to talk about road safety. Many had travelled a considerable distance to tell me why they thought we should make road safety, and particularly child safety, a priority. I was very moved by their experiences and their commitment. And I promised that we would take action. Which is not to say we have a bad record on road safety. Britain has had remarkable success in reducing road casualties and we now have one of the best records in Europe, and indeed the world. But a good record isn't enough. That is why we have announced demanding new targets for reductions in the number of people killed and seriously injured on our roads. And a particularly ambitious target for children. By 2010 we will aim to have achieved: * a further 50% reduction in the numbers of children killed or seriously injured; * a further 40% overall reduction in the numbers of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents; and * a further 10% reduction in the slight casualty rate. Although our overall record for child safety is relatively good, our child pedestrian record is poor in comparison. Last year, 103 children were killed as pedestrians on our roads - 103 too many. This is why we are setting a specific, much tougher target for children killed or seriously injured in road accidents. And drivers are far more likely to kill if they are travelling at speed. We will expect local authorities to take action to control speeds in areas where children are most vulnerable, particularly around schools. Our strategy is to target the problem and take effective action to deal with it. So: * we will ensure all local authorities conduct a child safety audit. I expect local authorities to introduce many more traffic-calmed 20mph zones, as a result, focussed on schools, on where people live and on children's routes to school; * we will improve the way we educate our children to be safer when using the road. It is not only about drivers taking care, or slower speeds, it is also about helping children and others to understand better the risks they face and how to deal with them; * and we will do more to target those who are particularly vulnerable - children in deprived areas, and children changing from primary to secondary school. Much has been said about speeds and speed limits. Research shows us that speed, more than anything else, is what is killing people. So controlling speed is at the heart of our strategy. When you realise that 85% of pedestrians hit at 40mph will die, compared to 45% at 30mph and 5% at 20mph. Speed kills just as effectively as drink driving. These are impressive and telling figures. Speed can make the difference between life and death. Speed limits are there for a specific purpose. With local authorities, we will take a long hard look at how we design roads and at the limits we set. To check that local authorities get speed limits right, we will provide detailed guidance. And we will take tough new steps to enforce speed limits and discourage dangerous driving, with tougher penalties set out in the major new review the Home Office is carrying out with the DETR. Our new strategy is a key element in our drive to improve transport safety generally. It has my very strong personal support. I believe it is possible to achieve the new casualty reduction targets. There is no doubt that measures taken in the last few years have had an effect. Our strategy will focus especially on speed. By working in partnership we can make a difference. With your help Britain can be a safer and more civilised place for everyone.",

      "body": "<p>Here's a list capable of loosening the bowels of anyone professing to love the cinema. Because every single name on it belongs to a movie currently in the process of being remade by one of the Hollywood studios: Battlestar Galactica, Bedazzled, Buck Rogers, The Dirty Dozen, Fahrenheit 451, Fantastic Voyage, Flash Gordon, Gone in Sixty Seconds, I Am Legend, I Claudius, Jason And The Argonauts, Logan's Run, Modesty Blaise, Planet Of The Apes (now to be dragged back to life by Tim Burton), Rollerball, A Star Is Born, Them!, The Time Machine, and X: The Man With X-Ray Eyes. Every one a classic - every one near-guaranteed to become a travesty in the not-too-distant future. Bear in mind that in Hollywood nothing, but nothing, is sacred (there was once a TV remake of Casablanca, in which Bogart was replaced by David Soul). But there's hope, in the shape of those much loved movies as yet unmolested by the execs. To wit, the following are not being remade. Yet. There's still time. </p> <p> <strong> Vertigo</strong> (Alfred Hitchcock, 1958) </p> <p> They've already done a TV version of Rear Window with Christopher Reeve in the Jimmy Stewart role, so don't think for a minute this won't be shoddily re-trod in the near future. 1976's Obsession, directed by serial Hitchcock-thief Brian De Palma, was a variation on its themes. Now it's only a matter of time before someone turns this serene temple of cinema into a heaving celluloid pissoir . And then they'll do The Birds properly, as Hitch would have wanted it. </p> <p> <strong> Highway To Hell </strong> (Mark Griffiths 1984) </p> <p> This is the kind of movie you saw in a drunken stupor on late-night TV 10 years ago and never forgot. When you finally track it down on video - good luck - it's every inch the nihilistic trash classic you remembered. Eric Stoltz escapes from his cop escort to Death Row and goes on the lam with a superstitious hooker who's been writing to him in prison. Everybody dies horribly. Trouble is, you show this to three friends and suddenly Jerry Bruckheimer's remaking it with a NASA-sized budget while buying up and burning all extant copies of the original. </p> <p> <strong> The Killer</strong> </p> <p>(John Woo, 1988) </p> <p> When video director Antoine Fuqua met Chow Yun-Fat (\"the Cary Grant of the exit-wound\") after the Asian superstar's arrival in Hollywood, his first words were \"Hey, you should do an American remake of The Killer!\" This suggestion alone should immediately have disqualified Fuqua from playing any part in Chow's career in Hollywood. Any fool can do bloodbags and shellcasings, as Fuqua proved with the aptly-titled Replacement Killers, but only Woo could have engineered a poignant marriage between slow-mo Peckinpah and Douglas Sirk's Magnificent Obsession. Bring me the head of Antoine Fuqua </p> <p> <strong> Detour</strong> </p> <p>(Edgar J Ulmer, 1944) </p> <p> I can just picture some executive striding around the conference table in a fever of inspiration saying \"Yeah, now this Detour thing might work if we just pour some money into it_\" And no one in the room will point out that Detour's power lies precisely in its Poverty Row origins. Made in six days on rickety sets and in rear-projection booths, starring the luckless Tom Neal, who later did time for murdering his wife, Detour remains so dark and poisonous it will probably send potential re-makers squealing for their mummies. Which has got to be good. </p> <p> <strong> Get Carter</strong> </p> <p>(Mike Hodges, 1971) </p> <p> Sadly, I cheated, because they're already remaking this toxic gangster classic. The script has been rewritten for Sylvester Stallone - it's like a nightmare, isn't it? - who will play a rather nicer Jack Carter than Michael Caine did in the original (he'll have a goatee). We will also be favoured with car chases, more gunplay, and a happy ending. This is exactly what happened when Mel Gibson re-adapted The Hunter (Richard Stark's source novel for John Boorman's Point Blank) to make Payback. He got cold feet about playing a bastard, fired the director, rewrote to death, and the gutless result was a foretaste of what we can expect from Carter 2000. If you need another Get Carter, choose the blaxploitation insta-remake, Hit Man. </p> <p> <strong> Night Of The Hunter</strong> </p> <p>(Charles Laughton, 1955) </p> <p> The kind of jerry-built accidental masterpiece that every suburban idiot in film school thinks he could make just that little bit better. Never mind the uniquely bizarre friction created by the gathering of such mismatched talents as Laughton, Lillian Gish, co-auteur Stanley Cortez, James Agee, Shelley Winters, Peter Graves and the mighty mighty Robert Mitchum, because someone's going to get their nasty mitts on it anytime now and bugger it up six ways from Sunday. </p> <p> <strong> The Magnificent Ambersons </strong> (Orson Welles, 1942) </p> <p> They can do what they like with Citizen Kane, but not with its melancholy and beautiful successor. Because there are some 30 minutes missing from the final version of The Magnificent Ambersons (an act of revenge on Welles by RKO Studios, the pigs), one can easily envisage someone deeming it worth redoing and thus \"fixing\". After all, there's Booth Tarkington's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1916 novel to draw on, so who needs Welles's screenplay? The vultures, as ever, are circling...</p>",

This week, just as emphatically, belongs to George W Bush, who nailed three wins in three very different contests in Virginia, North Dakota and Washington overnight. Next week, the key week, Super Tuesday week, the wheel spins again - and this time it will stop in deadly earnest.</p> <p>Just for a moment, though, turn aside from the mesmerising Bush-McCain contest and consider the day's biggest winner. Al Gore has been a forgotten man through Republican dominated February. But he has been out there campaigning night and day, east coast and west, away from the limelight that has been lavished on the Republicans. And last night he quietly won a bigger prize than anyone.</p> <p>By defeating Bill Bradley in an otherwise meaningless primary vote in Washington state yesterday, Gore proved he is the unstoppable winner in the Democratic race. Bradley had spent six consecutive days campaigning in Washington in the hope that a win there - in an often liberal and iconoclastic state - would get his challenge to Gore moving again. Last night, though, Gore won big - 69% to 30% - in Washington. Bradley's last throw ended humiliatingly.</p> <p>Six months ago, Bradley stood on the steps of his old high school in Crystal City, Missouri, and launched his presidential bid. His slogan was \"It Can Happen\". For a while last autumn, as Gore stuck in second gear and Bradley milked the \"I am not Al Gore\" routine, it looked as if it just might. But Gore has regrouped and Bradley has thrown it away. Washington was six wasted days. Gore leads by 14 points in New York, Bradley's last best hope which votes next week. After last night, it is clear. It won't happen.</p> <p>But Gore is the winner is a broader sense too. Last night, Bush recovered from Michigan and Arizona to duff McCain in a hat-trick of wins. From a Democratic point of view, it is the best of all possible results. The battle between McCain and Bush goes on, increasingly bitterly on the evidence of the religious wars between the two men this week, but in the end Bush looks to be emerging as the conservative and often underwhelming winner. McCain is the man the Gore people fear, so the script could have been written to suit Gore in every way.</p> <p>Bush's wins took the wind out of McCain's sails last night. Coming down the California central valley with McCain yesterday, as he campaigned for next week's primary here, there was barely a hint that things might be going amiss in Washington. The news from Virginia did not surprise. The result from Washington, though, was an evident shock. The mood among the McCain people went from relaxed to grim, chatty to taciturn, in a matter of moments, as they arrived in Los Angeles to be greeted with news from the northwest. It was a reminder of just how difficult their task really is.</p> <p>The three contests could hardly have been greater contrasts. North Dakota, where Bush romped home by 76% to 19%, is a prairie state with iron winters, strict teachings and a natural conservative take on the world. Bush's win there was expected, and McCain made only a single desultory visit to North Dakota, pausing for 30 minutes the day before yesterday to make a speech at Bismarck airport where the sound system failed. It was no surprise that the McCain message didn't get through either.</p> <p>No less expected was Bush's win in much more important Virginia, a once Democratic state now turned Republican, as most other Southern states were long ago. McCain is unpopular with the tobacco industry, and with some northern Virginia residents who don't like his advocacy of more flights into Washington DC's Ronald Reagan airport. Defeat by 53% to 44% was hardly a surprise. The McCain people had written Virginia off, but the 80% Bush win among core Republican voters is a fact which could toll the knell for McCain outside the South as well as inside it.</p> <p>Washington is the one that made a good night great for Bush. Part trendy Microsoft and high tech stuff, part old manual industry, Washington is a mixed bag. Seattle is one of the most relaxed cities in then world. Inland and to the east, though, the state moves sharply to the right. It has a record of going its own way, and last night it did. Bush's win - he led by 59% to 38% with 70% of the vote counted - was very big for a state in which McCain, like Bradley, felt the independents would play a key role. Like Bradley, however, McCain got it desperately wrong last night. Sleepless after Seattle in both cases. Next week is do or die.</p>",

But he has been out there campaigning night and day, east coast and west, away from the limelight that has been lavished on the Republicans. And last night he quietly won a bigger prize than anyone. By defeating Bill Bradley in an otherwise meaningless primary vote in Washington state yesterday, Gore proved he is the unstoppable winner in the Democratic race. Bradley had spent six consecutive days campaigning in Washington in the hope that a win there - in an often liberal and iconoclastic state - would get his challenge to Gore moving again. Last night, though, Gore won big - 69% to 30% - in Washington. Bradley's last throw ended humiliatingly. Six months ago, Bradley stood on the steps of his old high school in Crystal City, Missouri, and launched his presidential bid. His slogan was \"It Can Happen\". For a while last autumn, as Gore stuck in second gear and Bradley milked the \"I am not Al Gore\" routine, it looked as if it just might. But Gore has regrouped and Bradley has thrown it away. Washington was six wasted days. Gore leads by 14 points in New York, Bradley's last best hope which votes next week. After last night, it is clear. It won't happen. But Gore is the winner is a broader sense too. Last night, Bush recovered from Michigan and Arizona to duff McCain in a hat-trick of wins. From a Democratic point of view, it is the best of all possible results. The battle between McCain and Bush goes on, increasingly bitterly on the evidence of the religious wars between the two men this week, but in the end Bush looks to be emerging as the conservative and often underwhelming winner. McCain is the man the Gore people fear, so the script could have been written to suit Gore in every way. Bush's wins took the wind out of McCain's sails last night. Coming down the California central valley with McCain yesterday, as he campaigned for next week's primary here, there was barely a hint that things might be going amiss in Washington. The news from Virginia did not surprise. The result from Washington, though, was an evident shock. The mood among the McCain people went from relaxed to grim, chatty to taciturn, in a matter of moments, as they arrived in Los Angeles to be greeted with news from the northwest. It was a reminder of just how difficult their task really is. The three contests could hardly have been greater contrasts. North Dakota, where Bush romped home by 76% to 19%, is a prairie state with iron winters, strict teachings and a natural conservative take on the world. Bush's win there was expected, and McCain made only a single desultory visit to North Dakota, pausing for 30 minutes the day before yesterday to make a speech at Bismarck airport where the sound system failed. It was no surprise that the McCain message didn't get through either. No less expected was Bush's win in much more important Virginia, a once Democratic state now turned Republican, as most other Southern states were long ago. McCain is unpopular with the tobacco industry, and with some northern Virginia residents who don't like his advocacy of more flights into Washington DC's Ronald Reagan airport. Defeat by 53% to 44% was hardly a surprise. The McCain people had written Virginia off, but the 80% Bush win among core Republican voters is a fact which could toll the knell for McCain outside the South as well as inside it. Washington is the one that made a good night great for Bush. Part trendy Microsoft and high tech stuff, part old manual industry, Washington is a mixed bag. Seattle is one of the most relaxed cities in then world. Inland and to the east, though, the state moves sharply to the right. It has a record of going its own way, and last night it did. Bush's win - he led by 59% to 38% with 70% of the vote counted - was very big for a state in which McCain, like Bradley, felt the independents would play a key role. Like Bradley, however, McCain got it desperately wrong last night. Sleepless after Seattle in both cases. Next week is do or die.",

      "body": "<p>If nothing else, J\u00f6rg Haider is a master of surprise. His resignation as leader of the Austrian Freedom party was quite unexpected. But then, he is something else, an adroit and slippery political operator who ducks and dives with alarming agility. Having convulsed Austrian politics, Haider now says that he does not \"want to be seen as a shadow-chancellor\". He has retired to his Carinthian lair, which by no means rules him out of a further attempt on national power.</p> <p>And yet, visiting Austria one can see that the nature of Haider's demagoguery has been misunderstood outside the country. He has horrified the rest of Europe, he has sent Downing Street into spasms with his claim that he and Tony Blair are political brothers, he has been called a neo-Nazi and a new f\u00fchrer, a neo-fascist or a post-fascist. All of which misses the point. The truth is that he is not post- fascist so much as pre-fascist. J\u00f6rg Haider isn't Adolf Hitler's heir, he is Karl Lueger's.</p> <p>A century ago, Europe was in the throes of economic and social turmoil which has many parallels with today. Then it was industrialisation, with drastic social change fed by railways, steamships and telegraphs. Now it's globalisation, the information revolution and hi-tech (which means low-employment) industries. Then as now there were great migrations of peoples, which produced nativist reactions. In Vienna, the reactionary movement was led by Dr Karl Lueger, head of the Christian Social party. Lueger's Christian socialism wasn't the same as the Rev Charles Kingsley's (or Tony Blair's, Haider might note). His party's platform was very distinctive: anti-Marxist but also anti-capitalist, anti- liberal and anti-semitic.</p> <p>He found his support among the petty bourgeoisie and upper working class of Vienna. Lueger presented himself as the champion of the \"little man\", the artisan or shopkeeper threatened by big business and big bureaucracy. If there was no \"anti-European\" component in his rhetoric as in Haider's, maybe one can hear echoes from Lueger's attitude to the rest of the vast Hapsburg monarchy, whose sentimental admirers sometimes claim that it prefigured the EU.</p> <p>Not without reason, the Viennese saw the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy created in 1867 as a racket run in favour of Hungarian landowners. And, as now, they were frightened by mass immigration - today from Turkey or points further south.</p> <p>Just as Haider does, Lueger claimed that he was addressing economic grievances rather than fanning racial hatred when he denounced Jewish and Slav incomers. Vienna had indeed been transformed: before 1848, Jews were forbidden to live in the city. Fifty years later there were 200,000 Jews in Vienna, one 10th of the population. There were hundreds of thousands of Czechs and Hungarians as well, who weren't particularly popular with the indigenous Viennese either. But as ever it was the Jews who got it in the neck, and Lueger's own cynical and calculating version of anti-semitism was \"the socialism of fools\".</p> <p>Today, Haider has a habit of making outrageous statements before explaining them away, and he likes to claim that he isn't a racist. But in that too there are echoes of Lueger, and his most famous saying.

      "bodyText": "If nothing else, J\u00f6rg Haider is a master of surprise. His resignation as leader of the Austrian Freedom party was quite unexpected. But then, he is something else, an adroit and slippery political operator who ducks and dives with alarming agility. Having convulsed Austrian politics, Haider now says that he does not \"want to be seen as a shadow-chancellor\". He has retired to his Carinthian lair, which by no means rules him out of a further attempt on national power. And yet, visiting Austria one can see that the nature of Haider's demagoguery has been misunderstood outside the country. He has horrified the rest of Europe, he has sent Downing Street into spasms with his claim that he and Tony Blair are political brothers, he has been called a neo-Nazi and a new f\u00fchrer, a neo-fascist or a post-fascist. All of which misses the point. The truth is that he is not post- fascist so much as pre-fascist. J\u00f6rg Haider isn't Adolf Hitler's heir, he is Karl Lueger's. A century ago, Europe was in the throes of economic and social turmoil which has many parallels with today. Then it was industrialisation, with drastic social change fed by railways, steamships and telegraphs. Now it's globalisation, the information revolution and hi-tech (which means low-employment) industries. Then as now there were great migrations of peoples, which produced nativist reactions. In Vienna, the reactionary movement was led by Dr Karl Lueger, head of the Christian Social party. Lueger's Christian socialism wasn't the same as the Rev Charles Kingsley's (or Tony Blair's, Haider might note). His party's platform was very distinctive: anti-Marxist but also anti-capitalist, anti- liberal and anti-semitic. He found his support among the petty bourgeoisie and upper working class of Vienna. Lueger presented himself as the champion of the \"little man\", the artisan or shopkeeper threatened by big business and big bureaucracy. If there was no \"anti-European\" component in his rhetoric as in Haider's, maybe one can hear echoes from Lueger's attitude to the rest of the vast Hapsburg monarchy, whose sentimental admirers sometimes claim that it prefigured the EU. Not without reason, the Viennese saw the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy created in 1867 as a racket run in favour of Hungarian landowners. And, as now, they were frightened by mass immigration - today from Turkey or points further south. Just as Haider does, Lueger claimed that he was addressing economic grievances rather than fanning racial hatred when he denounced Jewish and Slav incomers. Vienna had indeed been transformed: before 1848, Jews were forbidden to live in the city. Fifty years later there were 200,000 Jews in Vienna, one 10th of the population. There were hundreds of thousands of Czechs and Hungarians as well, who weren't particularly popular with the indigenous Viennese either. But as ever it was the Jews who got it in the neck, and Lueger's own cynical and calculating version of anti-semitism was \"the socialism of fools\". Today, Haider has a habit of making outrageous statements before explaining them away, and he likes to claim that he isn't a racist. But in that too there are echoes of Lueger, and his most famous saying. Reproached once by a tougher-minded party colleague for showing kindness to individual Jews, Lueger replied: \"I decide who's a Jew.\" Or as the smirking Haider might say: \"I decide who's an immigrant.\" Three times Lueger was elected mayor of Vienna, and three times he was vetoed by the Emperor Franz Josef, who disliked his bigotry and demagoguery as much as respectable Austria and Europe now dislike Haider's. When he was elected a fourth time in 1897, the emperor gave in. Lueger died in 1910, well before he could see the full fruits of his work. Odious as Haider is, there may be a lack of proportion - or a failure of understanding - in the rage against him. Even if he praises Hitler's \"orderly\" economic policies, Haider has no territorial ambitions and no panzer divisions. Even if he became chancellor, he isn't going to invade Poland. Still, between pre-fascism and post-fascism comes fascism itself. Hitler learnt all his politics in Vienna, pan-German nationalism from other rabble- rousers such as Schoenerer, Jew-baiting and Slav-hating from Lueger, along with his appeal to the little man and his version of socialism. If the conditions for a new Hitler barely exist today, there is something eerily familiar about the mood of social unease and economic upheaval breeding demagogues.

In combative remarks ahead of an unprecedented three-way meeting between the EU, the US and Russia tomorrow in Lisbon, Mr Patten warned that for all the importance of building a strategic relationship with Moscow, human rights abuses cannot simply be passed over. Last week he formally expressed \"shock\" and \"deep concern\" at reports of mass graves near Grozny, and will be taking up the issue forcefully with Igor Ivanov. \"Russian leaders have to understand the depth of outrage at what people have read in their newspapers and seen on their TV screens,\" he told the Guardian in his 15th floor office in the Commission's Charlemagne building. \"Even if only half the stories were true they would still be horrific. We cannot behave with Russia as though nothing untoward had happened, as though we could simply conduct business the way that we wanted to before the Chechnya hostilities.\" Yet the EU has hardly been robust: in January aid programmes were partially diverted to humanitarian relief, though that, diplomats say, was only at Mr Patten's insistence that member states could not afford to backtrack on threats issued at the Helsinki summit. Sanctions, like those against Serbia or Iraq, are unthinkable: there is too much at stake, from nuclear safety to arms control, to alienate Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. But he adds:\"Some of the horrors inflicted on the civilian population are going to create scars that are going take a very long time to heal. There is a sort of spiritual pollution about closing your eyes to human rights abuses on such a dreadful organised scale.\" Handling Russia underlines a general difficulty: the last governor of Hong Kong is the first European commissioner with a serious chance of giving the EU the ability to match its economic might with real political and diplomatic muscle. He is a true heavyweight in Romano Prodi's commission, a world-class politician and intellectual with a hefty budget and a brief that extends across the globe. But all too often his hands are tied - both by Europe's governments and the EU's own deficiencies.

No slouch himself when it comes to charm and publicity, Patten looks positively low-key compared to Solana's high-profile world statesman act, complete with bodyguards and restless globetrotting that makes Brussels tongues wag. \"We've got different jobs and different bases of authority,\" Patten says wearily. \"He represents the council.

On balance, Commissioner Patten provides as good a sense of strategic vision and canny political sense as he did as Governor Patten - but without the furious personal attacks from Beijing.

Gerald Kaufman, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, is to take his members on a tour of Greece and Italy to look at archaeological sites - including a visit to Athens provisionally fixed for March 31. The decision has caused anger and disappointment among civil servants in the culture department who say in a memo that any visit by MPs will send \"the wrong signals\" to the Greek government and reopen the issue of the British museum returning the 2,500-year-old treasures to Athens. Chris Smith, the culture secretary, last night was livid at comments made by his officials after the Guardian sent a copy of the memo back to the department. The MPs' trip - not yet officially announced - leaked out fter the department of culture inadvertently sent the confidential background memo to an Australian television station planning a documentary on the Parthenon marbles. Mr Smith, who had not seen the memo, is reported to have asked for the civil servant who wrote it to be reprimanded. He is said to have told officials that the language was \"emotive, childish and not suitable for internal circulation let alone being sent to outsiders\". The memo discloses that officials from the department have held lengthy discussions with the clerk to the select committee about the trip and the terms of the investigation. It records: \"The committee accepts that it will not be able to avoid the issue of the Parthenon sculptures but the main thrust of the inquiry will be about modern day illicit trade and the return of such objects. \"Unfortunately, the committee is planning a visit to Greece in advance of its inquiry.\" The embarrassing memo includes accusations that President Clinton was \"bounced\" into saying the marbles should be returned and says that Britain was using \"delaying tactics\" at UN meetings to stop the issue of the marbles being raised by Greece. It also attacks the Cambridge historian William St Clair, who exposed the scandal of the cleaning of the marbles at the British museum. It says that a museum symposium on the scraping of the marbles, kept secret for 60 years, \"largely discredited St Clair's allegations\". It discloses that Mr Smith paid a special visit to examine the sculptures and decided that \"St Clair's account was greatly exaggerated and somewhat unbalanced.\" The memo says that when President Clinton last November called for the return of the marbles he had been given \"the usual incorrect Greek version of events\". It also says Britain was using a \"delaying tactic\" at Unesco meetings to stop the return of the marbles by claiming it would be contrary to the European convention on human rights. Last night Graham Binns, chairman of the British committee for the restitution of the marbles, described the memo as \"shocking, totally out of order and the ministry should be shamed by it. \"The document is a long and disingenuous spin.\"",

He said he was beaten at a detention camp and heard the screams of people who were being tortured. The return of Mr Babitsky, who went missing after Russia said it had handed him over to Chechen rebels in return for captive soldiers, caused as much surprise as his first reappearance on Friday in Dagestan, to the east of Chechnya. Mr Babitsky, who reported for US-funded Radio Liberty behind rebel lines, said he was first detained at the Chernokozovo camp. \"I can say to you that at first I was not in the hands of the special security forces but of sadists who detained me at the Chernokozovo concentration camp,\" he said in an interview on Radio Liberty's website. Rights groups say they have the testimony of people held at the camp with accounts of rapes, beatings and killings. Russia denies the allegations. \"This is a very serious statement and it demands a very careful investigation,\" Itar-Tass news agency quoted the head of the interior ministry's press department as saying of Mr Babitsky's allegations. Mr Babitsky was detained near the Chechen capital, Grozny, in mid-January. Russia announced the swap early in February, but it was not immediately known who was holding him.

He told commercial NTV television that he had heard people being tortured. \"Tortured, I cannot find another word,\" he said of one woman. \"There were cries which showed a person is experiencing torturous, unbearable pain for a long time.\" He said he heard guards shouting at another man that they would cut off a part of his body, while another man was beaten constantly. Mr Babitsky had been held in police custody in Dagestan on charges of holding a false passport and was only released after the acting president, Vladimir Putin, intervened by saying he was against holding the reporter for a such an offence.

A very cosy affair it was too.</p> <p>\"You know my team, I think,\" he told the chairman. \"A happy band,\" the chairman replied. \"Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said 'happy birthday', said Mr George. It was that kind of occasion.</p> <p>Luckily perhaps, because Mr George had no information to offer. Apparently, the governor spends his life adrift on a vast, unfathomable sea of ignorance. Now and again he sights a hard statistic or an incontrovertible fact, but as he shouts and waves his shirt, it disappears over the horizon.</p> <p>Or as Willem Buiter, a Dutch economist on the bank's MPC, monetary policy committee, (his colleague DeAnne Julius is American - no wonder the economy is in good shape; we've drafted in a crack team of foreigners to run it) said: \"We do not have perfect foresight. But we do not have perfect hindsight either.\"</p> <p>Only an economist could say: \"Not only do we not know what is going to happen, but we haven't much idea of what already has happened,\" and say it with such elegance.</p> <p>Indeed, Professor Buiter is a master of the non-answer. Michael Spicer, a Tory, kept trying to persuade him that Gordon Brown was handing out too much of our cash.</p> <p>Mr Spicer: \"Would any member of the MPC dispute the fact that public spending is now increasing faster than the rate of receipts?\"</p> <p>Prof. Buiter: \"It all depends on what you mean by 'now'.\" Dazzling.</p> <p>Mervyn King, a deputy governor, proved every bit as adept as his boss.</p> <p>Were wage rises keeping pace with productivity? he was asked.</p> <p>\"The latest earnings data is not easy to match up with the settlement data,\" he said, which translates in demotic English as \"search me, mate.\"</p> <p>So was productivity rising? Who the heck knows? Or, as Mr King put it, \"in times of trend productivity growth, it is very difficult to detect changes in a trend, because productivity is a volatile variable, reflected in the cyclical position.\" (\"I'll just get me coat,\" as they say on The Fast Show.)</p> <p>Mr George was asked whether the bank should intervene to bring down the value of sterling. \"Intervention in today's market is a form of posing a question,\" he said runically.</p> <p>A light went on in Michael Spicer's head. \"It's a rain dance,\" he exclaimed, \"You can't do anything about it!\"</p> <p>\"Exactly,\" intoned Mr George. \"I don't know what a rain dance is, but we can't do anything about it.\"</p> <p>The MPs kept probing to find out if there were any limits to this majestic ignorance. Why was the euro so badly undervalued? Mr George felt this might be a psychological problem. \"But I don't know.\"</p> <p>They pressed him. \"You ask me and I feel pathetic. I don't know. But I don't know if anyone else does know.\" Clearly we were still some way from touching bottom.</p> <p>How far was the pound overvalued? \"I don't know,\" flashed back the reply.</p> <p>Teddy Taylor wondered whether the pound was due to go down. Surely it couldn't rise any further?</p> <p>\"I don't think anyone would be confident enough to say that in the short term it might not go up further,\" Mr George said. It almost sounded like an opinion.</p> <p>Teddy Taylor was desperate for him to denounce the euro. \"If the next time you come here, the pound has gone up further and the euro has collapsed, what would you and your colleagues say?\"</p> <p>Did he imagine Mr George would commit himself to anything concrete like that? \"We would probably have a re-run of the discussion we have had today,\" the governor said, with a secret smile.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, came with his associates to the Commons yesterday for a chat with the treasury select committee. A very cosy affair it was too. \"You know my team, I think,\" he told the chairman. \"A happy band,\" the chairman replied. \"Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said 'happy birthday', said Mr George. It was that kind of occasion. Luckily perhaps, because Mr George had no information to offer. Apparently, the governor spends his life adrift on a vast, unfathomable sea of ignorance. Now and again he sights a hard statistic or an incontrovertible fact, but as he shouts and waves his shirt, it disappears over the horizon. Or as Willem Buiter, a Dutch economist on the bank's MPC, monetary policy committee, (his colleague DeAnne Julius is American - no wonder the economy is in good shape; we've drafted in a crack team of foreigners to run it) said: \"We do not have perfect foresight. But we do not have perfect hindsight either.\" Only an economist could say: \"Not only do we not know what is going to happen, but we haven't much idea of what already has happened,\" and say it with such elegance. Indeed, Professor Buiter is a master of the non-answer. Michael Spicer, a Tory, kept trying to persuade him that Gordon Brown was handing out too much of our cash. Mr Spicer: \"Would any member of the MPC dispute the fact that public spending is now increasing faster than the rate of receipts?\" Prof. Buiter: \"It all depends on what you mean by 'now'.\" Dazzling. Mervyn King, a deputy governor, proved every bit as adept as his boss. Were wage rises keeping pace with productivity? he was asked. \"The latest earnings data is not easy to match up with the settlement data,\" he said, which translates in demotic English as \"search me, mate.\" So was productivity rising? Who the heck knows? Or, as Mr King put it, \"in times of trend productivity growth, it is very difficult to detect changes in a trend, because productivity is a volatile variable, reflected in the cyclical position.\" (\"I'll just get me coat,\" as they say on The Fast Show.) Mr George was asked whether the bank should intervene to bring down the value of sterling. \"Intervention in today's market is a form of posing a question,\" he said runically. A light went on in Michael Spicer's head. \"It's a rain dance,\" he exclaimed, \"You can't do anything about it!\" \"Exactly,\" intoned Mr George. \"I don't know what a rain dance is, but we can't do anything about it.\" The MPs kept probing to find out if there were any limits to this majestic ignorance. Why was the euro so badly undervalued? Mr George felt this might be a psychological problem. \"But I don't know.\" They pressed him. \"You ask me and I feel pathetic. I don't know. But I don't know if anyone else does know.\" Clearly we were still some way from touching bottom. How far was the pound overvalued? \"I don't know,\" flashed back the reply. Teddy Taylor wondered whether the pound was due to go down. Surely it couldn't rise any further? \"I don't think anyone would be confident enough to say that in the short term it might not go up further,\" Mr George said. It almost sounded like an opinion. Teddy Taylor was desperate for him to denounce the euro. \"If the next time you come here, the pound has gone up further and the euro has collapsed, what would you and your colleagues say?\" Did he imagine Mr George would commit himself to anything concrete like that? \"We would probably have a re-run of the discussion we have had today,\" the governor said, with a secret smile.",

The idea, reminiscent of Reagan, that higher rates of tax may cut revenue is irrelevant to the UK's low marginal rates.</p> <p>Of course, things beside taxation affect inequality, but cuts in income tax accrue overwhelmingly to the better off, for the poor have little taxable income.

This makes cutting taxes now especially unappealing, for it implies a downturn may force the government to choose between reversing the cuts (a political taboo) and squeezing public spending.</p> <p>A meaningful notion of social justice must involve reducing inequalities in living standards.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Giddens should know better: the evidence suggests social justice requires progressive taxation (A third way budget, February 29). The idea, reminiscent of Reagan, that higher rates of tax may cut revenue is irrelevant to the UK's low marginal rates. Of course, things beside taxation affect inequality, but cuts in income tax accrue overwhelmingly to the better off, for the poor have little taxable income. And the reason the working families' tax credit will reduce poverty is because it is a \"rebadged\" benefit, not a true tax cut. I fear thriving government coffers reflect the economic cycle, not third-way fiscal policies. This makes cutting taxes now especially unappealing, for it implies a downturn may force the government to choose between reversing the cuts (a political taboo) and squeezing public spending. A meaningful notion of social justice must involve reducing inequalities in living standards. Third-way rhetoric cannot escape the reality that redirecting resources from rich to poor - whether directly or through financing of universal services - remains a crucial means of delivery. Tom Clark London School of Economics T.M.Clark@lse.ac.uk \u0095 By switching the emphasis from progressive to regressive taxation, the Tory government began transferring the burden of tax from the wealthy to the poor. Professor Giddens is now advocating these policies as New Labour's \"third way\". The failure of such policies is seen in the rising chaos and tragic waste in health, education and transport. Patrick Brady Geraldine Thorpe London Guildhall University \u0095 Perhaps the most vital thing to consider in the \"coming economic rethink\" (Letters, February 28) is that equity is a valid objective not only on ethical grounds but also on efficiency grounds. Under the pretence of making markets more \"free\", neo-liberal policies often deprive those who embody a high level of human capital the opportunity to join the production chain because they are financially disadvantaged. What results from this waste are incomplete markets and market failures. Rafael Pereira Gomes London r.gomes@ucl.ac.uk",

      "bodyText": "Israel and Syria were edging towards the resumption of stalled peace talks yesterday after the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, gave indications of a major concession over the Golan heights. Syria gave a cautious welcome to Mr Barak's comments, which pave the way for an Israeli withdrawal from the long-disputed territory. The talks broke up in January when Syria refused to go further until Israel gave a commitment to restore the Golan, which it has held since the 1967 war. Mr Barak told a cabinet meeting on Sunday that the previous four Israeli prime ministers had been prepared to withdraw from the territory, in comments which suggested this was an endorsement of the position he was now about to take. He made the remarks knowing they would be made public. Reports that a date for renewed talks had already been set for later this month were treated with scepticism by British, US and Israeli diplomats yesterday. But both US and British diplomatic sources interpreted Mr Barak's cryptic remarks as sufficient to get the process under way again. Tensions within the Israeli government over the best way forward spilled over yesterday when the country's minister for internal security, Shlomo Ben-Ami, confirmed that he and three other senior figures were sceptical about reaching an accord with Syria. Mr Ben-Ami, speaking in London, stressed the difficulties of doing business with a \"hermetically sealed\" state such as Syria, so long the standard-bearer in the ideological conflict against Zionism. In contrast to Mr Barak, Mr Ben-Ami said he did not believe Israel could take part in peace talks with both Syria and the Palestinians at once. Mr Barak reiterated yesterday that he would pursue both tracks, but Mr Ben-Ami favoured concentrating on negotiations with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. He said his view was shared by three ministers: the former prime minister Shimon Peres, Yossi Beilin and Haim Ramon. Asked whether there had been any response from Syria to Mr Barak's concession, Mr Ben-Ami carefully avoided answering, lending credence to speculation that a resumption of the US-brokered talks was being discussed behind the scenes. A senior Arab diplomatic source in Amman was reported as saying yesterday: \"Syrian-Israeli negotiations will resume after Eid al-Adha in the United States. An announcement is expected to that effect in the next 10 days or so.\" The four-day Muslim holiday, which depends on the sighting of the moon, is expected to end by March 20. Syrian radio yesterday welcomed Mr Barak's comments but added it was insufficient for a resumption of talks. The same line was taken in newspapers controlled by the Syrian government, which described Mr Barak's comments as important but failing to go far enough. The Golan heights are an emotive issue with Israelis, who fear they might be used for shelling Israeli villages. Israel wants to maintain a monitoring station there but Syria has refused. Any settlement with Syria would require a referendum, and Israel's parliament, the Knesset, is due to vote tonight on opposition proposals that would mean acceptance would require a majority of all eligible voters - a result which would be difficult to secure. Mr Ben-Ami said that whatever happened with Syria, Israel will pull out of Lebanon by July at the latest. Given that Israel was fulfilling the terms of a UN security council resolution, he said he expected the international community to ensure its border was respected. If not, Israel maintained the right to self-defence, suggesting Syria would be the target of any retaliation. The prospects for a resumption of Israeli negotiations with Mr Arafat continued to look bleak yesterday. The US Middle East envoy, Dennis Ross, left the region on Monday, having failed on a mission to solve a month-long impasse between Israel and the Palestinians. Part of the conflict is a dispute over 6.1% of West Bank land that Israel was to hand over to the Palestinians. Mr Arafat, who met the European commission president, Romano Prodi, in Gaza yesterday, said Israel was responsible for Mr Ross's failure.",

      "bodyText": "Senator John McCain of Arizona and Governor George W Bush of Texas were on course to divide the electoral spoils in yesterday's latest Republican presidential primary contests in Virginia and Washington state last night, but the Democratic hopeful Bill Bradley looked set to lose a last-ditch gamble to reignite his flagging campaign against Al Gore. Opinion polls taken before yesterday's primaries gave Mr Bush the lead over Mr McCain in Virginia, but in Washington Mr McCain was the frontrunner thanks to independent voters' support. Yesterday's contests pointed to a continuing neck-and-neck contest between the two Republicans heading into next week's crucial \"super Tuesday\" primaries, in which 16 states will choose their presidential candidates in both parties. A Gallup national opinion poll showed Mr McCain's approval ratings now exceed Mr Bush's for the first time in the contest, but the Texas governor still leads among core Republican voters, who hold the key in next Tuesday's day of reckoning. Mr McCain continued to set the agenda on the campaign trail yesterday, attacking Mr Bush for becoming a prisoner of the religious right and warning that the Texas governor could not create a national majority to defeat Mr Gore. \"Too many Americans believe that we've become an exclusionary party rather than an inclusionary one,\" Mr McCain told reporters. \"We have to send a message that we want everybody in, rather than some people out.\" Mr McCain told an eve-of-poll rally in Tacoma on Monday night that he was looking for \"a big victory in the state of Washington that will send a great message around America and the world\". Mr Bush said earlier in Bellevue that he would reinvigorate his cause by winning the primary in Washington \"because I am the one candidate who can speak to education and education reform\". But both candidates signalled that yesterday's contests were stepping stones to the main event on March 7 by spending the day campaigning elsewhere in the US. Mr McCain took his message to voters in the pivotal state of California, while Mr Bush addressed supporters in Ohio and Georgia, which also vote next week. The big loser in yesterday's battles seemed set to be Mr Bradley. The former New Jersey Democratic senator and one-time basketball star had gambled everything in recent days on gaining an upset pre-super Tuesday advantage over Mr Gore in yesterday's \"open\" primary in Washington. Although yesterday was not an official Democratic primary in the north-western state, Washington's unusual election rules placed all the presidential candidates on a common ballot paper yesterday, creating a cross-party \"beauty contest\" in which Mr Bradley hoped to finish ahead of Mr Gore, who has had a clear advantage in every aspect of the Democratic race so far. While Mr Gore and the Republican rivals have tried in recent days to take their message to all of the states which vote on March 7, Mr Bradley has spent the whole of the past week campaigning to ambush the vice-president in Washington, in the hope of generating a bounce for his faltering presidential bid. There was little sign from the polls that Mr Bradley's Washington strategy was likely to bear fruit, while opinion polls in New York, which votes next week and has been seen as Mr Bradley's best super Tuesday hope, showed Mr Gore ahead of his challenger by 52% to 38%.

Exit polls showed Mr Bush was on course for a comfortable win in the state over the Arizona senator John McCain, registering his first primary victory since he beat Mr McCain in a bitter battle in South Carolina last month, and giving his campaign a fresh boost over his rival in the run-up to next week's \"super Tuesday\" contests in 16 states. Mr McCain's camp dismissed its loss in Virginia by claiming that Mr Bush was a \"regional candidate\" who could win in conservative southern states but who could not rally a national, presidency-winning majority.

Mr Bush was the favourite to win yesterday's third contest, the Republican caucuses in North Dakota.

The evening had earlier seen a banking presentation. But when charging for refills was introduced as a deflationary measure before midnight (though the tab was still below the agreed total), tempers snapped. \"I'm told there were no bankers involved,\" said Richard Balkwill of Freud's, the restaurant in a converted church which was hired until the small hours by Morgan Stanley. \"The scrapping was between people we'd had to stop serving. We called the police to prevent them hurting one another.\" The restaurant rated the evening overall a \"probable success\" in terms of Oxford students showing they had a bit of zing, but Mr Balkwill described student newspaper estimates of an \u00a38,000 tab and individual drink tallies topping \u00a3100 as \"nonsense - wildly inflated\". A spokesman for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said: \"We have been carrying out these evenings at Oxford successfully for many years and just regret that a small number of people took advantage of our hospitality and spoiled the evening for others.\"",

Only one in five sufferers came from a single parent family, and three quarters were from an upper middle class background. Elizabeth Garralda, professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at Imperial College, London, who headed the research, said: \"This would seem to suggest little evidence to suggest social stress other than secondary school entry.\" Professor Garralda added that the stress of attending secondary school did not in itself prompt the illness, which causes profound fatigue, insomnia, aches and pains, and mental slowness. \"In general, chronic fatigue syndrome affects children who are already unwell because of a flu-type illness or glandular fever,\" she said. \"We believe it's probably the combination of being very unwell plus the stress of having to adapt to secondary school plus probably some biological and psychological vulnerabilities which cause it. \"This has never been brought out before and it's very intriguing.\" She added that while half attended public school - with half of these being boarders - it was impossible to deduce whether such schooling proved more stressful. \"These findings are probably more related to the fact that people in this socioeconomic group are more likely to be persistent in contacting their doctors if their children are suffering from symptoms,\" she said. \"On the other hand, many of these children are high achievers who put themselves under pressure to do well.\" She said it was difficult to determine which treatment had had the best effect, since so many had been tried: 56% of the children had tried alternative medicine and 52% psychological treatment.",

      "bodyText": "An incentive scheme that offers young offenders privileges including Gameboys, in-cell television and camping and canoeing trips in return for good behaviour has helped transform a troubled juvenile jail, a report from the chief inspector of prisons reveals today. Sir David Ramsbotham says the incentive scheme was \"very impressive\" and had helped implement a major overhaul at Werrington young offenders' institution, near Stoke-on-Trent, which 18 months ago he had described as a disgrace. About 25 of the 106 young offenders at Werrington who have reached the top level of the privileges and incentives scheme are allowed to have Nintendo computer games consoles in their cells. Inmates pay \u00a32 a week to hire the consoles, bought out of the proceeds of a refreshment stall used by visitors. The jail also has four Gameboys which are given out each week to inmates who have behaved particularly well. The chief inspector said that the attractions of television and computer games were used as the prime incentives to ensure a well behaved population at Werrington and, together with an effective anti-bullying scheme, were impressive examples of good practice. Each cell had also been equipped with a television which carried the five terrestrial channels plus a video channel. Prison staff monitor the content of programmes and any deemed unsuitable on grounds of sex or violence were either replaced by a video or switched off if it was late in the evening. Staff also organised \"leadership expeditions\" which consisted of about a dozen young offenders taking part in activities such as rock climbing, cross-country cycling trips, camping, and canoeing. \"These were not expensive junkets, but challenging episodes in the individual young person's lives where they were subtly introduced to the concepts of teamwork, individual responsibility, achievement, dealing with failure and helping others through the process,\" said Sir David. Big improvement at the juvenile training centre had also been achieved by reducing its population by nearly half from 180 to 102, a new injection of resources and staff and support from prison service headquarters. A prison service spokesman said: \"The computer sets are only given out as a reward for very good behaviour. If their marks slip, they are taken away and the offenders know it. \"Staff are very pleased with the way it is working and say it's something the lads really respond to.\" When the chief inspector of prisons visited Werrington in 1998 he published a scathing report in which he said teenage offenders had to eat their food in their cells, which were little more than lavatories. He said that the overcrowded conditions in which teenagers were kept in pairs in cells meant for one were so disgraceful that were Werrington to be a social services secure custody unit, it would have been closed for lack of provision of appropriate facilities.",

      "bodyText": "A target of halving serious road accidents involving child pedestrians will form part of a package of government measures to be unveiled today, aimed at making speeding as socially unacceptable as drink-driving. Tony Blair and the transport minister, Lord Macdonald, will promise to cut the annual toll of child road deaths and serious injuries from an average of around 200 to about 100 by 2010, and by 40% across all ages. Local authorities will be encouraged to enforce 20mph limits around schools. Ministers are also looking at delaying the earliest young people can take their tests until six months after their 17th birthday, or raising the driving age to 18. Learners may have to fill in a \"log book\" showing their experience before taking their test. Other measures include banning drink-drive repeat offenders from driving for two years, and tougher sentences for speeding drivers. The proposals follow the government's review of road safety, and will be backed with several million pounds of expenditure. Keith Hill, the junior transport minister, told MPs yesterday: \"We have to persuade drivers to slow down, and make speeding as socially unacceptable as drinking and driving.\" The government planned a renewed effort to tackle cannabis use by drivers, Mr Hill said. Ministers were considering using a \"drugalyser\", suggested by Tory MP Ann McIntosh in the Commons yesterday. Mr Hill said more publicity would be given to the effects of tiredness on drivers, \"which we now suspect contributes to 10% of all accidents\". The Tory transport spokesman, Bernard Jenkin, welcomed the thrust of the plans. \"The number of road casualties remains intolerable, equivalent to 100 Paddington disasters every year,\" he said. The RAC said the target reduction in deaths was ambitious and needed \"new and robust measures designed to reduce casualties among, or caused by, the highest risk or most vulnerable groups\". The environmental group Transport 2000 said the government had lost its nerve and had \"wimped out\" of imposing 20mph limits in all 30mph areas.

Mr Brown campaigned against the claimant measurements, with Labour describing them as fiddled figures. But always the opportunist, now the claimant figures look better he is all for them. The public will not mistake the stench of hypocrisy.\" A Labour spokesman said: \"This is ridiculous. The Tories should welcome the fact that 800,000 more people are in work since Labour came into power and that there are 1m vacancies in the economy. They should also welcome the measures announced today to help the remaining unemployed people get jobs.\" The attack will come as an embarrassment to the chancellor who has revived memories of the Norman Tebbit \"get on your bike\" era with his unequivocal message that many unemployed people have no excuse to remain out of work.",

It's a great feeling and a great accomplishment for him to visit us in Trench Town,\" she said. \"We would like to thank her majesty the Queen for trusting us to look after her son in an area which people had always said was no-go.\"</p> <p>In return, Prince Charles accepted a rasta hat, which he reluctantly modelled for the cameras crammed into a community centre. \"I've had enough, it's too hot,\" he said, before slipping on the red, green and gold headgear. The prince's unwillingness to pose appeared to be justified, as the dreadlocks sewn into the wool tumbled down over his face.</p> <p>Trench Town - immortalised in the music of Marley, who grew up here - once housed much of Kingston's middle class. But gangs armed by rival political parties turned it into a ghetto, a no-go area for police.</p> <p>Rita Marley claimed that such is the sense of distrust among the population that not even the prime minister of Jamaica would dare show his face. But times are changing, and the prince had come to support the Kingston Restoration Company, part-funded by the British government, which is helping to regenerate the area.</p> <p>Crowds pressed against the walls of the community centre to catch a glimpse of the prince meeting the widow of their hero, who died in 1981 but whose music lives to inspire a new audience. \"Bob Marley said in one of his songs: 'Can anything good come out of Trench Town?' The answer is yes,\" said Rita Marley.</p> <p>Later the prince met many who had gathered on the street in the sweltering heat to greet him on the final day of his Caribbean tour. Dispensing with protocol, one man rejected the usual handshake in favour of an enthusiastic \"high five\", to which the prince responded in kind.</p> <p>The prince had earlier experienced the typical living conditions of people here - packed into shacks around the communal yards that give their name to Caribbean gangs operating in Britain. But these \"yardies\" are far from gun-toting drug rivals. While crime rates are high and the threat of violence is never far away, these are ordinary people fighting hunger and poverty.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Deep among the slum yards of Trench Town, where Bob Marley's music is still revered, Prince Charles yesterday met Rita Marley, widow of the reggae king. \"It's more than words can express. It's a great feeling and a great accomplishment for him to visit us in Trench Town,\" she said. \"We would like to thank her majesty the Queen for trusting us to look after her son in an area which people had always said was no-go.\" In return, Prince Charles accepted a rasta hat, which he reluctantly modelled for the cameras crammed into a community centre. \"I've had enough, it's too hot,\" he said, before slipping on the red, green and gold headgear. The prince's unwillingness to pose appeared to be justified, as the dreadlocks sewn into the wool tumbled down over his face. Trench Town - immortalised in the music of Marley, who grew up here - once housed much of Kingston's middle class. But gangs armed by rival political parties turned it into a ghetto, a no-go area for police. Rita Marley claimed that such is the sense of distrust among the population that not even the prime minister of Jamaica would dare show his face. But times are changing, and the prince had come to support the Kingston Restoration Company, part-funded by the British government, which is helping to regenerate the area. Crowds pressed against the walls of the community centre to catch a glimpse of the prince meeting the widow of their hero, who died in 1981 but whose music lives to inspire a new audience. \"Bob Marley said in one of his songs: 'Can anything good come out of Trench Town?' The answer is yes,\" said Rita Marley. Later the prince met many who had gathered on the street in the sweltering heat to greet him on the final day of his Caribbean tour. Dispensing with protocol, one man rejected the usual handshake in favour of an enthusiastic \"high five\", to which the prince responded in kind. The prince had earlier experienced the typical living conditions of people here - packed into shacks around the communal yards that give their name to Caribbean gangs operating in Britain. But these \"yardies\" are far from gun-toting drug rivals. While crime rates are high and the threat of violence is never far away, these are ordinary people fighting hunger and poverty.",

      "byline": "Rupert Smith",

      "body": "<p>Hollywood did its best with the story of Sam Sheppard, the neurosurgeon accused of killing his wife Marilyn in 1954. The gory murder, and Sheppard's continued protestations of innocence, inspired a 60s TV series starring David Janssen and a 1993 movie starring Harrison Ford, in both of which the wronged doctor goes on the run to find the real (one-armed) culprit. The truth, as revealed in <strong> The Fugitive: The Final Chapter </strong> (BBC1) was stranger and less heroic. </p> <p>In 1999, nearly 50 years after Marilyn Sheppard was bludgeoned to death in her comfortable Cleveland home, her body was exhumed and re-examined by the Ohio State Prosecutor, Bill Mason, a man determined to prove that his predecessors were right to send Sam Sheppard to prison for ten years. Now Sheppard's son, Sam, who was seven years old when his mother was murdered in a nearby bedroom, is determined to prove his father's innocence and to gain financial compensation for half a century of misery. </p> <p>The details of the proceedings were grim enough: Marilyn Sheppard's unborn child was brought to the coroner's lab in a suitcase, while the prosecutor's team argued over a nightmarish model of the victim's battered head. But what emerged most disturbingly from The Fugitive: The Final Chapter was the arbitrary nature of American justice. Sheppard's first trial was a media circus. Sheppard was found guilty and went to jail for ten years. Appeal after appeal was rejected, while Quinn Martin Productions got to work on the TV show. Then, with the idea of a doctor wrongly accused of his wife's murder firmly embedded in the public conscious ness, a new appeal ordered Sheppard's release in 1964. The Supreme Court dismissed the original trial as unfair, but allowed the Cleveland prosecutor to retry him. This time he got off. </p> <p>The ratings for The Fugitive tailed off, the show was dropped, and there it might have ended, but for Sheppard Jr's claims. He believes he's found the killer; the prosecutor is determined to uphold the original verdict. The trial is now on, and whatever the truth of the matter, it was hard not to feel sympathy for Sheppard Jr as the prosecution team infiltrated his briefings, questioned his motives and referred to his mother as \"Marilyn\". \"I wish they'd call her Mrs Sheppard, at least while I'm there\", said the son, quivering with rage. </p> <p>The most unlikely figure in the whole shadowy drama was Sheppard's second wife Ariane, a wealthy German who funded the 1964 appeal and married Sheppard on his release. An outrageous platinum blonde with a taste for leopardskin and huge hairdos, she partied hard in 60s Cleveland despite the fact that her half-sister had been married to Josef Goebbels. But eventually Sheppard was too much even for her: addicted to booze and dope since his time inside, he started waving guns around and eventually sent her running to the divorce courts. In a final bizarre twist, Sheppard was forced to give up neuro surgery and ended up earning a buck in the wrestling ring, where he fought as \"Killer Sheppard\". </p> <p>Mercifully for the family, Marilyn Sheppard's remains have been reinterred; nothing emerged from the second autopsy. Sheppard himself died at the age of 46. His son is understandably bitter. \"My family deserves monetary damages. Let's cut the crap.\" </p> <p>BBC2 continued its investigations into the origins of human life in the second part of <strong> Ape-Man</strong>. Last week's opener was a woolly affair full of cod science and a lot of talk about shamanism; last night's programme actually got down to some hard history, and was much the better for it. There was still a superabundance of silly effects, jump-cuts and overwrought music, but at least there was a straightforward story in there too. And so we found ourselves in various African locations some three million years ago, where certain apes were beginning to evolve human characteristics. One enthusiastic professor believed this meant that they picked up weapons and went on eye-gouging, blood-drinking rampages; current thinking, however, favours a picture of our ancestors as small, elegant creatures who were clever enough to start sucking the brains out of dead animals. This rich diet improved their own mental capacity, leaving their root-chewing cousins on the evolutionary starting blocks. The reason? \"Vegetarians don't have big brains\", the most contentious claim of a contentious evening.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hollywood did its best with the story of Sam Sheppard, the neurosurgeon accused of killing his wife Marilyn in 1954. The gory murder, and Sheppard's continued protestations of innocence, inspired a 60s TV series starring David Janssen and a 1993 movie starring Harrison Ford, in both of which the wronged doctor goes on the run to find the real (one-armed) culprit. The truth, as revealed in The Fugitive: The Final Chapter (BBC1) was stranger and less heroic. In 1999, nearly 50 years after Marilyn Sheppard was bludgeoned to death in her comfortable Cleveland home, her body was exhumed and re-examined by the Ohio State Prosecutor, Bill Mason, a man determined to prove that his predecessors were right to send Sam Sheppard to prison for ten years. Now Sheppard's son, Sam, who was seven years old when his mother was murdered in a nearby bedroom, is determined to prove his father's innocence and to gain financial compensation for half a century of misery. The details of the proceedings were grim enough: Marilyn Sheppard's unborn child was brought to the coroner's lab in a suitcase, while the prosecutor's team argued over a nightmarish model of the victim's battered head. But what emerged most disturbingly from The Fugitive: The Final Chapter was the arbitrary nature of American justice. Sheppard's first trial was a media circus. Sheppard was found guilty and went to jail for ten years. Appeal after appeal was rejected, while Quinn Martin Productions got to work on the TV show. Then, with the idea of a doctor wrongly accused of his wife's murder firmly embedded in the public conscious ness, a new appeal ordered Sheppard's release in 1964. The Supreme Court dismissed the original trial as unfair, but allowed the Cleveland prosecutor to retry him. This time he got off. The ratings for The Fugitive tailed off, the show was dropped, and there it might have ended, but for Sheppard Jr's claims. He believes he's found the killer; the prosecutor is determined to uphold the original verdict. The trial is now on, and whatever the truth of the matter, it was hard not to feel sympathy for Sheppard Jr as the prosecution team infiltrated his briefings, questioned his motives and referred to his mother as \"Marilyn\". \"I wish they'd call her Mrs Sheppard, at least while I'm there\", said the son, quivering with rage. The most unlikely figure in the whole shadowy drama was Sheppard's second wife Ariane, a wealthy German who funded the 1964 appeal and married Sheppard on his release. An outrageous platinum blonde with a taste for leopardskin and huge hairdos, she partied hard in 60s Cleveland despite the fact that her half-sister had been married to Josef Goebbels. But eventually Sheppard was too much even for her: addicted to booze and dope since his time inside, he started waving guns around and eventually sent her running to the divorce courts. In a final bizarre twist, Sheppard was forced to give up neuro surgery and ended up earning a buck in the wrestling ring, where he fought as \"Killer Sheppard\". Mercifully for the family, Marilyn Sheppard's remains have been reinterred; nothing emerged from the second autopsy. Sheppard himself died at the age of 46. His son is understandably bitter. \"My family deserves monetary damages. Let's cut the crap.\" BBC2 continued its investigations into the origins of human life in the second part of Ape-Man. Last week's opener was a woolly affair full of cod science and a lot of talk about shamanism; last night's programme actually got down to some hard history, and was much the better for it. There was still a superabundance of silly effects, jump-cuts and overwrought music, but at least there was a straightforward story in there too. And so we found ourselves in various African locations some three million years ago, where certain apes were beginning to evolve human characteristics. One enthusiastic professor believed this meant that they picked up weapons and went on eye-gouging, blood-drinking rampages; current thinking, however, favours a picture of our ancestors as small, elegant creatures who were clever enough to start sucking the brains out of dead animals. This rich diet improved their own mental capacity, leaving their root-chewing cousins on the evolutionary starting blocks. The reason? \"Vegetarians don't have big brains\", the most contentious claim of a contentious evening.",

As two leftwing Labour MPs, Paul Flynn and Audrey Wise, called on Mr Dobson to accept he was not the real winner of Labour's selection and stand down, Mr Livingstone signalled that any move to run as an independent would be put on hold to give Labour time to \"sort out the mess\". But Labour's Millbank headquarters moved swiftly to stamp on any suggestion that the party's candidate might throw in the towel, insisting that Mr Livingstone was \"deluding himself\", while the former health secretary ruled out any suggestion he might step aside. After visiting a jobs scheme near Heathrow airport yesterday with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, Mr Dobson declared: \"I was elected under a system that all three candidates agreed to and I'm not go ing to step down because it suits one of the candidates who lost\". Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, said: \"Ken is well aware that Frank Dobson is and will remain Labour's candidate for London mayor. \"It is a fact that is not up for negotiation.\" The former Greater London council leader used a debate in Westminster with the other main parties' mayoral hopefuls, Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer and Tory Steve Norris, to issue a rallying call to Labour members not to resign from the party in protest against the selection \"fix\" but fight to overturn it. His new tactics followed days of speculation that he would announce an independent candidacy this week. But an early declaration now appears to have been ruled out. There was renewed contact between Mr Livingstone's campaign team and Ms McDonagh yesterday following Monday night's \"comradely\" meeting with the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. Both sides agreed to more discussions, though no date was fixed and suggestions that Mr Prescott might have made the Brent East MP any kind of offer were discounted. Mr Flynn, MP for Newport West and a consistent New Labour critic, made his call for Mr Dobson to step down in the latest issue of the leftwing Socialist Campaign Group News. Last night, Mrs Wise, the Preston MP, said Mr Dobson would \"earn a debt of gratitude\" if he \"extricated himself\" before further damage was inflicted on the party. Arrangements for the election remained on hold yesterday after talks between parties over the format of a free mailshot to voters broke down. The Tories and Liberal Democrats refused to accept a hastily drawn-up government compromise over the mailing, dismissing proposals for a booklet containing a summary of each candidate's manifesto as \"completely inadequate\".

      "body": "<p>During the mid and late 1950s, Sir Eric Mensforth, who has died aged 93, established helicopter development and production on a continuous, substantial scale in Britain. He changed the west country company, Westland, from a producer of fixed-wing aircraft to one whose work was based on the helicopters of the United States company Sikorsky, part of the United Aircraft group.</p> <p>It was on January 10 1947 that, after much bargaining - in which Westland was strongly supported by the helicopter division of British European Airways - an agreement was signed between Westland and the American company, licensing production of the Sikorsky S-51 helicopter. As a result, its British equivalent, the Westland-built WS-51 Dragonfly, flew on October 5 1948. Some 139 of the aircraft were to follow; a number were delivered to BEA, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. BEA used its Dragonflies to launch the world's first scheduled and sustained passenger-helicopter service, between Cardiff and Liverpool.</p> <p>In the mid-1930s, Mensforth became a board member of a subsidiary of the engineering conglomerate, John Brown. At the time, the parent group was looking for an outlet in the aircraft industry - and Mensforth recommended Westland Aircraft, then a small company in Yeovil, Somerset. As a result, in 1938 John Brown took over the company and Mensforth was appointed as its joint managing director.</p> <p>Two years earlier, the first Westland Lysander army co-operation aircraft had flown. During the fall of France in 1940, Lysanders suffered heavy casualties - 120 out of 175 were lost - but they later became famous for their hazardous night-time work in occupied France with the Special Operations Executive and the resistance. By 1943, a total of 1,427 Lysanders had been built at Yeovil, together with a further 225 in Canada.</p> <p>Mensworth found himself from 1943 to 1945 seconded to the ministry of aircraft production as a part-time production adviser. Meanwhile, Westland, apart from producing Lysanders, Supermarine Spitfires and Seafires, concentrated on the design of a single-seater, twin- engined fighter, the P9 Whirlwind, of which 116 were built. This was succeeded in production at Yeovil by a larger and faster twin-engined, single-seater, high-altitude fighter, the P14 Welkin, with an early pressurised cabin. But the aircraft suffered serious handling problems and, although 77 were built between 1940 and 1947, further development was abandoned.</p> <p>The next project, the W34 Wyvern, was a 500mph, long-range, torpedo-carrying, aircraft-carrier based fighter, initially powered by the new 24-cylinder, 46-litre, 3,500hp Rolls Royce Eagle engine - the last piston-engine to be built by Rolls Royce. In all, Westland built 124 Wyverns between 1945 and 1956, with various propeller-turbine engines in addition to the original Eagle. Once described as \"very nearly a very good aero plane\", the Wyvern - and, in particular, its turbo-prop engines - suffered many serious, and sadly fatal, difficulties.</p> <p>But, by then, Mensforth had decided that the future of Westland lay more in the possibilities of rotary-wing aircraft than in fixed-wing military and civil machines. He believed that Westland would not encounter the problems it had had with high performance, fixed-wing aircraft because of Sikorsky's helicopter experience.</p> <p>Eric Mensforth was the second son of Sir Holberry Mensforth, and was educated at Altrincham county high school, University College School, London, and King's College, Cambridge, where he read mechanical sciences. He then joined the engineering section of the Woolwich Arsenal, and from there went to Mather and Platt Ltd, before gaining two years of international engineering experience with Klocknernak BG in Germany.</p> <p>After a short time with the English Electric Company, he was appointed to the board of Markham and Co Ltd, of Sheffield, a John Brown construction company. Then came Westland.</p> <p>From 1945 until 1953, and from 1968-71, Mensforth was vice-chairman at Westland. He was chairman between 1953 and 1968, and president from 1979 until 1985, when he retired at the age of 76. During the 50 years between 1945 and 1995, 10 different major helicopters were built in Britain along the lines established between Sikorsky and Westland. More than 1,800 helicopters went into service with the navy, the army and civil operators, including BEA and later British Airways. So the move from fixed-wing to rotary-wing aircraft was indeed justified.</p> <p>Mensforth's publications included Air Frame Production (1947), the Cantor Lectures: Future Of The Aeroplane (1959) and the 1964 Lord Sempill Lecture, Production Of Helicopters And Hovercraft. Small in stature but substantial in business wisdom and vigorous in its application, Sir Eric served on many engineering, industrial and academic bodies, and was lord-lieutenant of South Yorkshire from 1974 to 1981.</p> <p>His wife Betty predeceased him, and he is survived by three daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Sir Eric Mensforth, engineer, born May 17 1906; died February 20 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "During the mid and late 1950s, Sir Eric Mensforth, who has died aged 93, established helicopter development and production on a continuous, substantial scale in Britain. He changed the west country company, Westland, from a producer of fixed-wing aircraft to one whose work was based on the helicopters of the United States company Sikorsky, part of the United Aircraft group. It was on January 10 1947 that, after much bargaining - in which Westland was strongly supported by the helicopter division of British European Airways - an agreement was signed between Westland and the American company, licensing production of the Sikorsky S-51 helicopter. As a result, its British equivalent, the Westland-built WS-51 Dragonfly, flew on October 5 1948. Some 139 of the aircraft were to follow; a number were delivered to BEA, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. BEA used its Dragonflies to launch the world's first scheduled and sustained passenger-helicopter service, between Cardiff and Liverpool. In the mid-1930s, Mensforth became a board member of a subsidiary of the engineering conglomerate, John Brown. At the time, the parent group was looking for an outlet in the aircraft industry - and Mensforth recommended Westland Aircraft, then a small company in Yeovil, Somerset. As a result, in 1938 John Brown took over the company and Mensforth was appointed as its joint managing director. Two years earlier, the first Westland Lysander army co-operation aircraft had flown. During the fall of France in 1940, Lysanders suffered heavy casualties - 120 out of 175 were lost - but they later became famous for their hazardous night-time work in occupied France with the Special Operations Executive and the resistance. By 1943, a total of 1,427 Lysanders had been built at Yeovil, together with a further 225 in Canada. Mensworth found himself from 1943 to 1945 seconded to the ministry of aircraft production as a part-time production adviser. Meanwhile, Westland, apart from producing Lysanders, Supermarine Spitfires and Seafires, concentrated on the design of a single-seater, twin- engined fighter, the P9 Whirlwind, of which 116 were built. This was succeeded in production at Yeovil by a larger and faster twin-engined, single-seater, high-altitude fighter, the P14 Welkin, with an early pressurised cabin. But the aircraft suffered serious handling problems and, although 77 were built between 1940 and 1947, further development was abandoned. The next project, the W34 Wyvern, was a 500mph, long-range, torpedo-carrying, aircraft-carrier based fighter, initially powered by the new 24-cylinder, 46-litre, 3,500hp Rolls Royce Eagle engine - the last piston-engine to be built by Rolls Royce. In all, Westland built 124 Wyverns between 1945 and 1956, with various propeller-turbine engines in addition to the original Eagle. Once described as \"very nearly a very good aero plane\", the Wyvern - and, in particular, its turbo-prop engines - suffered many serious, and sadly fatal, difficulties. But, by then, Mensforth had decided that the future of Westland lay more in the possibilities of rotary-wing aircraft than in fixed-wing military and civil machines. He believed that Westland would not encounter the problems it had had with high performance, fixed-wing aircraft because of Sikorsky's helicopter experience. Eric Mensforth was the second son of Sir Holberry Mensforth, and was educated at Altrincham county high school, University College School, London, and King's College, Cambridge, where he read mechanical sciences. He then joined the engineering section of the Woolwich Arsenal, and from there went to Mather and Platt Ltd, before gaining two years of international engineering experience with Klocknernak BG in Germany. After a short time with the English Electric Company, he was appointed to the board of Markham and Co Ltd, of Sheffield, a John Brown construction company. Then came Westland. From 1945 until 1953, and from 1968-71, Mensforth was vice-chairman at Westland. He was chairman between 1953 and 1968, and president from 1979 until 1985, when he retired at the age of 76. During the 50 years between 1945 and 1995, 10 different major helicopters were built in Britain along the lines established between Sikorsky and Westland. More than 1,800 helicopters went into service with the navy, the army and civil operators, including BEA and later British Airways. So the move from fixed-wing to rotary-wing aircraft was indeed justified. Mensforth's publications included Air Frame Production (1947), the Cantor Lectures: Future Of The Aeroplane (1959) and the 1964 Lord Sempill Lecture, Production Of Helicopters And Hovercraft. Small in stature but substantial in business wisdom and vigorous in its application, Sir Eric served on many engineering, industrial and academic bodies, and was lord-lieutenant of South Yorkshire from 1974 to 1981. His wife Betty predeceased him, and he is survived by three daughters. \u0095 Sir Eric Mensforth, engineer, born May 17 1906; died February 20 2000",

Prosecutors investigating the killing at the Buell elementary school in a working-class suburb of Mount Morris said the six-year-old boy fired a single shot, striking the girl who died half an hour later in hospital. \"There may have been some kind of scuffle or quarrel on the playground between this little boy and girl,\" said Art Busch, a county prosecutor.

      "body": "<p>In 1947 my uncle disappeared in Argentina. His plane vanished in the Andes on a flight between Buenos Aires and Santiago. In January this year, after 53 years, wreckage from the plane was found by climbers on mount Tupungato, a peak of 21,850ft. Last week, soldiers from the 11th Argentine Mountain Regiment set up base camp at Tres Quebradas (Three Ravines) and, leaving the mules and journalists, continued to climb the bleak, volcanic mountain. The landscape, even in summer, is dusted with snow and in deep, permanent shadow.</p> <p>Using the last days of clear weather before winter sets in, the soldiers climbed another 7,000ft to the frozen wreckage. It is an arduous and dangerous climb, and two of them are now in hospital. But they succeeded in recovering an oxygen cylinder, parts of the propellers, scraps of clothing, an empty wallet. Below the peak, the melting glacier has yielded one of the plane's wheels, tyre still inflated. The expedition has also rescued three bodies, preserved in the permanent frost, and part of a fourth. They may have finally solved the mystery of the plane's disappearance.</p> <p>On August 4 1947, the Times reported: \"A British South American Airways four-engined Lancastrian, the Star Dust . . . is reported missing and is believed to have made a forced landing in the Andes mountains. Six passengers are stated to be on board.\"</p> <p>One of these was my uncle, Peter Young, who had boarded in Buenos Aires. The report continues: \"Contact with the aircraft was lost at 9 o'clock last night, and it was due to arrive at Santiago at 1 o'clock this morning.\"</p> <p>The plane had come from London, with its crew of four ex-RAF bomber pilots, and the \"star girl\" stewardess. It was a flight that then took three days, six hours and 10 minutes. There were three possible routes to take to Santiago de Chile, all of them hazardous. It is not a great distance across the Andes, but in the way stand Aconcagua, the highest peak in South America (23,000ft), and the volcanic mount Tupungato. As the weather deteriorated, the pilot made an unscheduled stop in the pretty mountain resort of Mendoza. He decided to take the most direct route, but there was a risk of severe icing. A Chilean Air Force operator received a Morse code message - STENDEC - which was repeated, but has never been deciphered. And then the Star Dust disappeared.</p> <p>In the 1970s, generals such as Pinochet in Chile and Videla in Argentina made South America a continent famous for its Disappeared. The generals succeeded in altering the English language, and adding a new passive tense to an English verb that was once exclusively active.</p> <p>There have been two theories that the Star Dust was \"disappeared\". One involves a conspiracy by Peronistas to destroy official British government papers on board; the other, sabotage by people determined that the new airline BSAA should not succeed. It is more likely that the wings were iced.</p> <p>Two days after the first reports, there is a chilly announcement by the postmaster-general in the Times of August 6, that \"air mail correspond-ence for Chile posted in the United Kingdom on July 29 was on board the aircraft Star Dust, which is overdue on its flight from Buenos Aires to Santiago\". In October a search party from Santiago found a different plane. The search continued without success.</p> <p>In March 1948 the stationery office issued a report (price 9d) concluding that \"the actual cause of the accident remains obscure\". The foreign office issued a statement that \"the cause of the disaster may never be known, and in the light of former accidents in the Andes, the aircraft may not be found for years, if ever\".</p> <p>I remember that the news of Peter's disappearance came in August, for I was outside, stamping on tar bubbles. The family heard the news over the wireless, giving Peter's name. My aunt fainted. My grandmother never believed it. Because the first reports spoke of \"a forced landing\", she never gave up hope that, somewhere in the inaccessible Andean peaks he was alive, and would be rescued.</p> <p>There's a photograph of uncle Peter in Buenos Aires, in a dashing white South American suit and correspondent shoes. And a pile of post cards, saved by my grandmother. The first card is from Romania, where he tutored the young Prince Michael. I think he got the job, after Oxford, because his enterprising uncle John had tutored the family of the Prince of Tek, and had once stood Queen Mary in a corner. Not many people got the better of her.</p> <p>I don't know why he went on to South America. The postcards come thick and fast from Cuernavaca, Lima, Santiago and Rio de Janeiro. There's a postcard showing one of the monster-gods of the Aztecs, a huge stone gargoyle baying for sacrificial human blood. \"It proves,\" Peter writes, \"that the Mexicans like a joke.\"</p> <p>He travelled across South America constantly. A month or two after the outbreak of the second world war, he writes from Lima: \"This is where I have been staying during the past two weeks, out in the country. In two days' time I leave for Chile and at the end of the month go to Buenos Aires, where I look forward to finding some letters from you.\" Newly married, he writes from Buenos Aires: \"We arrived back from Chile after a three-day journey across the Andes,\" and he hopes that the family \"are not being much worried by raids, and have enough food.\"</p> <p>There was a shortage of glamour in the England of 1946. With my brother I had come from a colour-filled childhood in India to the dark and grime of post-war England. At Christmas we stayed with my grandmother, briefly released from boarding schools of Dickensian horror.</p> <p>That Christmas, Peter arrived from Argentina with a concertina, a collapsible opera hat and a glamorous wife in fox furs and high heels. She smelled wonderful. My cousins Caroline and Ruth and I - we were seven and six and four - still remember that Christmas vividly. Peter brought us chocolate in silver paper, and dolls with open-and-shut eyes that had real lashes. The war-dark house sparkled, and as they put on their 78s and danced the tango, it was better than Fred and Ginger.</p> <p>Near my grandmother's house there was a Doctor Barnardo's, where I made friends with a girl called Sylvia - I think I too felt like an orphan. We were inseparable, and since neither of us had ever been to the theatre, Peter took us both to Cinderella. It was the first time I can remember laughing in England.</p> <p>I even remember the joke. The Ugly Sisters decided they must slim for the Prince's Ball. They waddled in to a \"slimming chamber\" trailing a real dachshund on a lead behind them. They emerged, slender in fishnet tights, trailing a string of sausages. We were shocked for a moment, but Peter said he could hear the dog barking in the wings, so we knew it was all right. Sylvia and I fell off our seats, helpless with laughter. The usherette was bootfaced, and threatened to throw us out. But Peter charmed her, and told her we were orphans, and dusted us down.</p> <p>He was always generous. He gave my parents \u00a3100 for their wedding present - truly a fortune - and with it they bought a Ford 8, in which my mother ferried wounded troops recuperating in Poonah. It lasted until 1943, when spare parts could no longer be found in India. In the 60s, long after his disappearance, my cousins and I each received \u00a3500, the kind of money that can make all the difference to your life.</p> <p>Only once was there a chance that his body might be found. In 1970 I was in Santiago, interviewing Salvador Allende for this paper, when there came a report that an Andean glacier had melted, and moved, and that an aircraft fuselage had been glimpsed on the inaccessible reaches of mount Tupungato. I felt I owed it to my uncle to finish his story, but by the time I reached Argentina the wreckage had once more vanished under the Andean snows.</p> <p>And now at last, some at least of the bodies have been found. I hope that DNA tests don't mean the bones and bodies will now be separated. I feel that all 11 of the dead, English, Palestinian, German, should be buried and commemorated, as they died, together.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The scale of the damage inflicted on textiles group William Baird by Marks &amp; Spencer's decision to buy more goods abroad was underlined yesterday when the company revealed it plunged \u00a390.7m into the red last year. The company, which is suing Marks &amp; Spencer for breach of contract, said the store's decision to terminate its contract after 30 years had resulted in costs of \u00a3103.5m. The company is closing all 14 of the British factories it used to supply M&amp;S and 4,500 workers are losing their jobs. Shareholders have also suffered. Baird shares, which were trading at about 115p before the M&amp;S decision, have slumped and last night closed down 2p at 47.5p. Yesterday the company announced it was cutting its dividend in half to 5.25p per share for the year. Baird insists it does have a future but not in British manufacturing.

There has been a wholesale boardroom clearout and two former Sainsbury executives have been drafted in to try to turn Alldays around. So far there is little good news. The owned stores increased like-for-like sales by 7.9% in the past 12 months, but the profits they generate dipped from \u00a39.3m to \u00a36m as the company admitted that its controls and standards had slipped. The company has net debts of \u00a3125m and has axed its dividend. It seems unconcerned about the threat posed by rivals such as Sainsbury's and big-brand forecourt retailers, but has no idea when it might creep back into the black. \"It is too difficult to predict,\" said chairman George Duncan. Similarly, it is too difficult to predict when the shares might prove a worthwhile investment.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of the Thorntons chocolate shop empire departed yesterday, only four days after the firm issued a surprise profit warning - its third in 18 months. The company said Roger Paffard, who joined Thorntons in 1996, was leaving the company \"by mutual agreement\". But it was clear that he had been asked to step down. A spokesman for Thorntons said: \"It is time for a change at the top. We have had some tough times and a few disappointments. It is time for a different approach.\" Thornton's shares, which two years ago were changing hands at 290p, have been melting rapidly since the turn of this year, losing more than a quarter of their value. Yesterday, as Mr Paffard's departure was announced, they sank another 4p to a new low of 126p - which values the company, including 528 shops and a new factory, at just \u00a383m. John Thornton, the chairman and a member of the founding family which still controls 32% of the company, is to take day-to-day control of the company until a new chief executive is recruited. Last night there was speculation that Thorntons could be vulnerable to a takeover bid - possibly from one of the big Swiss companies such as Jacobs Suchard. Mr Paffard, who previously worked for the office supplies group Staples and furniture retailer Sharps, is likely to receive compensation of \u00a3186,000 for his loss of office - in line with his salary last year and his one-year contract. Last week Thorntons warned that its profits to the end of June this year were unlikely to match City expectations of around \u00a312m, or last year's level of \u00a310m. The alert came only 11 days before the company was due to announce half-time profit figuress and one analyst commented that \"to have to make a profit warning one week before the interim figures smacks of incompetence\". Last year's results were also downgraded after a similar profit warning. At that time Mr Paffard accepted the blame, saying that his senior managers had been so busy concentrating on the developments such as warehousing and manufacturing that they had neglected the ranges going into the shops. They were short of new lines and ran out of popular prodcuts; and customers, said Mr Paffard, were \"unforgiving\".",

Irish internet security firm Baltimore Technologies continued to respond to last week's results, soaring \u00a310.75 to \u00a3116.50, while London Bridge Software ended the day 220p higher at \u00a364.50 following better than expected results. Pharmaceutical research and development business, Cambridge Antibody Technology, rose 357p to \u00a323.75. Another pharmaceutical stock, Lincoln-based Elan Corporation, was also among the big gainers, finishing 175p up at \u00a324. Standing out from among yesterday's performers were Barclays, up 102p to \u00a315.26, and Reuters, 63p higher at \u00a313.69. Overall the market saw a return of interest in the heavyweight financial sector as fears of another rise in interest rates receded. Banks led the blue chip sector, a welcome return from the dire performance of recent months. Abbey National took the top spot on the FTSE 100 leaders board, up 66p to 711p with Royal Bank of Scotland , fresh from its NatWest triumph, up 73p to 833p, helped on its way by Lehman Brothers' view that the new combine should be ranked as an outperform rather than neutral stock. Lehman also pointed to the attractions of the former building societies now in the banking arena, such as Alliance &amp; Leicester, 49p higher at 567p. At the end of the day, the FTSE 100 index was 133.0 points higher at 6,232.6, just short of its 6,245.5 high for the day. Volume in London was good, with 1.687bn shares changing hands in 132,002 transactions. But this will be of little comfort to those holding a clutch of hi-tech stocks which showed big net losses on the day, including the computer services businesses, CMG, down 199p to \u00a361.74 and Terence Chapman, off 157p at 410p, and the Royalblue software company, down 175p to \u00a322.65.",

Your car will recognise your voice - and you can have a conversation with it, like talking to your partner.\" Mr Ziebart and his team, in common with other manufacturers, is working on devices such as navigational finders which also allow the driver to pre-book the opera or a meal. The new technology will be intuitive, and the steering wheel will remain in place for the foreseeable future to give a reassuring sense of control. At the Geneva Motor Show yesterday manufacturers fell over themselves to present their new ecologically friendly engines to offset the soaring cost of petrol under the impact of rising oil prices - which hit $30 a barrel last month. Fiat announced two refined versions of its ultra-compact Ecobasic car, one running on diesel and the other on a dual electric and petrol engine, which use less than three litres of fuel for every 100 kilometres, or 90 miles per gallon. Not to be outdone, Rick Wagoner, the president of General Motors, announced a new fuel-cell vehicle based on the Zafira people carrier which has a range of 250 miles and a top speed of 88mph. Elsewhere, responding to reporters' questions at the show, Mr Wagoner agreed that General Motors was \"interested\" in buying BMW but had seen no sign that the Quandt family, BMW's main shareholder, was willing to sell.",

However, after exceptional charges of $129m to cover the deal the group made a pre-tax loss of $78.9m. Chief executive Rolf Stahel said integration following the merger was \"95% complete\". Shire's management has taken over Roberts' salesforce and the American company's British head office in Guildford is to be closed. Sales of Adderall, Shire's drug for attention deficit disorder, leapt 92% to $142m.",

He writes ad copy for Nirvana, designed to present the band as a mature million-selling act: \"The world waits to see what happens when teen spirit turns into adult rage.\" What happens, writes Wilcha, will be \"a resounding punk-rock YES!\" He is horrified to find the words \"punk rock\" excised from his copy. </p> <p>Wilcha's video presents itself as a satirical critique of the mechanisms by which the system assimilates the counter-culture. For which, read simply: the way that some moderately intelligent marketing people contrive to sell noisy rock to a conservative American market. Incisive and engaging though it is, The Target Shoots First isn't as earth-shattering as we'd hope - only a real indie ingenu would be shocked by the revelation that corporations were profiting from youth culture.

As Stockhausen reminded us in an illustrated talk between the two performances of the work on Monday, he has continued to explore music in space, as he describes it, but he has never done so with the sheer youthful virtuosity he brought to this score. </p> <p>The Festival Hall isn't the best place to hear such a work - the orchestras all had to be placed more or less in front of the audience, so the sounds couldn't rotate around the space as they should. But with David Robertson, Martyn Brabbins and Pascal Roph\u00e9 in charge of the three bands of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the performance fairly sizzled. Complex webs of instrumental lines spread across the orchestras, often in three different tempi simultaneously; call-and-response passages echoed from one side to the other; most majestic of all, sounds gradually moved from side to side, drawing everyone into their orbit. </p> <p>There's a theatrical charge to much of the writing - comic moments, passages of enormous grandeur, little kernels of exquisite lyricism. When much of Stockhausen's recent music is so uneven, it was salutary to be reminded of one of his most exceptional achievements. </p> <p>Gruppen was prefaced here by a group of piano pieces from the same wondrously productive period - nine of the Klavierst\u00fccke written in the 50s, in which many of the technical innovations used in the orchestral work were first explored. Nicolas Hodges played the obsessive and compelling ninth piece; the rest were allotted to the superb Dutch pianist Ellen Corver, who also included the 1984 Klavierst\u00fcck XIV, part of Montag from Stockhausen's opera cycle Licht. After the clarity and discipline of the early pieces that really came as a nasty shock, as if warm treacle had suddenly been poured over this unique and penetrating soundworld.</p>",

Complex webs of instrumental lines spread across the orchestras, often in three different tempi simultaneously; call-and-response passages echoed from one side to the other; most majestic of all, sounds gradually moved from side to side, drawing everyone into their orbit. There's a theatrical charge to much of the writing - comic moments, passages of enormous grandeur, little kernels of exquisite lyricism. When much of Stockhausen's recent music is so uneven, it was salutary to be reminded of one of his most exceptional achievements. Gruppen was prefaced here by a group of piano pieces from the same wondrously productive period - nine of the Klavierst\u00fccke written in the 50s, in which many of the technical innovations used in the orchestral work were first explored. Nicolas Hodges played the obsessive and compelling ninth piece; the rest were allotted to the superb Dutch pianist Ellen Corver, who also included the 1984 Klavierst\u00fcck XIV, part of Montag from Stockhausen's opera cycle Licht. After the clarity and discipline of the early pieces that really came as a nasty shock, as if warm treacle had suddenly been poured over this unique and penetrating soundworld.",

      "body": "<p>As employee empowerment develops apace, it seems beyond belief that anyone would confident enough to blackmail a colleague or client. Yet that is exactly what Carol Winston-Churchill, who is a barrister, attempted with an American investment banker. Last week at the Old Bailey, Winston-Churchill pleaded guilty to threatening to tell David Brown's Manhattan employers, Bear, Stern &amp; Company, that he was gay after his plans to buy a house in Jamaica in 1983 fell through. </p> <p>Brown had already given Winston-Churchill \u00a3100,000 for conveyancing fees. She refused to return it when the deal was called off. When his lawyers began proceedings to recover the money, she threatened him. The banker, who has since died, was not, in fact, homosexual; he went straight to the police. However, Winston-Churchill apparently believed that she could exploit the stigma associated with homosexuality at the time. But that was nearly 20 years ago; could such a thing happen in the modern workplace? </p> <p>The last thing 35-year-old David Coppola expected when he joined the London office of a multinational bank was a succession of professional snubs and a salary just over half that of younger, less qualified colleagues. As a senior consultant in commercial banking, Coppola had been targeted as a fast-track high-flier. A successful and well-liked key player in his field, his scheduled progression through the initial two-year tenure was guaranteed. Or so he thought. </p> <p>After five years with the company, he has been promoted only once and achieved a salary package far from commensurate with his position. The reason, he alleges, is his sexuality. \"In the first year, the fact that I'm gay came out gradually over post-work drinks. I never made a big deal of it and eventually most of my colleagues sussed it anyway,\" he says. At this stage, Coppola reckons he should be at the peak of his career. His peers are on around one and half times his present salary and are rising through the ranks. His career appears to have reached a standstill. </p> <p>\"Glass ceiling\" is a term usually applied to women who are unable to achieve senior directorial positions as a result of gender prejudice within the workplace. Until now, the gay glass ceiling has not come under close scrutiny by the national lesbian and gay campaigning organisations. Research and monitoring of individual cases is minimal, in part because it is difficult to quantify, in part because the position of the individu als affected has not been publicised. \"We do get approached by people who believe their sexuality, combined with other people's prejudice, makes promotion problematic,\" says Phil Greasley, who is a campaigner with the lobby group Lager (Lesbian and Gay Equal Rights). \"We try to do as much for them as we can, but it's difficult to prove. An employer is free to choose who to promote and who not to, and it's easy to assess people so that they don't reach a level for promotion. Sometimes 'attitude' or 'approach' are mentioned in a negative way.\" </p> <p>It's the small details that add up to important evidence, though. And, Greasley thinks, if it can be shown that a person has been unfairly treated, it's not always necessary to prove that sexuality is the reason. Coppola has a briefcase full of details. He believes he has been regularly excluded from significant meetings, business trips and conferences, and kept isolated and uninformed. </p> <p>Coppola is not alone in his complaint. In other instances, too, a gay glass ceiling appears to be firmly, if unofficially, lodged in company structure. Paul McBride is a human resources manager working for a city council. Around the predominant male managers, McBride's honesty about his sexuality makes people twitchy. He came out to his colleagues six months after joining the council. Eight years later, he has reservations about having done it because of the still largely \"blokish\" office culture. </p> <p>\"I'm not the kind of person who talks about their sex life a lot, but I have found it in my interest to play it down. The further up the organisation I go, the more I find myself spending time with women at the same level because we have quite a lot of common experiences. We don't get invited to the pub or to play golf.\" </p> <p>For some, the absence of a family causes problems. The corporate publication Management Today cites Sir Bob Reid, deputy governor of the Bank of Scotland, who believes that anyone - gay or straight - who lacks a solid family backdrop is suspicious. \"The whole thing about life is that you get into trouble because you don't have a wide breadth of experience. You have to be suspicious of people who don't have children jumping on their sofas at home. They don't know about real life.\" </p> <p>McBride is not surprised by Reid's remarks: \"There are still very strong male networks and although on the surface it doesn't look like that's what's going on, the higher up you get, most business goes on outside the office and you don't get invited. You just don't find out.\" </p> <p>In 1996, Dr Nicholas Priestley, a clinical neuropsychologist was made clinical director of a private clinic in Bury. As one of the country's leading expert witnesses in head-injury litigation and one of the most senior doctors in his field, Priestley was regarded as the only suitable candidate. </p> <p>Thrilled to be appointed, he had no idea that three years later he would be embroiled in an industrial tribunal with his employers, Westminster Healthcare, over sex discrimination and constructive dismissal. Priestley alleges that management and colleagues taunted him relentlessly about his sex uality and the integrity of his character. \"In the corridor, colleagues would call me sick and perverted,\" Priestley claims. \"They simply could not treat a gay man as an equal.\" </p> <p>In two years he alleges he was ostracised and undermined by his co-workers, and asked on several occasions to \"change\" his personality (which he read as \"sexuality\"). Priestley made more than 30 written and verbal complaints to his employers about his treatment. In June 1998, Priestley felt he had no option but to hand in his resignation. Priestley's claims are denied by his employers, who say that there was no discrimination and that Priestley resigned for his own reasons. </p> <p>Priestley hoped to win a moral victory at industrial tribunal but claims the 10-day hearing was unfair. He claims that at one point he was asked, when taking the oath, how he could swear on the Bible, given that he was gay.

Speaking in the House of Commons on December 21 1999, Priestley's MP, David Chaytorm, said: \"If Dr Priestley had been a woman, had had a disability of some kind, or had been a member of an ethnic minority, he would have had recourse to the law earlier.

Campaigners believe it's a start, though not much to shout about, and Nicholas Priestley concludes, \"A statutory code of conduct must be implemented. Good employers are already implementing such policy - it's the bad ones who must be forced to change.\" </p> <p>Such a move would finally change a culture which can sustain blackmail, and everyday acts of prejudice as well as the glass ceiling. </p> <p>&amp;#'149; Jane Czyzselska writes regularly on gay rights at work for Attitude magazine.

This year the marketeers have gone one step further - websites for children and teenagers developed on the catch-em-young model of winning customers. </p> <p>A fully encrypted kids-only site, eKids, launches in the US today promising concerned parents a safe, fun and educa tional environment where their children can play, learn and communicate with other children around the world. </p> <p>\"The internet is like a physical street. Most parents don't want their children roaming the streets totally unsupervised,\" says chief executive El St John. Advertising is banned to prevent parents from being pestered for goods by their children, though the company admits sponsors will be sought. </p> <p>UK players looking to introduce secure child-focused sites include HIT Entertainment, the television company behind Bob the Builder, and Britt Allcroft, owner of the Thomas the Tank Engine franchise. </p> <p>Kids will even get their own currency to spend on the web. American children already have Rocketcash and Cybermoola. In the UK there are Y-creds, developed by Kevin Sefton, a former consultant to AOL. Parents can credit their child's account, with each Ycred - which come in \u00a35 units - worth 1p. </p> <p>But the big potential is in sites aimed at teenagers with time on their hands and money to spend. </p> <p>According to research from NOP the teenage segment is the fastest-growing demographic online.

      "bodyText": "Last year there was Handbag.com, Charlotte Street.com and Ready2shop.com. It was the year companies recognised the sales potential of women surfing the net. This year the marketeers have gone one step further - websites for children and teenagers developed on the catch-em-young model of winning customers. A fully encrypted kids-only site, eKids, launches in the US today promising concerned parents a safe, fun and educa tional environment where their children can play, learn and communicate with other children around the world. \"The internet is like a physical street. Most parents don't want their children roaming the streets totally unsupervised,\" says chief executive El St John. Advertising is banned to prevent parents from being pestered for goods by their children, though the company admits sponsors will be sought. UK players looking to introduce secure child-focused sites include HIT Entertainment, the television company behind Bob the Builder, and Britt Allcroft, owner of the Thomas the Tank Engine franchise. Kids will even get their own currency to spend on the web. American children already have Rocketcash and Cybermoola. In the UK there are Y-creds, developed by Kevin Sefton, a former consultant to AOL. Parents can credit their child's account, with each Ycred - which come in \u00a35 units - worth 1p. But the big potential is in sites aimed at teenagers with time on their hands and money to spend. According to research from NOP the teenage segment is the fastest-growing demographic online. NOP found that 98% of 12-16 years olds use a computer at home or school; 60% will be online by the spring, compared to 44% last summer. Girls spend more time online than boys. For a grouping so web-savvy they are poorly served. \"Beyond sites offering computer games there is very little fo cused content on the web,\" said David Pannell, a consultant at investment bank Durlacher. All that could be about to change. From April, a site backed by some of the biggest business names will aim directly at teenage girls. Wowgo is the brainchild of chief executive David Peller, a solicitor who helped bring Wagamama noodle bars to London, and chairman David Gold, of the Gold Greenlees Trott advertising agency. Mr Peller says: \"Having recognised that teen girls are both difficult to reach through traditional media and underserved in a digital environment, we have positioned ourselve to capture the huge opportunity this market represents in terms of size, value and influence.\" He plans a \"24-hour global digital community for teenage girls\" with chatrooms, exclusive content, gossip sites and - of course - commerce. Little surprise that Unilever, whose brands include Dove and Calvin Klein fragrances, is backing the enterprise, along with Durlacher and Hewlett Packard, with \u00a36m cash. Arch-rival Procter &amp; Gamble (Clearasil, Pantene and Tampax) will launch a competing site in the summer with Excite. Mr Pannell says technological change has forced the companies' hands. \"Children are spending less time watching TV and more time surfing the web and playing computer games.

      "body": "<p>There is a scene in Warren Leight's play when three jazz trumpeters sit side by side on bar stools listening to a bootleg recording of legendary trumpeter Clifford Brown, made the night before his fatal car crash. As the music curls like smoke across the auditorium of the Apollo Shaftesbury in London, the men's eyes begin to glaze and their jaws become slack in response. They look like customers in an opium den or junkies who have just had a fix. </p> <p>The idea - oft mooted elsewhere - of the relationship between jazz and drugs comes across strong in this play, a haunting riff of a drama about parent-son relationships, the madness of disappointment and the way the gift of music can open some doors of perception and slam others shut. As the young Clifford (named in honour of the dead Brown) muses about his father, the jazz trumpeter, Gene: \"I never understood how he could sense everything when he was blowing and sense nothing when he wasn't.\" Always married to his music and more at ease with his musician friends than in his own home, it is Gene's neglect of his wife, Terry, that tips her over the edge into madness. </p> <p>This is a memory play, and like so many memory plays it is seen through a spun sugar haze in which the distant past is always better than the near past and the near past better than the awful present. \"From what I understand,\" says Jason Priestley's not surprisingly emotional Clifford, \"everyone was happy before I was born.\" </p> <p>There is added poignancy in the fact it takes place between 1953 and 1985, which saw the decline of New York's jazz clubs. Gathering around the radio to hear Elvis Presley's first record, one of the characters predicts: \"That kid will do for jazz what the talkies did for Buster Keaton.\" Gene and the others laugh him off, blithely unaware that they are dodos on the edge of extinction. </p> <p>The evening often comes within a whisker of sentimentality and sometimes falls into the trap of romanticising jazz musicians, but there is something tough about both the writing and its sentiments. \"Wow, she broke Bakelite,\" observes the teenage Clifford as his mother hurls a cup in a drunken rage at the feckless Gene. Nothing will break this play: at times it is almost unbearable to watch as it charts the disintegration of Gene and Terry's marriage, with the boy Clifford condemned to play peacekeeper and Red Cross in the middle. </p> <p>The accents of the American cast take some getting used to, but the acting is diamond hard in that thrillingly wired way that is so distinctively American. Priestley, leaving Beverly Hills 90210 far behind, is immensely touching; Edie Falco, of Sopranos fame, goes noisily nutty as she realises that she will always play second fiddle to jazz, and Frank Wood is superb as Gene, a man who can talk to his son through his trumpet but can't even look him in the eye.</p> <p>\u0095 At the Apollo Shaftesbury, London W1, till May 6.

They look like customers in an opium den or junkies who have just had a fix. The idea - oft mooted elsewhere - of the relationship between jazz and drugs comes across strong in this play, a haunting riff of a drama about parent-son relationships, the madness of disappointment and the way the gift of music can open some doors of perception and slam others shut. As the young Clifford (named in honour of the dead Brown) muses about his father, the jazz trumpeter, Gene: \"I never understood how he could sense everything when he was blowing and sense nothing when he wasn't.\" Always married to his music and more at ease with his musician friends than in his own home, it is Gene's neglect of his wife, Terry, that tips her over the edge into madness. This is a memory play, and like so many memory plays it is seen through a spun sugar haze in which the distant past is always better than the near past and the near past better than the awful present. \"From what I understand,\" says Jason Priestley's not surprisingly emotional Clifford, \"everyone was happy before I was born.\" There is added poignancy in the fact it takes place between 1953 and 1985, which saw the decline of New York's jazz clubs. Gathering around the radio to hear Elvis Presley's first record, one of the characters predicts: \"That kid will do for jazz what the talkies did for Buster Keaton.\" Gene and the others laugh him off, blithely unaware that they are dodos on the edge of extinction. The evening often comes within a whisker of sentimentality and sometimes falls into the trap of romanticising jazz musicians, but there is something tough about both the writing and its sentiments. \"Wow, she broke Bakelite,\" observes the teenage Clifford as his mother hurls a cup in a drunken rage at the feckless Gene. Nothing will break this play: at times it is almost unbearable to watch as it charts the disintegration of Gene and Terry's marriage, with the boy Clifford condemned to play peacekeeper and Red Cross in the middle. The accents of the American cast take some getting used to, but the acting is diamond hard in that thrillingly wired way that is so distinctively American. Priestley, leaving Beverly Hills 90210 far behind, is immensely touching; Edie Falco, of Sopranos fame, goes noisily nutty as she realises that she will always play second fiddle to jazz, and Frank Wood is superb as Gene, a man who can talk to his son through his trumpet but can't even look him in the eye. \u0095 At the Apollo Shaftesbury, London W1, till May 6.
