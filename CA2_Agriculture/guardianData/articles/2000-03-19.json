      "body": "<p>Fair warning: this is not an interview with Duncan Ferguson. Anyone looking for one of those should track down some old Scottish newspapers or the odd Newcastle United programme. The striker formerly known as Duncan Disorderly no longer speaks to the media, partly because they come up with such unflattering nicknames, and any resemblance between what follows and actual contact between Ferguson and this newspaper is entirely coincidental. </p> <p>Ferguson has been called the Greta Garbo of football, although his horror of any kind of exposure makes the reclusive actress look like Posh Spice. The BBC cannot get him to appear on A Question of Sport, despite the fact that John Parrott is now his brother-in-law. After several rebuffs, the programme took the unusual step of asking Parrott to make a personal request, to which Ferguson replied politely but firmly in the negative, and this time he was only being asked to be a mystery guest. </p> <p>The Scot can occasionally be prevailed upon to make public appearances to thank supporters, but was furious when Sky TV cameras turned up and took over a player of the month award last year. Similarly, when Everton visited St James's Park last November, a rare interview with Ferguson in the programme was predictably plundered by a succession of quote-starved newspapers, even though it contained nothing more startling than an admission that he was pleased to see the club climb out of the bottom three and a promise that he felt 'fitter and stronger' and was 'dying to show the Geordies something of the real Duncan Ferguson'. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, Ferguson became so fed up with seeing the same quotes rehashed in different articles he asked the club if it was possible to put a stop to it. </p> <p>Ferguson is not the only footballer who does not understand how the media work, but he ought to be able to work out that it is his own reticence that gives his occasional utterances a value they scarcely deserve. He could learn from Alan Shearer, who does not talk much either, but says enough to confirm he has mastered the art of the anodyne interview. Ferguson's self-imposed silence dates fairly precisely from the sequence of events in Scotland that led to a six-week stay in Barlinnie Prison for a butt on Raith's John McStay while playing for Rangers in 1994. It is reasonable to assume he either blames the press for what happened (even though he was on probation at the time of the McStay incident), or does not want to give inquisitors the chance to bring it up. Never the most relaxed of interviewees even in the carefree days of his youth, Ferguson is positively hostile now. 'If there was any justice in this world those people who wrote all that rubbish about a great, great player [Shearer] who has since rammed every daft word down their throats should have been thrown out of their jobs on newspapers, radio and television,' he recently concluded. </p> <p>Shearer's response to this vote of confidence was to follow Ferguson's lead and announce his international retirement. Scotland have practically no strikers, certainly none of Ferguson's physical presence, so it is assumed his non-availability is harming his country, though since he has never added to the solitary goal he scored at under-21 level in seven full internationals there is room for debate on the subject. Goalscoring has never been Ferguson's forte, but failing to impose himself against the might of Estonia in his last appearance in a dismal 0-0 draw in Monaco in 1997 convinced many Scots they were not missing out on much. Craig Brown remains diplomatically receptive to a Ferguson change of heart, but usually stresses he would like the 6ft 4in striker as an option. The Scottish manager will be aware that one or two of his players believe Ferguson switches teams into involuntary long-ball mode. 'You can't help it,' one former team-mate explained. 'You look up and he's the first thing you see. The easiest thing is always to just hit it to him.' </p> <p>Bobby Robson does not appear to have any problems with that, neither does Shearer, and neither did Ruud Gullit, who bought Ferguson as a target man after initially inquiring after Dion Dublin. What you get with Ferguson is surprising ability on the ground for such a big man, and the occasional awesome display of strength and aggression when he is pumped up for big matches. 'Unplayable' is Alan Hansen's verdict. What you don't get is a regular supply of goals, and you tend not to get consistency either, since some part of Ferguson's extraordinary physique is usually under strain and he never seems far from his next injury. </p> <p>Yet if Fenerbahce really have \u00a312 million to wave under Newcastle's nose for Ferguson, Robson can be credited with a transformation even more startling than his celebrated rejuvenation of Shearer. Getting the England captain back to the top of the Premiership scoring charts is nothing compared to showing a profit on a player who was merely an \u00a38 million adornment to the treatment room under Gullit. It is possible the Turkish club's alleged interest stems from the misapprehension that Ferguson scores goals like last month's screamer against Manchester United all the time, but Robson is not about to let the facts get in the way of a good story. </p> <p>'Ferguson fought Jaap Stam in the air, he fought him on the touchline,' said a splendidly over-the-top Newcastle manager in full Churchillian flow. 'He gave him a torrid time, and I don't think Stam enjoyed it one bit. He probably found Ferguson the toughest, most awkward striker he has played against this season, and that includes the Champions League. Big Duncan is beginning to enjoy his football again, that's the change in him. He likes what he's doing so now he's doing it better. It shows in matches and it shows in training. He's not missing training like he was doing when I first came here.' </p> <p>Ferguson credits Robson for the correct diagnosis. 'He took the time and trouble to really examine my situation, and told me I was trying to come back too early from injuries,' he said (yes, in a club magazine). 'He was right. I have tended to do that throughout my career, and there have been occasions when I have had an injection and played when I shouldn't.' The newly restored Ferguson has again rejected Scotland, which Robson thinks is a pity, since they do not have another player like him. 'Mind you, there's no one like him in England either,' he said. 'Kevin Phillips isn't like him, neither is Andy Cole or Teddy Sheringham. He's unique.' And his partnership with Shearer? 'The most lethal in the Premiership,' according to fellow Scot Kevin Gallacher, who incidentally believes Ferguson is 'too big' to coerce back into a Scotland shirt. </p> <p>The respect in Gallacher's tribute is revealing. At both his English clubs, Ferguson has been hugely popular with supporters, fellow players, and hospital wards, which witnessed his impromptu visits and unheralded generosity. He is sure of a rapturous welcome at Everton today. Ferguson might have made a few mistakes when fame and fortune descended upon him too quickly in Scotland, but all you hear about now is a player who tips apprentices on boot duty with \u00a320 notes, buys presents for team-mates' babies, and makes sizeable donations to local charities as long as the press don't find out. </p> <p>You have to go back a few years to find anyone with a bad word to say about Ferguson, but one Karen Young, a topless dancer from his bachelor days on Merseyside, complained in the Sunday Mirror that he only had three topics of conversation: 'Football, prison, or his damned pigeons.' There's just no pleasing some girls. Ferguson may not find his way on to many chat shows, but three subjects is well above average. Too many players these days can't even talk about football.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fair warning: this is not an interview with Duncan Ferguson. Anyone looking for one of those should track down some old Scottish newspapers or the odd Newcastle United programme. The striker formerly known as Duncan Disorderly no longer speaks to the media, partly because they come up with such unflattering nicknames, and any resemblance between what follows and actual contact between Ferguson and this newspaper is entirely coincidental. Ferguson has been called the Greta Garbo of football, although his horror of any kind of exposure makes the reclusive actress look like Posh Spice. The BBC cannot get him to appear on A Question of Sport, despite the fact that John Parrott is now his brother-in-law. After several rebuffs, the programme took the unusual step of asking Parrott to make a personal request, to which Ferguson replied politely but firmly in the negative, and this time he was only being asked to be a mystery guest. The Scot can occasionally be prevailed upon to make public appearances to thank supporters, but was furious when Sky TV cameras turned up and took over a player of the month award last year. Similarly, when Everton visited St James's Park last November, a rare interview with Ferguson in the programme was predictably plundered by a succession of quote-starved newspapers, even though it contained nothing more startling than an admission that he was pleased to see the club climb out of the bottom three and a promise that he felt 'fitter and stronger' and was 'dying to show the Geordies something of the real Duncan Ferguson'. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, Ferguson became so fed up with seeing the same quotes rehashed in different articles he asked the club if it was possible to put a stop to it. Ferguson is not the only footballer who does not understand how the media work, but he ought to be able to work out that it is his own reticence that gives his occasional utterances a value they scarcely deserve. He could learn from Alan Shearer, who does not talk much either, but says enough to confirm he has mastered the art of the anodyne interview. Ferguson's self-imposed silence dates fairly precisely from the sequence of events in Scotland that led to a six-week stay in Barlinnie Prison for a butt on Raith's John McStay while playing for Rangers in 1994. It is reasonable to assume he either blames the press for what happened (even though he was on probation at the time of the McStay incident), or does not want to give inquisitors the chance to bring it up. Never the most relaxed of interviewees even in the carefree days of his youth, Ferguson is positively hostile now. 'If there was any justice in this world those people who wrote all that rubbish about a great, great player [Shearer] who has since rammed every daft word down their throats should have been thrown out of their jobs on newspapers, radio and television,' he recently concluded. Shearer's response to this vote of confidence was to follow Ferguson's lead and announce his international retirement. Scotland have practically no strikers, certainly none of Ferguson's physical presence, so it is assumed his non-availability is harming his country, though since he has never added to the solitary goal he scored at under-21 level in seven full internationals there is room for debate on the subject. Goalscoring has never been Ferguson's forte, but failing to impose himself against the might of Estonia in his last appearance in a dismal 0-0 draw in Monaco in 1997 convinced many Scots they were not missing out on much. Craig Brown remains diplomatically receptive to a Ferguson change of heart, but usually stresses he would like the 6ft 4in striker as an option. The Scottish manager will be aware that one or two of his players believe Ferguson switches teams into involuntary long-ball mode. 'You can't help it,' one former team-mate explained. 'You look up and he's the first thing you see. The easiest thing is always to just hit it to him.' Bobby Robson does not appear to have any problems with that, neither does Shearer, and neither did Ruud Gullit, who bought Ferguson as a target man after initially inquiring after Dion Dublin. What you get with Ferguson is surprising ability on the ground for such a big man, and the occasional awesome display of strength and aggression when he is pumped up for big matches. 'Unplayable' is Alan Hansen's verdict. What you don't get is a regular supply of goals, and you tend not to get consistency either, since some part of Ferguson's extraordinary physique is usually under strain and he never seems far from his next injury. Yet if Fenerbahce really have \u00a312 million to wave under Newcastle's nose for Ferguson, Robson can be credited with a transformation even more startling than his celebrated rejuvenation of Shearer. Getting the England captain back to the top of the Premiership scoring charts is nothing compared to showing a profit on a player who was merely an \u00a38 million adornment to the treatment room under Gullit. It is possible the Turkish club's alleged interest stems from the misapprehension that Ferguson scores goals like last month's screamer against Manchester United all the time, but Robson is not about to let the facts get in the way of a good story. 'Ferguson fought Jaap Stam in the air, he fought him on the touchline,' said a splendidly over-the-top Newcastle manager in full Churchillian flow. 'He gave him a torrid time, and I don't think Stam enjoyed it one bit. He probably found Ferguson the toughest, most awkward striker he has played against this season, and that includes the Champions League. Big Duncan is beginning to enjoy his football again, that's the change in him. He likes what he's doing so now he's doing it better. It shows in matches and it shows in training. He's not missing training like he was doing when I first came here.' Ferguson credits Robson for the correct diagnosis. 'He took the time and trouble to really examine my situation, and told me I was trying to come back too early from injuries,' he said (yes, in a club magazine). 'He was right. I have tended to do that throughout my career, and there have been occasions when I have had an injection and played when I shouldn't.' The newly restored Ferguson has again rejected Scotland, which Robson thinks is a pity, since they do not have another player like him. 'Mind you, there's no one like him in England either,' he said. 'Kevin Phillips isn't like him, neither is Andy Cole or Teddy Sheringham. He's unique.' And his partnership with Shearer? 'The most lethal in the Premiership,' according to fellow Scot Kevin Gallacher, who incidentally believes Ferguson is 'too big' to coerce back into a Scotland shirt. The respect in Gallacher's tribute is revealing. At both his English clubs, Ferguson has been hugely popular with supporters, fellow players, and hospital wards, which witnessed his impromptu visits and unheralded generosity. He is sure of a rapturous welcome at Everton today. Ferguson might have made a few mistakes when fame and fortune descended upon him too quickly in Scotland, but all you hear about now is a player who tips apprentices on boot duty with \u00a320 notes, buys presents for team-mates' babies, and makes sizeable donations to local charities as long as the press don't find out. You have to go back a few years to find anyone with a bad word to say about Ferguson, but one Karen Young, a topless dancer from his bachelor days on Merseyside, complained in the Sunday Mirror that he only had three topics of conversation: 'Football, prison, or his damned pigeons.' There's just no pleasing some girls. Ferguson may not find his way on to many chat shows, but three subjects is well above average. Too many players these days can't even talk about football.",

Now, with Pearce's chances of doing so having been undermined by two leg fractures, Gough and Hughes must be the best bets. </p> <p>Gough, my former Scotland colleague, will be 38 on 5 April, while Hughes, a team-mate at Manchester United, reached that age last month. But they hardly seem to have changed at all physically - and the same applies to their ability. </p> <p>Richard has the same lean body shape that he had some 20 years ago, when he was at the start of his career with Dundee United and I was at Aberdeen. He produced a superb performance against us on Wednesday. His anticipation, particularly with regards to the number of good crosses we produced, was as good as that of any Premiership central defender I have seen this season. </p> <p>The misgivings about the decision by Everton's manager, Walter Smith, to bring Richard to Everton at the start of the season - because of his age and limited top-flight football experience in recent seasons - have been proved to be misplaced.

It is a bit like giving up smoking. </p> <p>As you get older, the inevitable decline in physical power can be offset to a great extent by your knowledge of the game. When I reached the so-called 'veteran' stage in my own career, I found that while I had lost perhaps 10 per cent of my fitness and stamina, my football intelligence had improved by 25 per cent. But that does not mean you can afford not to keep training flat out. The body has to be accustomed to the tempo at which it is expected to perform on a Saturday. </p> <p>Therefore, although an older player might train for an hour a day, as opposed to an hour and a half, the effort he puts into it must be 100 per cent. </p> <p>A number of players are sceptical about the advantages of doing a lot of physical work. In pre-season training, when there is a particular emphasis on this, one often hears complaints such as: 'We are footballers, not Olympic athletes.' But one thing they overlook is that the greater their fitness and stamina, the better their concentration becomes. When it comes to matches, it is the players who are the most tired who make the most mistakes. </p> <p>In terms of footballers adopting the mentalities of athletes, Richard Gough is as good an example as any.

Intended to work as an 'early warning system' to problems that might occur. Will be staffed by at least six top accountants. However, while every club will have its books inspected annually, they will only be visited if problems arise. In addition both its powers and the punishments that may follow an FCU inquiry are still unclear. * Restoring the FA Cup's pre-eminence and avoiding this season's pitfalls that have seen holders Manchester United be allowed to withdraw, low crowds at the first-ever third round games staged before Christmas and confusion among fans about what stage it had reached. * Establishing 3,000 grassroots 'superclubs' within three years. Already common in Holland and Germany, they run up to 20 teams each and use their good facilities to draw together a huge number of participants. County Football Associations will have a key role in this. * Details of all transfers involving English clubs, both domestic and foreign, will have to be given to Lancaster Gate, including the exact fee paid and any cut given to an agent or any other third party, as part of a crackdown on bungs. * Setting up a customer relations unit at the Football Association to deal with fans' queries and concerns. But what could it do to help a fan disgruntled about a huge season-ticket hike? Crozier says a new good practice charter at every club should prevent that. * All coaches and managers in English professional football will have to have a Football Association pro licence before they can start working with players. Intended to drive up coaching standards. * A women's professional league will be created in 2003 to reflect the booming interest in females playing football here and worldwide.",

Sitting by the lake in the Buen Retiro park on a perfect summer's day in mid-March, I felt that only a loony would want to leave this city. Anelka, suspended by Real Madrid for 45 days for missing training sessions, will probably be off soon. </p> <p>Tuesday was the French striker's twenty-first birthday. Surely there are better ways of spending it than fighting with Real Madrid, but he coped. </p> <p>He played golf and tennis, socialised with his brothers and the neighbourhood pets, went to Real for punishment training, but was sent home for not calling in advance, and then served birthday cake and Coca-Cola to the journalists waiting outside his house. </p> <p>That night, Real played Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League. Some of the 40,000 fans who bothered to turn up were polled by the sports daily Marca on whether the Frenchman should be pardoned. 'No,' said 88 per cent. The club agrees. A spokesman said: 'If we had known all this before, we wouldn't have signed him. To have done otherwise would be masochistic.' Vicente del Bosque, the caretaker manager, added: 'This is not a school.' </p> <p>Yet Real have much in common with a boarding school of the Greyfriars variety. You could see this even as they took the field, led, as always, by the trio of Raul, Fernando Hierro, and Fernando Redondo. Raul (good at games) is the most popular boy in the class. Hierro is school captain: he has been around forever, is challenged by no one, and so has become a bit of a bully. Redondo is their crony. Roberto Carlos, Steve McManaman and Fernando Morientes tag along, good enough and sociable enough to have gained acceptance. But Anelka is the boy who gets bullied: the Billy Bunter of Real Madrid. </p> <p>The chaotic game against Dynamo ended in a 2-2 draw, leaving Real best placed to reach the knockout stages of the Champions League. Afterwards, as journalists waited for players outside the changing-rooms, the latest issue of France Football was passed around. Anelka treats the magazine as his newspaper of record, like a 1950s prime minister talking to The Times, and he had granted an interview in which he told all.</p> <p>Sadly, it only added to the impression that he is indeed a paranoid loner. 'I am alone against the rest of the team,' he said. He possessed, he claimed, a video showing his team-mates looking gloomy after he had scored his first goal for Real after six months at the club. He had tried to give this video to Del Bosque, but Del Bosque didn't want to see it. Also, the other black Francophone players had told him that the others wouldn't pass to him. </p> <p>This sounds extraordinary. But as the old joke says: sure he's paranoid, but what if everyone really is out to get him? None of the popular boys at Real have made Anelka feel at home. Hierro has attacked him in public, and the Frenchman says the sweeper even went to Lorenzo Sanz, the club president, to dissuade him from signing him. In Anelka's phrase, 'They threw me into the changing room, and said \"Look after yourself\".' </p> <p>When the Real squad emerged from the showers after the Dynamo game, everyone asked about Anelka. Christian Karembeu, one of his friends, shrugged. Sanz shrugged. The general view in Spain, as it was in England last year, is that Anelka should shut up and do what he is paid for. </p> <p>That is a peculiarly materialistic view: as if your salary should determine your behaviour. But even in materialistic terms, Real are being foolish. If you pay \u00a323 million for a player, it is bad management to make him fend for himself. </p> <p>There is a leading kit brand in the game today that assigns a minder to each footballer it signs. The minder gives the player occasional presents, acts as his secretary, friend and shrink, and remembers his wife's birthday. To most players, this comes as a bonus in a stressful life. To a few, it is essential. If you are a 21-year-old paranoid loner living in a country where you don't speak the language, you need help. </p> <p>Some clubs understand. Arsenal helped Tony Adams and Paul Merson fight addiction, kept Emmanuel Petit in England, restored the confidence of Dennis Bergkamp and Nwankwo Kanu, and had Anelka on the pitch scoring goals. </p> <p>Conversely, the collapse of Paul Gascoigne and Stan Collymore reflects badly on Middlesbrough and Aston Villa respectively. So Real must ask themselves how they failed Anelka. </p> <p>He has a point when he says no one wants him to succeed. The manager who signed him, John Toshack, has since been sacked, the seventh manager to go in Sanz's four years in charge. Sanz, who sanctioned Anelka's purchase, is obviously a changeable character. At the moment he is preoccupied with trying to buy back his son Fernando, who was sold to Malaga after failing to make the grade at Real. </p> <p>Del Bosque is a marginal figure, with none of the Louis XIV-style powers accorded to British managers. Viewed for years as an eternal assistant, this uncharismatic man is known chiefly for his Groucho Marx moustache. He keeps his head down. </p> <p>Jorge Valdano, one of Sanz's seven victims, says the current Real squad remind him of Frankenstein's monster: a mishmash of various managers' minds - 'this man's ear, that one's nose, someone else's mouth'. From the diverse materials Del Bosque has constructed a side. Anelka does not fit into it, geared as it is to a forward line of Raul and Morientes. </p> <p>Real ran up a debt of about \u00a3130 million in putting together this side.

Seeing as the devil of inconsistency has so far scorched their Premiership, FA Cup, Worthington Cup and Champions League aspirations it's logical to assume another untimely descent or two might finish their season off altogether.

Vieira, Kanu, Ljungberg and Thierry Henry, with Alex Manninger and Matthew Upson waiting in the wings. </p> <p>That Swedish international Ljungberg has imposed himself in this group is testament to his tenacious character. Having made the kind of impact on his debut that made you think he'd fit in just fine at Arsenal - looking like some kind of mutant version of Johnny Rotten meets Boyzone with his electric-shock hair and cute features, he came on as a late sub and claimed a cheeky goal and a booking against Manchester United - he struggled for a while. A little homesickness and a lot of fatigue after 18 months of uninterrupted football took its toll on his game.</p> <p>Now, adaptation completed, he has transformed himself into one of the club's most valuable players. It is significant that nobody has played more games for Arsenal this campaign than he. 'In his first season he was lost,' says Wenger, 'and this season his improvement has been one of the satisfactions of the year.' Fortunately for Arsenal Ljungberg appears to be as pleased with life at Highbury as they are with him. 'My contract is for two more years and obviously I will stay until then but I don't see any reason to move anyway. At the moment I am really happy with the club. I have a lot of friends in England and a good social life, I think we have a great team, and I'm playing as well, which is important. Of course we could win some more games - then I would be even happier. </p> <p>'I've heard everyone say that when Arsenal have their backs against the wall they play well and I think that's true,' adds Ljungberg. 'That's what we're hoping for. We have 10 more games in the league and we'll try to take as many points as we can and see where we finish. We need to get some consistency and a lot of points in a row and we can get in the top three, absolutely. And winning the Uefa Cup would be a great thing for me personally because I have never won a European trophy. Winning is a nice feeling and it drives you every day in training.' </p> <p>Back home they are watching his progress with interest. Ljungberg is revered as the best player in Sweden. For the national side he is the playmaker, the creator, the wand that can change a game. They reckon we will only see the best of him when he is free to roam in his favourite central role rather than positioned out wide as he is at the moment. 'If his finishing and final ball improves and when he has more experience that's where I think his future will lie,' hinted Wenger. 'And he has a big future, because he is good going forward, he works hard and he's a winner. He has the fighting spirit of an English side.' </p> <p>The Arsenal tradition of absolute refusal to accept defeat has been in short supply this season. Ljungberg, though, has never been a shrinking violet when it comes to rallying to the cause. He admits he used to get angry but is learning to channel his energy differently. 'It distracts your concentration,' he says. 'Now if opponents try to kick me down instead of shouting at them I try to dribble round them instead.' He has tried to move on from the experience against today's opponents at White Hart Lane, when he was sent off harshly and responded with a reckless gesture that earned him a suspension. </p> <p>It also brought cult hero status. At least, thought the Arsenal faithful, it symbolised passion. They are used to their players caring in these parts and it's gone awol too often for comfort lately.

Another lies in his own bed, \u00a338,000 a week still not enough to rouse him for light shooting practice at the Real Madrid training ground. Nobody gives a damn.

      "body": "<p>Cup finals, like the Cheltenham Festival, have a peculiar way of causing the compilers of the form book to wonder if their work is worth continuing. </p> <p>Faced with the kind of obstacles they would, in the normal course of a season, step over as if avoiding a fallen twig, 'certainties' have an alarming tendency to capsize. It is a trend that should lend encouragement to Aberdeen and their supporters when they take the field against Celtic at Hampden Park this afternoon in the showdown for the CIS Insurance Cup. </p> <p>If, on the other hand, they look for promising portents in the previous meetings between the teams this season, they are likely to feel like going off for a lie-down - on a railway line. Celtic's three league victories, by an aggregate score of 18-0, give the 2000 final of the competition formerly known as the Scottish League Cup the appearance of a catchweight contest, with the Parkhead side having at least a couple of stones in hand of their rivals. Yet the 9-2 freely available about the Pittodrie side is likely to bring willing takers to betting shops in the north-east, convinced that their team's resurgence since they lost 6-0 at home to Celtic on 11 December has somehow brought the protagonists much closer together.</p> <p>That may be something of an illusion. While Aberdeen have enjoyed better results than they were able to muster before the turn of the year, their performances have yet to persuade more dispassionate observers that they have improved sufficiently to warrant high expectation or a flood of optimistic wagers. Even if they have increased productivity since the midwinter break with victories that have taken them to today's final as well as the semi-finals of the Tennents Scottish Cup, their 'run' also includes a 5-0 thrashing from Rangers at Ibrox on 22 January on the only occasion they have encountered opponents of real substance. </p> <p>The last four words of the preceding paragraph indicate the other main source of hope for Aberdeen in today's final. While Celtic, even without the stricken Henrik Larsson, have frequently shown themselves to be capable of powerful performances - not only in their towering superiority over Aberdeen, but even in defeat against Rangers 11 days ago - they have, during the last few years of morale-sapping scuffling, demonstrated a singular inclination towards squandering opportunities. </p> <p>Their defeat by Raith Rovers of the First Division in the 1994 League Cup final and their failure to dispose of Falkirk, also from the lower league, in the 1997 Scottish Cup semi-final, have been the most memorable examples of a self-destructiveness which has manifested itself regularly when they have been allowed a chance to reach or even overtake Rangers at the top of the Premier League. </p> <p>Even so, failure is relative, and Celtic are made to look like all-conquering giants when their record in the last five years is set beside that of Aberdeen. Since the Pittodrie side won the 1995 renewal of the League Cup, they have lurched from one disappointment to the next, giving the impression of a club that has been mortally wounded. Paul Bernard is Aberdeen in microcosm, the midfielder's trials and tribulations coinciding precisely with the club's during this period. At \u00a31 million from Oldham Athletic, he was and remains Aberdeen's costliest player, but has spent half of his time there demented by hamstring and ankle injuries that have prevented him from attaining the standard expected by a crowd who have often been merciless in their disparagement. </p> <p>Having been signed by Roy Aitken in '95 and made the most promising start by playing in the League Cup winning team, Bernard has spent most of the years since as a target for derision, culminating in his being booed when substituted during the 5-0 defeat from Celtic at Pittodrie on the opening day of the season. 'I had taken a leg knock and had to go off and they booed me off the pitch,' said Bernard. 'I have been through quite a lot. I had only one season, the first, injury-free and it seems an eternity ago. It took a long time to get to the root of what was wrong with me and John Sharp, our physiotherapist, finally sat me down one day and told me it was going to take a full year to get me properly fit. </p> <p>'I was in a restaurant one day and a supporter shouted at me that I was happy just to take the wages and that I wasn't interested in getting fit. It's the deepest insult any player can hear. You just love playing and it's no fun being injured. But I knew where I had to go and if that's what I had to go through to get there, so be it.' </p> <p>Bernard is convinced that Roy Aitken should not have been dismissed at the end of 1997 and makes no secret of his belief that Aitken's successor, Alex Miller, helped to accelerate the decline. 'I think Alex Miller has a lot to account for, in terms of letting people go. When I joined, we had a strong squad, a good mix of youth and experience. I believe that, had the club stuck by Roy, he would have turned it around, but it's all just taken a nosedive since then.' </p> <p>Under Ebbe Skovdahl, the squad have been redrawn with a Scandinavian bias with the intention of running some steel through the core, but even that is unlikely to send shivers down the backs of the Celtic players. </p> <p>With Kenny Dalglish in charge, Celtic have a much less romantic, more pragmatic self-opinion and it is difficult to escape the impression that, if they give a performance, Aberdeen could once again be subjected to the treatment.</p>",

While Aberdeen have enjoyed better results than they were able to muster before the turn of the year, their performances have yet to persuade more dispassionate observers that they have improved sufficiently to warrant high expectation or a flood of optimistic wagers. Even if they have increased productivity since the midwinter break with victories that have taken them to today's final as well as the semi-finals of the Tennents Scottish Cup, their 'run' also includes a 5-0 thrashing from Rangers at Ibrox on 22 January on the only occasion they have encountered opponents of real substance. The last four words of the preceding paragraph indicate the other main source of hope for Aberdeen in today's final. While Celtic, even without the stricken Henrik Larsson, have frequently shown themselves to be capable of powerful performances - not only in their towering superiority over Aberdeen, but even in defeat against Rangers 11 days ago - they have, during the last few years of morale-sapping scuffling, demonstrated a singular inclination towards squandering opportunities. Their defeat by Raith Rovers of the First Division in the 1994 League Cup final and their failure to dispose of Falkirk, also from the lower league, in the 1997 Scottish Cup semi-final, have been the most memorable examples of a self-destructiveness which has manifested itself regularly when they have been allowed a chance to reach or even overtake Rangers at the top of the Premier League. Even so, failure is relative, and Celtic are made to look like all-conquering giants when their record in the last five years is set beside that of Aberdeen. Since the Pittodrie side won the 1995 renewal of the League Cup, they have lurched from one disappointment to the next, giving the impression of a club that has been mortally wounded. Paul Bernard is Aberdeen in microcosm, the midfielder's trials and tribulations coinciding precisely with the club's during this period. At \u00a31 million from Oldham Athletic, he was and remains Aberdeen's costliest player, but has spent half of his time there demented by hamstring and ankle injuries that have prevented him from attaining the standard expected by a crowd who have often been merciless in their disparagement. Having been signed by Roy Aitken in '95 and made the most promising start by playing in the League Cup winning team, Bernard has spent most of the years since as a target for derision, culminating in his being booed when substituted during the 5-0 defeat from Celtic at Pittodrie on the opening day of the season. 'I had taken a leg knock and had to go off and they booed me off the pitch,' said Bernard. 'I have been through quite a lot. I had only one season, the first, injury-free and it seems an eternity ago. It took a long time to get to the root of what was wrong with me and John Sharp, our physiotherapist, finally sat me down one day and told me it was going to take a full year to get me properly fit. 'I was in a restaurant one day and a supporter shouted at me that I was happy just to take the wages and that I wasn't interested in getting fit. It's the deepest insult any player can hear. You just love playing and it's no fun being injured. But I knew where I had to go and if that's what I had to go through to get there, so be it.' Bernard is convinced that Roy Aitken should not have been dismissed at the end of 1997 and makes no secret of his belief that Aitken's successor, Alex Miller, helped to accelerate the decline. 'I think Alex Miller has a lot to account for, in terms of letting people go. When I joined, we had a strong squad, a good mix of youth and experience. I believe that, had the club stuck by Roy, he would have turned it around, but it's all just taken a nosedive since then.' Under Ebbe Skovdahl, the squad have been redrawn with a Scandinavian bias with the intention of running some steel through the core, but even that is unlikely to send shivers down the backs of the Celtic players. With Kenny Dalglish in charge, Celtic have a much less romantic, more pragmatic self-opinion and it is difficult to escape the impression that, if they give a performance, Aberdeen could once again be subjected to the treatment.",

But why would women who like football necessarily want to watch women's football?

There is a sense in which, for all their good intentions, the FA are trying to run before they can walk. A women's football league would have the advantage of keeping young talent like Kelly Smith in England while bolstering the chances of promising youngsters like England Under-16 goalkeeper Aman Dosanj, but there is no point in building the structure without first laying the foundations. More girls than ever before are playing football but there are few established training centres for them to learn at. Southampton, which has an outstanding school of excellence run by former England player Sue Lopez, is one of the few places to nurture young female talent and in London Arsenal run a similarly successful scheme.

      "bodyText": "In the kind of derby that was never likely to slow the pulse rate, resilience was the most significant factor as Hibs overcame their early feebleness to give manager Alex McLeish the gratification that comes from an unbeaten record in the fixture. The probability of Hibs repeating their extraordinary 3-0 victory at Tynecastle had been seriously reduced by a revived Hearts, who had won five and drawn the other of their preceding six league matches. A win of any kind seemed virtually impossible the moment Jackson gave the visitors the lead. Even the least flexible of the home fans would have had difficulty in denying that, by that 25th minute, Hearts had looked the more promising side, composed in defence, compact and tidy in midfield, and quick and threatening in attack. Much of the menace came from Jackson, who is clearly distinguishable in most of the matches he plays as the one who is barracked by both sets of supporters. This derives partly from the fact that he has played for many of the clubs in opposition - including Hibs - and partly from his difficulty in establishing rapprochement with those in maroon. But, as a veteran international who has played in numerous derbies in Glasgow, Edinburgh and the North-East of England during his time with Newcastle, Jackson is not easily intimidated.

Southampton scored twice for the second week running, Kevin Davies scoring either side of half time, but this time their defence came away with their goal and pride intact. Indeed Paul Jones, the goalkeeper who was the most overworked man at White Hart Lane last week as he picked the ball out of the net seven times, did not have a save to make against a Villa side who succumbed to their first defeat in 13 games. Not surprisingly, Southampton's manager Glenn Hoddle put caution first after losing at Tottenham, and dropped the error-prone Francis Benali. Villa were without inspirational but injured captain Gareth Southgate, who was replaced by midfielder Ian Taylor in the heart of defence, and dropped striker Julian Joachim to the substitutes' bench.

Though it is mathematically possible for both clubs to avoid relegation this match was really a wooden spoon affair. </p> <p>A draw would have been something for Wednesday on a day their closest rivals lost, but when substitute Tommy Smith broke clear on the right and centred for Smart to slide in from six yards all was lost. </p> <p>The fact that a win just might lead to their Premiership survival seemed to escape Wednesday early on as they started with the urgency of a sloth on a day off. Watford made all the running and though lacking the guile to benefit from their posession they were always willing to show for the ball. </p> <p>While Wednesday manager Danny Wilson hopped from dug-out to pitchside, Watford recorded five shots on target in the first 15 minutes alone.

      "bodyText": "The living dead who inhabit Watford's Vicarage Road looked to have dragged Sheffield Wednesday down into the dark world of First Division football after Allan Smart's 88th-minute winner inflicted defeat in a game Wednesday really had to win. Though it is mathematically possible for both clubs to avoid relegation this match was really a wooden spoon affair. A draw would have been something for Wednesday on a day their closest rivals lost, but when substitute Tommy Smith broke clear on the right and centred for Smart to slide in from six yards all was lost. The fact that a win just might lead to their Premiership survival seemed to escape Wednesday early on as they started with the urgency of a sloth on a day off. Watford made all the running and though lacking the guile to benefit from their posession they were always willing to show for the ball. While Wednesday manager Danny Wilson hopped from dug-out to pitchside, Watford recorded five shots on target in the first 15 minutes alone. The best of that bunch came from Nordin Wooter, who danced into the Wednesday area to hit a shot which Pavel Srnicek fumbled before he sustaining an arm injury in blocking Heidar Helguson's follow-up effort. Wednesday's best assets were their band driven fans behind the goal they were supposed to be attacking. Watford, meanwhile were missing chances at the other end and Micah Hyde was guilty of some poor finishing when he completed a great one-two with Smart before lifting his shot over Srnicek and the crossbar from 10 yards out. Srnicek, having taken another knock to his right arm, was replaced by Kevin Pressman in the 32nd minute and, for no obvious reason, it coincided with a brief improvement in Wednesday's play going into half-time. They even hit the target for the first time when an Andy Hinchcliffe cross was met unconvincingly by Richard Cresswell's head, but it still needed a goalline clearance from Richard Johnson's chest to prevent the ball going in. Cresswell also had the first chance of the second half when a Neil Cox error allowed the Wednesday forward to run at goal. His shot was powerful too, but went inches wide as it flew into the roof of the side netting. At least Wednesday now had some fight to match Watford's bite, but the overall quality of this game remained far below what could be described as value for money entertainment.

      "trailText": "<p>Kazuo Ishiguro's new novel, When We Were Orphans, is architecturally sound but curiously furnished</p>",
      "byline": "Philip Hensher",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>When We Were Orphans</strong><br>Kazuo Ishiguro<br>Faber \u00a316.99, pp313<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502387741,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>All in all, Kazuo Ishiguro is a pretty odd novelist. His voice is studiedly anonymous, unfailingly formal and polite, even under the most dramatic circumstances. He resists and, I think, dislikes what most novelists relish, the particular concrete detail which pins down a scene to a locality and a time. He resists, too, that other most concrete element of writing - the metaphor. </p> <p>Towards the end of When We Were Orphans, it reveals itself to be a variation on Great Expectations, but a less Dickensian novelist can hardly be imagined. Dickens only constructs a plot, one feels, so that he can write about the characters' shoes, the particular colour of someone's shirt, the particular smell of a full larder. </p> <p>For Ishiguro, the particular detail is impeding and irrelevant, and, even in a costume drama like this one, the events pass in a smooth, weightless movement, undistinguished by the gritty marks of the particular fact. </p> <p>His virtues are all architectural ones. His timing and orchestration of events is practically unrivalled; in The Remains of the Day, the circling repetition of the narrator's narrow interests and the thin tone of voice are all designed to build up a weight which only cracks at the very end, when the narrator is reported as breaking down in tears. Cunningly, it is the one thing he doesn't tell us, and sets the reader off on a hunt backwards through the book, looking for other things he hasn't told us. </p> <p> The Unconsoled, his sublime and strange last novel, was an even more daring exploration of repetition and delay, a circle of frustration which only broke towards the end, with a truly overwhelming sensation of relieved grief. It was an annoying novel; what also made it a great one were the architectural uses to which it put the reader's annoyance, frustration and even boredom. </p> <p>In his previous two books, the weightless and unspecifying tone of voice was not a problem; he had carefully chosen the arena, and it would have been inappropriate to worry about the unyielding, unemotional formality of the sentences. The unreliable narrator of The Remains of the Day spoke like that because he was not quite educated and did not trust himself outside his chosen methods of expression. The beautiful, little hanging discord of the split infinitive in the last sentence is a model of expressive usage. </p> <p> The Unconsoled reads like a dream, in which the normal rules of time and space are suspended, and no dream is filled with intensely felt objects, intensely experienced physical facts. The calm reporting of the prose seemed entirely appropriate to the strange events of the book; it could not fully respond to the events, so it would set down what had happened with the simplest manner possible. </p> <p>In When We Were Orphans, the manner has, I think, become a problem. Again, the book has many virtues: it is surely developed and extended; it is full of ingenious variation; it builds to an admirable and satisfying climax. Its virtues, in short, are all architectural ones. It starts to present a problem when we look at the voice, the sentences, which, in the context, will not do at all. </p> <p>Christopher Banks is a fashionable society detective, solving fashionably ghastly crimes in 1930s England. In his past, however, there is an unsolved and traumatic crime which continues to torment him. He was brought up in Shanghai, with a father heavily involved in Western complicity in the importation of opium and a mother who campaigned fiercely against the trade. His parents crossed a major warlord, Wang Ku, and disappeared. Banks travels back to Shanghai, now riven by the Sino-Japanese war, and descends into the ruins of the city, searching hopelessly for the place where his parents might, just, still be held captive. </p> <p>Personal trauma as the world falls apart is classic Ishiguro territory, and in many ways he seizes the drama with both hands. It is striking how the ghastly 1930s shocker at the beginning moves into something altogether deeper as the book progresses. </p> <p>The single problem with the book is the prose, which, for the first time, is so lacking in local colour as to be entirely inappropriate to the task in hand. One can't only admire a book's structure. </p> <p>There is something troubling about Ishiguro's prose style that took me a while to pin down, and it's this - he hardly ever uses a phrasal verb. He is a writer who always prefers to say 'depart' rather than 'set off', 'discover' rather than 'find out'. Phrasal verbs are, in a way, at the heart of English; they are a part of the language which presents peculiar difficulty to the learner, since there is no logic whatever in their meaning, and they hardly ever resemble anything in another language. </p> <p>A Frenchman, learning English, would soon see the connection between 'discover' and 'd\u00e9couvrir'; 'find out', on the other hand, would seem to him like an exotic and irrational expression, which, despite its being more idiomatic, he might well choose to avoid.

      "bodyText": "When We Were Orphans Kazuo Ishiguro Faber \u00a316.99, pp313 Buy it at BOL All in all, Kazuo Ishiguro is a pretty odd novelist. His voice is studiedly anonymous, unfailingly formal and polite, even under the most dramatic circumstances. He resists and, I think, dislikes what most novelists relish, the particular concrete detail which pins down a scene to a locality and a time. He resists, too, that other most concrete element of writing - the metaphor. Towards the end of When We Were Orphans, it reveals itself to be a variation on Great Expectations, but a less Dickensian novelist can hardly be imagined. Dickens only constructs a plot, one feels, so that he can write about the characters' shoes, the particular colour of someone's shirt, the particular smell of a full larder. For Ishiguro, the particular detail is impeding and irrelevant, and, even in a costume drama like this one, the events pass in a smooth, weightless movement, undistinguished by the gritty marks of the particular fact. His virtues are all architectural ones. His timing and orchestration of events is practically unrivalled; in The Remains of the Day, the circling repetition of the narrator's narrow interests and the thin tone of voice are all designed to build up a weight which only cracks at the very end, when the narrator is reported as breaking down in tears. Cunningly, it is the one thing he doesn't tell us, and sets the reader off on a hunt backwards through the book, looking for other things he hasn't told us. The Unconsoled, his sublime and strange last novel, was an even more daring exploration of repetition and delay, a circle of frustration which only broke towards the end, with a truly overwhelming sensation of relieved grief. It was an annoying novel; what also made it a great one were the architectural uses to which it put the reader's annoyance, frustration and even boredom. In his previous two books, the weightless and unspecifying tone of voice was not a problem; he had carefully chosen the arena, and it would have been inappropriate to worry about the unyielding, unemotional formality of the sentences. The unreliable narrator of The Remains of the Day spoke like that because he was not quite educated and did not trust himself outside his chosen methods of expression. The beautiful, little hanging discord of the split infinitive in the last sentence is a model of expressive usage. The Unconsoled reads like a dream, in which the normal rules of time and space are suspended, and no dream is filled with intensely felt objects, intensely experienced physical facts. The calm reporting of the prose seemed entirely appropriate to the strange events of the book; it could not fully respond to the events, so it would set down what had happened with the simplest manner possible. In When We Were Orphans, the manner has, I think, become a problem. Again, the book has many virtues: it is surely developed and extended; it is full of ingenious variation; it builds to an admirable and satisfying climax. Its virtues, in short, are all architectural ones. It starts to present a problem when we look at the voice, the sentences, which, in the context, will not do at all. Christopher Banks is a fashionable society detective, solving fashionably ghastly crimes in 1930s England. In his past, however, there is an unsolved and traumatic crime which continues to torment him. He was brought up in Shanghai, with a father heavily involved in Western complicity in the importation of opium and a mother who campaigned fiercely against the trade. His parents crossed a major warlord, Wang Ku, and disappeared. Banks travels back to Shanghai, now riven by the Sino-Japanese war, and descends into the ruins of the city, searching hopelessly for the place where his parents might, just, still be held captive. Personal trauma as the world falls apart is classic Ishiguro territory, and in many ways he seizes the drama with both hands. It is striking how the ghastly 1930s shocker at the beginning moves into something altogether deeper as the book progresses. The single problem with the book is the prose, which, for the first time, is so lacking in local colour as to be entirely inappropriate to the task in hand. One can't only admire a book's structure. There is something troubling about Ishiguro's prose style that took me a while to pin down, and it's this - he hardly ever uses a phrasal verb. He is a writer who always prefers to say 'depart' rather than 'set off', 'discover' rather than 'find out'. Phrasal verbs are, in a way, at the heart of English; they are a part of the language which presents peculiar difficulty to the learner, since there is no logic whatever in their meaning, and they hardly ever resemble anything in another language. A Frenchman, learning English, would soon see the connection between 'discover' and 'd\u00e9couvrir'; 'find out', on the other hand, would seem to him like an exotic and irrational expression, which, despite its being more idiomatic, he might well choose to avoid. There is no logic to them; why 'get on with' and 'get off with' should mean what they do, rather than the other way round, cannot be justified, and yet they are at the heart of the spoken language. Ishiguro's avoidance of phrasal verbs is a major problem here - it gives his narrator a circumlocutious, cautious air which isn't really very helpful. More than that, it gives him a particular tone of voice which is not that of his social setting. It is bizarrely unconvincing as an idea of upper-middle-class London in the 1930s - I think Ishiguro will find that society beauties did not say 'pardon' then and do not now - and the inadequacy can be pinned down to the narrator's voice, and his choice of verbs, as much as the details. Here he is on his new digs: 'Although at that point I had yet to receive a single visitor in my rooms, I issued my invitation with confidence, having chosen the premises with some care. The rent was not high, but my landlady had furnished the place in a tasteful manner that evoked an unhurried Victorian past.' Receive, issue, furnish, evoke; Christopher Banks tells us that he is a 'society detective', but he sounds exactly like a policeman. Or, to be unkind, like a butler. Of course, there are splendid things in it; the games and huge terrors of a Shanghai childhood. Or the horrific descent into the lawless slums as Banks searches for his kidnapped parents, only partly marred by the way the prose will not budge an inch from its superb, unfeeling immaculacy: 'Most annoyingly, my right shoe had split apart, and my foot was badly gashed, causing a searing pain to rise with each step.' The resolution is moving and graceful, but the problem of the voice is a universal one, present and incredible in every sentence.",

      "body": "<p> It's Valentine's Day and Julianne Moore is running late. At 1.14pm, after a press conference for Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia was due to begin, the scowling head of the Berlin Film Festival made a solemn announcement to waiting reporters. Ms Moore, he said, was still in her hotel room and wouldn't be with us for some time. She was having her hair done, he sighed. </p> <p>But why was our German friend surprised? Moore is no longer just a performer, nor even an artist. She is a movie star . (With all the necessary hair care which that entails.) This transition has happened almost imperceptibly. One minute she was a repertory player in arty ensemble films such as Robert Altman's Short Cuts, Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights and her partner Bart Freundlich's The Myth Of Fingerprints; then suddenly she went overground, playing opposite Ralph Fiennes in The End Of The Affair and gathering an impressive best actress Oscar nomination for her efforts. A barometer of her appeal is that Moore's 'beauty regime' warranted a two-page spread in a recent issue of the National Enquirer. </p> <p>When she finally made her entrance in Berlin, Moore was rapturously received and her hair, of course, was perfect. Midway through, a smartly dressed European took the microphone - but he didn't have a question. 'Julianne? Mrs Julianne Moore?' he began in faltering English. 'You know today is the Valentine's Day, no? I have a present for you - because you are so nice .' Approaching the podium, he handed her a giant, heart-shaped red balloon. There was laughter, applause, and the actress blushed. </p> <p>Because, for now, Julianne Moore is one of America's sweethearts. So when Jodie Foster announced her decision to bow out of Hannibal , the long-awaited sequel to The Silence of The Lambs, to be directed by Ridley Scott, it seemed perfectly logical that Moore would make the short list. And it also reflects our rather perverse fascination with serious crime. Looking at the other names considered for the role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, the plucky young hick who develops a dangerous empathy with jailed murderer Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter, there's a curious consistency. Gillian Anderson, Hilary Swank. Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow. The keywords here seem to be intelligent, vulnerable, fearless and - most important of all - beautiful. </p> <p>Foster's decision to drop out, ostensibly to direct the more personal Flora's Plum, has prompted a lot of rumours about the production. First, that she was asking too much (some where in the Travolta league of $20 million plus). Then it was said she found the novel too disturbing and wanted to change Harris's surreal ending (in which Clarice goes native, so to speak), supposedly to the writer's annoyance. Then there was the matter of the script, finished last autumn by playwright David Mamet, in the gap between directing The Winslow Boy and State Of Maine, and given a subsequent polish by Schindler's List writer Steve Zail lian. Reports suggest that Foster perhaps felt the balance of power had shifted, and that the actress wasn't about to let Clarice take a back seat to the now-showboating Lecter. </p> <p>Moore, who announced she was 'very, very excited' about the role while negotiations were being finalised during her time in Berlin, does not seem fazed by following in Foster's footsteps. Which is brave, because there really doesn't seem to be much of a precedent. Sequels are usually commissioned for their stars, not their characters, as a quick glance at the roster of movie franchises shows: Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Scream. One of the rare exceptions is RoboCop, which found a new star for its third instalment, though few saw beyond the leading man's full-face helmet to realise it wasn't Peter Weller. In fact, the only recent examples of actors given the challenge of facing comparison with their predecessors is in the world of the prequel: for example, Robert De Niro succeeding Marlon Brando as the young Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II, or Ewan McGregor donning Alec Guiness's mantle to play the young Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars Episode 1. </p> <p> On second glance, it would seem the Hannibal cycle has more in common with the Bond franchise; indeed, when Jonathan Demme's adaptation of The Silence Of The Lambs swept the 1991 Oscars, nobody seemed too concerned that Lecter had already made his big-screen debut some five years before in Michael Mann's Manhunter, an adaptation of Harris's second book, Red Dragon. Here, Lecter was played by Brian Cox, a bigger, arguably more masculine alternative to Anthony Hopkins's gentrified performance. The two Lecters both have their fans, both very different in their attitudes to the two films, but - interestingly - their success is simply a matter of preference. </p> <p>Because, going back to Harris's original novels, there really is no blueprint for the definitive Lecter. Refer to chapter seven of Red Dragon , in which Detective Will Graham first visits Lecter (Mann inexplicably changed the name to Lecktor for the film adaptation) in the Chesapeake State Hospital For The Criminally Insane. Harris tells us little or nothing about Lecter, except that 'his eyes are maroon and they reflect the light redly in tiny points'. His only elaboration is that he 'is a small, lithe man. Very neat.' Compare this with chapter two of The Silence Of The Lambs : '[Clarice] could see that he was small, sleek; in his hands and arms she saw wiry strength like her own.' And a paragraph later: 'Dr Lecter's eyes are maroon and they reflect the light in pinpoints of red.' </p> <p>Which brings us to Clarice Starling. When the young FBI agent makes her entrance, all we know is that she has 'grass in her hair and grass stains on her FBI Academy windbreaker from diving to the ground under fire in an arrest problem on the range'. Harris deliberately doesn't give us too many physical clues as to Clarice's identity - this he leaves to Lecter, who famously dissects her personality during their first, tense meeting. Instead, we get a mental image of Clarice in which only her strengths and weaknesses really register, and if Moore is smart, she presumably understands that Clarice and Dr Lecter have a life beyond their actors. </p> <p>Put simply, Harris's trilogy is an archetypal modern fable, a timeless beauty and the beast saga. And just as Hannibal's physical attributes are irrelevant to this intellectual King Kong, so are Clarice Starling's. It's her mind that matters and her mind we care about, so it's no accident that only a certain type of actress could fit the bill. By way of illustration, the Hannibal short list was a select and prestigious elite - a far cry from the hullabaloo surrounding the casting of Charlie's Angels , in which every actress in Hollywood, from Jennifer Lopez to Catherine Zeta Jones, was said to be joining Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz for the camp action romp. </p> <p> That the part went to the relatively smalltime TV star Lucy Liu speaks volumes. In the hands of Ridley Scott, Hannibal was never going to go that far downmarket. Because Scott, director of post-feminist Western Thelma And Louise , would undoubtedly know that the part of Hannibal Lecter's bloody valentine would be a magnet to some of Hollywood's most sophisticated actresses. </p> <p>'Good roles for women are very hard to come by,' Moore told reporters in Berlin, 'because obviously the film business is based on economics. It's not interested in making movies about people and ideas, it's usually about things exploding and spending lots of money.' </p> <p>When the $70m Hannibal starts shooting in May, Moore will pick up her biggest pay-cheque yet, said to be around the $3m mark (but still only a fraction of Hopkins's salary). With Clarice Starling she may have found the perfect balance between commerce and art. The part is intelligent, accessible and, best of all, lucrative. Just right for any actress who wants to have her cake - or should that be pound of flesh? - and eat it. </p> <p><strong>Foster and Moore: a tale of two Starlings </strong></p> <p> <strong>Jodie Foster </strong></p> <p> <strong> Age:</strong> 37 </p> <p> <strong> Number of films made: </strong> 32 </p> <p><strong> Awards:</strong> Best actress Oscars for The Accused and The Silence of The Lambs .

Gillian Anderson, Hilary Swank. Angelina Jolie, Cate Blanchett, Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow. The keywords here seem to be intelligent, vulnerable, fearless and - most important of all - beautiful. Foster's decision to drop out, ostensibly to direct the more personal Flora's Plum, has prompted a lot of rumours about the production. First, that she was asking too much (some where in the Travolta league of $20 million plus). Then it was said she found the novel too disturbing and wanted to change Harris's surreal ending (in which Clarice goes native, so to speak), supposedly to the writer's annoyance. Then there was the matter of the script, finished last autumn by playwright David Mamet, in the gap between directing The Winslow Boy and State Of Maine, and given a subsequent polish by Schindler's List writer Steve Zail lian. Reports suggest that Foster perhaps felt the balance of power had shifted, and that the actress wasn't about to let Clarice take a back seat to the now-showboating Lecter. Moore, who announced she was 'very, very excited' about the role while negotiations were being finalised during her time in Berlin, does not seem fazed by following in Foster's footsteps. Which is brave, because there really doesn't seem to be much of a precedent. Sequels are usually commissioned for their stars, not their characters, as a quick glance at the roster of movie franchises shows: Lethal Weapon, Die Hard, Scream. One of the rare exceptions is RoboCop, which found a new star for its third instalment, though few saw beyond the leading man's full-face helmet to realise it wasn't Peter Weller. In fact, the only recent examples of actors given the challenge of facing comparison with their predecessors is in the world of the prequel: for example, Robert De Niro succeeding Marlon Brando as the young Don Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II, or Ewan McGregor donning Alec Guiness's mantle to play the young Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars Episode 1. On second glance, it would seem the Hannibal cycle has more in common with the Bond franchise; indeed, when Jonathan Demme's adaptation of The Silence Of The Lambs swept the 1991 Oscars, nobody seemed too concerned that Lecter had already made his big-screen debut some five years before in Michael Mann's Manhunter, an adaptation of Harris's second book, Red Dragon. Here, Lecter was played by Brian Cox, a bigger, arguably more masculine alternative to Anthony Hopkins's gentrified performance. The two Lecters both have their fans, both very different in their attitudes to the two films, but - interestingly - their success is simply a matter of preference. Because, going back to Harris's original novels, there really is no blueprint for the definitive Lecter. Refer to chapter seven of Red Dragon , in which Detective Will Graham first visits Lecter (Mann inexplicably changed the name to Lecktor for the film adaptation) in the Chesapeake State Hospital For The Criminally Insane. Harris tells us little or nothing about Lecter, except that 'his eyes are maroon and they reflect the light redly in tiny points'. His only elaboration is that he 'is a small, lithe man. Very neat.' Compare this with chapter two of The Silence Of The Lambs : '[Clarice] could see that he was small, sleek; in his hands and arms she saw wiry strength like her own.' And a paragraph later: 'Dr Lecter's eyes are maroon and they reflect the light in pinpoints of red.' Which brings us to Clarice Starling. When the young FBI agent makes her entrance, all we know is that she has 'grass in her hair and grass stains on her FBI Academy windbreaker from diving to the ground under fire in an arrest problem on the range'. Harris deliberately doesn't give us too many physical clues as to Clarice's identity - this he leaves to Lecter, who famously dissects her personality during their first, tense meeting. Instead, we get a mental image of Clarice in which only her strengths and weaknesses really register, and if Moore is smart, she presumably understands that Clarice and Dr Lecter have a life beyond their actors. Put simply, Harris's trilogy is an archetypal modern fable, a timeless beauty and the beast saga. And just as Hannibal's physical attributes are irrelevant to this intellectual King Kong, so are Clarice Starling's. It's her mind that matters and her mind we care about, so it's no accident that only a certain type of actress could fit the bill. By way of illustration, the Hannibal short list was a select and prestigious elite - a far cry from the hullabaloo surrounding the casting of Charlie's Angels , in which every actress in Hollywood, from Jennifer Lopez to Catherine Zeta Jones, was said to be joining Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz for the camp action romp. That the part went to the relatively smalltime TV star Lucy Liu speaks volumes. In the hands of Ridley Scott, Hannibal was never going to go that far downmarket. Because Scott, director of post-feminist Western Thelma And Louise , would undoubtedly know that the part of Hannibal Lecter's bloody valentine would be a magnet to some of Hollywood's most sophisticated actresses. 'Good roles for women are very hard to come by,' Moore told reporters in Berlin, 'because obviously the film business is based on economics. It's not interested in making movies about people and ideas, it's usually about things exploding and spending lots of money.' When the $70m Hannibal starts shooting in May, Moore will pick up her biggest pay-cheque yet, said to be around the $3m mark (but still only a fraction of Hopkins's salary). With Clarice Starling she may have found the perfect balance between commerce and art. The part is intelligent, accessible and, best of all, lucrative. Just right for any actress who wants to have her cake - or should that be pound of flesh? - and eat it. Foster and Moore: a tale of two Starlings Jodie Foster Age: 37 Number of films made: 32 Awards: Best actress Oscars for The Accused and The Silence of The Lambs . Also nominated for Nell and Taxi Driver (best supporting actress). Career breakthrough: Playing streetwise teenage prostitute in Taxi Driver. On Clarice Starling: 'I don't feel like I own her, but I know everything about her. She's the most specific character I've ever played. She's the kind of person if you said, \"Would she wear an orange miniskirt?\" I know exactly what the answer is.' Others on Foster: 'If God had designed a perfect acting machine it would be pretty close to Jodie,' says Jon Amiel who directed her in Sommersby . Also known as: BLT - 'Bossy Little Thing'. The nickname was devised by Jonathan Kaplan, director of The Accused . Julianne Moore Age: 39 Number of films made: 23 Awards: Current best actress Oscar nominee for role in The End of the Affair, previously nominated for supporting role in Boogie Nights. Career breakthrough : As Annabella Sciorra's acerbic best friend in The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. On Clarice Starling: 'I'm not going to do what Jodie did. She's a great actor, it was a magnificent performance, there's no way I'm going to duplicate it. There's no sense in even thinking about it.' Others on Moore: 'She does it all. She's an artist. When one speaks of Julianne Moore, it's like speaking of Bette Davis,' says Robert Altman who directed her in Short Cuts . Also known as: The Hardest Working Woman in Hollywood. Last year she starred in five films: Cookie's Fortune, An Ideal Husband, A Map of the World, Magnolia and The End of the Affair.",

Since then, the shares of Freeserve, Psion and Kingston Communications have plummeted by more than a third, and even Baltimore Technology has lost more than 10 per cent of its value. </p> <p>That has been mirrored by a revival in the fortunes of those who made way for the upstarts - bastions of the old economy such as Imperial Tobacco, Hanson and even bread and sugar producer Associated British Foods, whose shares recovered by as much as 15 per cent. </p> <p>That trend was repeated across the markets in both Britain and the US. In London, the Techmark 100 index of leading technology stocks is more than 15 per cent down on its peak, while Nasdaq, its US equivalent, has dropped more than 5 per cent. The FTSE 100 - which does not officially welcome the new entrants until tomorrow - and the Dow Jones surged. </p> <p>So far, the decline in technology shares is little more than a puff of air escaping from the balloon: even after last week's fall, the Nasdaq has doubled in little over a year; Techmark has done the same in less than six months. </p> <p>But is it a portent of a bigger shake-out to come? There are still few commentators prepared to predict that a technology crash will happen, let alone when it will come - although practically everyone agrees they look dramatically over-valued. Likewise, although everyone agrees there are real bargains among shares in the old economy, no one is expecting them to power ahead. </p> <p>Statistics from Warburg Dillon Reed illustrate how the new economy has come to dominate the market: stripping out technology stocks, the FTSE 100 index has fallen by more than 20 per cent in the past decade, most of that decline in the past three years. </p> <p>'The gap between old and new economy stocks is now too stretched,' said Steve Russell, strategist with HSBC. 'But remember that the technology revolution is for real. We recommend that people switch from the broad-brush approach of thinking, if its technology you have got to have it, and get into the winners and out of the losers.'He admits that, like everyone else, he has no idea who these will be - and even if he did, they would already be on stratospheric valuations. </p> <p>'The best guide is to look for companies with barriers to entry. On the Internet, there are none. In software and telecoms, there are strong barriers.' </p> <p>'Vodafone and perhaps Sema do have a chance of justifying their valuations.' </p> <p>Ian Scott of Lehman Brothers thinks these stratospheric valuations have put the British market out of line with the US. 'Nasdaq is up 16 per cent so far this year, while the [similar] European Neuermarkt has risen 76 per cent. It has not been appreciated how much bigger the rotation [from old to new economy stocks] has been in Europe compared with the US.' </p> <p>He points to specific sectors, such as telecoms - where European shares have jumped by 26.5 per cent so far this year, compared with a 7.1 per cent fall in the US - and media, which has almost doubled here but fallen by a quarter in the US. He believes there could be some selling of new economy stock, such as Reuters, which has risen 70 per cent this year, far faster than any of its US peers. Some attribute the decline in technology stocks to the flotation of lastminute.com. Despite scepticism in the City, it was comfortably subscribed, but those who bought hoping for a quick profit were disappointed as the shares fell sharply during the week. </p> <p>'It is unlikely that either institutions or private investors will see it as a one -way bet any longer,' said HSBC's Russell. </p> <p>Dissatisfaction with the lastminute.com flotation, coupled with share price weakness, has already produced casualties. Financial Objects, another technology company, has scrapped a flotation planned for next week. </p> <p>Last week's flurry of interest in old-economy stocks went only a little way to reversing more than year of declines in their shares. But analysts warn that not all cheap stocks are bargains. </p> <p>Michael O'Sullivan of Warburg Dillon Reed points to companies with consistently good results and strong positions in their markets, such as GKN, the engineer, CRH and BAe. </p> <p>He likes technology stocks but says: 'As for Freeserve and lastminute.com, we say waitaminute.com.' </p> <p>HSBC's Russell looks for industries unlikely to be changed by the Internet , such as life assurance, drinks and food firms: 'It is difficult to see how the Internet can stop people eating and drinking.'</p>",

That has been mirrored by a revival in the fortunes of those who made way for the upstarts - bastions of the old economy such as Imperial Tobacco, Hanson and even bread and sugar producer Associated British Foods, whose shares recovered by as much as 15 per cent. That trend was repeated across the markets in both Britain and the US. In London, the Techmark 100 index of leading technology stocks is more than 15 per cent down on its peak, while Nasdaq, its US equivalent, has dropped more than 5 per cent. The FTSE 100 - which does not officially welcome the new entrants until tomorrow - and the Dow Jones surged. So far, the decline in technology shares is little more than a puff of air escaping from the balloon: even after last week's fall, the Nasdaq has doubled in little over a year; Techmark has done the same in less than six months. But is it a portent of a bigger shake-out to come? There are still few commentators prepared to predict that a technology crash will happen, let alone when it will come - although practically everyone agrees they look dramatically over-valued. Likewise, although everyone agrees there are real bargains among shares in the old economy, no one is expecting them to power ahead. Statistics from Warburg Dillon Reed illustrate how the new economy has come to dominate the market: stripping out technology stocks, the FTSE 100 index has fallen by more than 20 per cent in the past decade, most of that decline in the past three years. 'The gap between old and new economy stocks is now too stretched,' said Steve Russell, strategist with HSBC. 'But remember that the technology revolution is for real. We recommend that people switch from the broad-brush approach of thinking, if its technology you have got to have it, and get into the winners and out of the losers.'He admits that, like everyone else, he has no idea who these will be - and even if he did, they would already be on stratospheric valuations. 'The best guide is to look for companies with barriers to entry. On the Internet, there are none. In software and telecoms, there are strong barriers.' 'Vodafone and perhaps Sema do have a chance of justifying their valuations.' Ian Scott of Lehman Brothers thinks these stratospheric valuations have put the British market out of line with the US. 'Nasdaq is up 16 per cent so far this year, while the [similar] European Neuermarkt has risen 76 per cent. It has not been appreciated how much bigger the rotation [from old to new economy stocks] has been in Europe compared with the US.' He points to specific sectors, such as telecoms - where European shares have jumped by 26.5 per cent so far this year, compared with a 7.1 per cent fall in the US - and media, which has almost doubled here but fallen by a quarter in the US. He believes there could be some selling of new economy stock, such as Reuters, which has risen 70 per cent this year, far faster than any of its US peers. Some attribute the decline in technology stocks to the flotation of lastminute.com. Despite scepticism in the City, it was comfortably subscribed, but those who bought hoping for a quick profit were disappointed as the shares fell sharply during the week. 'It is unlikely that either institutions or private investors will see it as a one -way bet any longer,' said HSBC's Russell. Dissatisfaction with the lastminute.com flotation, coupled with share price weakness, has already produced casualties. Financial Objects, another technology company, has scrapped a flotation planned for next week. Last week's flurry of interest in old-economy stocks went only a little way to reversing more than year of declines in their shares. But analysts warn that not all cheap stocks are bargains. Michael O'Sullivan of Warburg Dillon Reed points to companies with consistently good results and strong positions in their markets, such as GKN, the engineer, CRH and BAe. He likes technology stocks but says: 'As for Freeserve and lastminute.com, we say waitaminute.com.' HSBC's Russell looks for industries unlikely to be changed by the Internet , such as life assurance, drinks and food firms: 'It is difficult to see how the Internet can stop people eating and drinking.'",

No more the sage of the snug, he came cloaked as a moral philosopher.

To summarise his essay into ethics, taxation is the greatest evil to stalk our pestilential land. 'High taxes mean less freedom, less responsibility, less community, more dependency, a less elevated human condition,' he argued. 'Taxes are the enemy, not the friend, of all that binds society together.'</p> <p>My first reaction was suspicious. When politicians preach morality, I count my change. The Conservatives want tax to be the battleground of the next election and they want to fight the contest as the party promising to slash and burn.

Hague alluded to this difficulty: 'Conservatives need to show that the reason we want to cut taxes is not about crude electoral politics.' Conversations with intimates of the Tory leader confirm that I was not wrong to suspect that crude electoral politics is precisely what lies behind much of this. Dressing tax cuts in the language of morality is designed to make people feel better about voting Tory. It's not just good for your bank balance, it's a ticket to heaven.</p> <p>My second thought - which led me to more alarming conclusions about the Tory leader - is that he may also sincerely believe it when he says that lower tax makes a country more moral. He asserts: 'Taxes lie at the heart of state interference in our life.' Should his house ever catch fire, presumably Mr Hague would not dial 999 for the fire brigade on the basis that it would be state interference in his life. Should he ever be so unfortunate as to suffer a heart attack, presumably he would not want anyone to summon an ambulance on the basis that it would be state interference in his death.</p> <p>He seems to believe in some provision of public services. Shamelessly, in the very same speech, Hague complained of 'gridlocked' roads, 'falling' police numbers, and an NHS in 'crisis'. The Tory leader did not vouchsafe to us how he would spend large sums improving these services while simultaneously leading Britain towards his no-tax nirvana. Perhaps the idea is that Chancellor Portillo will be sent out to rattle a tin on the streets. Among his more feeble contentions, Hague claimed that people would give their tax cuts to charities. He did not adduce any evidence that this has ever happened in Britain - because there is none. The tax cutting by the Thatcher Governments did not result in the newly enriched gratefully cascading all their wealth in the direction of the Save The Children Fund. Those who employ offshore tax havens and multi-nationals which arrange their affairs to make themselves less liable for tax are rarely synonymous with generous philanthropy. Even if he were right, and people gave away all their tax cuts to charity rather than spending them on consumer goodies, he would still be wrong. Admirable organisation though it is, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is not designed to take over the functions of the Department of Environment.</p> <p>For the benefit of Mr Hague, let us go back to first principles. Taxation is the subscription we pay to live in a civilised society. There was no Inland Revenue in Stone-Age Britain; there was precious little morality either. The tax take in advanced industrial democracies fluctuates between a third and a half of national income. It is at the high end of the spectrum in Scandinavia, where they place a premium on social solidarity, and at the low end in the United States, where they invest their emphasis on individualism. There are some disadvantages to being a Swede or a Finn, but you are a lot less likely than an American to be mugged, or raped. And your six-year-old child is much less likely to be shot dead by a classmate. Which would the leader of the Tory Party say was the more moral place?</p> <p>Tax provides those things that are more efficiently delivered by the state - or which only the state can deliver. There are serious arguments to be had about where the frontier should be drawn between public and private. They are technical debates, even ideological disputes, but they are not moral arguments. Tax buys insurance against catastrophic personal loss or crisis. For more than 50 years there has been a consensus in Britain that, for most people, the NHS is the worst way of delivering health care - except for all the other ones. If the Tories want to take the American road, in which those who can afford it pay exorbitant sums for private insurance, and everyone else is left to the untender mercies of sink services, then they should say so. Tax can also be a lever to alter human behaviour - and here Mr Hague suddenly discovers a use for it. He says he would encourage families to stay together with tax breaks for the married, which means relatively higher taxes for those who aren't. It is a pitifully low view of human nature that believes people will love each other, and can be made to stay loving each other, by bunging them a few extra quid. 'Not tonight, darling.' 'But William Hague says he will restore the married couples' allowance.' 'Oh, alright then.'</p> <p>Where there is an ethical area of dispute over tax, it is about the extent to which the state should take resources from the wealthier to transfer them to the poorer. For sensible people, this is an argument about degrees rather than absolutes. All tax systems the world over - even Mr Hague's God blessed America - accept that the rich have obligations to the poor. The Left has historically regarded redistribution as a good in itself. The insight of New Labour, however imperfectly realised so far, is that this doesn't have to mean simply dolloping out benefits. Money can often be more effectively deployed to provide incentives and skills for the less well-off so that they have a stake in and make a contribution to a dynamic and prosperous society.</p> <p>Tories have always previously accepted a redistributive role for the tax system. Even Margaret Thatcher kept a higher rate for higher earners. If only from enlightened self-interest, pre-Hague Conservatives have recognised that grossly unequal societies are disfigured and dysfunctional.</p> <p>William Hague may seriously believe what he says, in which case he is a sillier man than I took him for. Doing him the credit of not being stupid, I am driven back to my first reaction to his 'moral case'. It is an exercise in cynicism. Vote for tax cuts and win a William Hague halo. If he is a philosopher of any kind, it is of the saloon bar.</p>",

Those who employ offshore tax havens and multi-nationals which arrange their affairs to make themselves less liable for tax are rarely synonymous with generous philanthropy. Even if he were right, and people gave away all their tax cuts to charity rather than spending them on consumer goodies, he would still be wrong. Admirable organisation though it is, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is not designed to take over the functions of the Department of Environment. For the benefit of Mr Hague, let us go back to first principles. Taxation is the subscription we pay to live in a civilised society. There was no Inland Revenue in Stone-Age Britain; there was precious little morality either. The tax take in advanced industrial democracies fluctuates between a third and a half of national income. It is at the high end of the spectrum in Scandinavia, where they place a premium on social solidarity, and at the low end in the United States, where they invest their emphasis on individualism. There are some disadvantages to being a Swede or a Finn, but you are a lot less likely than an American to be mugged, or raped. And your six-year-old child is much less likely to be shot dead by a classmate. Which would the leader of the Tory Party say was the more moral place? Tax provides those things that are more efficiently delivered by the state - or which only the state can deliver. There are serious arguments to be had about where the frontier should be drawn between public and private. They are technical debates, even ideological disputes, but they are not moral arguments. Tax buys insurance against catastrophic personal loss or crisis. For more than 50 years there has been a consensus in Britain that, for most people, the NHS is the worst way of delivering health care - except for all the other ones. If the Tories want to take the American road, in which those who can afford it pay exorbitant sums for private insurance, and everyone else is left to the untender mercies of sink services, then they should say so. Tax can also be a lever to alter human behaviour - and here Mr Hague suddenly discovers a use for it. He says he would encourage families to stay together with tax breaks for the married, which means relatively higher taxes for those who aren't. It is a pitifully low view of human nature that believes people will love each other, and can be made to stay loving each other, by bunging them a few extra quid. 'Not tonight, darling.' 'But William Hague says he will restore the married couples' allowance.' 'Oh, alright then.' Where there is an ethical area of dispute over tax, it is about the extent to which the state should take resources from the wealthier to transfer them to the poorer. For sensible people, this is an argument about degrees rather than absolutes. All tax systems the world over - even Mr Hague's God blessed America - accept that the rich have obligations to the poor. The Left has historically regarded redistribution as a good in itself. The insight of New Labour, however imperfectly realised so far, is that this doesn't have to mean simply dolloping out benefits. Money can often be more effectively deployed to provide incentives and skills for the less well-off so that they have a stake in and make a contribution to a dynamic and prosperous society. Tories have always previously accepted a redistributive role for the tax system. Even Margaret Thatcher kept a higher rate for higher earners. If only from enlightened self-interest, pre-Hague Conservatives have recognised that grossly unequal societies are disfigured and dysfunctional. William Hague may seriously believe what he says, in which case he is a sillier man than I took him for. Doing him the credit of not being stupid, I am driven back to my first reaction to his 'moral case'. It is an exercise in cynicism. Vote for tax cuts and win a William Hague halo. If he is a philosopher of any kind, it is of the saloon bar.",

The site has been revised several times, with the aim of making it increasingly comfortable for customers to complete transactions quickly and efficiently. </p> <p>Executive director Paul Kafka says: 'Our aim has always been to convince customers that their business is best handled through Fidelity. To achieve that we have invested heavily for the past seven years in technology - more recently in Internet technology - and that commitment is ongoing. </p> <p>'It's an essential part of building trust between us and the customers.

      "bodyText": "The award for best customer service on a financial services Internet site went to Fidelity, the UK's largest independent seller of equity-based Isas and second-largest unit trust/Oeic manager, with a range of 35 onshore funds. Worldwide, Fidelity is the largest independent fund management organisation with over \u00a3536 billion under management for more than 15 million clients. It set up in the UK in 1979, and was the first company to go into the Pep market, in 1987, and, later, one of the first to offer Isas. Fidelity launched its website (www.fidelity.co.uk in 1996. The site has been revised several times, with the aim of making it increasingly comfortable for customers to complete transactions quickly and efficiently. Executive director Paul Kafka says: 'Our aim has always been to convince customers that their business is best handled through Fidelity. To achieve that we have invested heavily for the past seven years in technology - more recently in Internet technology - and that commitment is ongoing. 'It's an essential part of building trust between us and the customers. We are huge believers in the Internet as the key to giving customers the power to control their own finances both now and in the future, and our objective is to achieve that more and more comprehensively.' An important point of change for Fidelity and its customers was 6 April last year when, for the first time, the Government gave the go ahead for investors to open and operate Isas by electronic signature. Now individual investors can open an Isa from scratch via Fidelity's website and access and operate their account 24 hours a day, seven days a week, using its state-of-the-art WebXpress service.

The Fidelity site also gives customers access to online educative texts explaining the basics of Isas, building a portfolio and so on.

Here investors will be able to review funds across the whole market, buying and selling online as they wish with a discount on unit purchases. Around 30,000 of Fidelity's million UK customers now operate their accounts online, and that number is growing fast, with one in five Isas now opened online. Behind the scene, some 1,100 staff in systems and customer support serve Fidelity's web-based customers.

In the 60 tables published, Equitable has appeared in the top 10 on 47 occasions, more than any rival. The record of the Equitable's Personal Pension Plan is highlighted in annual pensions surveys by trade journal Money Management . It is one of only two companies to have won a five-star 'best buy personal pension' award in every survey. The flexibility of the plan stems from the fact that it is effectively structured as a series of recurrent single-premium contracts. 'This means that each premium buys its own separate piece of benefit, so you can pay what you like when you like and not be penalised if you don't follow a set payment pattern,' Dunbar says. Similarly, plan holders can retire when they choose without giving a prearranged retirement date or paying a financial penalty.",

      "body": "<p>I sent an email round my colleagues saying, 'Remind me why I'm supposed to hate AA Gill' and my laptop practically levitated with the response. My problem is I admire him, but you're not supposed to say that at The Observer - Nick Cohen reports you to the commissars if you do, and Euan Ferguson bites your ankles. We are all supposed to stick pins in our AA Gill dolls and repeat the mantra: 'Please let this be the week that AA Gill starts to go off, oh Lord, that The Sunday Times might wither and die and the power of Murdoch be no more in the land.' </p> <p>You'd think he would go off, writing the sheer quantity he does - two weekly reviews (restaurants and TV) for The Sunday Times, plus longer articles for its magazine and GQ - but it's been seven years now and still no sign. Just to rub our noses in it, he also writes novels and is on to number three, having published Sap Rising and Starcrossed. Most people would have abandoned novel-writing after getting the reviews he got ('Frightful pile of garbage' - New Statesman ; 'Hideously and unamusingly obscene' - Evening Standard ), but he points out that the second novel got less-terrible reviews than the first, so if he carries on improving at this rate, the third should attract plaudits such as 'readable' or 'good in parts'. </p> <p>My colleagues' reasons for hating him basically boil down to these: 1. His novels, obviously. 2. His salary - believed to be more than \u00a3200,000 - obviously. 3. His smugness - especially his frequent self-congratulatory references to his girlfriend, Nicola Formby, 'the Blonde'. 4. His enthusiasm for the glitterati. 5. His friendship with Jeremy Clarkson. 6. His suits. Oddly enough, it's the suits - made for him by Doug Haywood and lined with women's silk scarves - that seem to enrage male journalists more than anything, even his salary. Here is a typical rant from Michael Bywater: </p> <p> 'He is a ponce. Suits with Herm\u00e8s headscarves cut up for linings. Really. He thinks he is handsome and has a profile like what's-his-name in Gormenghast and indeed he may be handsome but he is not sexy. I have asked everyone and they say, \"No, of course he is not sexy, sweetie pie, calm down,\" which I think proves my point. </p> <p>'He and Nicola Formby are a Power Couple, which we hate, don't we? He is a ponce - oh, hang on, I already said that - but it bears repetition, and anyway he has a little man who comes in once a week to hang his coats up and do his shoes, who he calls \"my valet\". He has a sort of stoat-like cunning which I envy and resent. 'But the real reason we should attack him is that he is impressed by celebrity and believes people like Henry Bent-Cockleburst and Joan Collins, etc are impressive. </p> <p>'So what? Well so this: Gill is almost unequalled in his powers of vituperative description and has a magical eye for the telling detail which condemns the whole, but he wastes it on faux-snobbery - or (I suspect) faux-faux-snobbery: easy targets, people who don't deserve to be sliced to pieces, instead of using his remarkable satiric gift for real satiric purpose.' </p> <p>Phew. But actually Bywater preceded all this by saying: 'Adrian? I like him a lot. He's loyal, witty, generous, clever, curious and a genuine original.' So you see the problem. We journos all want to hate AA Gill because he's paid more than us, but then we are awed by his talent and, moreover, forced to concede that he's quite a nice bloke. I shall strain every sinew to make him sound loathsome, but it's going to be hard work. </p> <p>Certainly his flat in South Kensington is easy to loathe. There is a portrait of Stalin over his desk, ho ho, and a yucky screensaver photo of him and Nicola kissing under palm fronds. Then there are all the 'amusing' objets - piles of stuffed monkeys' heads on the mantelpiece, Tanzanian pregnancy masks on the walls - as though he has read a description of Redmond O'Hanlon's house and said to an interior decorator, 'I want something like that, but of course much smarter, and not all smelly and moth-eaten like Redmond's.' But then I am disarmed because he is so touchingly proud of the place - it is the first flat he has ever owned. And he says he spends all day in this room, so he wanted something interesting that wouldn't turn into hotel decor. </p> <p> But soon I am twitching with suspicion at the sight of his bookshelves - enviable floor-to-ceiling bookcases with proper sliding library ladders - why does he have all these books when he's supposed to be dyslexic? Is he really dyslexic, or just a bit bad at spelling? He presses a key on his computer to reveal the work in progress and I am properly silenced. I must have interviewed several dozen people who describe themselves as dyslexic (sometimes I think being dyslexic is the prime requirement for being famous), but I have never actually seen the scale of the problem before. Adrian's spelling is so bizarre the computer spellcheck is useless because it can't guess what word he is aiming for. So he writes everything in his own weird English on the computer, then dictates it to the copytakers at Wapping, or reads it into a tape recorder. He says this process has its advantages: he can tell when a sentence is clunky or when a joke falls flat. 'I have a complete blank for all grammar - and it's been my saving grace. All I've ever done is listen to people talking and talk a lot myself - and I think the closer all writing is to talk, the better it is.' I agree - but still, to be a professional writer with this degree of handicap is equivalent to, say, an amputee swimming the Channel. Obviously it's possible - but bloody hard work. </p> <p>And perhaps because it was so difficult for him to become a writer, he is still bursting with delight and pride at having made it. He still dashes to the station on Saturday nights to buy The Sunday Times before anyone else does, and he keeps a wary eye out for up-and-coming new writers who might eventually supplant him. But he believes he has one great advantage over most of his would-be rivals: he is young as a columnist but old as a person. He is 45, with far more 'life experience' than the sort of smoothie-chops who slither straight from Oxbridge to a job at The Telegraph. For most of his twenties he was an alcoholic and only became a 'born-again person' when he dried out at 30. </p> <p>Why he became a drunk is a bit of a mystery - he claims he had a very happy childhood, and that his parents were liberal and supportive. His father, Michael Gill, was a famous television director (he directed Civilisation); his mother an actress. He remembers their home as being very glamorous, full of artists and actors having great conversations and sleeping on the floor. He was dimly aware that his parents were having affairs - it was the Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice era - but that didn't worry him, though he remembers feeling relieved when they finally divorced. </p> <p>Because he was dyslexic - always top in IQ tests, bottom in exams - and also had a bad stammer, his parents sent him to a 'progressive' co-ed boarding school, St Christopher's, Letchworth. 'It was a boarding school for loonies, basically. [Michael Winner also went there.] For the first two terms I was pretty miserable - it was really a benchmark for being unhappy, actually. Then I had a few good years when I made good friends and lost my stammer.' But he still always felt inadequate at home. 'I was just aware that I wasn't that great. Nobody was telling me that I should be more gilded than I was, but I knew it anyway.' He says so often, so insistently, that his parents were not to blame for his subsequent alcoholism that it feels like something he has had to learn, probably in AA. But he told an interviewer in 1996 that his father's success was 'a terrible weight. I spent 10 years getting drunk and doing whatever drugs were going.' </p> <p>Even at school, he would walk one-and-a-half miles over fields to the nearest pub. But when he left school, the year before A levels, he really started drinking. 'I thought, great - this is me. This is something I can do really well. I had never found anything I could do really well before. I could drink absolutely anyone under the table. And from the age of 19, there wasn't a day I didn't drink.' He also took drugs, mainly speed and acid but sometimes heroin, and claims that his first job after school was dealing speed. Then he went to art school, the Slade. He had assumed from the age of two that he would be a great artist and he spent four years at art school and six years signing on, trying to paint, until one day he realised he wasn't any good. He had plenty of technical tricks but no vision. And anyway by that time he was shaking too much to hold a brush. </p> <p>'I was drinking all day, every day - to the point where I got alcoholic gastritis, which is throwing up all the time, and burst all the blood vessels in my eyes. I was four stone heavier, because I drank beer as well as whisky - sick, sweaty; you sweat all the time, you sweat urea. I also had delirium tremens, where you have to take your first drink by putting a scarf round your arm and over the back of your neck [he demonstrates] so you can pull the glass up, otherwise you smash your teeth. And drinking through a straw, Benylin and vodka - that's great, let me tell you, if you want a recipe for this article. But the delirium is worse than the tremens - it's as if you're dreaming all the time and you see things that look as real as that sofa there. I had spiders the size of soup plates. So you live an incredibly complicated fantasy life - this ongoing, rather syrupy Steven Spielberg movie runs constantly in your head, with you as the wronged but ultimately triumphant hero. And I would pray - really pray - for a fatal illness. I wanted to have cancer, because cancer would make sense of it all. I had no excuse for being a junkie and a drunk. I came from a happy, supportive, endlessly liberal family who loved me. But if I had cancer I would have an excuse and, more than that, there would be an end, an end to the self-loathing, the monumental huge rucksack of self-hatred which you have to drink on. And the fear - a lot of being drunk is to do with being frightened all the time.' </p> <p> At last, when he was 30 and already yellow with hepatitis, he agreed to go to a drying-out clinic. He took his last drink - Mo\u00ebt et Chandon - on the train to Clouds, on 1 April 1984. 'I was quite close to dying. I was on the edge of cirrhosis. I had the highest liver count of anyone there. I was on a 24-hour watch with a nurse because you can die - in fact, I watched someone die - from alcoholic withdrawal. You have fits, and they were very worried that that might happen to me.' </p> <p>He was in the clinic for six weeks and came out sober. He has not touched alcohol since. 'But the important thing is, I was 30 when I stopped, and you're given this incredible clean sheet and that is a fabulous gift.' Of course, he didn't immediately leap from being AA Gill the drunk to AA Gill the successful writer. There were several years of just enjoying being sober, free of the fear. These were his cooking years, when he worked in restaurants (his younger brother, Nicholas, was a chef) and taught a cookery course in Scotland. But in his mid-thirties he discovered that he could write, and he wrote art reviews for little magazines. And in 1990 he married a venture capitalist, Amber Rudd, and had two children, Flora, now eight, and Hector, now six. </p> <p>Then someone asked him to write a piece for Tatler on what it was like being in a detox clinic. He wrote it under the pseudonym Blair Baillie for the September 1991 Tatler and Jane Procter, the then-editor, recalls: 'It was a brutally honest description. It combined the most compelling imagery with an exquisite use of English. At the risk of sounding overdramatic, I remember sitting in my office sobbing as I read it.' She asked to meet this Blair Baillie and suggested he should do interviews (thank God he didn't) - but, instead, he opted to do a cookery column with his own illustrations. He was shocked when an editor told him that he was a funny writer - he wanted to be Bernard Levin - but he accepted his fate. In 1993 he was poached by The Sunday Times, where he quickly established himself as their shiniest star. He said if he told me his salary, he would have to kill me, but the best guesstimates put it at over \u00a3200,000. He has given his editor some hairy moments, being reported to the Racial Equality and Press Complaints Commissions about his frequent attacks on the Welsh and last year's 'Hunforgiven' about the Germans. He was also once physically attacked by Robert Kilroy-Silk, to whom he'd given a 'firm but fair' TV review. But he is completely fearless. His mother and Nicola sometimes tell him to be careful. 'But I think you absolutely can't, because the moment you start thinking that there might be consequences, you've stopped doing your job and you may as well just rewrite PR handouts.' Hear hear. </p> <p>He writes all day, every day, fuelled by cigarettes and coffee; he doesn't even pause to eat till the evening. But, unfortunately, what he most enjoys writing is novels - he believes that 'Journalism is success, writing books is achievement.' Yet even his friends are stumped to find anything good to say about his novels. Why does he bother? The money must be negligible compared to his salary. He bangs on about the sense of achievement, and the pleasure of creating characters - 'It's just the most fun I have writing' - but I suspect he writes novels because the Tatler crowd he moves in considers it OK to be a novelist and not OK to be a journalist. But he is far too intelligent to make any such admission to me. </p> <p>His novels are characterised by poor structure, hysterical over-writing and truly terrible sex scenes. These are terrible, first, because there are so many of them - especially in Sap Rising, where he can't stop babbling on like a schoolboy, saying every rude word he knows - and second, because they are often so disgusting. He has a sort of Hogarthian relish for revolting couplings - there is one with a dog in Sap Rising, and an unspeakable scene in Starcrossed where the hero has to have sex with an ugly woman, which seems to be Gill's idea of a fate worse than death. There is something compulsive, almost unhinged, about his sex writing, as if he actually can't stop himself. And indeed he told me that writing for a Sunday newspaper, with no opportunity to write about sex, 'I built up this sort of well of unwritten sex. I would play endless jokes with the subs, trying to get rude bits in - I invented a restaurant called the Pork Trombone - but they always took it out.' His Style editor, Jeremy Langmead, confirms that 'he's always trying to slip filthy words into his copy'. </p> <p>There is something so off-key about his descriptions of women, and his fixation with genitalia, that I can't be the first person to think he's a closet bisexual. Actually he says everyone thinks it, has done all his life, probably because of his 'feyness', or his camp way of speaking. He doesn't mind - on the contrary, he was 'really chuffed' recently when a gay magazine nominated him as one of the 50 sexiest men in the world. He has a gay friend who tells him, 'You're a gay trapped in a straight body,' but, in fact, he says, his entire homosexual experience amounts to 'a little mutual masturbation' at school and it certainly didn't convert him. </p> <p>He has always had girlfriends, even in his drinking years, and was briefly married in his twenties to Cressida Connolly, and then to Amber Rudd in his thirties. That second marriage seemed to be happy and he was and is besotted with his two children - but he walked out on them in 1995 for Nicola Formby, 'the Blonde'. At the time, she was a model and girl-about-town, mainly known for having gone out with Viscount Linley. They met when Nicola went to consult Adrian about starting a restaurant - she had done a cookery course at La Varenne and is by all accounts a brilliant cook - and she was dazzled by his knowledge. He was presumably dazzled by her beauty - he once wrote a nauseating article in which he described her as 'drop-dead, table-banging, foot-stomping, forehead-corrugating, eyeball-inflating, hubba-hubba, wolf-whistling sensational' and it was at that point that many of my colleagues took against him. I winced for his ex-wife when I read that piece - but apparently she bears him no ill will; on the contrary, she has told friends that Adrian is a far better ex-husband than he ever was husband. </p> <p>He is always advertising 'the Blonde' in his columns, drooling over her beauty, hinting at their fantastic sex life. According to Nicholas Coleridge, they make love twice a day. But when I checked this with Nicola she said, quick as a flash, 'Only once a day with me!' I would have thought it was fairly irritating to be known as the Blonde, but she says, no, she likes it - in fact she writes a column called 'Blonde Date' in Tatler. She is officially editor at large for Tatler, and style editor of The Telegraph magazine. She is an extremely nice, polite girl, who seems to have quite a cool head on her shoulders. When I asked if she hoped to marry Adrian one day, she said she never particularly wanted to be married, and didn't fancy being 'the third Mrs Gill'. What about children? 'I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.' Adrian says he would love to have more children and hopes that Nicola will want them, too. 'It would be a terrible shame, I think, for her not to have children, and if she does have children I sincerely hope that they're mine.' </p> <p>But when I asked Adrian what she was like - apart from being beautiful - he gave what sounded more like a job reference. 'She's immensely organised. She's got a fantastically good eye for detail. I mean, she'll sit in a restaurant and say, \"Have you noticed that you never see courgettes on menus any more?\" And a lot of that is the essence of what I write anyway - so we tend to do stories together, and she's very good for travelling with.' (Nicola says he's a nightmare to travel with because he wants to be at the airport hours early. But once they arrive, he's fine.) </p> <p>Marcelle d'Argy Smith, the former editor of Cosmopolitan, who is probably their closest joint friend, describes them as 'two terribly successful, attractive alpha people having the most wonderful time - and they're both extraordinarily nice and generous, very kind'. But they are both very, very work-oriented - and almost everything they do is work. They dine out six nights a week so he can keep an eye on restaurants, and on the seventh night they stay in and watch television, so he can write his television review. He loathes dinner parties, but will go to almost any drinks party - 'It's true I absolutely would go to the opening of a fridge' - and yet he admits he is very bad at parties, always a wallflower, and of course always sober. I must say, whenever I've seen him and Nicola at parties they don't seem to be having much fun. But he explains, 'Usually, for one or other of us, it's work. If I read something in someone else's copy and I don't know what they're talking about, I just get this sudden froideur [presumably he means panic] about what am I not noticing. But then I worry that I might start taking it seriously, that I might start caring about not getting the right invitation. It hasn't happened yet, touch wood.' </p> <p>But he says Nicola is always complaining that they don't have any friends, just endless acquaintances, and, 'I worry that in the end I see the same 200 or 300 people over and over again, and I would hate to think that that actually ended up being what my social life was. There are lots of people I think of as being old, dear friends, but I maybe only speak to them once or twice a year, because they constantly go to the back of the queue, behind all the things which are to do with work, with deadlines. I'm continually saddened when I look through my address book, at how patchy it is, at how many people drop off the edge of my life.' </p> <p>One person who has shockingly dropped off the edge of his life is his younger brother Nick, his only sibling. Not knowing, I asked a casual question about whether he was still working as a chef and Adrian's eyes filled with tears. 'I don't know. My brother sort of disappeared, just over a year ago. He wasn't working. He's divorced, got three children. He came to see me and said, \"I'm having a miserable time. I'm going to disappear for a bit.\" I think there comes a point for some people where you look at the totality of your life and say, \"This is not what I want. There's not anything worth salvaging. So I'll go off and start again.\" In a sense, I had that forced on me, and Nick never did. And he's just gone and done it. I'm sure he'll turn up - but it will be when he wants to. It must be everybody's right to do that - to just chuck in the hand and say, \"Deal me a whole new set of cards.\" I mean, on one level I think he's very courageous. On another level - I miss him a lot. I miss him terribly. I love him, Nick.' </p> <p>Gill obviously believes that the heart has its reasons. He made an equally abrupt departure when he left his wife and two small children for Nicola and has never regretted it - he says he is a great believer in 'positive divorce'. And yet he claims to be a Christian, which doesn't normally entail belief in positive divorce. 'Well, then the alternative is that I'm a great believer in really miserable marriages. That doesn't seem to be particularly Christian either!' he snaps. He says the great advantage of being a low-church Protestant, which he is, is that you don't have to get your religion through priests or pastors, because 'everyone has a direct line to God'. He spends time in churches, though not usually during services, and says that in his drinking years he used to cry a lot in the back of churches. </p> <p>None of his friends seem to know that he's a Christian. Jeremy Clarkson was quite amazed when I told him: 'Adrian? Christian? What - as in milk of human kindness, goodwill to all men? He's having you on.' His Style editor, Jeremy Langmead, was equally dismissive - 'I've never met someone so un-Christian - I thought the only person he worshipped was himself.' </p> <p>I find it very hard to square the beliefs expressed in his novels and his columns with Christianity, or indeed with any moral overview. Starcrossed in particular is almost Thatcherite in its contempt for 'losers' (and I wonder what his brother Nicholas made of it). Its message seems to be that rich, beautiful, famous people are actually better than poor, ugly, unsuccessful ones - better as in more deserving of space on the planet. It may be that because he despises himself for being poor and unsuccessful in his drinking years, he assumes that everyone who is poor and unsuccessful merely needs to get a grip and sign into Clouds. Although that's not fair either - he once wrote a very moving piece about poverty in the Sudan. Part of the trouble with AA Gill is that he can argue almost any case so eloquently you can't really tell which case he believes in. My more earnest colleagues complain that he 'always goes for the soft targets', but given that he's writing for a magazine called Style, you wouldn't seriously expect him to offer a critique of capitalism. Nevertheless, there is a sort of a missing middle in his writing - he swings between gushing sentimentality and withering contempt with no rational argument in between. And his fiercest contempt is usually directed at people who commit the crime of being ugly - reverence for beauty is the one consistent value in his oeuvre. </p> <p>Perhaps that is why he spends all the hours at Doug Haywood's, faffing over his execrable suits. Nicola says it's harmless: 'He loves clothes, and I think that's great. He goes off and sits with Doug Haywood and twinks and twanks about whether the stitching should go here, and the lining should be like this - that's his kind of game of golf in the afternoon. I don't think he's obsessively vain, but he likes the business of looking well turned out.' </p> <p>I asked Adrian if he wished he were more handsome, and a strange, puzzled frown darkened his brow, so I quickly amended the question to more devastatlingly handsome, which seemed to go down better. 'I'm no more secure in my appearance than I think anyone else is. I'm 45, I'm going bald, I stoop, I've got terrible teeth. I don't really worry about those things, but I'm aware of them. I happened to fall in love with someone who is very beautiful and I think it's totally captivating, beauty. I can take any amount of it - I never walk into a room and think, ho hum, more beautiful girls. What I really despise is the people who say it's only skin deep, it means nothing.' But it makes for a perilous future, surely - he and Nicola can't always be hot, can't always be beautiful, can't always be successful (though perhaps I'm indulging in a little wish fulfilment here). He admits that he worries sometimes about what happens to old columnists - he knows he can't go on forever. But, he explains, 'It comes back again to what I was saying about getting this clean sheet. The person I am now is the person that, at 29, I would have wanted to be. Somehow I did turn into someone that, in another life, I would have hated and envied. I was at a dinner party once with a whole lot of bankers and lawyers, and someone said, \"Where do you want to be in 10 years' time?\" And every single person round the table had a life plan, a goal, and it finally got to me and I said, \"Please God, I can be doing exactly what I'm doing now. If I can write a book a year, and get paid a really absurd amount of money to eat in restaurants and watch television, and to be read but not to be famous - I couldn't really better that.\"' Dontcha hate him? </p> <p> \u0095 Starcrossed by AA Gill is published by Black Swan in May, price \u00a36.99</p>",

Well so this: Gill is almost unequalled in his powers of vituperative description and has a magical eye for the telling detail which condemns the whole, but he wastes it on faux-snobbery - or (I suspect) faux-faux-snobbery: easy targets, people who don't deserve to be sliced to pieces, instead of using his remarkable satiric gift for real satiric purpose.' Phew. But actually Bywater preceded all this by saying: 'Adrian? I like him a lot. He's loyal, witty, generous, clever, curious and a genuine original.' So you see the problem. We journos all want to hate AA Gill because he's paid more than us, but then we are awed by his talent and, moreover, forced to concede that he's quite a nice bloke. I shall strain every sinew to make him sound loathsome, but it's going to be hard work. Certainly his flat in South Kensington is easy to loathe. There is a portrait of Stalin over his desk, ho ho, and a yucky screensaver photo of him and Nicola kissing under palm fronds. Then there are all the 'amusing' objets - piles of stuffed monkeys' heads on the mantelpiece, Tanzanian pregnancy masks on the walls - as though he has read a description of Redmond O'Hanlon's house and said to an interior decorator, 'I want something like that, but of course much smarter, and not all smelly and moth-eaten like Redmond's.' But then I am disarmed because he is so touchingly proud of the place - it is the first flat he has ever owned. And he says he spends all day in this room, so he wanted something interesting that wouldn't turn into hotel decor. But soon I am twitching with suspicion at the sight of his bookshelves - enviable floor-to-ceiling bookcases with proper sliding library ladders - why does he have all these books when he's supposed to be dyslexic? Is he really dyslexic, or just a bit bad at spelling? He presses a key on his computer to reveal the work in progress and I am properly silenced. I must have interviewed several dozen people who describe themselves as dyslexic (sometimes I think being dyslexic is the prime requirement for being famous), but I have never actually seen the scale of the problem before. Adrian's spelling is so bizarre the computer spellcheck is useless because it can't guess what word he is aiming for. So he writes everything in his own weird English on the computer, then dictates it to the copytakers at Wapping, or reads it into a tape recorder. He says this process has its advantages: he can tell when a sentence is clunky or when a joke falls flat. 'I have a complete blank for all grammar - and it's been my saving grace. All I've ever done is listen to people talking and talk a lot myself - and I think the closer all writing is to talk, the better it is.' I agree - but still, to be a professional writer with this degree of handicap is equivalent to, say, an amputee swimming the Channel. Obviously it's possible - but bloody hard work. And perhaps because it was so difficult for him to become a writer, he is still bursting with delight and pride at having made it. He still dashes to the station on Saturday nights to buy The Sunday Times before anyone else does, and he keeps a wary eye out for up-and-coming new writers who might eventually supplant him. But he believes he has one great advantage over most of his would-be rivals: he is young as a columnist but old as a person. He is 45, with far more 'life experience' than the sort of smoothie-chops who slither straight from Oxbridge to a job at The Telegraph. For most of his twenties he was an alcoholic and only became a 'born-again person' when he dried out at 30. Why he became a drunk is a bit of a mystery - he claims he had a very happy childhood, and that his parents were liberal and supportive. His father, Michael Gill, was a famous television director (he directed Civilisation); his mother an actress. He remembers their home as being very glamorous, full of artists and actors having great conversations and sleeping on the floor. He was dimly aware that his parents were having affairs - it was the Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice era - but that didn't worry him, though he remembers feeling relieved when they finally divorced. Because he was dyslexic - always top in IQ tests, bottom in exams - and also had a bad stammer, his parents sent him to a 'progressive' co-ed boarding school, St Christopher's, Letchworth. 'It was a boarding school for loonies, basically. [Michael Winner also went there.] For the first two terms I was pretty miserable - it was really a benchmark for being unhappy, actually. Then I had a few good years when I made good friends and lost my stammer.' But he still always felt inadequate at home. 'I was just aware that I wasn't that great. Nobody was telling me that I should be more gilded than I was, but I knew it anyway.' He says so often, so insistently, that his parents were not to blame for his subsequent alcoholism that it feels like something he has had to learn, probably in AA. But he told an interviewer in 1996 that his father's success was 'a terrible weight. I spent 10 years getting drunk and doing whatever drugs were going.' Even at school, he would walk one-and-a-half miles over fields to the nearest pub. But when he left school, the year before A levels, he really started drinking. 'I thought, great - this is me. This is something I can do really well. I had never found anything I could do really well before. I could drink absolutely anyone under the table. And from the age of 19, there wasn't a day I didn't drink.' He also took drugs, mainly speed and acid but sometimes heroin, and claims that his first job after school was dealing speed. Then he went to art school, the Slade. He had assumed from the age of two that he would be a great artist and he spent four years at art school and six years signing on, trying to paint, until one day he realised he wasn't any good. He had plenty of technical tricks but no vision. And anyway by that time he was shaking too much to hold a brush. 'I was drinking all day, every day - to the point where I got alcoholic gastritis, which is throwing up all the time, and burst all the blood vessels in my eyes. I was four stone heavier, because I drank beer as well as whisky - sick, sweaty; you sweat all the time, you sweat urea. I also had delirium tremens, where you have to take your first drink by putting a scarf round your arm and over the back of your neck [he demonstrates] so you can pull the glass up, otherwise you smash your teeth. And drinking through a straw, Benylin and vodka - that's great, let me tell you, if you want a recipe for this article. But the delirium is worse than the tremens - it's as if you're dreaming all the time and you see things that look as real as that sofa there. I had spiders the size of soup plates. So you live an incredibly complicated fantasy life - this ongoing, rather syrupy Steven Spielberg movie runs constantly in your head, with you as the wronged but ultimately triumphant hero. And I would pray - really pray - for a fatal illness. I wanted to have cancer, because cancer would make sense of it all. I had no excuse for being a junkie and a drunk. I came from a happy, supportive, endlessly liberal family who loved me. But if I had cancer I would have an excuse and, more than that, there would be an end, an end to the self-loathing, the monumental huge rucksack of self-hatred which you have to drink on. And the fear - a lot of being drunk is to do with being frightened all the time.' At last, when he was 30 and already yellow with hepatitis, he agreed to go to a drying-out clinic. He took his last drink - Mo\u00ebt et Chandon - on the train to Clouds, on 1 April 1984. 'I was quite close to dying. I was on the edge of cirrhosis. I had the highest liver count of anyone there. I was on a 24-hour watch with a nurse because you can die - in fact, I watched someone die - from alcoholic withdrawal. You have fits, and they were very worried that that might happen to me.' He was in the clinic for six weeks and came out sober. He has not touched alcohol since. 'But the important thing is, I was 30 when I stopped, and you're given this incredible clean sheet and that is a fabulous gift.' Of course, he didn't immediately leap from being AA Gill the drunk to AA Gill the successful writer. There were several years of just enjoying being sober, free of the fear. These were his cooking years, when he worked in restaurants (his younger brother, Nicholas, was a chef) and taught a cookery course in Scotland. But in his mid-thirties he discovered that he could write, and he wrote art reviews for little magazines. And in 1990 he married a venture capitalist, Amber Rudd, and had two children, Flora, now eight, and Hector, now six. Then someone asked him to write a piece for Tatler on what it was like being in a detox clinic. He wrote it under the pseudonym Blair Baillie for the September 1991 Tatler and Jane Procter, the then-editor, recalls: 'It was a brutally honest description. It combined the most compelling imagery with an exquisite use of English. At the risk of sounding overdramatic, I remember sitting in my office sobbing as I read it.' She asked to meet this Blair Baillie and suggested he should do interviews (thank God he didn't) - but, instead, he opted to do a cookery column with his own illustrations. He was shocked when an editor told him that he was a funny writer - he wanted to be Bernard Levin - but he accepted his fate. In 1993 he was poached by The Sunday Times, where he quickly established himself as their shiniest star. He said if he told me his salary, he would have to kill me, but the best guesstimates put it at over \u00a3200,000. He has given his editor some hairy moments, being reported to the Racial Equality and Press Complaints Commissions about his frequent attacks on the Welsh and last year's 'Hunforgiven' about the Germans. He was also once physically attacked by Robert Kilroy-Silk, to whom he'd given a 'firm but fair' TV review. But he is completely fearless. His mother and Nicola sometimes tell him to be careful. 'But I think you absolutely can't, because the moment you start thinking that there might be consequences, you've stopped doing your job and you may as well just rewrite PR handouts.' Hear hear. He writes all day, every day, fuelled by cigarettes and coffee; he doesn't even pause to eat till the evening. But, unfortunately, what he most enjoys writing is novels - he believes that 'Journalism is success, writing books is achievement.' Yet even his friends are stumped to find anything good to say about his novels. Why does he bother? The money must be negligible compared to his salary. He bangs on about the sense of achievement, and the pleasure of creating characters - 'It's just the most fun I have writing' - but I suspect he writes novels because the Tatler crowd he moves in considers it OK to be a novelist and not OK to be a journalist. But he is far too intelligent to make any such admission to me. His novels are characterised by poor structure, hysterical over-writing and truly terrible sex scenes. These are terrible, first, because there are so many of them - especially in Sap Rising, where he can't stop babbling on like a schoolboy, saying every rude word he knows - and second, because they are often so disgusting. He has a sort of Hogarthian relish for revolting couplings - there is one with a dog in Sap Rising, and an unspeakable scene in Starcrossed where the hero has to have sex with an ugly woman, which seems to be Gill's idea of a fate worse than death. There is something compulsive, almost unhinged, about his sex writing, as if he actually can't stop himself. And indeed he told me that writing for a Sunday newspaper, with no opportunity to write about sex, 'I built up this sort of well of unwritten sex. I would play endless jokes with the subs, trying to get rude bits in - I invented a restaurant called the Pork Trombone - but they always took it out.' His Style editor, Jeremy Langmead, confirms that 'he's always trying to slip filthy words into his copy'. There is something so off-key about his descriptions of women, and his fixation with genitalia, that I can't be the first person to think he's a closet bisexual. Actually he says everyone thinks it, has done all his life, probably because of his 'feyness', or his camp way of speaking. He doesn't mind - on the contrary, he was 'really chuffed' recently when a gay magazine nominated him as one of the 50 sexiest men in the world. He has a gay friend who tells him, 'You're a gay trapped in a straight body,' but, in fact, he says, his entire homosexual experience amounts to 'a little mutual masturbation' at school and it certainly didn't convert him. He has always had girlfriends, even in his drinking years, and was briefly married in his twenties to Cressida Connolly, and then to Amber Rudd in his thirties. That second marriage seemed to be happy and he was and is besotted with his two children - but he walked out on them in 1995 for Nicola Formby, 'the Blonde'. At the time, she was a model and girl-about-town, mainly known for having gone out with Viscount Linley. They met when Nicola went to consult Adrian about starting a restaurant - she had done a cookery course at La Varenne and is by all accounts a brilliant cook - and she was dazzled by his knowledge. He was presumably dazzled by her beauty - he once wrote a nauseating article in which he described her as 'drop-dead, table-banging, foot-stomping, forehead-corrugating, eyeball-inflating, hubba-hubba, wolf-whistling sensational' and it was at that point that many of my colleagues took against him. I winced for his ex-wife when I read that piece - but apparently she bears him no ill will; on the contrary, she has told friends that Adrian is a far better ex-husband than he ever was husband. He is always advertising 'the Blonde' in his columns, drooling over her beauty, hinting at their fantastic sex life. According to Nicholas Coleridge, they make love twice a day. But when I checked this with Nicola she said, quick as a flash, 'Only once a day with me!' I would have thought it was fairly irritating to be known as the Blonde, but she says, no, she likes it - in fact she writes a column called 'Blonde Date' in Tatler. She is officially editor at large for Tatler, and style editor of The Telegraph magazine. She is an extremely nice, polite girl, who seems to have quite a cool head on her shoulders. When I asked if she hoped to marry Adrian one day, she said she never particularly wanted to be married, and didn't fancy being 'the third Mrs Gill'. What about children? 'I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.' Adrian says he would love to have more children and hopes that Nicola will want them, too. 'It would be a terrible shame, I think, for her not to have children, and if she does have children I sincerely hope that they're mine.' But when I asked Adrian what she was like - apart from being beautiful - he gave what sounded more like a job reference. 'She's immensely organised. She's got a fantastically good eye for detail. I mean, she'll sit in a restaurant and say, \"Have you noticed that you never see courgettes on menus any more?\" And a lot of that is the essence of what I write anyway - so we tend to do stories together, and she's very good for travelling with.' (Nicola says he's a nightmare to travel with because he wants to be at the airport hours early. But once they arrive, he's fine.) Marcelle d'Argy Smith, the former editor of Cosmopolitan, who is probably their closest joint friend, describes them as 'two terribly successful, attractive alpha people having the most wonderful time - and they're both extraordinarily nice and generous, very kind'. But they are both very, very work-oriented - and almost everything they do is work. They dine out six nights a week so he can keep an eye on restaurants, and on the seventh night they stay in and watch television, so he can write his television review. He loathes dinner parties, but will go to almost any drinks party - 'It's true I absolutely would go to the opening of a fridge' - and yet he admits he is very bad at parties, always a wallflower, and of course always sober. I must say, whenever I've seen him and Nicola at parties they don't seem to be having much fun. But he explains, 'Usually, for one or other of us, it's work. If I read something in someone else's copy and I don't know what they're talking about, I just get this sudden froideur [presumably he means panic] about what am I not noticing. But then I worry that I might start taking it seriously, that I might start caring about not getting the right invitation. It hasn't happened yet, touch wood.' But he says Nicola is always complaining that they don't have any friends, just endless acquaintances, and, 'I worry that in the end I see the same 200 or 300 people over and over again, and I would hate to think that that actually ended up being what my social life was. There are lots of people I think of as being old, dear friends, but I maybe only speak to them once or twice a year, because they constantly go to the back of the queue, behind all the things which are to do with work, with deadlines. I'm continually saddened when I look through my address book, at how patchy it is, at how many people drop off the edge of my life.' One person who has shockingly dropped off the edge of his life is his younger brother Nick, his only sibling. Not knowing, I asked a casual question about whether he was still working as a chef and Adrian's eyes filled with tears. 'I don't know. My brother sort of disappeared, just over a year ago. He wasn't working. He's divorced, got three children. He came to see me and said, \"I'm having a miserable time. I'm going to disappear for a bit.\" I think there comes a point for some people where you look at the totality of your life and say, \"This is not what I want. There's not anything worth salvaging. So I'll go off and start again.\" In a sense, I had that forced on me, and Nick never did. And he's just gone and done it. I'm sure he'll turn up - but it will be when he wants to. It must be everybody's right to do that - to just chuck in the hand and say, \"Deal me a whole new set of cards.\" I mean, on one level I think he's very courageous. On another level - I miss him a lot. I miss him terribly. I love him, Nick.' Gill obviously believes that the heart has its reasons. He made an equally abrupt departure when he left his wife and two small children for Nicola and has never regretted it - he says he is a great believer in 'positive divorce'. And yet he claims to be a Christian, which doesn't normally entail belief in positive divorce. 'Well, then the alternative is that I'm a great believer in really miserable marriages. That doesn't seem to be particularly Christian either!' he snaps. He says the great advantage of being a low-church Protestant, which he is, is that you don't have to get your religion through priests or pastors, because 'everyone has a direct line to God'. He spends time in churches, though not usually during services, and says that in his drinking years he used to cry a lot in the back of churches. None of his friends seem to know that he's a Christian. Jeremy Clarkson was quite amazed when I told him: 'Adrian? Christian? What - as in milk of human kindness, goodwill to all men? He's having you on.' His Style editor, Jeremy Langmead, was equally dismissive - 'I've never met someone so un-Christian - I thought the only person he worshipped was himself.' I find it very hard to square the beliefs expressed in his novels and his columns with Christianity, or indeed with any moral overview. Starcrossed in particular is almost Thatcherite in its contempt for 'losers' (and I wonder what his brother Nicholas made of it). Its message seems to be that rich, beautiful, famous people are actually better than poor, ugly, unsuccessful ones - better as in more deserving of space on the planet. It may be that because he despises himself for being poor and unsuccessful in his drinking years, he assumes that everyone who is poor and unsuccessful merely needs to get a grip and sign into Clouds. Although that's not fair either - he once wrote a very moving piece about poverty in the Sudan. Part of the trouble with AA Gill is that he can argue almost any case so eloquently you can't really tell which case he believes in. My more earnest colleagues complain that he 'always goes for the soft targets', but given that he's writing for a magazine called Style, you wouldn't seriously expect him to offer a critique of capitalism. Nevertheless, there is a sort of a missing middle in his writing - he swings between gushing sentimentality and withering contempt with no rational argument in between. And his fiercest contempt is usually directed at people who commit the crime of being ugly - reverence for beauty is the one consistent value in his oeuvre. Perhaps that is why he spends all the hours at Doug Haywood's, faffing over his execrable suits. Nicola says it's harmless: 'He loves clothes, and I think that's great. He goes off and sits with Doug Haywood and twinks and twanks about whether the stitching should go here, and the lining should be like this - that's his kind of game of golf in the afternoon. I don't think he's obsessively vain, but he likes the business of looking well turned out.' I asked Adrian if he wished he were more handsome, and a strange, puzzled frown darkened his brow, so I quickly amended the question to more devastatlingly handsome, which seemed to go down better. 'I'm no more secure in my appearance than I think anyone else is. I'm 45, I'm going bald, I stoop, I've got terrible teeth. I don't really worry about those things, but I'm aware of them. I happened to fall in love with someone who is very beautiful and I think it's totally captivating, beauty. I can take any amount of it - I never walk into a room and think, ho hum, more beautiful girls. What I really despise is the people who say it's only skin deep, it means nothing.' But it makes for a perilous future, surely - he and Nicola can't always be hot, can't always be beautiful, can't always be successful (though perhaps I'm indulging in a little wish fulfilment here). He admits that he worries sometimes about what happens to old columnists - he knows he can't go on forever. But, he explains, 'It comes back again to what I was saying about getting this clean sheet. The person I am now is the person that, at 29, I would have wanted to be. Somehow I did turn into someone that, in another life, I would have hated and envied. I was at a dinner party once with a whole lot of bankers and lawyers, and someone said, \"Where do you want to be in 10 years' time?\" And every single person round the table had a life plan, a goal, and it finally got to me and I said, \"Please God, I can be doing exactly what I'm doing now. If I can write a book a year, and get paid a really absurd amount of money to eat in restaurants and watch television, and to be read but not to be famous - I couldn't really better that.\"' Dontcha hate him? \u0095 Starcrossed by AA Gill is published by Black Swan in May, price \u00a36.99",

      "body": "<p>One of the hot tips for Tuesday's Budget is the introduction of more incentives for mothers to get back to work. A rise in statutory maternity pay is one possibility; an extension to Working Families Tax Credit is another. </p> <p>But WFTC - although joyously welcomed by lone parents' charities and other groups - could still have its problems in practice. So if you are one of the 700,000 families claiming WFTC, expect a bumpy ride from next month, when employers take over from the Inland Revenue the task of paying out the money. </p> <p>WFTC was introduced last October as the beefed-up, more generous successor to Family Credit - paying over \u00a3100 a week to some families. For the first six months, the Inland Revenue has been administering the payments - but responsibility passes to employers for claims starting after 4 April. </p> <p>With more efficient companies there will, doubtless, be a seamless transition. But tax experts and welfare rights advisers are predicting major difficulties elsewhere. 'This is the first time that employers have been payers of benefits,' says Paul Falvey of accountant Grant Thornton. 'Employers representing only 2 per cent of the workforce have undergone Inland Revenue training on how to deal with it. Employers aren't geared up at all.' </p> <p>Nick Burkitt of the Low Pay Unit worries that low-paid people - who are quite likely to be working in small businesses - may not get the benefit on time or may get the wrong amount. Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Matthew Taylor, fears that WFTC 'imposes unneces sary burdens on small business, and encourages fraud'. </p> <p>The new Disabled Person's Tax Credit is also being administered in the same way - through employers for claims starting after 4 April. </p> <p>When he unveiled the credits, Chancellor Gordon Brown was adamant that WFTC should escape the stigma of being a benefit paid by the Benefits Agency - but should instead be added to the pay packet and seen as a 'credit'. </p> <p>The complexity of dealing with the credits has sparked rumours that some employers will be less willing to employ WFTC recipients. </p> <p>A small minority of WFTC recipients will still be paid by the Inland Revenue - those who are self-employed and those in a couple where the partner claiming is either self-employed or not working. </p> <p>So, if you are an employed claimant, what should you be expecting? If you are already claiming, you will have made your first claim to the Inland Revenue (which now runs the Benefits Agency). When your claim was granted, it was agreed for a six-month period. As that period comes to an end, you need to make another claim for the next six months. This should be fairly straightforward - unless your circumstances have changed considerably. </p> <p>When the Inland Revenue agrees the claim, it will write to your employer telling them how much you should be paid. You will not need to give your employer details of your partner's earnings or the number and ages of your children: these details are kept confidentially by the Revenue. You may, however, want to speak to your employer to check that they are ready to sort out your claim. </p> <p>Accountant Grant Thornton believes that some employers will find it difficult to bolt WFTC on to their existing systems - not least because WFTC is calculated by the day, whereas most payroll systems work by the month. Falvey adds: 'I have heard of one case where a large employer was told that the new software might not be ready until the end of May. In the meantime, they could perhaps calculate it manually and make cheque payments. This should be possible if they are alive to the situation.' </p> <p>Some employers think they will not need to deal with the issue because none of their staff has a low enough salary to qualify for WFTC. But they will need to think again. A working couple with a joint income of \u00a334,000 and four children could be entitled to WFTC of \u00a356.30 per week. A single parent on \u00a330,000 could also qualify. </p> <p>The Low Pay Unit says that at the other end of the spectrum, 'there are a lot of people who don't have written contracts or payslips'. Their employers have payroll systems which do not comply with the law as it is - let alone with the new complexities. Burkitt says: 'A lot of these people are used to having weekly benefits payments. They can't be kept waiting while it is sorted out.' </p> <p>There is an Inland Revenue helpline. And there are provisions for the Revenue to pay the money to the claimant if the employer does not. Tardy employers can be fined up to \u00a33,000 by the Revenue for failing to fulfil their obligations. </p> <p>Other concerns about the WFTC include the fact that it could be easy to make mistakes - and therefore to be penalised by the Revenue for making those errors. The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group is urging the Government to smooth out the system. The definition of income for Income Tax purposes is not the same as the definition for WFTC - even though both areas are handled by the same government department. </p> <p>For instance, the tax-efficient Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) are excluded from Income Tax calculations - but are included for WFTC. Benefits in kind - from the company car to the free yoga classes - are included in your taxable income, but excluded when your WFTC income is calculated. </p> <p>Confused? Well, be careful if you ask your employer for help on what exactly your earnings are. They may get it wrong too. Check your income with a specialist adviser from a Citizens Advice Bureau, welfare rights unit, Gingerbread or another specialist charity. </p> <p>John Andrews, chair of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, believes that employers could soon start to find significance in the fact that benefits in kind are excluded from WFTC: 'When the penny drops, they may start giving some of their pay in childcare vouchers, perhaps. Then we have a new avoidance industry again.' </p> <p>That would be ironic. One of the tax themes of the last decade has been the Government's relentless pursuit of tax dodges through benefit in kind schemes. In the 1980s, wealthy workers in the City sometimes got partly paid in gold bars to avoid the tax. It would be bizarre if working parents soon start getting partly paid in childcare vouchers. </p> <p>\u0095 Inland Revenue helplines: (for claimants) 0845 609 5000; (for employers) 0845 714 3143. </p> <p>\u0095 Gingerbread advice line: 0800 018 4318; Lone parent helpline: 0800 018 5026 (run by the National Council for One Parent Families). </p> <p>\u0095 Low Pay Unit helpline: 020-7713 7583</p>",

WFTC was introduced last October as the beefed-up, more generous successor to Family Credit - paying over \u00a3100 a week to some families. For the first six months, the Inland Revenue has been administering the payments - but responsibility passes to employers for claims starting after 4 April. With more efficient companies there will, doubtless, be a seamless transition. But tax experts and welfare rights advisers are predicting major difficulties elsewhere. 'This is the first time that employers have been payers of benefits,' says Paul Falvey of accountant Grant Thornton. 'Employers representing only 2 per cent of the workforce have undergone Inland Revenue training on how to deal with it. Employers aren't geared up at all.' Nick Burkitt of the Low Pay Unit worries that low-paid people - who are quite likely to be working in small businesses - may not get the benefit on time or may get the wrong amount. Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Matthew Taylor, fears that WFTC 'imposes unneces sary burdens on small business, and encourages fraud'. The new Disabled Person's Tax Credit is also being administered in the same way - through employers for claims starting after 4 April. When he unveiled the credits, Chancellor Gordon Brown was adamant that WFTC should escape the stigma of being a benefit paid by the Benefits Agency - but should instead be added to the pay packet and seen as a 'credit'. The complexity of dealing with the credits has sparked rumours that some employers will be less willing to employ WFTC recipients. A small minority of WFTC recipients will still be paid by the Inland Revenue - those who are self-employed and those in a couple where the partner claiming is either self-employed or not working. So, if you are an employed claimant, what should you be expecting? If you are already claiming, you will have made your first claim to the Inland Revenue (which now runs the Benefits Agency). When your claim was granted, it was agreed for a six-month period. As that period comes to an end, you need to make another claim for the next six months. This should be fairly straightforward - unless your circumstances have changed considerably. When the Inland Revenue agrees the claim, it will write to your employer telling them how much you should be paid. You will not need to give your employer details of your partner's earnings or the number and ages of your children: these details are kept confidentially by the Revenue. You may, however, want to speak to your employer to check that they are ready to sort out your claim. Accountant Grant Thornton believes that some employers will find it difficult to bolt WFTC on to their existing systems - not least because WFTC is calculated by the day, whereas most payroll systems work by the month. Falvey adds: 'I have heard of one case where a large employer was told that the new software might not be ready until the end of May. In the meantime, they could perhaps calculate it manually and make cheque payments. This should be possible if they are alive to the situation.' Some employers think they will not need to deal with the issue because none of their staff has a low enough salary to qualify for WFTC. But they will need to think again. A working couple with a joint income of \u00a334,000 and four children could be entitled to WFTC of \u00a356.30 per week. A single parent on \u00a330,000 could also qualify. The Low Pay Unit says that at the other end of the spectrum, 'there are a lot of people who don't have written contracts or payslips'. Their employers have payroll systems which do not comply with the law as it is - let alone with the new complexities. Burkitt says: 'A lot of these people are used to having weekly benefits payments. They can't be kept waiting while it is sorted out.' There is an Inland Revenue helpline. And there are provisions for the Revenue to pay the money to the claimant if the employer does not. Tardy employers can be fined up to \u00a33,000 by the Revenue for failing to fulfil their obligations. Other concerns about the WFTC include the fact that it could be easy to make mistakes - and therefore to be penalised by the Revenue for making those errors. The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group is urging the Government to smooth out the system. The definition of income for Income Tax purposes is not the same as the definition for WFTC - even though both areas are handled by the same government department. For instance, the tax-efficient Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) are excluded from Income Tax calculations - but are included for WFTC. Benefits in kind - from the company car to the free yoga classes - are included in your taxable income, but excluded when your WFTC income is calculated. Confused? Well, be careful if you ask your employer for help on what exactly your earnings are. They may get it wrong too. Check your income with a specialist adviser from a Citizens Advice Bureau, welfare rights unit, Gingerbread or another specialist charity. John Andrews, chair of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, believes that employers could soon start to find significance in the fact that benefits in kind are excluded from WFTC: 'When the penny drops, they may start giving some of their pay in childcare vouchers, perhaps. Then we have a new avoidance industry again.' That would be ironic. One of the tax themes of the last decade has been the Government's relentless pursuit of tax dodges through benefit in kind schemes. In the 1980s, wealthy workers in the City sometimes got partly paid in gold bars to avoid the tax. It would be bizarre if working parents soon start getting partly paid in childcare vouchers. \u0095 Inland Revenue helplines: (for claimants) 0845 609 5000; (for employers) 0845 714 3143. \u0095 Gingerbread advice line: 0800 018 4318; Lone parent helpline: 0800 018 5026 (run by the National Council for One Parent Families). \u0095 Low Pay Unit helpline: 020-7713 7583",

Even its rapid expansion in the past few years seems to have done little harm: 85 per cent of its funds have been in the top quartile of their sectors since launch. </p> <p>Bonham Carter makes this achievement sound deceptively simple. 'The key factors have been attracting and keeping talented people, making sure one person is closely associated with the performance of a fund and still providing a team environment so that those talented individuals can discuss ideas constantly.' </p> <p>One of the ways the group gets the best out of all its fund managers is its policy of seeing people from as many companies as possible in its offices, rather than going on the road to visit them. Several fund managers sit down together to grill them. </p> <p>Bonham Carter explains: 'This approach is more time- efficient. It means we can sometimes see three or four companies in a day. </p> <p>'More importantly, because everybody sees things in a different way, it means people will ask questions about what they are interested in - the financial side, the management and so on - and can then debate these matters with their colleagues.' </p> <p>Although an agreed position may be reached, whether or not individual managers decide to put a company in their funds is up to them. They are not left entirely to their own devices, however. Every two months, as a risk control mechanism, fund portfolios are monitored to ensure that they do not have too many unquoted companies or one big hold ing that is getting out of proportion. Another aspect of the Jupiter approach is its flexible and pragmatic investment culture. Bonham Carter says: 'We don't focus rigidly on large or small companies, or pursue a growth or value approach; we invest in what we think is right at the time. We look at where a company's growth is coming from, what the risks are and whether there are barriers to entry which will enable them to defend their profits.' </p> <p>In the end, though, he adds: 'Fund management is an art. It is a subjective process.' And this, of course, is where individual managers' talents come in.</p>",

Even its rapid expansion in the past few years seems to have done little harm: 85 per cent of its funds have been in the top quartile of their sectors since launch. Bonham Carter makes this achievement sound deceptively simple. 'The key factors have been attracting and keeping talented people, making sure one person is closely associated with the performance of a fund and still providing a team environment so that those talented individuals can discuss ideas constantly.' One of the ways the group gets the best out of all its fund managers is its policy of seeing people from as many companies as possible in its offices, rather than going on the road to visit them. Several fund managers sit down together to grill them. Bonham Carter explains: 'This approach is more time- efficient. It means we can sometimes see three or four companies in a day. 'More importantly, because everybody sees things in a different way, it means people will ask questions about what they are interested in - the financial side, the management and so on - and can then debate these matters with their colleagues.' Although an agreed position may be reached, whether or not individual managers decide to put a company in their funds is up to them. They are not left entirely to their own devices, however. Every two months, as a risk control mechanism, fund portfolios are monitored to ensure that they do not have too many unquoted companies or one big hold ing that is getting out of proportion. Another aspect of the Jupiter approach is its flexible and pragmatic investment culture. Bonham Carter says: 'We don't focus rigidly on large or small companies, or pursue a growth or value approach; we invest in what we think is right at the time. We look at where a company's growth is coming from, what the risks are and whether there are barriers to entry which will enable them to defend their profits.' In the end, though, he adds: 'Fund management is an art. It is a subjective process.' And this, of course, is where individual managers' talents come in.",

You'll have to wait until November to see the programme (Lost Gardens, Channel 4), so it would be premature to tell its story, but it was my first visit to a Cornish valley garden. (I drove past the entrance to Heligan about six years ago when the restoration was in full flow, but it was the end of the day and I had a long journey ahead I've regretted it ever since.) </p> <p>The essential components of these gardens - rhododendrons, ferns, magnolias, azaleas, camellias, bamboos - are not plants that I feel any empathy with. Just as the first five years of your life influences everything about the rest of your days, so the landscape you first knew and loved imprints itself on you and becomes the geology of the bone. The alkaline chalkland of north Hampshire was ideal for beech, yew, box, irises, carnations and summer flowering deciduous shrubs, but hopeless for rhododendrons and camellias. Apart from the soil conditions, it is on a frost line which meant we could not grow anything remotely tender. </p> <p>So these Cornish gardens with their mild climate, high rainfall and careful siting in valleys protected by massive tree planting along the rims (creating an even milder micro-climate) are a foreign country. Any self-respecting Cornish person would point out that Cornwall always has been another country, but the strangeness is measured in foliage and light, not in custom. </p> <p>I visited Glendurgan, which was created in the early years of the 19th century. This means that it has had time to evolve a sustainable ecology based upon this intelligent combination of manmade environment and uncontrollable climate. The result, like the Gulf-Streamed south-west corner of Ireland and the west coast of Scotland, is effectively temperate rainforest with a constant mild temperature and a rainfall of about 45 inches spread evenly across the year. It never dries out, never gets too hot and hardly drops below freezing more than once or twice a year. This means that plants from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China and the lower slopes of the Himalayas feel more at home there than anywhere else in England. </p> <p>The most obvious beneficiary of this environment is the Tasmanian tree fern, Dicksonia antartica, which, despite having become wildly trendy over the past few years, is still outlandishly prehistoric. These are the 6ft fronds that dinosaurs pushed past. They sprout on top of tall 'trunks' which are actually a thick matted cord of root. There are few stained-glass windows in this world as lovely as gazing up through these interlocking fronds, backlit by a blue sky. The conventional account of the tree fern's arrival in this country is that the stems were used as ballast by cargo ships returning from Australasia and one was thrown overboard in Falmouth harbour. Someone noticed that it began to sprout and planted it in their garden, where it thrived. </p> <p>Given the right conditions, tree ferns do very well. In the wrong climate, they are almost impossible to grow. They ask only for some light (although not too much - dappled shade is the perfect prescription), moist soil, moist air, summer temperatures that are not too hot and mild winters (although most of the Cornish tree ferns survived the terrible winters of 1948 and 1963) and to be kept free from ivy which suckers on to their fibrous stem and which would eventually clog up the centre of the fronds which acts as a sump for rainwater, rather like a bromeliad. The theory is that the dying fronds hang down like a faded curtain, shading out potentially threatening climbers, but it doesn't seem to work against ivy. </p> <p>The tree ferns look wonderful all year round, but in spring the flowering trees in these Cornish gardens are startlingly brilliant. My favourite is the Magnolia campbellii, the flowers of which open from plum-pink, avocado-sized buds into fat-petalled water lilies on the end of naked branches. That is extraordinary enough, but it dips into fantasy when you see how big these trees can become. Magnolias were such a fixture of interwar suburban planting - with 100 M x soulangeanas planted for one of any other type - that our gardens have domesticated them. A visit to these Cornish gardens blows away all these preconceptions. In its native Himalayas, the magnolia can reach 150ft, although it does well to reach a third of that in this country. But that is still staggering. Imagine a massive ash or beech suddenly exploding into huge flower and you are on the right track. The steep-sided valleys mean you can gaze up at the flowers 60ft above you, and then climb the hillside and look down on to them. Astonishment is the only just response. They must be planted for your dotage and your grandchildren, because they are very slow to come into flower, taking 25 years to produce a single flower. Not makeover material. They like an acidic soil and spring frosts would reduce the flowers to used tissue, so they must be in a sheltered and/or mild spot. An even bigger tree is M x veitchii which is a cross between M campbellii and M denudata, and this has reached 85ft in Cornwall. </p> <p>The acidic soil is a prerequisite for rhododendrons and their flowers run amok from early February until late spring. Like tree ferns, they prosper best in high humidity and low heat. I hardly know what to think of rhododendrons. Yet I noticed last week that they made me smile. Perhaps this is their secret. They are not serious plants. They do not have the wonder of the magnolias or the mystery of tree ferns. The combination of glossy green leaves and shocking pastels is something to do with this, like a 1950s print of a starlet determined to make a splash at her first premiere; but also the way that they flower so profusely, the bushes bobbled all over like a glossy bathing cap. But, despite myself, I think that I am learning to like them, even though I cannot grow them on my neutral clay. </p> <p>Even Hillier's Guide to Trees and Shrubs, which is my first point of reference in all matters dendrological, with Hugh Johnson's Encyclopaedia of Trees hard on its heels, admits that 'Rhododendron leaves can be extremely dull' and once they have flowered they create a backdrop as ungiving as a banker's smile. We have all come to see R ponticum as a rampant weed, choking whole hillsides with that flat glossy stare, but until my Cornish visit I had not realised that laurel can be equally invasive. I saw one garden where both the cherry laurel, Prunus laurocerasus, and the Portuguese laurel, P lusitanica, with lateral growth as thick and as long as trees, created an impenetrable jungle. Both were innocently planted as cover for plants and game birds, but in that climate they grow like triffids. </p> <p>The maze at Glendurgan is of laurel and the head gardener told me that they cut it five times a year to keep it reasonably crisp. The main problem with this, he said, was not so much the cutting, but getting the clippings out. Every basket of laurel clippings had to be carried right round the maze of paths to the entrance to be emptied. It's a lovely image. </p> <p>\u0095 Dicksonia antartica is available from \u00a329 per plant upwards at Fern Express, 81 Bridle Road, Burton Joyce, Nottingham NG14 5FS (0115 931 2212; fax 0115 931 4114)</p>",

But all operate on the conventional economic model of selling something for more than it costs to produce it. </p> <p>Then there are the organisations that supply information on the Web as a public service. That includes: government and other statutory bodies such as the Competition Commission; many universities; schools who have to make their inspection reports available online; some companies; pressure groups; even the National Health Service. </p> <p>At the other end of the scale, and in a category few of us searching the Web at home will even see, are business-to-business sites such as <a href=\"http://www.goindustry.com/\">Goindustry</a>, an online auction house that helps companies dispose of unwanted assets such as machine tools from decommissioned plants, or trading hubs like those being established by <a href=\"http://www.carrefour.com/\">Carrefour</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ford.com\">Ford</a>. </p> <p>In between, are thousands of other businesses and websites, all hoping to make at least some money by using the Web as a business tool but without looking like conventional businesses. Until earlier this month, many would have relied on taking a share of the telephone charges paid by surfers: for example, half of last year's revenues for <a href=\"http://www.freeserve.com\">Freeserve</a>, the Internet Service Provider, came from call charges. But following the move towards unmetered access - pioneered by <a href=\"http://www.altavista.com\">Alta Vista</a> and now widely emulated - these revenues will disappear. In their place are two sources of revenue still at the heart of most Internet business plans: advertising and commission. </p> <p>Advertising is big business on the Web. Virtually every site you click on will have at least one advert. Some estimate that as much as 80 per cent of all venture capital money raised by Internet business is spent on advertising. Some of that goes on conventional media, television and billboards, for example, but a lot of it is spent on the Web itself. Every time you use one of the major search engines to look for a subject, an advert claiming you can find books on the subject at Amazon pops up. Small wonder, then, that its marketing and sales spend last year was more than $400 million, or a quarter of its total sales. </p> <p>Commissions can be earned in a variety of ways. First, there are businesses such as <a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">lastminute.com</a>, which is effectively a travel agent taking a cut of the cost of a flight, holiday or hotel room in exchange for helping the supplier fill it.

Indeed, some take it further and will try to take a commission on every subsequent purchase made by someone who was first introduced to a retailer through their portal. </p> <p>Not every company will be able to command lucrative commission deals. Internet excitement is cooling; those who control the budgets are starting to be more discriminating about where and how they spend their money. One financial services business describes being asked by one of the smaller search engines to agree to pay a commission of 2p every time it was included in a list of possible mortgage lenders. It finally agreed a flat fee of \u00a37,000. </p> <p>How sustainable are these as business models? The City is growing increasingly sus picious of Internet businesses which rely heavily on advertising. It is not impossible to make money from adverts: there are plenty of free newspapers which do just that, and even paid-for titles make around 70 per cent of their money from adverts. But while there are a limited number of newspapers, the Web sometimes appears infinite. Will there be enough money to go round? </p> <p>Some businesses are trying to drum up subscriptions to reduce their reliance on advertising, but that does depend on having valuable content. Even Encyclopaedia Britannica was forced to offer its entire reference library free on the Web to compete with rivals such as Microsoft's Encarta. </p> <p>Nick Gibson, an analyst with Durlacher, says advertising rates on the Web are still quite cheap but points to the power the Web gives you to target individuals who are likely to be interested in your product and to garner information about your target market. That, he says, means Web advertising could actually command a premium, rather than, as at present, a discount. But he adds: 'Advertisers are paying for consumers to access the Net. That will be difficult to sustain if you have content which you cannot differentiate from others.' </p> <p>Everyone expects a major shake-out among consumer Internet businesses as the Web matures and it becomes clear just how much revenue can be creamed from surfers. Christopher Spray of venture capitalist Atlas Ventures, which specialises in financing technology companies, is enthusiastic about business-to-business opportunities, like Goindustry. </p> <p>This sector is even less developed than the consumer Web but, experts say, it will eventually account for 80 per cent of all e-commerce. And eventually this is where the real money will be made.</p>",

Nick Gibson, an analyst with Durlacher, says advertising rates on the Web are still quite cheap but points to the power the Web gives you to target individuals who are likely to be interested in your product and to garner information about your target market. That, he says, means Web advertising could actually command a premium, rather than, as at present, a discount. But he adds: 'Advertisers are paying for consumers to access the Net. That will be difficult to sustain if you have content which you cannot differentiate from others.' Everyone expects a major shake-out among consumer Internet businesses as the Web matures and it becomes clear just how much revenue can be creamed from surfers. Christopher Spray of venture capitalist Atlas Ventures, which specialises in financing technology companies, is enthusiastic about business-to-business opportunities, like Goindustry. This sector is even less developed than the consumer Web but, experts say, it will eventually account for 80 per cent of all e-commerce. And eventually this is where the real money will be made.",

      "body": "<p>Sylvia Plath gassed herself, aged 30, in the cold London flat she had moved into after separating from her husband, Ted Hughes. She shut the door and put out bread and milk for her baby son and three-year-old daughter. Her death, in 1963, is the most famous thing about her, as impossible to erase from the memory as any line of her poetry. And since her death, her life has become a minefield. </p> <p>The Plath estate - managed by Olwyn Hughes - has fought to guard her image and to protect her children. Plath has become the siren who never lost the power to seduce, the sphinx that five biographers have tried to unriddle.Ted Hughes' miraculous final volume of poetry Birthday Letters, published in 1998 months before his death, seemed like the last words on the subject. </p> <p>But now Plath's unedited journals, notebook and diaries - whose serialisation continues in the Guardian on Monday and Tuesday - are to appear in a single volume for the first time. </p> <p>And of course we will read on, like detectives, greedy for clues. Advance publicity promises that Plath will be 'explained' (as if such a thing were possible). </p> <p>They will reveal, we are told, that Plath's worst enemy was not Ted Hughes - as feminists have claimed - but herself. No one who has read Plath's autobiographical novel The Bell Jar - let alone her poetry - will regard this as news. </p> <p>But as the train of literature about Plath and Hughes thunders on, as often as not Plath's poetry is left behind. No one stops to ask how good it was. Is it Plath's doomed life we care about most? Was death her best poem? Are her poems anything more than anguished poetic diaries? And can they be separated from her life? </p> <p>When I was at school, girls who would not read anything else were often to be discovered, 'mixed-up kids in long trailing skirts,' with slim volumes of Plath under their arms. </p> <p>She touched a nerve, made ordinary adolescent gloom sensational. Her suicide threw her poetry into relief, gave it glamour. Death seemed to be her co-author. She was a guide to the depths: despair, madness, the wish to die. I read Plath, too, avidly. But I have never felt drawn back to her. I felt I had outgrown her - that one needed to outgrow her, for one's own sanity. </p> <p>Literature is full of madness: Virgina Woolf, John Clare, Selima Hill. But Sylvia Plath stands out in modern mythology as Ophelia - with Hughes, her husband poet, her Hamlet. </p> <p>For sheer pain no one outclasses Plath. It is, above all, an astonishing performance, intensely theatrical. Plath is a star turn, scooping herself out of darkness. I find the theatricality dazzling - but disabling too. </p> <p>The poems Plath is most famous for are her last ones (1962-3) written before her death and published as Ariel in 1965. 'Daddy' and 'Lady Lazarus' are quoted so often, you could be forgiven for thinking she had written nothing else. 'Daddy', a poem I've always loathed, is none the less a technical tour de force. 'Daddy' has stepped straight out of a malign cabaret. The poem is seen as a rant against father and husband: 'If I've killed one man, I've killed two/Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.' </p> <p>'Lady Lazarus' is a far better poem, though also histrionic. What a line for a seductress: 'And I eat men like air.' (Is there any teenage girl who would not enjoy quoting such a line to herself as she set out to a party?) But it is the other boast from the same poem - 'Dying/Is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well' that has become Plath's epitaph. </p> <p>She had a need to be a femme fatale, even if she always knew she was most likely to prove fatal to herself. </p> <p>Her husband Ted Hughes described her as an 'unusual' poet. He said she could be 'intensely artificial' but added that even in her weaker poems she had a 'unique excitement'. There was, he said, a 'sense of a deep mathematical inevitability in the sound and texture of her lines'. It is more than inevitability, it is fatalism. </p> <p>The landscape of Plath's poems is depressed: it is black and white, 'mica silver' or steel, only occasionally interrupted by an assault of scarlet. Emotions, too, are black and white, as if in X-ray: the bones are always on show. Plath did not gild the lily, she blackened it. </p> <p>When other colours appear in her work they are almost hallucinogenic: a green field too radiant to be true; brilliant blue cornflowers; visionary blackberries; blood red poppies that remind her of a woman in an ambulance. </p> <p>Hers is the poetry of damage and of emergency. Over and again bandages appear: 'The wind stops my breath like a bandage,' and 'mother to myself I wake swaddled in gauze...' There is always a sense of a face beneath the skin, endlessly reconstructed, an in-patient. Even the moon is in casualty: 'The moon's crook whitens, thin as the skin seaming a scar.'

      "bodyText": "Sylvia Plath gassed herself, aged 30, in the cold London flat she had moved into after separating from her husband, Ted Hughes. She shut the door and put out bread and milk for her baby son and three-year-old daughter. Her death, in 1963, is the most famous thing about her, as impossible to erase from the memory as any line of her poetry. And since her death, her life has become a minefield. The Plath estate - managed by Olwyn Hughes - has fought to guard her image and to protect her children. Plath has become the siren who never lost the power to seduce, the sphinx that five biographers have tried to unriddle.Ted Hughes' miraculous final volume of poetry Birthday Letters, published in 1998 months before his death, seemed like the last words on the subject. But now Plath's unedited journals, notebook and diaries - whose serialisation continues in the Guardian on Monday and Tuesday - are to appear in a single volume for the first time. And of course we will read on, like detectives, greedy for clues. Advance publicity promises that Plath will be 'explained' (as if such a thing were possible). They will reveal, we are told, that Plath's worst enemy was not Ted Hughes - as feminists have claimed - but herself. No one who has read Plath's autobiographical novel The Bell Jar - let alone her poetry - will regard this as news. But as the train of literature about Plath and Hughes thunders on, as often as not Plath's poetry is left behind. No one stops to ask how good it was. Is it Plath's doomed life we care about most? Was death her best poem? Are her poems anything more than anguished poetic diaries? And can they be separated from her life? When I was at school, girls who would not read anything else were often to be discovered, 'mixed-up kids in long trailing skirts,' with slim volumes of Plath under their arms. She touched a nerve, made ordinary adolescent gloom sensational. Her suicide threw her poetry into relief, gave it glamour. Death seemed to be her co-author. She was a guide to the depths: despair, madness, the wish to die. I read Plath, too, avidly. But I have never felt drawn back to her. I felt I had outgrown her - that one needed to outgrow her, for one's own sanity. Literature is full of madness: Virgina Woolf, John Clare, Selima Hill. But Sylvia Plath stands out in modern mythology as Ophelia - with Hughes, her husband poet, her Hamlet. For sheer pain no one outclasses Plath. It is, above all, an astonishing performance, intensely theatrical. Plath is a star turn, scooping herself out of darkness. I find the theatricality dazzling - but disabling too. The poems Plath is most famous for are her last ones (1962-3) written before her death and published as Ariel in 1965. 'Daddy' and 'Lady Lazarus' are quoted so often, you could be forgiven for thinking she had written nothing else. 'Daddy', a poem I've always loathed, is none the less a technical tour de force. 'Daddy' has stepped straight out of a malign cabaret. The poem is seen as a rant against father and husband: 'If I've killed one man, I've killed two/Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.' 'Lady Lazarus' is a far better poem, though also histrionic. What a line for a seductress: 'And I eat men like air.' (Is there any teenage girl who would not enjoy quoting such a line to herself as she set out to a party?) But it is the other boast from the same poem - 'Dying/Is an art, like everything else. I do it exceptionally well' that has become Plath's epitaph. She had a need to be a femme fatale, even if she always knew she was most likely to prove fatal to herself. Her husband Ted Hughes described her as an 'unusual' poet. He said she could be 'intensely artificial' but added that even in her weaker poems she had a 'unique excitement'. There was, he said, a 'sense of a deep mathematical inevitability in the sound and texture of her lines'. It is more than inevitability, it is fatalism. The landscape of Plath's poems is depressed: it is black and white, 'mica silver' or steel, only occasionally interrupted by an assault of scarlet. Emotions, too, are black and white, as if in X-ray: the bones are always on show. Plath did not gild the lily, she blackened it. When other colours appear in her work they are almost hallucinogenic: a green field too radiant to be true; brilliant blue cornflowers; visionary blackberries; blood red poppies that remind her of a woman in an ambulance. Hers is the poetry of damage and of emergency. Over and again bandages appear: 'The wind stops my breath like a bandage,' and 'mother to myself I wake swaddled in gauze...' There is always a sense of a face beneath the skin, endlessly reconstructed, an in-patient. Even the moon is in casualty: 'The moon's crook whitens, thin as the skin seaming a scar.' The moon chaperones Plath indifferently right up to her final poem: 'The moon has nothing to be sad about/Staring from her hood of bone/... She is used to this sort of thing/Her blacks crackle and drag.' And Plath knew she was writing into a void. Her poems were about containment, but they failed her. It is painful to read Ted Hughes, in the introduction to the Collected Poems, describing how Plath told him the first poem in Ariel began with 'love' and the last poem ended with 'Spring'. It is as if there were other, more affirmative poems she wished she could write, just as she wished to be free of herself. Sometimes she writes like a mother, sometimes like an electrified child. But the mother rarely makes it to the end of a poem. 'Child' starts entrancingly: 'Your clear eye is the one absolutely beautiful thing./I want to fill it with colour and ducks,/The zoo of the new...' but the wish doesn't work. The final verse consumes the rest with a 'wringing of hands' and a dark, starless ceiling. It does make her a lesser poet that she occupies one terrifying dimension.

His Anglophiles (and phobes) are marvellously drawn, from Voltaire, whose first impression of England was its 'fine sunny weather', to the Kaiser who, despite his efforts to be a 'super-Prussian', required a steady supply of tea and scones. Buruma's witty and insightful study is all the finer for its use of memoir - he includes his tweedy German grandparents for whom 'the idea of England as a place of refuge was not just propaganda'. Serendipities: Language and Lunacy Umberto Eco Phoenix \u00a36.99, pp164 Buy it at BOL Five short essays in which Eco proposes that 'even errors can produce interesting side effects'. Thus Marco Polo, on meeting a rhino, thinks he has found a unicorn, and ruefully confesses that the mythical creature is not nearly as glamorous as he had been led to expect. Eco's prose is rightly described as 'learned', and as I struggled with some of the more abstruse passages, I tried to find comfort in the author's original thesis. Mondo Desperado Patrick McCabe Picador \u00a36.99, pp229 Buy it at BOL Preconceptions confounded: Mondo Desperado is actually by one 'Phildy Hackball', a shameless hack whose major interests, according to his fraudulent biographical note, are 'having a few jars' and 'relaxing with friends', and who is currently working on a novel 'with plenty of shooting - and a shark!' So it's Hackball who is responsible for such lines as 'This Bruce Lee fellow! To kung fu what Elvis was to rock and roll or a chopsocky fraud in a warm-up suit?' Liberated from the tasteful constraints of quality fiction, McCabe/ Hackball's short-story collection is a cheerful riot of tacky prose and gratuitously surreal situations, like a fast-forward viewing of Father Ted. \u0095 Sophie Harrison The Heart-Shaped Bullet Kathryn Flett Picador \u00a35.99, pp296 Buy it at BOL Kathryn Flett's memoir, based on her Observer columns, is a shockingly honest - and often very funny - account of her 17-month marriage, and her attempt to rebuild her life after her husband's desertion. She recounts the familiar experience of falling in love - the doubts, the wild excitements, the surprises and disappointments - with wit and candour, largely succeeding in the difficult task of rendering a very personal experience compelling as a story. It is not a book for those who feel squeamish about touchy-feely soul-baring, but anyone who has had their heart broken will find Flett a sympathetic and entertaining companion. \u0095 Jane Perry",

Howard was granted unique access to Lowry's estate, which was bequeathed to Carol Ann Lowry, the painter's 'adoptive goddaughter', one of the several young girls Lowry befriended, and who helped to fuel his artistic fantasies.</p> <p>The archive contains Lowry's extensive library and some of the hoarded artefacts that filled his Victorian house on the edge of the Moors. It also includes a series of his obsessively reworked erotic paintings which begin to suggest a different artist to the northern heritage industry's favourite icon.</p> <p>Talking of his book, Howard suggests that the principal challenge was to strip away the perception of Lowry as a marginal, colloquial figure and to re-examine the work. In his lifetime, Lowry was happy to play the uncultured amateur for the London papers as a form of self-protection. As a result, however, he was, early on, characterised as a Sunday painter, and the image has stuck - 'I'm a Sunday painter every day of the week,' he would later say, angrily.</p> <p>Howard's belief was that far from being a unschooled naif, Lowry was closely attuned to contemporary painting and philosophy in Britain and Europe. His forensic study of the archive supported that hunch. Strongly influenced by Van Gogh early in his career Lowry later admired artists such as Magritte and Balthus and saw his own work in a similar private, visionary context.</p> <p>He drew bleak inspiration from Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, which he returned to again and again, and was equally entranced by the Copp\u00e9lia myth, apparently seeing in the ballet of a man who enjoyed the control of a young woman automaton a metaphor for his own methods. The 'old Lancashire saws' he was fond of quoting were often borrowed from Lowry's reading in European philosophy.</p> <p>Far from being a simple social realist, sketching outside the mill gates, Lowry would paint into the early hours most nights, accompanied by the wilder arias of Donizetti or Bellini. 'I wanted to paint myself into what absorbed me,' Lowry was fond of saying. And what absorbed him, Howard shows, 'was an attempt to control that thing which he so feared: the mass of other people, particularly women; life itself'.</p> <p>A large and clumsy boy, Lowry always saw himself as a misfit. 'I didn't like being a child,' he would say, and as an adult he seemed in restless search for his missing boyhood. He would paint a version of himself in crowds, always standing alone, or behind a fence, watching children play.</p> <p>He worried continually about his mental state. In 1951, he confessed to a psychiatrist friend how he would stare for hours at 'empty houses with empty windows standing in isolation on derelict streets...' seeing in those desolate buildings an image of himself, 'yearning to recapture forgotten days of childhood happiness'. The friend characterised him as 'a severely depressed man... who, not knowing how he would get through the day, would find himself somehow, with a brush in his hand, before his easel and with no recollection of having painted what he now saw before him.' </p> <p>Sometimes what he saw before him was very disturbing indeed. Shelley Rohde, whose excellent, updated biography of Lowry takes account of Howard's findings, examines the root of Lowry's depression in his relationship with his mother, a claustrophobic bond that seemed to prevent him developing intimacy with other women.</p> <p>After his father died in 1932, Lowry nursed his 'bedfast' mother until her death seven years later. It was during this time that Lowry began painting what he called his 'horrible heads'. He claimed he had no idea where these images came from. They are anguished figures, bloodshot self-portraits, which bear a close relationship to the work of Edvard Munch.</p> <p>Of one portrait of a wild staring man with crimson eyes, Lowry said that during his mother's illness he would look in his shaving mirror every morning and this was the image he saw staring back at him.</p> <p>More disturbing still were the many paintings and drawings Lowry subsequently made of a recurring sexual fantasy, nearly all of which came to light after his death. The work returns to an image of a dark-haired woman with blackened eyes in fetishistic costume. These women have huge, sadistic collars cutting into their throats, breasts pushed up and out of torturous bodices.</p> <p>In some of the images, the apparently lifeless figures are being manipulated by the hand of an unseen man, like the mannequin of Dr Coppelius. What struck Howard most, when he saw these pictures, he says, was how finished these were, some signed and dated, as if Lowry wanted to incorporate them in the main body of his work.</p> <p>Always a restless reworker of his art, the paintings show evidence of Lowry's most obsessive attention. 'He clearly worked on them for years,' Howard suggests. 'Reclothing them, shortening their skirts, changing their bows and their ribbons... for him, this was a ceaselessly renewable activity and surely linked to his own needs for sexual gratification.'</p> <p>Lowry was always a single man. In a rare candid moment in his seventies, he confessed to one friend: 'I have never married; I have never had a girl, in fact.' In place of adult attachments, he befriended and nurtured young girls with ambitions to be painters, some as young as 12, all with dark hair and dark eyes.</p> <p>Carol Ann Lowry was one of these girls. She had written to him in 1957, at saying she had an interest in art and, since they shared a surname, would he offer her advice? Some months later, he appeared on her doorstep. Long before he met Carol Ann, Lowry had talked often of his 'Ann',an oval-faced girl with kohled eyes and swept back hair; Lowry said he had known 'Ann' in Lytham, and would mention how she had died when she was young.</p> <p>He seemed haunted by her and drew versions of her over and over (an image not dissimilar to Dante Gabriel Rossetti's portraits of Jane Morris which Lowry collected: 'I don't like his women at all,' said Lowry, 'but they fascinate me, like a snake').</p> <p>This idealised Ann, however, it seems, never really existed. But in some respects, Carol Ann came to embody her, as others of Lowry's young friends had embodied her before. Carol Ann described Lowry to Shelley Rohde as: 'More than my father, or my mother, or anyone. He made me... in his image of Ann'. Lowry gave her, she says, 'gifts of character and education'. She called him 'Uncle Laurie' and she never had any reason to think of him other than with respect and love. </p> <p>Some weeks after Lowry died, in 1976, Carol Ann Lowry was summoned to a vault beneath the NatWest bank in Manchester by the executors of Lowry's will (he had left his entire fortune of about \u00a3300,000 to her). There she was shown Lowry's sadistic drawings.</p> <p>Rohde records Carol Ann's reaction to the images. Her first thought was: 'Oh no, no not Uncle Laurie. Please dear God, not Uncle Laurie.' Her second was: 'They are me.' Later, on reflection, she felt that the pictures were more the darker side of that image of Ann for whom she had been apparently just the latest in a series of models.</p> <p>The erotic work led Howard to look at X-rays of other Lowry's paintings and what he discovered was even more surprising. Erased from Lowry's paintings were further versions of this tortured image. An innocent looking street scene revealed a version of a mannequin; stilettos and bodices emerged half-submerged in seascapes.</p> <p>The difficulty Howard faced on seeing these works was how to incorporate them into the main body of Lowry's art. Far from being a blind alley, they seemed to offer a clue to the painter's method in more familiar pieces. Through his work during 42 years as a rent collector, a job he typically kept secret from the press, Lowry was intimate with the secret lives of the subjects of his work, Manchester's urban poor. Throughout his life, however, he would refer to the 'matchstick men and women' in his pictures as figures to be manipulated, doll-like.</p> <p>Howard suggests that the erotic figures of Lowry's imagination were simply a 'continuation of the practice of reducing people and the outside world to toys and automata'. This controlling obsession fed too into Lowry's self-confessed love of the grotesque. In order to come to terms with the fear and strangeness of the world, Lowry needed to capture and contain it in his art. He exhibited a Diane Arbus-like fascination with the halt and the lame; he populated many of his paintings with cripples, and would spend afternoons in Piccadilly Gardens talking to the down-and-outs, partly out of compassion but in part to allow himself a hollow, Beckett-like laugh at the human condition.</p> <p>'There is a grotesque streak in me. I just can't help it,' he would say. 'I'm attracted to sadness, and there are some very sad things you see.' To children, who tend to tend to love his paintings, Lowry has, in Howard's terms, always been a 'spooky painter'.</p> <p>Seen in this context, the familiar urban landscapes, which he abandoned almost as soon as they became 'successful', also take on a personal, dreamlike quality. The apparently corporeal figures trudging to or from the mill, 'ghostly figures which tenant these courts and laneways, which seem to me so beautiful,' seem evidence not of Lowry's social realism but efforts to hold the strangeness of the world in check.</p> <p>Lowry never painted people at work, but the gaps at the beginning and end of days - Eliot's evening 'spread out against the sky, like a patient etherised on a table'. Where were these people drifting off to? To the pubs he rarely visited? The families he didn't have?</p> <p>Lowry seemed ever restless for the answer to these questions, a voyeur of his own voyeurism. As an old man, Lowry would stare out to sea and question the tides. In his eighties, he painted a series of seascapes, including phallic structures rising from the waves, which he called self-portraits.</p> <p>His question of his work always was: 'Will it last? Will I live?' In recent years, it has been unfashionable to take his painting too seriously. Howard's book and the new gallery invites us to look at Lowry again. What we see could well come as something of a shock.</p>",

Where were these people drifting off to? To the pubs he rarely visited? The families he didn't have? Lowry seemed ever restless for the answer to these questions, a voyeur of his own voyeurism. As an old man, Lowry would stare out to sea and question the tides. In his eighties, he painted a series of seascapes, including phallic structures rising from the waves, which he called self-portraits. His question of his work always was: 'Will it last? Will I live?' In recent years, it has been unfashionable to take his painting too seriously. Howard's book and the new gallery invites us to look at Lowry again. What we see could well come as something of a shock.",

He not only collected them obsessively but invented techniques to make their classification more precise. This volume brings together technical papers and butterfly-themed passages from his work. The closest comparable case of a major author having world eminence in another expertise would be A.E. Housman, who emended corrupt classical texts with the same analytical exquisiteness that Nabokov used to revise the classification of butterflies, according to the details of their dissected genitals. </p> <p>Classical philology is hardly a more popular or accessible pursuit than lepidoptery, but the volume (edited by Christopher Ricks), which includes passages from Housman's technical writings as well as the poems, is an outstanding success. </p> <p>The advantages of that book over this one were that it was wieldy, that it never left the domain of culture and that it showed a side of the writer absent from his verse. The slyly fatalistic persona of the poet made a fascinating contrast with the professor of Latin, who was a doughty if not brutal scrapper, and never split a hair in argument if there was a chance of splitting the person to whom it was attached. </p> <p>When Nabokov wrote in 1947 that his scientific papers 'have no interest whatever for the layman', he was expressing pride as much as melancholy. Any reader would enjoy the passage reprinted here from his novel, The Gift, about the living arrangements of those large blues which have 'concluded a barbaric pact' with ants: 'I saw how an ant, greedily tickling a hind segment of that caterpillar's sluglike little body, forced it to excrete a drop of intoxicant juice, which it swallowed immediately. In compensation, it offered its own larvae as food; it was as if cows gave us Chartreuse and we gave them our infants to eat.' </p> <p>His prose, though, is impenetrable even when there are touches of the same precise fancy dimly detectable: 'The most conspicuous thing about the upper portion is the presence of a pair of formidable semi-transparent hooks [the subunci or falces of a peculiar shape not found in allied genera], produced from the opposite side of the distally twinned uncus and facing each other in the manner of the stolidly raised fists of two pugilists [of the old school] with the uncus hoods adding a Ku Klux Klan touch to the picture.' </p> <p> Nabokov's Butterflies is edited and annotated by Brian Boyd, a professor of English (and biographer of Nabokov) and Robert Michael Pyle, a lepidopterist, each of whom provides a substantial introduction. The editors find a harmony in Nabokov between artist and scientist - and it would be nice if there were traces of that virtue in their collaboration. There is overlap and contradiction in their opening remarks. </p> <p>The literature man might usefully have advised the butterfly man to pitch his essay consistently. On one page, we are advanced students, not needing to be reminded of the meaning of 'phenology'. On another, we are back in primary school, struggling to understand the advantages of a system of classification, and asked to imagine 'running a big city without telephones'. </p> <p>In return, Pyle could have suggested that Boyd not gloss over the crucial hostility towards evolutionary theory in Nabokov's scientific work. </p> <p>Mimicry, about which Nabokov wanted to write an ambitious book, seemed to him impossible to explain in evolutionary terms. Boyd remarks only on the likelihood that 'had he begun serious work on mimicry, he would have found sufficient evidence of purely physical explanations to be forced to abandon his dearly-held metaphysical speculations'. </p> <p>Pyle isn't so sure, or rather - bizarrely - he asserts (citing no source) that Brian Boyd 'is not so sure, suspecting Nabokov might well have counter-argued in ways no one would have guessed'. A writer who famously 'confessed' (Speak, Memory) that he did not believe in time was always going to resist an explanation of life that requires nothing else. What is striking in Nabokov's Butterflies is the consistency of his opposition to scientific orthodoxy. </p> <p>He asserts that mimicry, by the gratuitous splendour of its imitations, disproves evolution, in fiction, memoir and scientific paper. In an essay on Lysandracormion, he uses such heretical phrases as 'the secret decrees of nature', while also giving that agency a whiff of Detroit by talking not of genetic variations but of 'bringing out' particular 'makes' of butterfly. </p> <p>Nabokov seems to interpret mimicry as an artificial flaw in an aesthetic design, a clue left for those able to see it. The amount of emotion he invested in the metaphysics of lepidoptery - his special sense that mimicry proved an exemption from determinism - would be hard to underestimate. Temperamentally, he hated system as much as he loved pattern, and it would be shattering for him to find the enemy in the stronghold of his beloved system underlying pattern. </p> <p>Nabokov ruled out of court any psychological reading of his life or work (and his critics largely oblige), but is it so surprising that the ambitious book on mimicry which would settle the matter never got written? </p> <p>He visualised a 'high ridge', where the mountainside of scientific knowledge could join the opposite slope of artistic imagination, but the winds up there are high also, and no hiker, not even the most experienced, can guarantee to keep his footing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nabokov's Butterflies Annotated and edited by Brian Boyd and Robert Michael Pyle Allen Lane \u00a325, pp783 Buy it at BOL Books Unlimited author page Vladimir Nabokov was an expert on butterflies. He not only collected them obsessively but invented techniques to make their classification more precise. This volume brings together technical papers and butterfly-themed passages from his work. The closest comparable case of a major author having world eminence in another expertise would be A.E. Housman, who emended corrupt classical texts with the same analytical exquisiteness that Nabokov used to revise the classification of butterflies, according to the details of their dissected genitals. Classical philology is hardly a more popular or accessible pursuit than lepidoptery, but the volume (edited by Christopher Ricks), which includes passages from Housman's technical writings as well as the poems, is an outstanding success. The advantages of that book over this one were that it was wieldy, that it never left the domain of culture and that it showed a side of the writer absent from his verse. The slyly fatalistic persona of the poet made a fascinating contrast with the professor of Latin, who was a doughty if not brutal scrapper, and never split a hair in argument if there was a chance of splitting the person to whom it was attached. When Nabokov wrote in 1947 that his scientific papers 'have no interest whatever for the layman', he was expressing pride as much as melancholy. Any reader would enjoy the passage reprinted here from his novel, The Gift, about the living arrangements of those large blues which have 'concluded a barbaric pact' with ants: 'I saw how an ant, greedily tickling a hind segment of that caterpillar's sluglike little body, forced it to excrete a drop of intoxicant juice, which it swallowed immediately. In compensation, it offered its own larvae as food; it was as if cows gave us Chartreuse and we gave them our infants to eat.' His prose, though, is impenetrable even when there are touches of the same precise fancy dimly detectable: 'The most conspicuous thing about the upper portion is the presence of a pair of formidable semi-transparent hooks [the subunci or falces of a peculiar shape not found in allied genera], produced from the opposite side of the distally twinned uncus and facing each other in the manner of the stolidly raised fists of two pugilists [of the old school] with the uncus hoods adding a Ku Klux Klan touch to the picture.' Nabokov's Butterflies is edited and annotated by Brian Boyd, a professor of English (and biographer of Nabokov) and Robert Michael Pyle, a lepidopterist, each of whom provides a substantial introduction. The editors find a harmony in Nabokov between artist and scientist - and it would be nice if there were traces of that virtue in their collaboration. There is overlap and contradiction in their opening remarks. The literature man might usefully have advised the butterfly man to pitch his essay consistently. On one page, we are advanced students, not needing to be reminded of the meaning of 'phenology'. On another, we are back in primary school, struggling to understand the advantages of a system of classification, and asked to imagine 'running a big city without telephones'. In return, Pyle could have suggested that Boyd not gloss over the crucial hostility towards evolutionary theory in Nabokov's scientific work. Mimicry, about which Nabokov wanted to write an ambitious book, seemed to him impossible to explain in evolutionary terms. Boyd remarks only on the likelihood that 'had he begun serious work on mimicry, he would have found sufficient evidence of purely physical explanations to be forced to abandon his dearly-held metaphysical speculations'. Pyle isn't so sure, or rather - bizarrely - he asserts (citing no source) that Brian Boyd 'is not so sure, suspecting Nabokov might well have counter-argued in ways no one would have guessed'. A writer who famously 'confessed' (Speak, Memory) that he did not believe in time was always going to resist an explanation of life that requires nothing else. What is striking in Nabokov's Butterflies is the consistency of his opposition to scientific orthodoxy. He asserts that mimicry, by the gratuitous splendour of its imitations, disproves evolution, in fiction, memoir and scientific paper. In an essay on Lysandracormion, he uses such heretical phrases as 'the secret decrees of nature', while also giving that agency a whiff of Detroit by talking not of genetic variations but of 'bringing out' particular 'makes' of butterfly. Nabokov seems to interpret mimicry as an artificial flaw in an aesthetic design, a clue left for those able to see it. The amount of emotion he invested in the metaphysics of lepidoptery - his special sense that mimicry proved an exemption from determinism - would be hard to underestimate. Temperamentally, he hated system as much as he loved pattern, and it would be shattering for him to find the enemy in the stronghold of his beloved system underlying pattern. Nabokov ruled out of court any psychological reading of his life or work (and his critics largely oblige), but is it so surprising that the ambitious book on mimicry which would settle the matter never got written? He visualised a 'high ridge', where the mountainside of scientific knowledge could join the opposite slope of artistic imagination, but the winds up there are high also, and no hiker, not even the most experienced, can guarantee to keep his footing.",

In the Seventies, the Americans poured development funds into Afghanistan to counter growing Russian influence; throughout the Eighties, they funded the Afghan resistance (particularly its hardline Islamist factions); in the Nineties, Washington's policy aim, Rashid says, was to isolate Russia and Iran by ensuring a stable environment to allow an oil pipeline to be built from central Asia to Pakistan through Afghanistan. Currently, they only care about Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born terrorist being sheltered by the Taliban. </p> <p>The most interesting thing about the Taliban is that they focus a complex ethical debate.

But by the summer of l965 she was a wreck, and fled home to Port Arthur, weighing only six stone. She spent a year at home, cleaning up and seriously trying to be good. Her old classmates suddenly saw her wearing frocks and make-up, with her hair neatly tied in a bun, playing canasta and painting a Nativity mural for her parents' porch.

The ephemeral Brice was based on White's long-time lover Hubert Sorin, who died of Aids, aged 32, before White completed the book.

White brings to the wasting of his lover's body the same forensic attention that he has always reserved for the physicality of his descriptions of lovemaking.</p> <p>To begin with, though, it is the narrator, Austin, in whom our sympathies are rooted. Austin, who like White, has long been 'seriopositive' without developing Aids, has an apartment on the \u00cele St Louis, and White uses the misty magic of that place as a touchstone for his sense of the 'posthumous, post-diagnosis, foreign days' that he spends among the camp banter of young circle of friends, mostly former lovers.</p> <p>The sparkle of his past lust is pricked on summer evenings with the fairy-lit bateau-mouches passing his window, telling the story of the river in five languages; that life, however, has given way to dark nights crossing the Pont Marie 'with its empty statue niches looking down on the Seine, black and shiny as mined coal between tourist boats, more and more widely spaced as midnight and the winter solstice drew nearer'.</p> <p>Meeting Julien changes all of this.

By the end of it or by the time you fall asleep - whichever comes first - all your prejudices will have been deliciously confirmed. </p> <p>Jeffrey Archer is living proof of the old adage that when people write fiction, they show their true colours. In this collection of 14 short stories, the disgraced former Conservative Party deputy chairman plunders his colourful past to reveal himself as a man obsessed with money, preferably in brown envelopes, deceit, champagne and other men's wives who dress up like Shepherd's Market whores. </p> <p>He even helps the reader out by marking with asterisks those tales which 'I would like to acknowledge are based on true incidents'. This is more than half the stories. Thanks, Jeffrey. </p> <p>Readers now know exactly what Archer's idea of a good time is. He goes out on a bright, crisp spring morning and runs into a woman he has admired from afar for years. She is called something girly like Susie and has 'long, fair hair, blue eyes, a captivating smile and slim figure'. </p> <p>She 'greets me with a long hug, an \"I feel I know you better already\" hug.' The two agree to have lunch. He tries 'a chat-up line I've used many times in the past' - 'If you could do anything in the world right now, what would it be?' She says she wants to go to Paris. </p> <p>'That's my perfect day, too,' our hero declares, before the two agree to pack and meet at Waterloo Station.

By the end of it or by the time you fall asleep - whichever comes first - all your prejudices will have been deliciously confirmed. Jeffrey Archer is living proof of the old adage that when people write fiction, they show their true colours. In this collection of 14 short stories, the disgraced former Conservative Party deputy chairman plunders his colourful past to reveal himself as a man obsessed with money, preferably in brown envelopes, deceit, champagne and other men's wives who dress up like Shepherd's Market whores. He even helps the reader out by marking with asterisks those tales which 'I would like to acknowledge are based on true incidents'. This is more than half the stories. Thanks, Jeffrey. Readers now know exactly what Archer's idea of a good time is. He goes out on a bright, crisp spring morning and runs into a woman he has admired from afar for years. She is called something girly like Susie and has 'long, fair hair, blue eyes, a captivating smile and slim figure'. She 'greets me with a long hug, an \"I feel I know you better already\" hug.' The two agree to have lunch. He tries 'a chat-up line I've used many times in the past' - 'If you could do anything in the world right now, what would it be?' She says she wants to go to Paris. 'That's my perfect day, too,' our hero declares, before the two agree to pack and meet at Waterloo Station. On the Eurostar, she gives him 'a hug that was a definite step towards \"I can't wait to get your clothes off\".' He takes her to a little restaurant 'that prides itself on not being in any of the tourist guides' and where the m\u00e2itre d' is an old friend. As the last legs of the champagne bubble down the flutes, the two leave for 'my favourite hotel'. To please him, Archer's 'lady' dresses up in a see-through blouse, skintight leather skirt, fishnet stockings, stilettos and shocking pink lipstick. In bed, she is 'everything a man could ask - exciting, tender, provocative, teasing and, for an exquisite moment, a rampant whore'. He does not say how he performed but enjoys ridiculing her husband - Angus - as 'an old prune'. Back in London, their 'lovemaking' continues apace. They do it in the back seat of his Mercedes in an NCP car-park in Mayfair, in the service lift in Harrods, the loo at Le Caprice and in a box in the dress circle at Covent Garden.

He savours his conquest: 'I have always considered it ignoble for any man to discuss a lady as if she were simply a trophy but I must confess... it had been well worth the waiting.' If the asterisked plotlines in this collection of scammy tales - 'Crime Pays', 'Too Many Coincidences', 'Something for Nothing', 'The Endgame', 'The Reclining Woman' - are to be believed, Susie's husband, 'old prune' Angus, will conveniently keel over with a heart attack, leaving her the \u00a320 million he has made tricking businesses into paying for phoney advertisements. Our hero will marry Susie, use her fortune to make even more money with a spot of insider trading, before forcing her into the arms of another, divorcing her and using his detailed knowledge of Channel Island laws to make off with a third of her estate.

Last week David Irving took time off to give this revealing and forthright interview to celebrated American author  Gerald Posner. He remains defiant, unapologetic and more outspoken than ever</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'Those are Adolf Eichmann's personal papers and diaries, the ones the Israelis didn't find when they kidnapped him,' says David Irving, casually pointing to a stack of papers strewn on his kitchen table. His flat is overflowing with books, documents, files, as well as World War II memorabilia. 'They are more interesting than the Eichmann papers Israel just released to help the defence. They are desperate and clutching at straws.' </p> <p>Irving, 62, relishes the limelight and tweaking his foes. He is thoroughly enjoying the fallout from his high-profile libel lawsuit against Penguin publishers and American Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt. After much prodding, he has agreed to a rare break in his round-the-clock trial work to see me in his sprawling Mayfair townhouse flat. 'After my closing argument in the trial,' he declares, 'I shall give no further interviews. This is probably the last one. I need to get back to my writing after a three-year hiatus.'</p> <p>Irving remains unrepentant. In three weeks time he will discover if his libel action will salvage his reputation or mark him as permanently ruined. Following closing arguments last week, and while the the judge considers his verdict, one might expect Irving to be circumspect and politically correct. But that is not his style. Instead he seems determined to take on his foes and to reiterate his strident views. </p> <p>He leads me into his study. There, he sat directly in front of a large colour overhead photograph of Crematorium Two at Auschwitz: 'That's the holy of holies,' says Irving, jabbing one of his pudgy fingers toward the photo. 'No one was gassed there. The stories from survivors where someone says they used to take off the manhole covers and then the gas poured in, it's all false.' </p> <p>He enjoys, as he puts it, 'deglamorising and deromanticising' the Holocaust. 'The Poles have admitted that the only gas chamber at Auschwitz is a reconstruction built by them in 1948. It's only a damn tourist attraction.' </p> <p>The charges start coming rapid fire. Although Irving relishes his status as a contrarian and historic mischief-maker, he desperately wants to be accepted as a serious historian. And he is anxious to demonstrate that instead of being cowed by the battery of legal talent defending Lipstadt, he is defiant and unbowed. For the next hour, he launches into a rather remarkable defence of his own conclusions as well as an extraordinary attack on the foundations of the Holocaust. In a virtual monologue, peppered occasionally with German phrases, he rattled off contentions almost faster than I could type them into my notebook computer. </p> <p>'All Auschwitz survivors are now useless witnesses at any trial since they have all seen Spielberg's Schindler's List, and can recite from memory where the supposed shower heads with gas were.' When he says something he particularly likes, his yellow teeth flash as his thin lips part in a devilish grin. </p> <p>And he does not back away from some of the extreme statements and acts attributed to him, although he often tries to deflect their importance by casting it as prankish humour. Yes, there were swizzle sticks adorned with little swastikas at his 1991 book party, but 'those were really nothing more than copies of Hitler's personal standard that my publisher had made up for the launch of my book.' (The late Alan Clark was according to Irving, 'a great admirer of Hitler. He sat in that very chair that you are in right before my party started and told me in depth about his admiration for Hitler.') </p> <p>What about a little ditty found in the voluminous personal diaries produced in the trial: </p> <p> 'I am a Baby Aryan, <br>Not a Jewish or sectarian, <br>I have no plans to marry, <br>An Ape or Rastafarian. </p> <p> 'Yes, that was mine. But I wrote it because of the bounce of the words and they rhyme, not the content. They say it makes me a racist. Well, that is all they got from my diaries. There are 20 million words in those diaries, and these are 20. So that makes me what - 0.0001 per cent racist?' After a moment's hesitation, he adds, 'But I do now wish I had used vegetarian instead of Rastafarian.' </p> <p>He comes alive when he talks about the trial, the forces he sees arrayed against him, and what he believes he is accomplishing in courtroom 73 of the High Court. </p> <p>'I have been singled out,' Irving says as he sets forth a grand conspiracy he believes operates against him. 'There has been, for years, a co-ordinated effort to demolish my legitimacy as a historian. It is an international endeavour. It is the international network of the Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the Austrian Jewish Congress, the American Jewish Committee, and a number of others.</p> <p>'These are some of the traditional enemies of truth. These are all bodies that Lipstadt thanks in her book. They always use the slime defence against me. It is expensive for them, with so many lawyers and experts, but they mount it. In any case, Jews should be asking not who pulled the trigger, but why? When the Nazis asked the Slovaks, the Hungarians, the Czechs, and others to give over their Jews, everyone did so gladly. Why did the Americans and Roosevelt refuse to let the St. Louis dock? What is it about these people that no one wanted them?' </p> <p>It it vintage Irving. He deflects the query about why many respected organisations have taken such a keen interest in his handling of history and instead turns the discussion into a rhetorical question about the nature of Jews, one that he is prepared to answer. Although he is adamant that he is not a racist or anti-Semite, no sooner had he posed the question than he provided an answer that is chillingly reminiscent of the anti-Semitic themes that have persisted for centuries. 'Greed.' He pauses, letting the word virtually hang in the room.</p> <p>'Fifty years from now you might well have the same problem in the United States. The Jewish \u00e9lite in America is filling the same positions they held in the Weimar republic during the 1920s and 1930s - controlling the big banks, the film business, media, and the like. The Jews disproportionately held all these big positions in Germany. It's a mirror image in the US. And it will evoke howls of rage from the ordinary citizens who are kept out of the power \u00e9lite.' </p> <p>Irving's charge about the 'Jewish \u00e9lite in America' sounds remarkably similar to that made by the most extreme right-wing race baiters in the US, and it is surprising to hear him say it publicly, especially since his courtroom persona has been that of the measured historian who only has a difference of opinion with other historians. </p> <p>Although he has been forced to admit at trial that he greatly underestimated the number of Jews killed in mobile gas vans (97,000 died that way), he finds solace in his belief - which almost no courtroom observer shares - that he has made great strides in demonstrating that Auschwitz's Crematorium Two, the site of half a million deaths, is 'a mere legend'. </p> <p>'It is the geocentre of the supposed death factory,' says Irving, his voice rising slightly as he becomes more excited. 'But I have pictures that show there were no holes in the ceiling, so there was no place for the gas to come from.' </p> <p>'What about the large quantities of Zyklon B gas that were shipped to Auschwitz?' I ask. </p> <p>His answer is the classic defence of hardcore revisionists. 'Yes, huge quantities of Zyklon B were shipped there.

      "bodyText": "'Those are Adolf Eichmann's personal papers and diaries, the ones the Israelis didn't find when they kidnapped him,' says David Irving, casually pointing to a stack of papers strewn on his kitchen table. His flat is overflowing with books, documents, files, as well as World War II memorabilia. 'They are more interesting than the Eichmann papers Israel just released to help the defence. They are desperate and clutching at straws.' Irving, 62, relishes the limelight and tweaking his foes. He is thoroughly enjoying the fallout from his high-profile libel lawsuit against Penguin publishers and American Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt. After much prodding, he has agreed to a rare break in his round-the-clock trial work to see me in his sprawling Mayfair townhouse flat. 'After my closing argument in the trial,' he declares, 'I shall give no further interviews. This is probably the last one. I need to get back to my writing after a three-year hiatus.' Irving remains unrepentant. In three weeks time he will discover if his libel action will salvage his reputation or mark him as permanently ruined. Following closing arguments last week, and while the the judge considers his verdict, one might expect Irving to be circumspect and politically correct. But that is not his style. Instead he seems determined to take on his foes and to reiterate his strident views. He leads me into his study. There, he sat directly in front of a large colour overhead photograph of Crematorium Two at Auschwitz: 'That's the holy of holies,' says Irving, jabbing one of his pudgy fingers toward the photo. 'No one was gassed there. The stories from survivors where someone says they used to take off the manhole covers and then the gas poured in, it's all false.' He enjoys, as he puts it, 'deglamorising and deromanticising' the Holocaust. 'The Poles have admitted that the only gas chamber at Auschwitz is a reconstruction built by them in 1948. It's only a damn tourist attraction.' The charges start coming rapid fire. Although Irving relishes his status as a contrarian and historic mischief-maker, he desperately wants to be accepted as a serious historian. And he is anxious to demonstrate that instead of being cowed by the battery of legal talent defending Lipstadt, he is defiant and unbowed. For the next hour, he launches into a rather remarkable defence of his own conclusions as well as an extraordinary attack on the foundations of the Holocaust. In a virtual monologue, peppered occasionally with German phrases, he rattled off contentions almost faster than I could type them into my notebook computer. 'All Auschwitz survivors are now useless witnesses at any trial since they have all seen Spielberg's Schindler's List, and can recite from memory where the supposed shower heads with gas were.' When he says something he particularly likes, his yellow teeth flash as his thin lips part in a devilish grin. And he does not back away from some of the extreme statements and acts attributed to him, although he often tries to deflect their importance by casting it as prankish humour. Yes, there were swizzle sticks adorned with little swastikas at his 1991 book party, but 'those were really nothing more than copies of Hitler's personal standard that my publisher had made up for the launch of my book.' (The late Alan Clark was according to Irving, 'a great admirer of Hitler. He sat in that very chair that you are in right before my party started and told me in depth about his admiration for Hitler.') What about a little ditty found in the voluminous personal diaries produced in the trial: 'I am a Baby Aryan, Not a Jewish or sectarian, I have no plans to marry, An Ape or Rastafarian. 'Yes, that was mine. But I wrote it because of the bounce of the words and they rhyme, not the content. They say it makes me a racist. Well, that is all they got from my diaries. There are 20 million words in those diaries, and these are 20. So that makes me what - 0.0001 per cent racist?' After a moment's hesitation, he adds, 'But I do now wish I had used vegetarian instead of Rastafarian.' He comes alive when he talks about the trial, the forces he sees arrayed against him, and what he believes he is accomplishing in courtroom 73 of the High Court. 'I have been singled out,' Irving says as he sets forth a grand conspiracy he believes operates against him. 'There has been, for years, a co-ordinated effort to demolish my legitimacy as a historian. It is an international endeavour. It is the international network of the Anti-Defamation League, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the Austrian Jewish Congress, the American Jewish Committee, and a number of others. 'These are some of the traditional enemies of truth. These are all bodies that Lipstadt thanks in her book. They always use the slime defence against me. It is expensive for them, with so many lawyers and experts, but they mount it. In any case, Jews should be asking not who pulled the trigger, but why? When the Nazis asked the Slovaks, the Hungarians, the Czechs, and others to give over their Jews, everyone did so gladly. Why did the Americans and Roosevelt refuse to let the St. Louis dock? What is it about these people that no one wanted them?' It it vintage Irving. He deflects the query about why many respected organisations have taken such a keen interest in his handling of history and instead turns the discussion into a rhetorical question about the nature of Jews, one that he is prepared to answer. Although he is adamant that he is not a racist or anti-Semite, no sooner had he posed the question than he provided an answer that is chillingly reminiscent of the anti-Semitic themes that have persisted for centuries. 'Greed.' He pauses, letting the word virtually hang in the room. 'Fifty years from now you might well have the same problem in the United States. The Jewish \u00e9lite in America is filling the same positions they held in the Weimar republic during the 1920s and 1930s - controlling the big banks, the film business, media, and the like. The Jews disproportionately held all these big positions in Germany. It's a mirror image in the US. And it will evoke howls of rage from the ordinary citizens who are kept out of the power \u00e9lite.' Irving's charge about the 'Jewish \u00e9lite in America' sounds remarkably similar to that made by the most extreme right-wing race baiters in the US, and it is surprising to hear him say it publicly, especially since his courtroom persona has been that of the measured historian who only has a difference of opinion with other historians. Although he has been forced to admit at trial that he greatly underestimated the number of Jews killed in mobile gas vans (97,000 died that way), he finds solace in his belief - which almost no courtroom observer shares - that he has made great strides in demonstrating that Auschwitz's Crematorium Two, the site of half a million deaths, is 'a mere legend'. 'It is the geocentre of the supposed death factory,' says Irving, his voice rising slightly as he becomes more excited. 'But I have pictures that show there were no holes in the ceiling, so there was no place for the gas to come from.' 'What about the large quantities of Zyklon B gas that were shipped to Auschwitz?' I ask. His answer is the classic defence of hardcore revisionists. 'Yes, huge quantities of Zyklon B were shipped there. The appropriate quantities for fumigation, especially with the camp's typhus epidemics and problems with pest control.' My expression shows my scepticism. 'Look,' he continues. 'Zyklon B may have been used against prisoners. I don't know. But I know crematorium 2 was not an enormous gas chamber.' Although he says the debate over how many were killed by the Nazis is not important, he enjoys contending that 'only 100,000 Jews may have died at Auschwitz,' most from diseases, and the rest from shootings and hangings. Then, as though his very minor concession about the possible use of gas ran against his spirit, he picked up again in a vitriolic mode. 'Jewish leaders have hijacked the word 'holocaust.' It's even spelt everywhere with a capital H. My Jewish editor in New York would not let me use the word in my book Hitler's War to describe the Allied bombing of Dresden.

You either have to buy it or not, and if you don't buy it, what a headache.' Now Irving's face is flushed red. His speech is rapid.

Tomorrow, the august trade body hosts a grand City reception aimed at portraying German investment in Britain in the warmest light. But by the time the reminder was dropping on newsdesks last week, BMW - Germany's biggest UK investor by far - had been secretly negotiating its humiliating and bloody retreat for five long months. </p> <p>The latest chapter in Rover's turbulent history was written in a modern, three- storey office block in London's fashionable Covent Garden. Last October, when Jon Moulton and colleagues from venture capital firm Alchemy flew to BMW's imposing Munich headquarters, they expected the meeting in the four cylinder-shaped building to be short but not especially sweet. But in Helmut Panke, BMW's finance director, the Alchemy team found an audience more than eager to listen to their plans. </p> <p>'We expected to be shown the door. Instead, we spent two hours batting back and forth motor car strategy,' Moulton said this weekend in an interview with The Observer. 'Most of our deals walk in off the street. But the creative input for this one came from right here. We just thought, hell, BMW must have been really, really hurting with Rover just then.' </p> <p>And no wonder. Since 1994, when BMW bought Rover for \u00a3800 million from British Aerospace, the Germans have invested \u00a33 billion in the old British Leyland carmaker's sprawling plants at Longbridge, Cowley and Land Rover at Solihull. The audacious move was meant to spearhead BMW's attempted drive into the middle and mass markets to complement its upmarket, luxury marque. Instead, Rover visited nothing but tears, blood and peri odic bouts of fratricide on the BMW board. </p> <p>Losses last year leapt to \u00a3725m, hit by sterling's strength and consumer resistance to a tarnished brand name. It was hard to forecast when Rover would ever make a profit. And so thoroughly disenchanted had BMW become by the end of the millennium that its infamously professional German managers had started to take their eyes off the ball. </p> <p>At Rover's biggest plant, Longbridge, which employs 9,000 workers, the 140,000-car-a-year production is now running at one-and-a-half times annual sales. As a result, more than 50,000 Rover 25 and 45 models are lined up in fields waiting for a buyer, increasing Rover's losses - and BMW's grief - by the day. Precisely how many, however, no one at BMW or Alchemy seems to know: the venture capitalists are sending for satellite photos to count the stock this weekend. </p> <p>'It's a mess. We know they've had stock control and production problems,' Moulton said. 'It's almost impossible to reconcile. They have a great German business [and] a great American business. But here, quite apart from the cultural problems, they just didn't have the right mindset for the mass market.' </p> <p>Much has been made of Alchemy's lack of any experience in the motor industry. In its three-year existence, the firm's highest-profile buyout has been Fads, the DIY chain. Behind the scenes, however, Moulton tried three years ago to buy Lotus from General Motors, but was pipped at the post by Proton, the Malaysian car group. </p> <p>He has since kept his idea alive: the launch of a new range of medium-volume British sports and saloon cars. The deal with BMW now realises the dream by another route: the MG brand. </p> <p>'We spent a long time trying to buy Lotus,' Moulton said. 'We know this business well. We will be small and agile and ahead of the technology curve. Of course, no one in their right mind would start from here. But we have to create an optimal business from a sub-optimal start. That's why we call ourselves Alchemy.' </p> <p>For months, in total secrecy, Moulton's team and Panke's accountants at BMW thrashed out various options for BMW's exit. Whether, for instance, in addition to Longbridge and its 9,000 workers, it should take the Cow ley plant, which employs another 3,500 near Oxford. Or the factory at Swindon, where another 2,500 staff make Rover body panels. After Thursday's outline deal, however - which will see Alchemy's new MG Motor Company take over Longbridge, the MG marque, MGF sports car, the old Mini and Rover's 25, 45 and new 75 models - the future of the other two plants is uncertain. </p> <p>For the moment, BMW is to keep Cowley to produce its new Mini - the last attempt, together with a brand new \u00a3400m engine plant at Hams Hall in the Midlands, to salvage something from the Rover d\u00e9bcle. But industry experts predict BMW may be storing up more problems for itself from its expensive British base. Over the next two years, Cowley's production of the Rover 75 will transfer to Longbridge, making more jobs vulnerable. Swindon, meanwhile, may be sold to Mayflower, the independent automotive engineering company which already produces panels for the MGF. </p> <p>Throughout Alchemy's long drawn-out negotiations there was one no-go area. The venture capitalists did not have the resources to stump up the \u00a32 billion to buy Land Rover. </p> <p>The world's best-known four-wheel drive brand had been one of the main attractions of Rover to the Germans. And, with worldwide sales of the Land Rover range reaching a record 178,000 last year, it was the one undoubted success story of BMW's British misadventure. Friday's \u00a31.8bn sale of Land Rover to Ford, therefore, came as yet another shock to the public. But not to Alchemy. 'When we first discussed how they could do this months ago,' Moulton told <strong> The </strong> <strong> Observer, </strong> 'we said your write-off on Rover will be \u00a32bn. But Land Rover's worth \u00a32bn, so you're even.' </p> <p>It may now seem less curious that, largely unremarked, BMW has also been developing its own four-wheel drive model, the X-5, independently of Land Rover. </p> <p>The timing of last week's dramatic events was in fact dictated by the deal with Ford, not by the one with Alchemy. Last Mon day, when Moulton was due in Munich again, he assumed it was for more routine negotiations. Instead, to his surprise, Panke pushed for a quick deal. The Americans were clearly ready.

By then, the powerful Quandt family, BMW's biggest shareholders, who previously had supported the pro-Rover faction on the board, had also seen enough. </p> <p>Moulton hopes to complete the deal in six weeks, and is as coy on precise financial detail as he is on the likely job losses at Longbridge. Some industry experts predict that by the time the life of the current Rover range expires in a few years' time, the MG Car Company may employ as few as 1,000 workers out of the 9,000 current employees. </p> <p>The risk, though, to Alchemy will be strictly limited. The firm will invest no more than \u00a350m, and will get the \u00a31bn factory debt-free. BMW, meanwhile, has written off \u00a31.9bn. It will also be stumping up the money for future wages and development by giving Alchemy the 50,000-plus vehicles in stock, which are worth up to \u00a3500m. </p> <p>So there you have it.

      "bodyText": "Rover's German boss has apologised for lying to the British Government about the death sentence hanging over the Longbridge car plant. The Germans kept the Cabinet in the dark because they say their plans, leading to thousands of job losses, were 'market sensitive'. The implied insult that Ministers and officials could not be trusted with a commercial secret has added to the Government's fury over BMW's handling of the Longbridge sale. Tony Blair, who is said to have been shaking with anger when he heard the news, after the decision was made, is expected to have angry words with German Chancellor Gerhart Schroder, when they meet at an EU summit in Lisbon this week. Rover chairman, Werner Saman, had a face-to-face meeting with Trade Secretary Stephen Byers less than a week before BMW's board decided to sell Rover Cars. He raised BMW's now familiar complaint about the strength of the pound, which is making it difficult to sell British cars on the Continent, but denied that anything that would affect UK car production was up for discussion. When the two met again in Longbridge on Friday, Byers accused him of being deliberately misleading, and was given an apology. According to an eye witness: 'He said the reason he didn't give the information was that it was market sensitive at the time. But the Department is continually receiving market sensitive information so that any problems can be dealt with as they come up.' The war of words between the British government and the car manufacturers reflect government fears of mass unemployment and political damage for Labour in the West Midlands. Yesterday, Byers claimed it was not too late to find someone else who would take over car production at Longbridge. On his way into the first meeting of a government-backed task force to deal with the impact of the sale, Byers said: 'There is nothing to stop someone coming along and putting in a new offer with BMW.' But officials and union leaders are resigned to the prospect that Longbridge will be taken over by Alchemy Partners, and that car production will be halved Byers, who has come under fire over a series of problems, including last week's decision to site a \u00a3200 million science project in Oxfordshire rather than Warrington, is battling to show the Government is doing all that could be expected after being taken by surprise. He has been backed by the head of the AEEU, Sir Ken Jackson, who blames the crisis entirely on BMW. But Bill Morris, head of the transport workers' union, the TGWU, which represents four-fifths of the Longbridge workforce, criticised the Government for not foreseeing the disaster. Tory MP John Redwood, a former trade minister, said: 'Byers went to sleep on the job. It's no good him blaming BMW, because he was being negligent. If his job isn't on the line, it should be.'",

It is the culmination of decades of institutional failure, managerial incompetence, government inadequacy, poorly-lead unions and a na\u00efve business culture. BMW made mistakes, certainly, particularly in overestimating the value of the Rover brand in a home market where Britishness counts for less and less, and the manner of its exit, leaving tens of thousands of jobs and a dealer network to swing in the wind with no prior warning, is disgraceful. But this remains a home-made tragedy. </p> <p>At the bottom of Rover's long-term failure is a hopelessly crude conception of what constitutes enterprise and business success. The British have never accepted that an enterprising business is also an enterprising and intelligent organisation embedded in a network of other enterprising organisations, in which the quest for profit, while imperative, is not the sufficient condition for success alone. Creativity, employee commitment, investor patience and professional and trade skills are the other essential parts of the brew. </p> <p>But the British view, embodied in company law and culture, is that business is solely about the pursuit of profit, in which the shareholder is sovereign and the market is held to be a fact of nature. Workers are essentially disposable commodities. Customers are pulp to be milched in the service of maximum dividends. At the heart of business success is not the time-consuming effort of organisation building, nurturing human capital and sustaining a brand - it is doing the big deal. Mr Blair, Mr Byers and the unions are right to protest at the secrecy with which Rover was sold to the venture capitalist Alchemy, but that was because in Britain the law requires that shareholders consult with no one when they do deals. </p> <p>As for the state's relationship with industry, the century-long approach has been hands-off - markets must do what they will and business must live with the consequences. In particular, the exchange rate must be allowed to settle where the financial markets drive it. The long history of British incapacity to organise a competitive exchange rate for our industrial base is now acted out as opposition to membership of the euro. </p> <p>A determined effort to keep sterling competitive has been abjured, because of political timidity, lack of policy innovation and a backward-looking cadre of economists and commentators who refuse to see how the dynamics of exchange-rate determination have been changed with the launch of the euro. Finance is again king, cemented by romanticism about retaining political sovereignty over the pound when it has long been lost and laced with not a little xenophobia. </p> <p>For the decline of Rover is the story of all these weaknesses unfolding and recurring at different times over the entire postwar period. There were the absurd stock-market-driven bids and deals of the 1950s and 1960s as the car industry consolidated, with no management team getting hold of the emerging British Leyland and building it as a creative manufacturing organisation around long production runs and product innovation. The imperative was raising dividends. Union militancy, based on a wrong-headed analysis of capitalism, brought matters to a crisis in the 1970s. When the private BL failed and was bought by the National Enterprise Board, funds intended for product development were spent on delivering ridiculous pay deals to buy off threatened strikes. </p> <p>There followed a failed sale to Ford and then British Aerospace's stewardship in 1988; a clever deal to buy Rover cheaply, cleverer asset-stripping and a cleverer-still sale to BMW. Cumulatively, the money invested in Rover may have seemed high; in fact, it was paltry, late and poorly targeted. And all the while the exchange rate reached astonishing highs, fell back briefly and then reached new peaks during the ERM d\u00e9bcle, making car manufacturing a task only for the congenitally stubborn. </p> <p>When BMW intervened in 1994, it seemed to offer the management, commitment and deep pockets, but in reality the game was up. There is too much car-making capacity in the European car industry, German management tech niques did not travel and Rover was too far gone to be saved. The sale to Alchemy is the end. It acknowledges that within four years all that will be left - unless a Ford or a Volkswagen buy Longbridge, which is unlikely - is specialist sports car manufacture and even that is doubtful. </p> <p>What we have to do is not try to save what is lost, but to learn - and build structures that mean the next wave of companies in the new information economy do not suffer the same fate. I would target four areas: the exchange rate, consultation procedures, corporate law and 'local' Keynesianism to support the stricken West Midlands. </p> <p>First, Britain needs to commit to join the euro at a competitive exchange rate 20 per cent lower than today, somewhere around DM2.50. The Government should state this as its aim, then raise \u00a320 billion through issuing long-term bonds, sell pounds and buy euros - and promise to do the same again until the pound has fallen to the target level. At current exchange rates, the Government will make a capital profit of \u00a34bn on each \u00a320bn intervention and alleviate the evisceration of manufacturing. Euro-scepticism costs money and jobs. </p> <p>Second, no British government or trade union should be humiliated by a secret deal on such a scale again. The Industrial Society (I write as its incoming chief executive) has shown that under the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings Regulations, a company has no legal requirement to consult with anybody when a company transfers its employment responsibilities through a sale of its shares. Shareholder-driven deals, in short, require no consultation with the labour force whatsoever. This loophole should be closed immediately. </p> <p>Third, we need to rethink corporate law and, in particular, the responsibilities of pension-fund trustees, directors of banks and boards of trading businesses. If we want companies to be more intelligent and creative, then the requirements we make of directors and financiers need to be less crude than at present. As a first step, the annual publication of a social, employment, investment and environmental audit should be made a condition of a stock-exchange listing, alongside the publication of the annual report. </p> <p>And last, the West Midlands should become the venue for a new approach to economic development, what Frank Field calls local Keynesianism. The whole region should be designated as an 'employment zone' in which employers' national insurance contributions are abolished and where the Government directs a wave of public investment and procurement. We need to become serious about regional policy. </p> <p>Mr Blair and his Cabinet feel betrayed and politically exposed. Finding a buyer for Rover has to be attempted, but nobody should hold their breath. Instead, this could be the opportunity for decisive change, not only in the name of jobs but to relegitimise government, which has been made to look incompetent. Don't get mad, Mr Blair. Get even.</p>",

Coz when there's a Tesco here, not a car factory, that's what we'll all be doing.' </p> <p>The laughter is shrill and abrupt. As the afternoon shift poured out of the factory gates past the BMW sign on which, after dark, 'Stabbed in the back' was sprayed in large letters, they were spitting with rage. Everyone blamed BMW. </p> <p>'Shafted. Treated despicably. Lied to from beginning to end. We won't trust anyone again.' These were typical comments called out as knots of grey-overalled assembly line workers trooped home from the vast plant. </p> <p>'The Germans have sold us down the Swanee,' said Steve Nash. 'All those promises - they just lied. That's it for us now.' He puts together the middle-sized Rover 25 and 45 cars, whose quality has never been better, and sales never worse as confidence in the brand ebbs away. </p> <p>Steve Bond, 38, lives 'just down the road' in a community almost entirely dependent on Rover. He is the only breadwinner in his household, and his \u00a318,000 a year from driving a forklift truck at Longbridge supports a wife and six-year-old daughter. </p> <p>'The first I knew was when I saw the newspaper headlines. Big shock - although I think BMW always intended to do something like this,' Bond says. </p> <p>What jobs will there be if Longbridge shuts down? 'Nothing. The kind of stuff you see in the Jobcentre pays half what Rover does.' </p> <p>Local suppliers are more inclined to blame the strength of sterling and Britain's reluctance to join the euro, although many cannot afford to criticise BMW, as they still supply components to its Oxford plant. Just yards from the main gate at Longbridge stands GPM engineering. It makes the machines that make the cars, fitting conveyor systems, pulleys and assembly line sections for Rover. </p> <p>Managing director Geoff Crow started making the Austin A40 at Longbridge as a 16-year-old apprentice in 1956, when the factory buzzed with 28,000 workers. </p> <p>He witnessed the industrial turmoil of the Sixties and Seventies, and left what was by then the Metro production line in 1982 to start GPM 'because my wife said there might be a better long-term future doing something else'. </p> <p>He reckons his \u00a312 million annual turnover, 'modest' profits and 130 staff will sur vive without Rover because he supplies the likes of Jaguar, Ford and Nissan, too. </p> <p>'And we work harder than everyone else,' he says. The machines roll at GPM in the evenings and through weekends. Halfway through showing The Observer proudly round his plant, Crow takes a call from Honda. </p> <p>'They say they can get their components more cheaply from Japan and they want me to drop my prices, again,' he said. Carmakers have forced 20 per cent price cuts on suppliers in the past two years, with 'violent pressure'.They consider 20 quotes before awarding contracts. </p> <p>Does he have a choice? 'Yes. Drop my price or lose the job.' </p> <p>He blames today's strife first on the Conservatives ('and I vote for them'), and now on Labour's reluctance to join the euro. </p> <p>'If Longbridge were to close it would be a disaster for the West Midlands. It has had many owners in the past 30 years, but the current one seems the most dubious.' He also blames the failure of successive managements to 'get a grip' on workers. </p> <p>Isn't it cruel that the young Longbridge workers of today pay the price for mistakes made 30 years ago? 'Life is cruel. No one has a divine right to be in this industry,' Crow says. </p> <p>That is little comfort to Longbridge worker John. He has made his living at Rover for 10 years. His father-in-law works at components supplier Tucker Fasteners nearby, where a third of the work is for Rover. </p> <p>John's brother works for a local subsidiary of GKN, which is equally dependent, and his wife is at the Lucas electronics factory in Kingstanding, where 40 per cent of the work is for Longbridge. </p> <p>So many jobs will go. 'We feel utterly betrayed,' he says. </p> <p><strong>From penny-farthings to losses in the millions</strong></p> <p><strong> 1877:</strong> John Starley and William Sutton set up firm making penny-farthings. </p> <p> <strong> 1896:</strong> Company renamed Rover Cyle Company. </p> <p> <strong> 1904:</strong> Produced its first car. </p> <p> <strong> 1931:</strong> BMW built its first car - the 'Dixi', a model licensed from Rover. </p> <p> <strong> 1933:</strong> Moved to concentrate on medium-sized quality cars; adopted the advertising slogan 'Britain's finest car'. </p> <p> <strong> 1948:</strong> Launch of Land Rover. </p> <p> <strong> 1950:</strong> Rover produced the world's first car powered by a jet engine. </p> <p> <strong> 1963:</strong> Rover P6 2000 launched and named car of the year. </p> <p> <strong> 1968:</strong> Company absorbed into British Leyland. The group's constituent parts had around 40 per cent of the UK car market. </p> <p><strong> 1970:</strong> tie-up with Honda for the launch of the Triumph Acclaim. </p> <p> <strong> 1975:</strong> Nationalised. </p> <p> <strong> 1984:</strong> Announced that it needed to take on more employees; Longbridge total already stood at 13,000. </p> <p> <strong> 1986:</strong> Whole group renamed Rover, dropping BL. Negotiations to sell the group to Ford halted by Government. Further negotiations - also blocked - to sell Land Rover to Ford. </p> <p> <strong> 1987:</strong> Company said it would trade profitably that year. </p> <p> <strong>1988:</strong> Bought by British Aerospace, with the help of \u00a3250 million of government help. </p> <p> <strong> 1994:</strong> BMW bought Rover for \u00a3800 million - trumping an offer from Honda to lift its stake from 20 per cent to just under 50 per cent. </p> <p> <strong> 1995:</strong> Announced that the Rover 400 would be the last project on which Rover collaborated with Honda. </p> <p> <strong> 1998:</strong> Rover losses reached \u00a3647 million. </p> <p> <strong> 1999:</strong> Rover suffered 26 per cent sales decline, with UK market share falling below 5 per cent. Losses running at \u00a3600 million. Shed some 9,000 Rover jobs. BMW said it would invest \u00a33 billion in Rover in the years up to 2005.

Managing director Geoff Crow started making the Austin A40 at Longbridge as a 16-year-old apprentice in 1956, when the factory buzzed with 28,000 workers. He witnessed the industrial turmoil of the Sixties and Seventies, and left what was by then the Metro production line in 1982 to start GPM 'because my wife said there might be a better long-term future doing something else'. He reckons his \u00a312 million annual turnover, 'modest' profits and 130 staff will sur vive without Rover because he supplies the likes of Jaguar, Ford and Nissan, too. 'And we work harder than everyone else,' he says. The machines roll at GPM in the evenings and through weekends. Halfway through showing The Observer proudly round his plant, Crow takes a call from Honda. 'They say they can get their components more cheaply from Japan and they want me to drop my prices, again,' he said. Carmakers have forced 20 per cent price cuts on suppliers in the past two years, with 'violent pressure'.They consider 20 quotes before awarding contracts. Does he have a choice? 'Yes. Drop my price or lose the job.' He blames today's strife first on the Conservatives ('and I vote for them'), and now on Labour's reluctance to join the euro. 'If Longbridge were to close it would be a disaster for the West Midlands. It has had many owners in the past 30 years, but the current one seems the most dubious.' He also blames the failure of successive managements to 'get a grip' on workers. Isn't it cruel that the young Longbridge workers of today pay the price for mistakes made 30 years ago? 'Life is cruel. No one has a divine right to be in this industry,' Crow says. That is little comfort to Longbridge worker John. He has made his living at Rover for 10 years. His father-in-law works at components supplier Tucker Fasteners nearby, where a third of the work is for Rover. John's brother works for a local subsidiary of GKN, which is equally dependent, and his wife is at the Lucas electronics factory in Kingstanding, where 40 per cent of the work is for Longbridge. So many jobs will go. 'We feel utterly betrayed,' he says. From penny-farthings to losses in the millions 1877: John Starley and William Sutton set up firm making penny-farthings. 1896: Company renamed Rover Cyle Company. 1904: Produced its first car. 1931: BMW built its first car - the 'Dixi', a model licensed from Rover. 1933: Moved to concentrate on medium-sized quality cars; adopted the advertising slogan 'Britain's finest car'. 1948: Launch of Land Rover. 1950: Rover produced the world's first car powered by a jet engine. 1963: Rover P6 2000 launched and named car of the year. 1968: Company absorbed into British Leyland. The group's constituent parts had around 40 per cent of the UK car market. 1970: tie-up with Honda for the launch of the Triumph Acclaim. 1975: Nationalised. 1984: Announced that it needed to take on more employees; Longbridge total already stood at 13,000. 1986: Whole group renamed Rover, dropping BL. Negotiations to sell the group to Ford halted by Government. Further negotiations - also blocked - to sell Land Rover to Ford. 1987: Company said it would trade profitably that year. 1988: Bought by British Aerospace, with the help of \u00a3250 million of government help. 1994: BMW bought Rover for \u00a3800 million - trumping an offer from Honda to lift its stake from 20 per cent to just under 50 per cent. 1995: Announced that the Rover 400 would be the last project on which Rover collaborated with Honda. 1998: Rover losses reached \u00a3647 million. 1999: Rover suffered 26 per cent sales decline, with UK market share falling below 5 per cent. Losses running at \u00a3600 million. Shed some 9,000 Rover jobs. BMW said it would invest \u00a33 billion in Rover in the years up to 2005. Forecast that Rover would break even by 2002 - if sterling stayed at DM2.90. Government agreed \u00a3150m of aid - after BMW had threatened to shift some production to Hungary. 2000: Break-up announced.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Gordon Brown rises to deliver his Budget speech on Tuesday, two distinct business constituencies will be hoping for his wholehearted - and more importantly his fiscal - support. </p> <p>Newly minted dot.com executives will be keeping their fingers crossed that the Government's rallying cry for the weightless economy will translate into further tax breaks on their share options, tax credits for research and other routes to unfettered wealth. In contrast, captains of old British industry - the sort that employs hundreds of thousands of traditional Labour voters who see Brown as their champion in government - will be agonising over every word, scouring them for every penny of help he can offer. Will he notice them? </p> <p>The signs for the old economy are not good. The Government seems infatuated by 'entrepreneurship', by 'new', 'knowledge-based', 'high-tech' companies and by business start-ups. BMW said as much as it abandoned ship at Rover. </p> <p>Meanwhile 'old economy' companies - which wearily point out that they are the real seat of high--tech, knowledge-based Britain - groan that they are punished by the high pound, higher taxes, and inertia. </p> <p>While Harland and Wolff, the 180-year old Belfast shipbuilder, goes to the wall complaining that the Government did not lend it enough support, Lastminute.com screeches on to the market with a dubious valuation model and a temporary market capitalisation of \u00a3750 million. Then it plummeted. Although it may only be a matter of perception, the importance of the enterprise economy seems to many to be overstated - and disproportionate in terms of the Government. </p> <p>To be fair, it is not all one-way traffic from Westminster. Earlier this month Brown reinforced warnings from Howard Davies, head of the Financial Services Authority, about the danger of investing in dot.com stocks. But the Chancellor's rhetoric has been tilted unmistakably towards the new economy. In his Pre-Budget Report speech in Parliament last autumn, he stressed that in Britain the potential of new markets, new technologies and new skills had historically been 'squandered'. </p> <p>He said Britain had only half the rate of business start- ups and share ownership of the US, and added: 'The British economy needs high levels of investment and entrepreneurship.' </p> <p>Part of the Government's strategy has been to aim its new measures at the small businesses which it hopes will be the tomorrow's Microsofts. In his pre-Budget statement Brown said: 'Enterprise for all calls for a larger number of small businesses.' </p> <p>However, as Lucy Chennels of the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out: 'Small does not mean new - you could be talking about bakers as well as Internet start-ups.' </p> <p>Equally, as Martin Temple of the 'old economy' Engineering Employers Federation says: 'Rolls-Royce is an \"old\" company, but it is an extremely high-tech company. Companies like this are the true technology companies.' </p> <p>This may be so. But whether small is a proxy for new does not alter the fact that new is where the effort is going. </p> <p>Chennells says measures introduced since the last election which have impacted primarily on big business have been nasty. 'These measure have been broadly revenue raising, and so broadly negative,' she says. </p> <p>For example, changes in taxation of dividend income introduced in the July 1997 Budget are estimated to bring in between \u00a34 billion and \u00a35bn a year, largely from shareholders in big businesses. </p> <p>And the introduction in March 1998 of a new Corporation Tax system, requiring companies to pay the tax quarterly, increases the burden over the four-year introduction period. These payments outweigh the benefits of cuts in Corporation Tax rates, from 33 to 30 per cent since 1997. </p> <p>At the same time Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have been in luck since 1997. Cuts in Corporation Tax from 23 to 20 per cent for SMEs and to 10 per cent for the smallest companies, coupled with targeted boosts in capital allowances, produce a benefit of just over \u00a31bn. There is more to come for small businesses. The 2000 package is likely to be the most New Economy-focused of all. The Budget is likely to include the following measures for small business: </p> <p> \u0095 An all-employee share ownership scheme that gives tax relief on shares in small companies. </p> <p> \u0095 An Enterprise Management Incentives Scheme giving tax relief on share options for 10 key employees of small companies; </p> <p> \u0095 Reform of capital gains tax on business assets to shorten the period over which they have to be held to be free of tax when they are sold. At the moment assets have to be held for 10 years: this will be shortened to five; </p> <p> \u0095 Tax relief for investment by large firms in small ones worth 20 per cent of the investment; </p> <p> \u0095 An extension to research and development tax credits allowing small companies which invest more than \u00a325,000 in R&amp;D to deduct \u00a3150 from taxable profits for every \u00a3100 spent. </p> <p>In addition, Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers has already introduced an enterprise initiative, with \u00a3245m of Government money, aimed at attracting a further \u00a3755m from the private sector to invest in small companies in deprived regions. </p> <p>Two big questions arise from these initiatives. First, is the Government losing sight of the big picture by focusing on the new economy, which could be harmful? Second, will its strategy work? </p> <p>Ian Brinkley, senior economist at the Trades Union Congress, is concerned that the focus on the new economy is unbalancing the Government's attempts to reform the whole economy - particularly the 'productivity gap' between the UK and US and European economies. </p> <p>He says: 'The initiative behind the Government's productivity drive across the economy has given way to promoting the Internet and high-tech companies. The original debate - for example how do you encourage R&amp;D and long-term investment in companies - has run out of steam. Now it is focusing on tax schemes for start-ups.' </p> <p>In its respected Green Budget - which examines the Chancellor's policy options - the IFS finds that there is no clear-cut justification for taxing smaller companies differently from bigger ones. </p> <p>But it also states: 'There are potential dangers in tilting the balance of the econ omy in favour of smaller firms. There is convincing evidence that, on average, small firms tend to provide lower productivity, lower wages and less secure jobs than larger companies.' This, it said, could have a 'perverse impact' on productivity. </p> <p>Old-economy companies believe they are about to take a further tax hammering on top of missing out on perks limited to smaller companies. Temple, of the Engineering Employers' Federation, says: 'If you look at the burden of taxation on business since 1997, it has increased.' </p> <p>The travails of industries in Britain's 'old' economy have only added to the pressure on Brown to retreat from the apparently green stance taken in the Budget a year ago. </p> <p>Already, Brown has climbed down on several key issues on which his green credentials were founded. Last autumn, he bowed to pressure to limit the 'climate change levy' - the tax on industries' use of energy. He agreed to cut the levy by 80 per cent on industries deemed to be 'energy intensive'. The mere fact that he conceded the principle inevitably opened the floodgates; other industries which don't quite qualify for the rebate but are nevertheless heavy energy users are now pressing for inclusion in the rebate scheme. </p> <p>Brown has also backtracked on his promise to raise fuel prices annually by at least 6 per cent more than inflation - a decision that followed a high-profile and populist campaign waged by the road haulage industry against heavier taxes. </p> <p>From the Exchequer's point of view, petrol and diesel have the great virtue of not being vulnerable to large- scale smuggling: people may bring vans full of cheap cigarettes into the country, but they are less likely to try to smuggle a tankerload of petrol. The Freight Transport Association wants any increase in fuel costs to be offset by cuts in vehicle excise duty The FTA asserts that excise duty on a 40-tonne, five-axle articulated lorry is \u00a35,750 in Britain, compared with \u00a31,720 in Germany and just \u00a3450 in France. </p> <p>The green argument for higher duty on fuel is hard to fault. Evidence over the past three decades suggests strongly that when people have to pay more for their fuel in real terms, they feel inclined to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. In other words, high prices really do suppress demand for fuel; and that in turn suppresses emissions of greenhouse gases. </p> <p>But the Treasury does not relish the prospect of a rerun of last year's campaign against increases in duty. Any increase is likely to be only 1 or 2 per cent in real terms. And it may be offset by a cut in the duty on trucks. </p> <p>Fuel taxes and the climate change levy are the main battle grounds on which the environmental arguments have been played out. But the Government is also setting targets for electricity companies to increase the proportion of electricity they produce from renewable resources. And it wants a doubling of combined heat and power plants by 2010. </p> <p>Beyond the Budget there are measures that will add to transport costs - such as company car parking taxes. Of course, it is true to say that petrol and parking taxes affect small companies as well as big. But they all erode the ability of 'old-economy' British businesses to compete. </p> <p>Ironically, it is perhaps lack of action that is hurting most. Not only are all the goodies stacked towards new companies, but big business watches the inactivity on calming the hot spots of the economy - particularly the housing market - with dismay. </p> <p>Traditional manufacturers, particularly those who are net exporters, are being hammered by the high value of sterling - which has averaged DM2.95 under Labour - about 10 per cent overvalued according to City economists. Companies from BMW, Rover's estranged parent, to Corus, the Anglo-Dutch company which includes former British Steel, have posed question marks over UK-sourced products and plants - such as Longbridge in Birmingham and the Llanwern strip steel mill in Wales. </p> <p>Ian Rogers of the UK Steel Association says: 'The exchange rate has been a big problem since 1997. The Government says there is little it can do about it because responsibility for interest rates rests with the Monetary Policy Committee. But we have been arguing for some time the need for a balance between fis cal and monetary policy to ease pressure on sterling.' </p> <p>Rogers and Temple agree that there are a series of measures that should be considered. These include calming the housing market by raising stamp duty on housing transactions - a possibility on Tuesday - or increasing capital gains tax on short-term property deals. Temple also thinks savings should be encouraged more by increasing the amounts that can be put into Individual Savings Accounts from \u00a37,000 in the first year and \u00a35,000 thereafter. </p> <p>Big business might understand the Government's attention to small companies if it was clear that its policies were sure to work. But in the view of many experts, their validity is unproven. So, do the new economy measures add up to much? </p> <p>The Institute of Fiscal Studies' analysis of proposed Budget 2000 measures is sceptical about the benefits. On employee share ownership, for example, it indicates that there are already two schemes in place, and says the evidence from these is that they are more popular with larger firms. </p> <p>Employees of small companies who take part risk losing both salaries and savings if their company is hit. Evidence that schemes increase productivity is also thin. </p> <p>On changes to capital gains tax it says that, because large financial investors don't pay CGT and individuals can avoid it through other Government schemes, 'it is not obvious that reducing capital gains tax rates on business assets will have a large impact on the level of investment'. </p> <p>And on R&amp;D tax credits the IFS says: 'Restricting the measure to small companies will lower the cost to the Gov ernment but will also reduce the additional R&amp;D that is likely to be generated.' </p> <p>All in all, Chennells is sceptical. 'What they are doing would seem to be targeted at small and new companies. That would be great if we could guarantee that a lot of small businesses could do what Microsoft has done. But it is hard to predict which companies will.' </p> <p>On top of this, the limited resources being spent on the new/small business schemes are not really proportionate to the importance attached to them. There may be heat. But is there light? </p> <p>Chennells says: 'The Government's response would be that we are targeting measures so they don't cost very much and focus on areas we want to develop. So it is spending small amounts of money on small companies when they account for a relatively small part of UK investment.' </p> <p>Perhaps more perplexing for Brown is that despite wanting the Government to be seen as entrepreneur-friendly, there is a growing clamour from dot.com start-ups and other consultancy operators that in fact the weightless economy is being suppressed. </p> <p>Barry Watson, a tax partner at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, says that the situation with regard to taxing share options is extremely grave. </p> <p>'Most people considering leaving jobs for a start-up will go because, while the salary may be lower, they will pick up a large tranche of share options. But the problem is that first of all they will face a 40 per cent tax, and in addition a further 10 per cent in National Insurance Contributions. When you add up what this means for start-ups who have to use options as an incentive it is absolutely horrifying,' says Watson. In some cases, companies will face larger bills for NI contributions on share options than they have revenues. </p> <p>In addition to this the employee faces a potential capital gains tax bill of a further 40 per cent when cashing out of their start-up. 'In the US this would be 20 per cent. The UK compares very unfavourably in terms of competing on the CGT front in Europe as well as the US,' says Watson. </p> <p>Against this background, many exponents of the 'new economy' complain that they, or their businesses, would be better relocating offshore. </p> <p>In addition, the introduction of the dreaded 'IR 35' is infuriating consultants - and in particular IT professionals, who are now not allowed to count themselves as self-employed and enjoy the tax benefits which traditionally went with them. 'This seems a very strange way to encourage the flexible labour market,' says one consultant. </p> <p>The Treasury may argue that it is being prudent with taxpayers' money. But this really points to the paradox at the centre of the whole policy. We have a highly successful but risk-averse Chancellor trying to encourage essentially risky entrepreneurialism without placing significant public funds in jeopardy. </p> <p>This strategy makes it impossible to help those most in need - old economy companies. But Brown will also be aware that his job is creating the right climate for growth - if certain plants fail it may be the head gardener, the DTI's Byers, who carries the can.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Gordon Brown rises to deliver his Budget speech on Tuesday, two distinct business constituencies will be hoping for his wholehearted - and more importantly his fiscal - support. Newly minted dot.com executives will be keeping their fingers crossed that the Government's rallying cry for the weightless economy will translate into further tax breaks on their share options, tax credits for research and other routes to unfettered wealth. In contrast, captains of old British industry - the sort that employs hundreds of thousands of traditional Labour voters who see Brown as their champion in government - will be agonising over every word, scouring them for every penny of help he can offer. Will he notice them? The signs for the old economy are not good. The Government seems infatuated by 'entrepreneurship', by 'new', 'knowledge-based', 'high-tech' companies and by business start-ups. BMW said as much as it abandoned ship at Rover. Meanwhile 'old economy' companies - which wearily point out that they are the real seat of high--tech, knowledge-based Britain - groan that they are punished by the high pound, higher taxes, and inertia. While Harland and Wolff, the 180-year old Belfast shipbuilder, goes to the wall complaining that the Government did not lend it enough support, Lastminute.com screeches on to the market with a dubious valuation model and a temporary market capitalisation of \u00a3750 million. Then it plummeted. Although it may only be a matter of perception, the importance of the enterprise economy seems to many to be overstated - and disproportionate in terms of the Government. To be fair, it is not all one-way traffic from Westminster. Earlier this month Brown reinforced warnings from Howard Davies, head of the Financial Services Authority, about the danger of investing in dot.com stocks. But the Chancellor's rhetoric has been tilted unmistakably towards the new economy. In his Pre-Budget Report speech in Parliament last autumn, he stressed that in Britain the potential of new markets, new technologies and new skills had historically been 'squandered'. He said Britain had only half the rate of business start- ups and share ownership of the US, and added: 'The British economy needs high levels of investment and entrepreneurship.' Part of the Government's strategy has been to aim its new measures at the small businesses which it hopes will be the tomorrow's Microsofts. In his pre-Budget statement Brown said: 'Enterprise for all calls for a larger number of small businesses.' However, as Lucy Chennels of the Institute for Fiscal Studies points out: 'Small does not mean new - you could be talking about bakers as well as Internet start-ups.' Equally, as Martin Temple of the 'old economy' Engineering Employers Federation says: 'Rolls-Royce is an \"old\" company, but it is an extremely high-tech company. Companies like this are the true technology companies.' This may be so. But whether small is a proxy for new does not alter the fact that new is where the effort is going. Chennells says measures introduced since the last election which have impacted primarily on big business have been nasty. 'These measure have been broadly revenue raising, and so broadly negative,' she says. For example, changes in taxation of dividend income introduced in the July 1997 Budget are estimated to bring in between \u00a34 billion and \u00a35bn a year, largely from shareholders in big businesses. And the introduction in March 1998 of a new Corporation Tax system, requiring companies to pay the tax quarterly, increases the burden over the four-year introduction period. These payments outweigh the benefits of cuts in Corporation Tax rates, from 33 to 30 per cent since 1997. At the same time Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have been in luck since 1997. Cuts in Corporation Tax from 23 to 20 per cent for SMEs and to 10 per cent for the smallest companies, coupled with targeted boosts in capital allowances, produce a benefit of just over \u00a31bn. There is more to come for small businesses. The 2000 package is likely to be the most New Economy-focused of all. The Budget is likely to include the following measures for small business: \u0095 An all-employee share ownership scheme that gives tax relief on shares in small companies. \u0095 An Enterprise Management Incentives Scheme giving tax relief on share options for 10 key employees of small companies; \u0095 Reform of capital gains tax on business assets to shorten the period over which they have to be held to be free of tax when they are sold. At the moment assets have to be held for 10 years: this will be shortened to five; \u0095 Tax relief for investment by large firms in small ones worth 20 per cent of the investment; \u0095 An extension to research and development tax credits allowing small companies which invest more than \u00a325,000 in R&amp;D to deduct \u00a3150 from taxable profits for every \u00a3100 spent. In addition, Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers has already introduced an enterprise initiative, with \u00a3245m of Government money, aimed at attracting a further \u00a3755m from the private sector to invest in small companies in deprived regions.

      "body": "<p>If you are a married man with children, with a job in a high-risk Internet company that pays a small wage and lots of shares but which could leave you penniless next month... If you don't care much about pollution and bought your house in the South-east in the early Nineties recession... If you don't smoke or drink, have no private health insurance and run an efficient car... then Gordon Brown's Budget will be for you. </p> <p>We have all heard that the Chancellor is a traditional old Labour wealth redistributor. So the sorts of people mentioned above are those towards whom the rest of our wealth has been redistributed in his two Budgets since 1997, and they are likely to benefit in his third on Tuesday. </p> <p>If you are among them, you will have benefited from a raft of child-friendly policies. Your decision to take up your old school friend's offer to join him in dot.comland means that your \u00a310,000 pay will be lightly taxed, thanks to a 10p starting rate of tax. </p> <p>But from April the 20 per cent of the firm he gave you in shares won't be subject to income tax, capital gains tax or National Insurance contributions, if you keep them for five years, thanks to Brown. </p> <p>If it does not work out and your wages are cut you will be eased into a more generous benefit and tax credit system. </p> <p>If you do end up out of work, the New Deal for the unemployed will be there to help with training, or to find another job for you. And com ing back into work you will find you do not face the 100 per cent-plus effective tax rate which existed in the past. </p> <p>Of course, if you are reading this, whoever you are, you are not only Gordon Brown's number one fan, you are also probably unique. </p> <p>For the rest of us, the key question is whether the clever occupant of Number 11 has taken or given to us since he became Chancellor. For Brown the key question is whether we have noticed. </p> <p>So who should be grateful? Have Middle Englanders gained over traditional Labour voters, families over individuals, men over women, the young over the elderly, southerners over northerners? </p> <p>The problem giving Labour's Millbank apparatchicks the collywobbles is the alienation felt by traditional Labour voters over the policies of 'Tory Tony'. </p> <p>On one level the tax breaks for small businesses introduced by the Chancellor, and the blaze of publicity surrounding the enterprise economy indicate there is something to worry about. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Brown can claim that if anyone has delivered to the traditional Labour supporter it is he. </p> <p>Since 1997 his tax measures, and particularly the increases in benefits, have seen the poorest 20 per cent of us increase their income after tax by more than 5 per cent. </p> <p>By contrast, a series of measures impacting on the middle classes, including the abolition of mortgage interest tax relief and of the married couples' tax allowance, mean that the incomes of the wealthiest have fallen. Research by David Piachaud of the London School of Economics finds that Budget measures have had a marked impact on those in poverty, defined as on less than half average income. </p> <p>Piachaud says Brown's measures have lifted 1 million families with children out of poverty. These measures include a children's element in the Working Families Tax Credit introduced by Brown to boost the former Family Credit benefit and deliver it in pay packets. On top of this come a children's tax credit - due in April next year - and higher child benefit. </p> <p>Progressive macro-economic policies coupled with the New Deal have seen long-term unemployment fall by 500,000, and the minimum wage - something Brown has championed - has cut those in poverty by some 300,000. </p> <p>But Piachaud finds that the poor who are also out of work have missed out, because the Jobseekers' Allowance has been uprated in line with prices, not earnings, which rise faster. He says: 'An estimated 2 million have been lifted out of poverty since the election. That's out of 14 million, so there is a lot more to do. But it is an impressive start. Simlarly, a third of the 3 million children in poverty have been lifted out.' </p> <p>Ian Brinkley, senior economist at the Trades Union Congress, adds: 'If you are a family you have done reasonably well. If you are a family in work you have done very well. But it is not so good if you are of working age and poor without children and without a job, or if you are a pensioner.' </p> <p>Martin Weale of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research believes Brown has concentrated resources and reformed the structure of welfare payments to ease the unemployed into work.

      "bodyText": "If you are a married man with children, with a job in a high-risk Internet company that pays a small wage and lots of shares but which could leave you penniless next month... If you don't care much about pollution and bought your house in the South-east in the early Nineties recession... If you don't smoke or drink, have no private health insurance and run an efficient car... then Gordon Brown's Budget will be for you. We have all heard that the Chancellor is a traditional old Labour wealth redistributor. So the sorts of people mentioned above are those towards whom the rest of our wealth has been redistributed in his two Budgets since 1997, and they are likely to benefit in his third on Tuesday. If you are among them, you will have benefited from a raft of child-friendly policies. Your decision to take up your old school friend's offer to join him in dot.comland means that your \u00a310,000 pay will be lightly taxed, thanks to a 10p starting rate of tax. But from April the 20 per cent of the firm he gave you in shares won't be subject to income tax, capital gains tax or National Insurance contributions, if you keep them for five years, thanks to Brown. If it does not work out and your wages are cut you will be eased into a more generous benefit and tax credit system. If you do end up out of work, the New Deal for the unemployed will be there to help with training, or to find another job for you. And com ing back into work you will find you do not face the 100 per cent-plus effective tax rate which existed in the past. Of course, if you are reading this, whoever you are, you are not only Gordon Brown's number one fan, you are also probably unique. For the rest of us, the key question is whether the clever occupant of Number 11 has taken or given to us since he became Chancellor. For Brown the key question is whether we have noticed. So who should be grateful? Have Middle Englanders gained over traditional Labour voters, families over individuals, men over women, the young over the elderly, southerners over northerners? The problem giving Labour's Millbank apparatchicks the collywobbles is the alienation felt by traditional Labour voters over the policies of 'Tory Tony'. On one level the tax breaks for small businesses introduced by the Chancellor, and the blaze of publicity surrounding the enterprise economy indicate there is something to worry about. Nevertheless, Brown can claim that if anyone has delivered to the traditional Labour supporter it is he. Since 1997 his tax measures, and particularly the increases in benefits, have seen the poorest 20 per cent of us increase their income after tax by more than 5 per cent. By contrast, a series of measures impacting on the middle classes, including the abolition of mortgage interest tax relief and of the married couples' tax allowance, mean that the incomes of the wealthiest have fallen. Research by David Piachaud of the London School of Economics finds that Budget measures have had a marked impact on those in poverty, defined as on less than half average income. Piachaud says Brown's measures have lifted 1 million families with children out of poverty. These measures include a children's element in the Working Families Tax Credit introduced by Brown to boost the former Family Credit benefit and deliver it in pay packets. On top of this come a children's tax credit - due in April next year - and higher child benefit. Progressive macro-economic policies coupled with the New Deal have seen long-term unemployment fall by 500,000, and the minimum wage - something Brown has championed - has cut those in poverty by some 300,000. But Piachaud finds that the poor who are also out of work have missed out, because the Jobseekers' Allowance has been uprated in line with prices, not earnings, which rise faster. He says: 'An estimated 2 million have been lifted out of poverty since the election. That's out of 14 million, so there is a lot more to do. But it is an impressive start. Simlarly, a third of the 3 million children in poverty have been lifted out.' Ian Brinkley, senior economist at the Trades Union Congress, adds: 'If you are a family you have done reasonably well. If you are a family in work you have done very well. But it is not so good if you are of working age and poor without children and without a job, or if you are a pensioner.' Martin Weale of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research believes Brown has concentrated resources and reformed the structure of welfare payments to ease the unemployed into work. This has been done by reducing the rate of benefit withdrawal as people move into the tax system, which before 1997 had in some cases been more than 100 per cent. In other words, they became worse off as they returned to work. However, Weale says, there is still much to do. The issue is complicated because people in different circumstances, entitled to different benefits, will have different withdrawal rates as their benefits and credits taper out. Weale says an effective policy could be to concentrate on the withdrawal rate, setting a target of, say, 60 per cent, and focusing on delivering that figure, which is what matters to the unemployed moving into work. The Government is floating proposals to tackle these issues by creating an Employment Tax Credit and an Integrated Child Credit to restructure the Working Families Tax Credit and Children's Tax Credit, which could ease the taper of these benefits into working wages. The aim would be a package of benefits for children that targets unemployed families more effectively, along with extending WFTC to families without children. The implications of such measures are dramatic. Since 1990 taxes have been paid to individuals, while benefits have been paid to families. This has made it compli cated to introduce the WFTC because, although it has been a family measure, it has to be directed to the person in work - usually the man. This has led women's groups to criticise tax credits as more likely to end up in the pub than in Mothercare. Proposals for a future Integrated Child Credit would pay it to the main carer, redressing the balance. But some women think Brown should go further. Last week Labour MP Ruth Kelly pointed out that single parents are penalised by the tax credit system if they declare they are living with partners or their children's fathers.

Families with small children are likely to benefit. Ministers were shaken last week by a survey showing Britain is still bottom of the European league for child poverty. Child benefit is to be raised by 3 per cent. Brown has also been working on a new unified tax credit for children, and has shown interest in a 'baby tax credit' which would be worth \u00a360 a week for the first year of a child's life. Changes to capital gains tax will please industry, and among other tax breaks there will be a cut in VAT on home renovations, as part of a policy of encouraging builders to re-use land that has already been developed instead of putting pressure on the green belt.",

      "body": "<p>A frightened hare sprints into an open field watched by hundreds of cheering spectators. The animal is running for its life. Seconds later, two greyhounds race after it and in a flash one has its teeth locked around the hare's head. The crowd cheers. The other greyhound bites into the hare's hind legs.</p> <p>The hare's screams can be heard as the two greyhounds fight over their prey, which thrashes around in pain.</p> <p>A man in a black balaclava runs up and takes the hare from the dogs. He takes more than five attempts to break its neck. Finally, the hare's body goes limp and it is stuffed into a black bin liner.</p> <p>This horrific event, caught on film by undercover investigators, is the fate of just one of the many hares killed at this year's Waterloo Cup - Britain's premier hare coursing event held over three days in February on Lord Leverhulme's Altcar estate, north of Liverpool.</p> <p>As well as revealing the slaughter of hares, the film uncovers the lengths to which blood sport enthusiasts are going to ensure one of their favourite pastimes is not banned by future legislation.</p> <p>For much of the first day, the organisers of the Waterloo Cup had special guests: a Home Office team investigating the impact a ban on hunting with dogs would have.</p> <p>The undercover footage clearly illustrates how the team, headed by former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns, was shown a sanitised version of the 'sport', which would be illegal if the Government bans hunting with dogs as it promised in its election manifesto.</p> <p>Instead of the typical 50-metre start - known as the 'slip' - the hare normally gets before the greyhounds are released, the film shows coursing officials holding the dogs back much longer while Burns was present. Many hares were given a 120-metre start and escaped unharmed.</p> <p>The crowd - frustrated at not seeing as many 'kills' as usual - are heard yelling and swearing at officials to let the dogs go earlier. Only two hares were killed in the time Burns and his colleagues were there - a fraction of the usual number. When the Home Office team left, the officials adopted to their normal practice, giving the hares much less chance to escape.</p> <p>The footage also shows that after Burns left, bookmaker Stephen Little, a big name in the sport and a sponsor of the Waterloo Cup, appeared to be taking bets from young children. This would be a criminal offence.</p> <p>The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) - whose investigators took the film - have passed a copy of the tape to Lancashire Police.</p> <p>At the end of the first day, the organiser, Sir Mark Prescott, is heard addressing the assembled crowd: 'The inquiry team could not have seen coursing in a better light. But I don't know if the Government will heed what they say.'</p> <p>One of the undercover team who took the film said: 'The true barbarity of the Waterloo Cup was hidden from the inquiry.'</p> <p>The IFAW investigator, whose sister took the footage that resulted in the prosecution of circus trainer Mary Chipperfield, said: 'I've been observing hare coursing for years, and you almost had to laugh at the contrived concern they were showing for the hunted animals this time around, just because these Home Office guys were watching.'</p> <p>Animal rights campaigners believe this is not the first time the Home Office team has been prevented from getting a true picture of blood sports in action. In January, Burns was due to attend a meet of Bicester and Whaddonhase Fox Hunt, in Oxfordshire.</p> <p>Burns called off the night before, after the hunt told him that the weather wasn't suitable. But investigators filmed the Bicester and Whaddon out hunting as planned the following day unobserved.</p> <p>Labour MP Colin Pickthall, whose West Lancashire constituency is home to the Waterloo Cup, is a long-standing campaigner against hare coursing.</p> <p>He said: 'It's no surprise to me the Home Office team were given a false picture of what happens. It is truly barbaric and really should be viewed in the same light as dogfighting and bear baiting.</p> <p>'I was a guest with other MPs a couple of years ago and the same thing happened. We saw no hares killed but I later saw some footage of the coursing after we had gone and it was horrific.

      "bodyText": "A frightened hare sprints into an open field watched by hundreds of cheering spectators. The animal is running for its life. Seconds later, two greyhounds race after it and in a flash one has its teeth locked around the hare's head. The crowd cheers. The other greyhound bites into the hare's hind legs. The hare's screams can be heard as the two greyhounds fight over their prey, which thrashes around in pain. A man in a black balaclava runs up and takes the hare from the dogs. He takes more than five attempts to break its neck. Finally, the hare's body goes limp and it is stuffed into a black bin liner. This horrific event, caught on film by undercover investigators, is the fate of just one of the many hares killed at this year's Waterloo Cup - Britain's premier hare coursing event held over three days in February on Lord Leverhulme's Altcar estate, north of Liverpool. As well as revealing the slaughter of hares, the film uncovers the lengths to which blood sport enthusiasts are going to ensure one of their favourite pastimes is not banned by future legislation. For much of the first day, the organisers of the Waterloo Cup had special guests: a Home Office team investigating the impact a ban on hunting with dogs would have. The undercover footage clearly illustrates how the team, headed by former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns, was shown a sanitised version of the 'sport', which would be illegal if the Government bans hunting with dogs as it promised in its election manifesto. Instead of the typical 50-metre start - known as the 'slip' - the hare normally gets before the greyhounds are released, the film shows coursing officials holding the dogs back much longer while Burns was present. Many hares were given a 120-metre start and escaped unharmed. The crowd - frustrated at not seeing as many 'kills' as usual - are heard yelling and swearing at officials to let the dogs go earlier. Only two hares were killed in the time Burns and his colleagues were there - a fraction of the usual number. When the Home Office team left, the officials adopted to their normal practice, giving the hares much less chance to escape. The footage also shows that after Burns left, bookmaker Stephen Little, a big name in the sport and a sponsor of the Waterloo Cup, appeared to be taking bets from young children. This would be a criminal offence. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) - whose investigators took the film - have passed a copy of the tape to Lancashire Police. At the end of the first day, the organiser, Sir Mark Prescott, is heard addressing the assembled crowd: 'The inquiry team could not have seen coursing in a better light. But I don't know if the Government will heed what they say.' One of the undercover team who took the film said: 'The true barbarity of the Waterloo Cup was hidden from the inquiry.' The IFAW investigator, whose sister took the footage that resulted in the prosecution of circus trainer Mary Chipperfield, said: 'I've been observing hare coursing for years, and you almost had to laugh at the contrived concern they were showing for the hunted animals this time around, just because these Home Office guys were watching.' Animal rights campaigners believe this is not the first time the Home Office team has been prevented from getting a true picture of blood sports in action. In January, Burns was due to attend a meet of Bicester and Whaddonhase Fox Hunt, in Oxfordshire. Burns called off the night before, after the hunt told him that the weather wasn't suitable. But investigators filmed the Bicester and Whaddon out hunting as planned the following day unobserved. Labour MP Colin Pickthall, whose West Lancashire constituency is home to the Waterloo Cup, is a long-standing campaigner against hare coursing. He said: 'It's no surprise to me the Home Office team were given a false picture of what happens. It is truly barbaric and really should be viewed in the same light as dogfighting and bear baiting. 'I was a guest with other MPs a couple of years ago and the same thing happened. We saw no hares killed but I later saw some footage of the coursing after we had gone and it was horrific. It simply does not belong in Britain in the twenty-first century.' Supporters of hare coursing strongly reject the claims made by the animal rights group. Charles Blanning, secretary of the National Coursing Club - an affiliate of the Countryside Alliance - said: 'Our rules state the slip must be at least 80 yards and there were no differences or inconsistencies when Lord Burns was there.' Blanning said over the three days there were 108 courses and only 18 hares were killed. He added: 'For the last seven years we have been told this is the last Waterloo Cup. I am confident there will be one next year, the year after and for many years after that.' But the evidence compiled by the investigators debunks several claims made in the Countryside Alliance's submission to the Burns inquiry. Its document on hare coursing states: 'There is strong evidence that these animals do not outwardly appear distressed when chased,' and, 'When a hare is brought down death is virtually instantaneous.' But the undercover footage shows hares being disembowelled alive by dogs; dogs pulling at either end of a live hare; and coursers taking several gos to break the neck of a hare not killed by dogs. antony.barnett@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Taiwan's electors yesterday defied the threat of a mainland Chinese invasion by electing Chen Shui-bian - the pro-independence candidate Beijing had told them to reject - as their President. The vote was a crushing defeat for the Chinese Kuo-mintang (KMT) party, which has ruled Taiwan for more than 50 years and which once jailed Chen during his 20-year struggle. A record turnout gave Chen, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate, a comfortable victory with 39.3 per cent of the vote. As one working-class voter put it: 'He comes from a poor family and understands us. We aren't bothered about China: it's just empty words from Beijing.' At his headquarters last night, Chen - besieged by thousands of cheering flag-wavers - said: 'The Taiwan people have overcome darkness and fear and have used our sacred vote to defend democracy'. Without mentioning Taiwan's independence, he promised to work for direct trade relations with the mainland and invited Beijing's leaders to visit the island. But Beijing will not be happy at Chen's pledge 'to help the international community push for democratic reform and for human rights' - subjects on which China has very different views. Communist leaders had kept up pressure on Chen until the last minute, with one Beijing paper on the eve of polling accusing him of 'gambling with the lives of his people'. US Defence Secretary William Cohen has urged China to 'tone down its rhetoric and threats of intimidation' and called for both sides to 'sit down and see how to reconcile their differences peacefully', an offer subsequently repeated by Chen. 'If they don't want to meet me in Beijing or Shanghai, then I shall be happy to meet them in Hong Kong or Singapore.' Analysts believe President Jiang Zemin and his fellow Communist Party leaders may wait until Chen's inauguration on 20 May before deciding how to respond. Chen will still face a KMT majority in the legislature although he can appoint his own Cabinet. A political earthquake may only just have begun. The DPP's chairman, Lin Yi-hsiung, spoke last night of building a new inclusive society that cared for 'clean mountains and clean water'. This rosy view of the future was not shared by mainland China. Chen's victory 'will increase the likelihood of our using force to solve the Taiwan question', Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po newspaper, a Beijing supporter, said yesterday. The mainland Science Times accused Chen of 'gambling with the happiness of the Taiwanese people' while knowing full well that 'Taiwan independence means war'. It was against this background of intimidation that voters turned out in record numbers - at 80 per cent, nearly 10 per cent higher than in the 1996 election. Earlier Chen had cast his vote at the National Elemen tary School in a quiet street lined with banyans in the north of Taipei city. He stood in line with the voters outside the classroom polling station, overlooked by a large statue of Dr Sun Yat-sen. Sun led the 1911 revolution and founded the Chinese Nationalists whose power Chen has now overthrown. His wife, Wu Shu-jen, accompanied him in her wheelchair, looking pale and strained but with a determined air.

For instance, an Iraqi could claim asylum by applying in writing to the Home Office's Immigration and Nationality Directorate, and filling in the appropriate form. Almost all would be allowed to stay without a personal interview with a case worker.</p> <p>But those who arrived at Dover and Heathrow - points of entry for 80 per cent of refugees - were confronted by immigration officials operating under different rules. Though the Home Office listed 19 countries which it regarded as the most repressive in the world, officials at these two ports of entry recognised just four - Afghanistan, Liberia, Somalia and the war-torn states of the former Yugoslavia.</p> <p>Consultants from Vantage Point, the firm hired last year by the Home Office to examine the asylum system, discovered that 350 Iraqi Kurds, whose persecution by Saddam Hussein has been recognised internationally, were in the queue at East Dover waiting to be interviewed.</p> <p>Their names had been added to a list with thousands of others from all over the world - so many, that the average wait for an interview was two years. If the 350 Kurds had been able to apply for asylum in writing, the rules would not have required them to be interviewed at all.</p> <p>The consultants warned that the system was so inefficient that it would not have been able to handle the flow of asylum-seekers effectively even if the Government had given it all the money and resources it needed and the notorious new computer system at its Croydon headquarters had worked properly.</p> <p>At the time of the report, there was an average delay of 11 months between an asylum-seeker's arrival in Brit-ain and a decision on whether they could stay. The backlog of cases was then 76,570 cases. Each month, more than 4,000 new asylum-seekers arrived, while the decision rate for those already in the country was only 2,000 a month.</p> <p>The authors warned that officials were going to have to increase their efficiency almost fourfold, handling nearly 8,000 cases a month if they were to get to grips with the backlog by April 2001.</p> <p>The backlog has since climbed to nearly 100,000, having doubled since Labour came to power. There are 60,000 in London - 11,000 in just two boroughs, Haringey and Newham. The Government's attempted remedy has been the 'dispersal' system which seeks to move asylum- seekers to underpopulated estates in the North of England.</p> <p>Last month Downing Street said that for the first time in years the number of cases successfully processed was greater than the number of new asylum- seekers coming into the country.</p> <p>On 1 April, the new system of issuing asylum-seekers with vouchers instead of cash will come into force, along with a clampdown on trafficking in illegal immigrants.</p>",

For instance, an Iraqi could claim asylum by applying in writing to the Home Office's Immigration and Nationality Directorate, and filling in the appropriate form. Almost all would be allowed to stay without a personal interview with a case worker. But those who arrived at Dover and Heathrow - points of entry for 80 per cent of refugees - were confronted by immigration officials operating under different rules. Though the Home Office listed 19 countries which it regarded as the most repressive in the world, officials at these two ports of entry recognised just four - Afghanistan, Liberia, Somalia and the war-torn states of the former Yugoslavia. Consultants from Vantage Point, the firm hired last year by the Home Office to examine the asylum system, discovered that 350 Iraqi Kurds, whose persecution by Saddam Hussein has been recognised internationally, were in the queue at East Dover waiting to be interviewed. Their names had been added to a list with thousands of others from all over the world - so many, that the average wait for an interview was two years. If the 350 Kurds had been able to apply for asylum in writing, the rules would not have required them to be interviewed at all. The consultants warned that the system was so inefficient that it would not have been able to handle the flow of asylum-seekers effectively even if the Government had given it all the money and resources it needed and the notorious new computer system at its Croydon headquarters had worked properly. At the time of the report, there was an average delay of 11 months between an asylum-seeker's arrival in Brit-ain and a decision on whether they could stay. The backlog of cases was then 76,570 cases. Each month, more than 4,000 new asylum-seekers arrived, while the decision rate for those already in the country was only 2,000 a month. The authors warned that officials were going to have to increase their efficiency almost fourfold, handling nearly 8,000 cases a month if they were to get to grips with the backlog by April 2001. The backlog has since climbed to nearly 100,000, having doubled since Labour came to power. There are 60,000 in London - 11,000 in just two boroughs, Haringey and Newham. The Government's attempted remedy has been the 'dispersal' system which seeks to move asylum- seekers to underpopulated estates in the North of England. Last month Downing Street said that for the first time in years the number of cases successfully processed was greater than the number of new asylum- seekers coming into the country. On 1 April, the new system of issuing asylum-seekers with vouchers instead of cash will come into force, along with a clampdown on trafficking in illegal immigrants.",

      "body": "<p>At 3:30 this Tuesday afternoon, he will rise to the Dispatch Box, saturnine and granite-jawed. The chattering monkeys of the Westminster jungle will be silenced as the basso profundo tones of the big beast take command of the Commons. His speech will arch across the globe and swoop down to demonstrate mastery of minute details of the briefs of Cabinet colleagues to whom he will not have vouchsafed the secrets of his red box until just before lunch. Labour MPs will be anxious to see the sting drawn from Tory attacks on tax and the discontent in the Labour heartlands salved. They will not, however, be all that nervous. On the experience of his previous performances, Gordon Brown's fourth Budget will write stunning headlines for himself and for the Government. When he sits down an hour or so later, two things can be said with some certainty. The back benches will cheer him with waving order papers while a beamingly congratulatory Tony Blair enthuses for the watching TV cameras. The other thing that we can be sure of is that the one person in the Commons least content with his position will be Gordon Brown.</p> <p>All politicians are driven animals, but the Chancellor burns with an unusually fearsome fire which uses up computer keyboards and colleagues alike. The son of Kirkcaldy absorbed the virtues of hard work and prudence at the knee of his Presbyterian Rector father, whose death 15 months ago Brown felt very keenly. Work is both duty and joy, and he struggles to comprehend why his drive is not matched by lesser mortals. He is rarely awake much later than six, soon after he's on the phone to his intimates, often mid-jog, and he'll be banging out e-mails when feebler spirits are heading for bed. The mundanities of daily life - things like how to open a milk carton without spurting the contents over your shirt - often confound him. He was once so engrossed in a conversation that he opened a car door into oncoming traffic and it was smashed off.</p> <p>Brown lives as if this will be his last productive day on the planet. He is the second son of three brothers, an ambiguous status in the family hierarchy which often makes awkward high-achievers of middle children. When he lost the use of one eye after being kicked in the head playing rugby, the doctor told Brown that he could not say how long he might see with the other. The prospect of going blind - at some unknown time in the future - surely concentrated that formidable mind. Brown first came to some national prominence when he defeated the establishment candidate to be elected student rector of Edinburgh University. Biographers and profile writers always identify this as a landmark, youthful achievement. Yet Brown's own view is that it was a 'wasted year' which he could have spent more productively developing his ideas. The intensity of the man produces equal magnitudes of awed admiration and profound mistrust among colleagues. Another senior Minister, with no particular animus against Brown, says: 'Gordon is an outstanding Chancellor. And an appalling politician. I would trust him with my money, but never with my life.'</p> <p>An outstanding steward of the Treasury he has been. By this stage in the life of every previous post-war Labour Chancellor, the holder of the office had been swamped by economic calamity. Dalton had resigned to be replaced by Cripps who would be devalued; Callaghan had been forced to quit; Healey was running into the throttling embrace of the international bankers. Brown presides over swelling financial surpluses, steady economic growth, and shrinking dole queues that have emboldened him to speak again of Labour's old ambition of full employment. His forecasts have consistently proved more correct than those of commentators or critics. Even some who attacked it at the time now acknowledge the lightning coup, in the first few days after the election, of handing control over interest rates to the Bank of England. It is a unique trio of feats: respected by the City, liked by party activists, and popular with the public. His approval ratings are currently better than those of Tony Blair. If his next three years are as successful as his first three, he will challenge Lloyd George for the title of most outstanding Chancellor of the past 100 years.</p> <p>He is already at least as powerful the as the Welsh Wizard. Brown had to leave the Labour conference of 1998 early to fly to Washington for a meeting of the IMF. As he was driven to the airport with his economics advisor, Ed Balls, and his then spin-meister, Charlie Whelan, the car radio was broadcasting Tony Blair's conference speech. The Prime Minister listed the Government's achievements from the working families tax credit to the minimum wage. As the conference clapped each item, Brown growled over the applause: 'He fought that... he opposed that.'</p> <p>This story speaks to his power. If Blair did fight, Brown prevailed. It speaks to his resentments against Blair. And it speaks to Brown's insecurities. Of all the people in the world, his fellow passengers hardly needed telling who is the principal architect of welfare and work reform.</p> <p>His friend, the Labour MP Tom Clarke, claims that Brown is now more relaxed in his skin, which he puts down to finding happiness in his personal life. Brown and Sarah Macaulay have been partners for four years. Each spring, someone encourages the newspapers to read the banns for a summer wedding. Each summer passes and Gordon has still not produced a ring. He seems to regard marriage as he does the single currency: he favours a successful marriage in principle, but won't say when he expects his convergence criteria to be satisfied. Sarah is knitted into the tight Brown clan of trusties and has formed a close bond with his assistant, Sue Nye. Some report a melancholy wistfulness about Sarah when she is in the company of Sue's new-born. Brown's first love - Princess Margarita of Romania - finally gave up on him after five years, not because she stopped loving him but because 'it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing'.</p> <p>Ironically, it is children, especially the children of working poor families, who are the greatest beneficiaries of the childless Chancellor. Child benefits and tax credits have been his most favoured instrument for shifting resources and opportunities from the well-off to the badly-off. One of the things that makes Brown a large, serious and, in many ways, unfashionable type of politician is that he is a social engineer who still believes that the state can change people's lives and behaviour for the better. He is much more than the economic overlord of this Government. His allies talk glowingly of how he has 'colonised' the entire welfare and work agenda. Over at Number 10, it's a source of complaint that billions have been poured into Brown's schemes at the expense of health and education, the areas more cherished by Tony Blair.</p> <p>It is the compulsion to control that causes the greatest aggravation to col leagues. They groan that the pathologically secretive Brown's idea of consultation is to pick up the phone and bark at them what he has decided five minutes before he issues the press release. One extremely influential figure in the upper reaches of New Labour talks of there being a 'Good Gordon' and a 'Bad Gordon'. Good Gordon has the 'largest and clearest strategic mind in the Government'. At Cabinet 10 days ago, in his capacity as campaign chieftain, Brown gave other Ministers a masterful over-view of the path to winning the next election. Good Gordon is compelling company when he has a glass in hand and is relaxing among the few people he really trusts. Witty as well as wise, he is capable of flashing a smile much more charming than the forced rictus that is displayed on television.</p> <p>Then there is 'Bad Gordon' who 'throws the most appalling tantrums with Tony when he doesn't get his own way'. Witnesses to the more explosive encounters between Blair and Brown often report their shock at the bullying, disdainful, expletive-laden language the Chancellor hurls in the direction of the Prime Minister. Blair - though his frustration can also boil into swearing and shouting - tends to be more sanguine about Brown than anyone else at Number 10. To those, and there are many, who bring him complaints about the Chancellor's behaviour, Blair is apt to reply that it is the price they must all be content to pay for Brown's brilliance.</p> <p>There is a mutual dependence between the two. Brown came to office with a much more developed political philosophy than Blair who found it easier to discard ideological baggage because he has always travelled light. Brown has gone through intellectual turmoils trying to reconcile what he used to believe in - state planning and nationalisation - with the free-market-happy creed of New Labour. In times of need, Brown is still likeliest to be Blair's first port of call, whether it is beating back the nationalists in Scotland or dressing the flimsy frame of the Third Way with solid policy. What the Prime Minister does for his Chancellor is protect him against the animosity of Cabinet colleagues. Blair, the maestro of the mood of Middle Britain, also provides the political cover for Brown's redistribution by stealth.</p> <p>What you cannot help but notice is that the praise Blair lavishes on the talents of Brown is not so generously reciprocated. The defining hinge of this complex relationship is what happened in the days following John Smith's death in 1994. Brown had always taken it as given that he would be the leader and can never be expected to make a full recovery from his shock and grievance that the assumption was not shared by Blair. From a mixture of obligation, guilt and sincere admiration for his abilities and his sacrifice, Blair ceded to him enormous latitude. Yet, however powerful Brown has become, it will never be quite enough so long as someone else bears the title First Lord of the Treasury. Brown would not be human - he certainly would not be Brown - if he was not doing everything to ensure that, if another leadership opportunity comes around, he will be positioned to grasp the ultimate prize.</p> <p>When a potential rival or a perceived threat runs into trouble - glee has been pretty unconfined at the Treasury over the griefs of Stephen Byers - Brown's mood always seems to lighten. He will never forgive what he regards - even if the truth is more complex - as Peter Mandelson's treachery. Just as Mandelson will never forget Brown's complicity in the exposure of his home loan from Geoffrey Robinson which forced Mandelson out of the Cabinet in Christmas 1998. Blair's two best men bring the worst out of each other.</p> <p>The least attractive side of both of their characters is the inability to drop a grudge or end a feud. Though Whelan and Robinson left the Government that Christmas, the old gang continues to operate, albeit more discreetly. Whelan, though he is now pursuing a successful alternative career as a journalist and broadcaster, is also doing bits of business on the side for his hero. Lines of Charlie boosting Brown or rubbishing possible rivals are still fed to sympathetic journalists. Staff at the New Statesman, which Robinson owns, say that the only time the proprietor has ever intervened in the editorial content of the magazine was to insist, at Brown's behest, that it run a weekly Scottish supplement, the idea being to reinforce his fiefdom north of the border. Some of his friends believe that Brown is on a sort of promise from Blair that the succession will be his mid-way through the next parliament. Blair will decide that he wants to be a proper father to his fourth child, and hand on the torch. Among Brown's enemies, there is a deep and abiding suspicion of his ambitions. Says one Blairite: 'I think Gordon plans to replace Tony - whether Tony plans to retire or not.' We would hear less of this if Gordon Brown could relax just a little, and enjoy harvesting the deserved plaudits for a Chancellor at the peak of his powers. And you can hear how he would reply to that: Peak? Peak? Whose saying this is my peak?

      "body": "<p>It is when Chancellors are the object of adulation that they should be most on their guard. I have no doubt that Gordon Brown will turn in another vintage performance on Tuesday; but beneath the superficial perception of superb economic policies, financial stability and steady economic growth, the signs are multiplying that all is not well with what we used to call British industry. And this is bound to damage the wider economy. </p> <p>We have to use the phrase 'British industry' with care, because industry located in Britain, rather like financial institutions located in the City of London, is increasingly foreign-owned. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, some 25 per cent of 'British' manufacturing output is from foreign-owned firms. </p> <p>Sir Geoffrey Owen points out in his magisterial work From Empire to Europe (HarperCollins), that some three-quarters of 'British' car exports now come from Japanese assembly plants opened in Britain during recent decades, and from the older UK subsidiaries of Ford, General Motors and Peugeot. </p> <p>Of course, if foreign-owned companies here are gradually closed down or sold as a result of decisions made in Munich, Tokyo or Detroit, then by definition the consequence is to reduce the percentage of foreign ownership as well as the manufacturing base itself. I am reminded of the point made to me early in the Eighties by Sir John Harvey-Jones, then chairman of ICI, before his next career as television's 'Troubleshooter'. Sir John was firmly of the view that, when it came to the crunch, foreign multinationals would not hesitate to close down their British subsidiaries. </p> <p>In recent weeks there seem to have been crunches at Harland &amp; Wolff, Rover, British Steel (now known as Corus) and, if not a crunch, then at least a severe scare at Ford. The impact will be bad enough on the business and workforce; but there are also likely to be repercussions on other local firms and communities. </p> <p>The subtitle of Owen's book is 'The decline and revival of British Industry Since the Second World War'. It is the 'revival' thesis that intrigues me. Owen is dismissive of most government industrial policies of the pre-Thatcher years, and attributes British industry's putative revival to a mixture of the increased competitive pressures of the Eighties, and the benefits to the British economy of 'inward investment' - foreign ownership.

      "bodyText": "It is when Chancellors are the object of adulation that they should be most on their guard. I have no doubt that Gordon Brown will turn in another vintage performance on Tuesday; but beneath the superficial perception of superb economic policies, financial stability and steady economic growth, the signs are multiplying that all is not well with what we used to call British industry. And this is bound to damage the wider economy. We have to use the phrase 'British industry' with care, because industry located in Britain, rather like financial institutions located in the City of London, is increasingly foreign-owned. According to the Department of Trade and Industry, some 25 per cent of 'British' manufacturing output is from foreign-owned firms. Sir Geoffrey Owen points out in his magisterial work From Empire to Europe (HarperCollins), that some three-quarters of 'British' car exports now come from Japanese assembly plants opened in Britain during recent decades, and from the older UK subsidiaries of Ford, General Motors and Peugeot. Of course, if foreign-owned companies here are gradually closed down or sold as a result of decisions made in Munich, Tokyo or Detroit, then by definition the consequence is to reduce the percentage of foreign ownership as well as the manufacturing base itself. I am reminded of the point made to me early in the Eighties by Sir John Harvey-Jones, then chairman of ICI, before his next career as television's 'Troubleshooter'. Sir John was firmly of the view that, when it came to the crunch, foreign multinationals would not hesitate to close down their British subsidiaries. In recent weeks there seem to have been crunches at Harland &amp; Wolff, Rover, British Steel (now known as Corus) and, if not a crunch, then at least a severe scare at Ford. The impact will be bad enough on the business and workforce; but there are also likely to be repercussions on other local firms and communities. The subtitle of Owen's book is 'The decline and revival of British Industry Since the Second World War'. It is the 'revival' thesis that intrigues me. Owen is dismissive of most government industrial policies of the pre-Thatcher years, and attributes British industry's putative revival to a mixture of the increased competitive pressures of the Eighties, and the benefits to the British economy of 'inward investment' - foreign ownership. Loosely translated, Britain's industry is supposed to have benefited from globalisation and Thatcherism. Owen gives short shrift to 'short-termism' and other familiar explanations of poor industrial performance; his principal theme is that, unlike the Germans and the French, we did not expose ourselves to the beneficial winds of competition until late in the day. Given the timelags involved in these matters, I recently suggested to him at a National Institute of Economic and Social Research seminar that perhaps improved productivity in the Eighties could be attributed to the delayed impact of Sir Edward Heath's policy of taking us into the Common Market in 1973, rather than to Thatcherism. Owen notes: 'However nationalistic [Mrs Thatcher] may have been on other issues, she had no inhibitions about making the British economy more dependent on foreign companies.' He also says: 'With hindsight, the overvaluation of sterling [in the early Eighties] could be regarded as a fortunate accident which contributed to the subsequent success of the Thatcher government's supply side policies' - the crisis forced improvements in productivity. As a matter of fact, it was my old friend Lord (Peter) Walker who tried to salvage something from the macro-economic disasters of the early Eighties: faced with people like Thatcher and Sir Keith Joseph (who believed the Department of Trade and Industry should be abolished) he urged a policy of encouraging inward investment as a way of at least achieving some kind of industrial policy. Higher productivity was a necessary but not a sufficient condition for improving the supply side. The growth of supply itself - actual production - was woefully slow in the UK in the Eighties, and still is. And here we have once again an overvalued pound - a common factor behind recent industrial crunches and scares. I wonder if Owen thinks this is a prelude to another economic miracle.

A year after Nato launched a bombing campaign to rescue the KLA, Pentagon commanders have formally alerted the US military that it expects to have to engage its former allies 'this spring'. This comes as senior officials in the Defence Department continue to fight plans to send further reinforcements into what many consider a potential war zone. The grim prognosis for the restive province has emerged days before the first anniversary of Nato's bombing raids against Yugoslavia after Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to negotiate over Kosovo. It arises amid increasing tension between Washington and Nato commanders in Brussels over the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo. US military officials and Western diplomats based in Pristina, Kosovo's edgy capital, say there is evidence that Albanian insurgents are bent on stirring trouble in southern Serbia, on the province's eastern boundary.

      "bodyText": "Banks, already accused of profiteering, face a new threat tomorrow when a Government-backed inquiry is to support a campaign to lift restrictions on 'cashback' facilities for shoppers and drinkers. Supermarkets, which have joined the campaign by retailers, are threatening to remove the banks' cashpoint machines from their stores unless the bankers lift the \u00a350 limit on cashbacks at the tills. Pub chains are planning to expand trial cash services. The Banking Industry Review will say the banks should relax the limit because consumers will soon be hit by penalties of up to \u00a32.50 when they take as little as \u00a310 from cashpoints - even though withdrawals costs the banks a maximum of 30p. The inquiry head, Don Cruickshank, has already recommended in an interim report that the limit should be raised as part of a general relaxation of restrictions on consumer choice. 'Retailers are in discussions with each other and with the banks about the \u00a350 limit and they would be very happy to see it raised,' said British Retail Consortium (BRC) official Ann Grain. Sainsbury's said it had told banks it would not renew licences for the 919 cashpoint machines at its stores unless the limit is eased. 'Why should our customers pay a fine to withdraw cash from a machine outside our store when they can get it for free at our tills?' asked a spokesman. 'This limit is out-dated and unfair.' Half of all adults in the AB social group use a cashpoint at least once a week and are expected to be among the worst hit by the banks' new fees. People living in rural areas and small towns are particularly badly affected. Sainsbury says its cashback transactions have increased by 10 per cent since banks agreed to charge cashpoint users. Asda puts its rise at double that. All kinds of retailers have joined the campaign, including brewer Whitbread. 'Our trial of the cashback service in the Hogshead pubs has been very successful, especially with students and in remote areas,' said a Whitbread spokeswoman. The banks, which imposed the limit in the Eighties, claim that raising it would encourage fraud. The Cruickshank report is expected to reject this argument. The retailers say increasing cashbacks would lessen the risk of theft because they will have less money in the tills. They would also benefit from reduced cash collection fees and bank charges. The campaign is the latest twist in a long-running row between retailers and banks over charges. The BRC accuses the banks of 'cartel-like practices'. The Cruickshank report is expected to criticise the banks for the way they levy charges and make 'excessive' profits. Its interim study found that the current system of cashpoint charges 'is inefficient, anti-competitive and socially exclusive'. It added: 'There is an overwhelming case for change.' Cruickshank wants access to cash opened up: 'Retailers are natural suppliers of cash to their customers, and might be willing to increase their activities in this regard if permitted by card scheme rules.' Some observers expect the former chief of the telecoms watchdog, Oftel, to take the ultimate step of recommending that banks be referred to the Office of Fair Trading. The review's publication, the day before the Budget, will enable the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, to renew his attack on institutions whose power works against the consumer.",

      "body": "<p>It was daylight, but the car's headlights were on. As Betty Wilson drove past the mud-caked brown Sierra parked on a grass verge, she noticed a small man in the driver's seat trying to pull a trilby hat down over his face. Alongside him was a woman sitting bolt upright in a jet black dress.</p> <p>'Her eyes were open,' Wilson said last week. 'And she had strange marks on her face.' But she was in a hurry to get to work and drove on.</p> <p>The 20-year-old woman in the Sierra, Samo Paull, was dead. She had been strangled and burst blood vessels had made her skin go mottled. The nervous-looking man was Alun Kyte, a loner from the West Midlands police now believe may be a worse mass killer than Peter Sutcliffe, the infamous Yorkshire Ripper.</p> <p>Like Sutcliffe, Kyte had few friends and a violent hatred of women. He also preyed on prostitutes and killed them after sex. Like Sutcliffe, Kyte managed to evade arrest for years. But while Sutcliffe was jailed for killing eight young women, detectives believe Kyte, 35, may have murdered as many as 20 prostitutes in a macabre murder spree lasting almost two decades.</p> <p>He was given two life sentences at Nottingham Crown Court last week for the murder of Paull, last seen alive in December 1993, and another Birmingham prostitute, Tracy Turner, last seen on 3 March 1994 at 12.41am at the Hilton Park Service station on the M6 near Staffordshire. Her naked body was found seven hours later, dumped on the verge of another desolate lane.</p> <p>But the proceedings in court did not convey the full story of the activities of the so-called Midlands Ripper or the extent of his evil. As detectives told The Observer this weekend that they were examining the disappearances of prostitutes going back to 1984, the first details of Kyte's life were beginning to emerge - and a trail of deaths stretching from Liverpool to Glasgow.</p> <p>It seemed, according to detectives, that he chose to live an itinerant lifestyle in order to maximise his opportunity to kill in different parts of the country.</p> <p>There was little to suggest from his background that Kyte would embark on such a grisly criminal career. He was born on 7 July 1964 in Tittensor, Stoke on Trent. After growing up with his parents in a quiet suburban street in the Rickerscote area of Stafford, Kyte left school and started a series of odd jobs.</p> <p>A sickly youngster, he always kept an inhaler nearby in case of a sudden attack of the chronic asthma he had suffered from since he was a boy. His mother and two sisters doted on him, believing he could do no wrong.</p> <p>Few people knew Kyte closely. A rare childhood friend at the local pub says: 'He'd come in here with his mate, play pool and leave.' He was rarely seen with women and often lived in hostels or bed and breakfasts, and often travelled hundreds of miles in a week, telling acquaintances he was looking for work.</p> <p>Detectives now know he was also scouring the country for victims. They were almost always prostitutes - picked because they were vulnerable and many did not have families who knew what they were doing. He also frequented motorway service stations.</p> <p>When reports first reached police that a man was attacking prostitutes, it was difficult to know if the same person was involved. Information on the attacks was collated by Operation Enigma, the police's audacious attempt to find links between 72 unsolved murders of women throughout the country.</p> <p>The operation, run by the National Crime Faculty in Hampshire, used tracking and data analysis techniques from Canada. Detectives and forensic scientists sought to upgrade DNA samples and genetic information discovered at the scene of every crime, and match them to unsolved murders.</p> <p>But Kyte was cunning. A chilling insight into his modus operandi was provided to The Observer last week by a former prostitute in the Birmingham area. Now the mother of five children, she was working alone on a wet March night in the Balsall Heath area. At 10pm, she was approached by Kyte, who offered her \u00a340 for sex. He was her seventh customer that night. 'He drove me in a tan Maestro for a few miles down the road, and we stopped in the dark, unlit car park of Moseley Hall Hospital.'</p> <p>Kyte's accent was soft - reassuring. Cassette tapes and litter were strewn about the car floor; a tartan blanket was stretched across the back seat. Kyte went to the back of the car, something she was accustomed to, as many businessmen kept their money in their briefcase in the boot.</p> <p>He got back in the car and put his left arm around her neck, and put a Stanley knife to her neck. 'He told me to give him my purse and house keys, and to take my clothes off. I was petrified and kept telling him not to kill me, that I was three months pregnant. Something in him must have changed at the mention of a baby, as he then told me to get out, and threw my clothes after me.'</p> <p>The woman ran to the local police station and made a full statement. Since the murders of Turner and Paull, the police had moved to make the local prostitutes more aware of the threat. She admits her escape was down to luck; her abiding impression of the man with the blade to her throat was that he had been in that situation before.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, Kyte was seen at Alton Services in the West Midlands masquerading as a reporter from Stafford. He asked detailed questions about recent murders in the area and whether the victims had been seen at the service station, and used a pay phone to make a fake call to his news editor.</p> <p>Kyte enjoyed the high profile his gruesome murders warranted and managed to evade police despite being arrested for a string of petty offences. His favourite crime was to shoplift goods and return them for cash.</p> <p>On the night of Tracy Turner's death, Central Television ran a reconstruction of Paull's murder. But the Crime Stalker programme went disastrously wrong: police believe Kyte saw the programme and that it fuelled his desire to kill again three hours later.</p> <p>He was arrested in December 1997 at the scene of a rape. His victim had fled the lodging house where he had sodomised her and Kyte was arrested two hours later, leaving the premises. He was found guilty at Bristol Crown Court and sentenced to eight years in jail.</p> <p>It was only after detectives took a routine sample that his DNA was matched with that found on the body of Turner in March 1998. He was charged with her murder in May of that year, and that of Paull's soon after. Detectives were jubilant: they had their man.</p> <p>Now police are investigating his connection with the August 1994 strangling of Liverpool-born Julie Finlay, 23, found semi-naked in a field near the Raynford bypass; the 1997 Glasgow murder of prostitute Tracy Wylde; with the murder of Natalie Pearman in November 1992; with the 1994 strangling of Dawn Shields from Sheffield; with the March 1993 strangling of Gloucester prostitute Carol Clark, found dumped by a Bristol canal. They are also going back as far as the murder of 28-year-old prostitute Yvonne Coley in 1984.</p> <p>Their relatives wait with what Julie Finlay's mother, Patricia, describes as the 'same set of emotions that occur every time the police have a lead'. They just want the crimes linked to the killer.</p> <p>One emotion remains constant. 'I can't get Julie out of my mind', her mother says. 'Her killer is still alive while she's in a cemetery.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nick.walsh@observer.co.uk\">nick.walsh@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It was daylight, but the car's headlights were on. As Betty Wilson drove past the mud-caked brown Sierra parked on a grass verge, she noticed a small man in the driver's seat trying to pull a trilby hat down over his face. Alongside him was a woman sitting bolt upright in a jet black dress. 'Her eyes were open,' Wilson said last week. 'And she had strange marks on her face.' But she was in a hurry to get to work and drove on. The 20-year-old woman in the Sierra, Samo Paull, was dead. She had been strangled and burst blood vessels had made her skin go mottled. The nervous-looking man was Alun Kyte, a loner from the West Midlands police now believe may be a worse mass killer than Peter Sutcliffe, the infamous Yorkshire Ripper. Like Sutcliffe, Kyte had few friends and a violent hatred of women. He also preyed on prostitutes and killed them after sex. Like Sutcliffe, Kyte managed to evade arrest for years. But while Sutcliffe was jailed for killing eight young women, detectives believe Kyte, 35, may have murdered as many as 20 prostitutes in a macabre murder spree lasting almost two decades. He was given two life sentences at Nottingham Crown Court last week for the murder of Paull, last seen alive in December 1993, and another Birmingham prostitute, Tracy Turner, last seen on 3 March 1994 at 12.41am at the Hilton Park Service station on the M6 near Staffordshire. Her naked body was found seven hours later, dumped on the verge of another desolate lane. But the proceedings in court did not convey the full story of the activities of the so-called Midlands Ripper or the extent of his evil. As detectives told The Observer this weekend that they were examining the disappearances of prostitutes going back to 1984, the first details of Kyte's life were beginning to emerge - and a trail of deaths stretching from Liverpool to Glasgow. It seemed, according to detectives, that he chose to live an itinerant lifestyle in order to maximise his opportunity to kill in different parts of the country. There was little to suggest from his background that Kyte would embark on such a grisly criminal career. He was born on 7 July 1964 in Tittensor, Stoke on Trent. After growing up with his parents in a quiet suburban street in the Rickerscote area of Stafford, Kyte left school and started a series of odd jobs. A sickly youngster, he always kept an inhaler nearby in case of a sudden attack of the chronic asthma he had suffered from since he was a boy. His mother and two sisters doted on him, believing he could do no wrong. Few people knew Kyte closely. A rare childhood friend at the local pub says: 'He'd come in here with his mate, play pool and leave.' He was rarely seen with women and often lived in hostels or bed and breakfasts, and often travelled hundreds of miles in a week, telling acquaintances he was looking for work. Detectives now know he was also scouring the country for victims. They were almost always prostitutes - picked because they were vulnerable and many did not have families who knew what they were doing. He also frequented motorway service stations. When reports first reached police that a man was attacking prostitutes, it was difficult to know if the same person was involved. Information on the attacks was collated by Operation Enigma, the police's audacious attempt to find links between 72 unsolved murders of women throughout the country. The operation, run by the National Crime Faculty in Hampshire, used tracking and data analysis techniques from Canada. Detectives and forensic scientists sought to upgrade DNA samples and genetic information discovered at the scene of every crime, and match them to unsolved murders. But Kyte was cunning. A chilling insight into his modus operandi was provided to The Observer last week by a former prostitute in the Birmingham area. Now the mother of five children, she was working alone on a wet March night in the Balsall Heath area. At 10pm, she was approached by Kyte, who offered her \u00a340 for sex. He was her seventh customer that night. 'He drove me in a tan Maestro for a few miles down the road, and we stopped in the dark, unlit car park of Moseley Hall Hospital.' Kyte's accent was soft - reassuring. Cassette tapes and litter were strewn about the car floor; a tartan blanket was stretched across the back seat. Kyte went to the back of the car, something she was accustomed to, as many businessmen kept their money in their briefcase in the boot. He got back in the car and put his left arm around her neck, and put a Stanley knife to her neck. 'He told me to give him my purse and house keys, and to take my clothes off. I was petrified and kept telling him not to kill me, that I was three months pregnant. Something in him must have changed at the mention of a baby, as he then told me to get out, and threw my clothes after me.' The woman ran to the local police station and made a full statement. Since the murders of Turner and Paull, the police had moved to make the local prostitutes more aware of the threat. She admits her escape was down to luck; her abiding impression of the man with the blade to her throat was that he had been in that situation before. Soon afterwards, Kyte was seen at Alton Services in the West Midlands masquerading as a reporter from Stafford. He asked detailed questions about recent murders in the area and whether the victims had been seen at the service station, and used a pay phone to make a fake call to his news editor. Kyte enjoyed the high profile his gruesome murders warranted and managed to evade police despite being arrested for a string of petty offences. His favourite crime was to shoplift goods and return them for cash. On the night of Tracy Turner's death, Central Television ran a reconstruction of Paull's murder. But the Crime Stalker programme went disastrously wrong: police believe Kyte saw the programme and that it fuelled his desire to kill again three hours later. He was arrested in December 1997 at the scene of a rape. His victim had fled the lodging house where he had sodomised her and Kyte was arrested two hours later, leaving the premises. He was found guilty at Bristol Crown Court and sentenced to eight years in jail. It was only after detectives took a routine sample that his DNA was matched with that found on the body of Turner in March 1998. He was charged with her murder in May of that year, and that of Paull's soon after. Detectives were jubilant: they had their man. Now police are investigating his connection with the August 1994 strangling of Liverpool-born Julie Finlay, 23, found semi-naked in a field near the Raynford bypass; the 1997 Glasgow murder of prostitute Tracy Wylde; with the murder of Natalie Pearman in November 1992; with the 1994 strangling of Dawn Shields from Sheffield; with the March 1993 strangling of Gloucester prostitute Carol Clark, found dumped by a Bristol canal. They are also going back as far as the murder of 28-year-old prostitute Yvonne Coley in 1984. Their relatives wait with what Julie Finlay's mother, Patricia, describes as the 'same set of emotions that occur every time the police have a lead'. They just want the crimes linked to the killer. One emotion remains constant. 'I can't get Julie out of my mind', her mother says. 'Her killer is still alive while she's in a cemetery.' nick.walsh@observer.co.uk",

The newsgroups are often explicitly named: several are described as pre-teens erotica. Others hide behind impenetrable acronyms. Sources in the Internet world suggest that there are up to 40 newsgroups carried by Demon that promote paedophile material.</p> <p>Newsgroups are stored on an ISP's own news server - a computer database that records all the posted messages. If it were proved that Demon was aware paedophile material had been placed on its server and had failed to remove it, the ISP would be breaking the law. Demon says it acts quickly to remove paedophilic material when it is drawn to its attention.</p> <p>Yesterday The Observer found scores of paedophilic material in several newsgroups carried by Demon. Some showed young teenage girls and boys; others were of young children performing sex acts on adults. It is illegal to download such material, but this newspaper, which has now destroyed the images, believes it was acting in the public interest.</p> <p>Four years ago the Government became so worried about the way the Internet was becoming a playground for paedophiles that it threatened sweeping regulatory measures. Ministers became alarmed after the Metropolitan Police issued a list of 133 newsgroups which it believed contained material of a criminal nature.</p> <p>In response, the ISPs, terrified that their autonomy was about to be curtailed, formed what was to become the Internet Watch Foundation, a self-regulatory body made up of the big players in the Internet. Demon was a driving force behind the creation of the IWF. One of its Internet experts, Clive Feather, be-came its first chairman. The idea was that the IWF would alert the ISPs to the presence of paedophilic material on their servers and would pass on complaints from the public. If an ISP refused to remove the material, the IWF would then alert the police.</p> <p>But it is clear that something failed to spark at the IWF and in 1998 the Government called in advisers from accountants KPMG and law firm Denton Hall to suggest how the organisation could be strengthened. Relaunched last month, the new look IWF is endorsed by the Government and, in particular, the Department of Trade and Industry, which played a 'facilitating role in its creation', according to a DTI spokesman.</p> <p>At the time of its launch, Patricia Hewitt, Minister for E-Commerce, said: 'The Internet Watch Foundation plays a vital role in combating criminal material on the Net.' To offset accusations of bias in favour of the ISPs, a new independent chairman was appointed. Roger Darlington, head of research at the Communication Workers Union, heads an enlarged 13-strong board. However, Demon retains two places on the board. Feather chairs the IWF's funding body. Demon contributes around \u00a330,000 a year to the IWF's \u00a3225,000 running costs.</p> <p>Critics have suggested that the fact that ISPs, notably Demon, continue to sit on the industry's own regulatory board represents a conflict of interest. But the Government is loath to scrap the IWF, believing a self-regulatory system is the best solution to a complex problem. The Metropolitan Police also believe that working with the ISPs, rather than trying to force some strong-arm solution, is the way forward.</p> <p>'We have always taken the view that the co-operation approach was the best one. My disappointment is that the industry in general has not felt it possible to agree a consistent policy,' Jauch said.</p> <p>Demon has in the past argued that deleting selected newsgroups was counter-productive. The IWF's Darlington said: 'There's a debate in the industry as to whether that [banning certain newsgroups] would shuffle the problem elsewhere.'</p> <p>Certainly this policy of 'containment', as it is known in the industry, appears to have reaped dividends. The IWF, by monitoring some of the most notorious newsgroups, was able to alert the police to a prolific distributor of paedophile material. Leslie Bollingbroke, 42, who used the Internet pseudonym 'Sam', was recently jailed for four years for posting images of children.</p> <p>However, the containment argument gets short shrift from other quarters.</p> <p>'There is no evidence to support this argument, and much to suggest that it is misguided. Most British ISPs have removed paedophile groups without any increase in the amount of illegal content posted to other groups,' one expert said.</p> <p>Critics of the self-regulation model also point out a paradox at its heart. The IWF often has to rely on tip-offs from the public. But few members of the public will admit to having downloaded paedophiliac material because this is a criminal offence. Recently the IWF's remit was expanded to examine racist publications in newsgroups - a move critics fear may dilute its ability to monitor paedophiliac postings even further.</p> <p>The police, too, have only limited resources. 'Our Internet unit is very small. We can't monitor what goes on right across the Internet,' said Jauch.</p> <p>Demon declined to comment on why it was practically the only ISP to continue to carry newsgroups that have been shown habitually to carry paedophilic material. In a written response to The Observer 's questions it stated: 'Newsgroups have long been established as being one of the most valuable of these services, and at their best serve to unite interested parties across the globe to share knowledge and information.'</p> <p>Critics say paedophiles will merely end up subscribing to foreign ISPs if all of their UK rivals ban selected newsgroups, so a blanket prohibition is futile. However Jauch said: 'That's the same as a club owner saying, \"Lots of people take drugs so therefore it's OK if I allow drugs in my club\".'</p> <p>One observer said: 'It's an interesting balance between the protection of children and civil liberties. Although it's not that difficult to work out which side most people fall down on.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jamie.doward@observer.co.uk\">jamie.doward@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

In response, the ISPs, terrified that their autonomy was about to be curtailed, formed what was to become the Internet Watch Foundation, a self-regulatory body made up of the big players in the Internet. Demon was a driving force behind the creation of the IWF. One of its Internet experts, Clive Feather, be-came its first chairman. The idea was that the IWF would alert the ISPs to the presence of paedophilic material on their servers and would pass on complaints from the public. If an ISP refused to remove the material, the IWF would then alert the police. But it is clear that something failed to spark at the IWF and in 1998 the Government called in advisers from accountants KPMG and law firm Denton Hall to suggest how the organisation could be strengthened. Relaunched last month, the new look IWF is endorsed by the Government and, in particular, the Department of Trade and Industry, which played a 'facilitating role in its creation', according to a DTI spokesman. At the time of its launch, Patricia Hewitt, Minister for E-Commerce, said: 'The Internet Watch Foundation plays a vital role in combating criminal material on the Net.' To offset accusations of bias in favour of the ISPs, a new independent chairman was appointed. Roger Darlington, head of research at the Communication Workers Union, heads an enlarged 13-strong board. However, Demon retains two places on the board. Feather chairs the IWF's funding body. Demon contributes around \u00a330,000 a year to the IWF's \u00a3225,000 running costs. Critics have suggested that the fact that ISPs, notably Demon, continue to sit on the industry's own regulatory board represents a conflict of interest. But the Government is loath to scrap the IWF, believing a self-regulatory system is the best solution to a complex problem. The Metropolitan Police also believe that working with the ISPs, rather than trying to force some strong-arm solution, is the way forward. 'We have always taken the view that the co-operation approach was the best one. My disappointment is that the industry in general has not felt it possible to agree a consistent policy,' Jauch said. Demon has in the past argued that deleting selected newsgroups was counter-productive. The IWF's Darlington said: 'There's a debate in the industry as to whether that [banning certain newsgroups] would shuffle the problem elsewhere.' Certainly this policy of 'containment', as it is known in the industry, appears to have reaped dividends. The IWF, by monitoring some of the most notorious newsgroups, was able to alert the police to a prolific distributor of paedophile material. Leslie Bollingbroke, 42, who used the Internet pseudonym 'Sam', was recently jailed for four years for posting images of children. However, the containment argument gets short shrift from other quarters. 'There is no evidence to support this argument, and much to suggest that it is misguided. Most British ISPs have removed paedophile groups without any increase in the amount of illegal content posted to other groups,' one expert said. Critics of the self-regulation model also point out a paradox at its heart. The IWF often has to rely on tip-offs from the public. But few members of the public will admit to having downloaded paedophiliac material because this is a criminal offence. Recently the IWF's remit was expanded to examine racist publications in newsgroups - a move critics fear may dilute its ability to monitor paedophiliac postings even further. The police, too, have only limited resources. 'Our Internet unit is very small. We can't monitor what goes on right across the Internet,' said Jauch. Demon declined to comment on why it was practically the only ISP to continue to carry newsgroups that have been shown habitually to carry paedophilic material. In a written response to The Observer 's questions it stated: 'Newsgroups have long been established as being one of the most valuable of these services, and at their best serve to unite interested parties across the globe to share knowledge and information.' Critics say paedophiles will merely end up subscribing to foreign ISPs if all of their UK rivals ban selected newsgroups, so a blanket prohibition is futile. However Jauch said: 'That's the same as a club owner saying, \"Lots of people take drugs so therefore it's OK if I allow drugs in my club\".' One observer said: 'It's an interesting balance between the protection of children and civil liberties. Although it's not that difficult to work out which side most people fall down on.' jamie.doward@observer.co.uk",

Keiran Riley died in the early hours yesterday at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh where he had undergone emergency surgery for severe burns after the blaze at his home in Hawick on Friday morning. His seven-month-old sister, Caitlyn, was snatched from her smoke-filled bedroom by their father, Kenny, a Lothian and Borders firefighter who drove the first engine to arrive at the scene. Last night, she remained in a 'critical but stable' condition, suffering from the effects of inhaling the choking black smoke that had spread rapidly through the end-of-terrace house. Mr Riley's wife, Caroline, 38, and her son Derek McLean, 20, were downstairs when the fire broke out and got the couple's two other children, Shannon, two, and Connor, one, outside to safety. But they were prevented by the flames from getting back inside to rescue Keiran and Caitlyn. Colleagues said yesterday that the family were coping 'as well as they possibly could' under the circumstances. A fire brigade spokesman said: 'They are doing OK, but it is pretty tough for any family to deal with this sort of tragedy.' After spending Friday and most of yesterday morning at the hospital, Mrs Riley returned to Hawick to care for their other children while Mr Riley remained at his daughter's bedside. The brigade has made counselling available, and has arranged transport for the family to travel between their home and Edinburgh. A post-mortem is due to be carried out on Keiran today. Mr Riley , a firefighter with 15 years experience, was 10 minutes from the end of his night shift when the 999 call came through from his stepson, Derek, shortly before 8am. He then sped to his home to his home in Queens Drive a qaurter of a mile away. Without stopping to put on breathing apparatus, he beat his way through the flames and smoke to rescue Caitlyn while directing his colleagues towards Keiran's bedroom, where the blaze is understood to have started. Mr Riley's assistant divisional commander, Ian Currie, praised him, saying his instincts had overtaken his normal firefighting duties.

      "bodyText": "David Wright, the father of the late Loyalist Volunteer Force leader, Billy Wright, has always been proud to be British - until recently. Now the 67-year-old grandfather from the loyalist heartland of Portadown says he has lost his faith in British justice after what he describes as a 'series of cover-ups' over the murder of his notorious son in the top-security Maze prison in 1997. Billy Wright was a hate-figure for nationalists in Northern Ireland, who lived in fear of his Mid-Ulster UVF brigade and later the breakaway LVF, when a team of young loyalists called 'the rat-pack' carried out a campaign of sectarian killings in a part of the Province that became known as the 'murder triangle'. But Wright's father says his son's reputation should not stop those who believe in civil liberties from investigating the strange circumstances of his death, two days after Christmas 1997. Later this month David Wright will meet the human rights group British/Irish Rights Watch, which for years has highlighted allegations of the shoot-to-kill, torture and intimidation of republicans by the security forces, to discuss the case. Wright has been told that the RUC file on his son's death has been closed following the arrest and conviction of three Irish National Liberation Army prisoners who breached security to shoot Billy Wright dead in the forecourt of H-Block 6.

The Sainsbury Laboratory at Science Minister Lord Sainsbury's Gatsby Foundation and the John Innes Centre are based on the same site in Norwich and have set up a joint company to profit from their discoveries. \u0095 The Wellcome Trust is paying for a key employee to work inside the Government's Office for Science and Technology. Sarah Ginn works for the Council for Science and Technology, which advises the Prime Minister on major scientific advances. The decision by the Prime Minister to locate the new synchrotron laboratory at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire has provoked protests worldwide from scientists. A synchrotron is a doughnut-shaped machine which can produce exceptionally good quality X-ray images by using electrons travelling at the speed of light, guided by magnets. The new facility is regarded as vital to the future of molecular biology and genome research. Wellcome is contributing \u00a3100m towards the \u00a3500m cost of the new laboratory. The British Government is putting up close to \u00a3350m and the French are giving \u00a350m. Many scientists believe that basing the laboratory in Oxford will threaten the world-beating research into causes of breast cancer currently being undertaken by the team already based in Cheshire, at the Daresbury laboratory, near Warrington. They had hoped that the new lab would enhance their existing research and now fear the break up of their team. Warrington MP Helen Southworth warned: 'It's not just a box you can label and send somewhere else. It's 500 jobs and 500 families.' Dr Rob Lewis, who heads Daresbury's breast cancer team, said: 'This is an outrageous decision and a disaster for Britain. All the people at Daresbury will up and leave, and we will lose the team which took seven years to build up. 'We're not highly paid. Typical salaries are in the low twenties. Up here, that buys you a three-bedroom house. Down there, it gets you a box. Two senior electronics engineers have already resigned. This is meltdown.' Liverpool MP Peter Kilfoyle, who quit the Government over his fears that it is ignoring the North-South divide, said: 'It's an outrageous decision. It's part of the attempt to put everything in the golden triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge.'",

Trimble's problems will be compounded when his former ally David Burnside forces an emergency extra meeting of the UUC to debate a motion making a return to government conditional upon retention of 'the proud name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary'.

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, and Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain launched an extraordinary attack on the Home Office over its attempts to force The Observer to hand over records it might have relating to the former M15 officer David Shayler. Cook made protests at the 'highest level' and Hain is said to be 'horrified' at what he believes to be a grave attack on press freedom through the actions against this newspaper and our sister publication The Guardian. The revelations highlight growing tensions between the Foreign Office and Home Office on how to deal with allegations that MI6 was involved in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadaffi, in 1995. A senior Whitehall source said: 'The Home Office has gone manic on this... it's bloody crazy, the Government should not be picking a war with the press.' On Friday an Old Bailey judge ordered The Observer and Guardian to hand over material relating to Shayler to aid a Special Branch investigation into serious breaches of the Official Secrets Act. Three weeks ago an Observer front-page article repeated claims by the former intelligence officer that M16 had been involved in a plot to murder Gadaffi. The Observer obtained the names of two MI6 officers allegedly involved but did not publish them. The Guardian was ordered to hand over the original of an e-mailed letter it published from Shayler. The Observer's barrister Michael Tugendhat QC argued that the Special Branch action was in breach of journalistic freedom of expression as enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights. He said there was no evidence that the article damaged the national interest. Roger Alton, editor of The Observer , said: 'Our front page story covered issues of enormous public interest. This case raises very important principles about journalists and their sources and the protection of their sources.' Last night Shayler said: 'The Government is adopting the tactics of a totalitarian state by attacking the press in this way.' Both newspapers said they would challenge the judge's order, taking it to the European court of human rights if necessary.",

The two pianists, Steven Maughan and CBTO's music director Jonathan Hinden, convinced you that Debussy had always intended his music this way. In great works the heat is at the centre not on the surface and always shines out. We certainly heard as much of Debussy as Proust did when he listened to the first performance on the telephone. There are two more performances, in Wakefield tomorrow and at Snape Maltings this Saturday. Olivier Messiaen first encountered Pell\u00e9as in 1918 when he was 10 years old. It left a lasting impression and his own music took root in that same anti-symphonic tradition. Those of us ineluctably drawn to Birmingham again on Wednesday had the chance to hear Messiaen's monolithic last summation, \u00e9clairs sur l'au-del\u00e0 , first performed just after his death in 1992. This 11-movement contemplation, played by a vast orchestra, displays Messiaen at his most refined and most spectacular. In the ninth 'Birds of the Trees of Life' section, an astonishing trilling and twittering of eight clarinets, seven flutes and three piccolos bursts forth, by some elaborate calculation managing to play the songs of 25 different birds.

The exotic mix of bamboo chimes, roto toms and a variety of bells and cymbals, reflecting Weir's acknowledged debt to 'cheerful' Buddhist funeral music, would have appealed to Messiaen, and made an apt contrast to \u00e9clairs. </p> <p>In this aurally ingenious score, full of dry-bone rattles and whispers, the sound of all the string players tapping their fingers rapidly on the wood of their instruments, swirling up through the orchestra like a chill wind through trees and echoed elsewhere by flurries of ascending scales, was an especially brilliant touch. The excellently drilled treble voices of the City of Birmingham Symphony Youth Chorus, aged from eight to 12 and performing from memory, sang out the long, overarching lines with evident relish.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As chief reporter for the Bristol Evening Post, Nigel Dando has knocked on the doors of too many people whose loved ones have been murdered. 'It's the job you most dread,' he says. 'Fifty per cent will say I don't want to talk about it. Go away. The other 50 per cent will invite you in. For them, it's a therapeutic thing, I suppose, a way of expressing their grief.'</p> <p>Today, Nigel is being part of the 'other 50 per cent', although it's doubtful whether he views letting a reporter into his cottage in the hills outside Bath as balm to a darkened soul. Next month marks the first anniversary of his younger sister's death, by a single gun shot to the head, on her own London doorstep, and he knows that there is an appetite in the media for information. The beast must be fed. Into his living room the reporter must come.</p> <p>He has given statements before; carefully chosen words of regret and tribute, reactions to developments in the investigation, polite - always polite - 'No comment' where necessary. But he has never before sat down and given an answer to that question which he, like every other journalist, including his late sister, has forever had on their lips, the one which goes: how does it feel?</p> <p>He is not even sure he is minded to answer it now. It is not how the Dandos do things. Like his sister, he does not go in for overblown emotions or grand gestures. There is, for example, only one photograph of Jill Dando in the tidy, floral living room, a simple family shot, tucked away on a windowsill overlooking the garden.</p> <p>'It's a case of not having much to say,' he says. 'The police are doing their job. We're missing Jill but we're getting on with it.' He sits in a chair side on to me, staring away at the unset fireplace, mug of coffee in hand, still. Just before Christmas, he received a number of requests for interviews. 'I knew what they wanted,' he says. 'Our first Christmas without Jill. I understood it. But I thought it would be mawkish.' All requests were refused. 'We accept Jill's gone,' he says. 'We are just trying to get on with life as best we can.'</p> <p>Seated here, at the heart of the story, it appears there is not one Jill Dando murder, but two. The first is the murder of Jill Dando as national event, the stuff of newspaper headlines and comment pieces on the cult of TV personality and appeals for information by the police. Last week, that Jill Dando murder was all but turned into an institution, with the launch of a charity appeal to raise funds for a faculty of crime science at University College London in her name.</p> <p>Then there is the other Jill Dando murder, the one that is about personal and very private loss, for her widower father Jack and her fianc\u00e9, the gynaecologist Alan Farthing, and her close friends. Nigel is unique among this tight knot of friends and family in crossing over between the two. He understands fully that his own bereavement is also a national story with a particular dynamic.</p> <p>It has been like that from the start. He was first told something had happened to Jill by a friend in Bristol, an area reporter for the Daily Mail, but he assumed it wasn't anything particularly important. Then he received a second call from the same source. 'He said it was quite serious. I rang her home but got the answerphone. I rang her mobile but that was just diverted back to her answerphone. I also couldn't get hold of Alan.'</p> <p>He was standing in the newsroom at the Bristol Evening Post at the time. 'Sky News was on the television, as it always is, and they just said Jill Dando has been shot dead on her doorstep. Even though it was a shock, I saw in a flash what size of a story it would be. I knew I was going to be besieged.' He was driven by a friend to his home town of Weston-super-Mare to check his father was all right and then he drafted a statement. 'You stand on the doorstep and you say the things you want to say and then you ask to be given space. You're not looking inward, you're looking outward.'</p> <p>The remarkable thing, he says, is that the journalists abided by his request. They did keep their distance and they continue to do so. It is as if, a year on, there is now some cordon sanitaire self-imposed by journalists around Jill Dando's family. 'I've had calls for comments at the office which I've refused and the journalists have said fine and gone away and I've thought to myself, well, if it had been me making the call I'd have tried a little harder than that.'</p> <p>Still, he says, this curious reluctance serves him well. Up to now, he has only been willing to talk if Detective Inspector Hamish Campbell, who is leading the investigation, has said it would prove helpful to the inquiry do so. 'I don't go out of my way to ring the police and fill up on the detail,' he says. 'There have been a number of leaks from the investigation and because I'm a journalist they could think I was responsible, if I knew everything that was going on. I don't want them to be in a position where they could put one and one together and make three.'</p> <p>He says he is not dismayed at the failure to catch anybody, even though most murders that are unsolved in the first two months stay that way. 'Deep down, my gut feeling is that it will be solved,' he says. 'At the moment, the police still haven't got a motive, which makes it difficult, but I've worked on murders that have been solved years after the event. The fact is the police have as many people working on it now as they did in the early days.'</p> <p>I ask him if he has any idea what happened. 'None at all. The scenario which has always made most sense to me was that, as she was so rarely at home, it had to be a professional hit. It seems very unlikely that someone would wait day after day.' Because she was, by then, spending more and more time at Alan Farthing's home, she could be away from her house in south-west London for up to two weeks at a time, particularly as she had exchanged contracts to sell it. She only returned to collect faxes. 'There had to be a degree of planning in it,' Nigel says. He thinks for a moment. Then he says: 'We just want to know what happened. You think, why would she have upset someone so much?' Upsetting people was not what Jill Dando did.</p> <p>Let's go back to the scene of the crime, the place where a life ended and this mystery began - the doorstep of number 29 Gowan Avenue, just off the Fulham Palace Road. The murder makes no more sense here than it does in Nigel Dando's living room. It is a quiet, prosperous street of large, flat-fronted villas, now changing hands for around \u00a3500,000 each. Most noticeably, there is no cover for a would-be assassin. The houses are almost terraces, their front doors only a few feet from the pavement. The road is relatively broad, giving good line of sight from quite a distance and there are very few trees to get in the way. It should have been easy for anybody loitering here for any length of time to be spotted.</p> <p>And there were sightings. Alan Taylor, a window cleaner working on a house opposite, saw a man walking up and down outside Jill Dando's house half an hour before she was shot. Taylor described him as clean-shaven and dark suited, with fair hair. A cleaner going between jobs saw a similar looking man at the end of the street. At 11.35 Richard Hughes at 31 Gowan Avenue heard a scream. He and another neighbour, Geoffrey Upfill-Brown, then saw a man going towards the Fulham Palace Road. The description was similar to that given by the others. By now, Jill Dando's 37 years of life were over, courtesy of a 9mm bullet, although it would be another hour and a half before she was certified dead at the nearby Charing Cross Hospital.</p> <p>From closed-circuit camera footage, mobile phone traces and till receipts, police know that, after leaving Alan Farthing's house in Chiswick at 10am, Jill went to Hammersmith to fill her BMW with petrol and buy some stationery before stopping off at a fishmongers to buy two Dover sole fillets. She also had a mobile phone conversation with Allasonne Lewis, her agent.</p> <p>After that, the rest uncertainty. There would be reports of sweaty men leaping into and out of nearby Bishop's Park, of blue Range Rovers, of a man boarding a bus, an interesting escape route for an assassin. In the weeks that followed, the press would report that it was definitely a three-man gang, or that no, actually, it was a loner; that the gun may have been ex-Argentine - or not; that there was a Crimewatch connection, or that it had something to do with a randy Russian Mafia boss whose advances she had spurned; or that, because she had made an appeal on behalf of Kosovan refugees, it was all a ghastly Serbian plot.</p> <p>What is most striking, however, from a reading of the mountain of newspaper coverage that greeted her killing, is that after about the first six weeks all of this stops. There are no more developments, no more theories, no more real suspects. All that changes is the size of the reward. By August, it had reached \u00a3250,000. With no arrest, let alone conviction, it is still available.</p> <p>It is the failure of that reward to be claimed which leads Det Insp Hamish Campbell to believe the murder was carried out by an individual acting alone. If there had been a gang involved, he says, news would have leaked out into the underworld and somebody would have come forward to claim the cash. It hasn't happened. He's a logical chap, is Hamish Campbell, his thinking as neat and tidy as his close cropped hair and his well pressed suit. 'Police officers tend to deal with crime and criminals,' he says. 'If it were an ordinary criminal event, we would have heard something. Nothing has come to us.' But this is only a theory, perhaps little more than a 'gut feeling', and arrests are rarely made on those.</p> <p>Around him, in his office overlooking the Earl's Court Road in London's Kensington, he has what he hopes are the tools to find it: time sheets detailing every moment of Jill's life throughout April 1999 and before. He has maps of the area and aerial photographs. He has diagrams showing how everybody in her life fitted together. He says he is confident that this one will be solved. Forget that a year has passed. There are still 40 officers working on it. The solution is out there.</p> <p>'You must go to the crime scene and work from what you find,' he says. 'You can only bring a hypothesis from the evidence. We receive letter after letter with theories: that she presented a TV programme badly and a TV producer wanted to get her for it, or it was something to do with this Crimewatch or that Crimewatch. But there's no evidence. It's all fanciful.' Still, every letter is read and indexed.</p> <p>As well as the letter writers, there are the newspapers who come up with their own theories. Prime among them last May was a two-day 'special investigation' by John Stalker, formerly of the Manchester police. He eventually concluded that it was, on a balance of probabilities, carried out by a Serbian gang. Stalker still holds to that view. 'This was an assassination,' he says now. 'I've never been very keen on the thwarted lover or obsessive fan theory. No, it seemed to me that it had to be some London-based Serbian dissident group. A single bullet. Very rare that.'</p> <p>Campbell is dismissive. Stalker, he says, 'never spoke to us, he never saw Miss Dando's body, has never seen the firearm or spoken to the witnesses. He concluded it was the Serbians because they were at the front of people's minds then. It's exactly the same after the Brixton and Brick Lane nail bombs. They, too, were said to be a Serbian plot.' As he says, they turned out to be the work of a weird loner who had rustled something up in his front room. 'Stalker published his piece 21 days after the murder. We hadn't even assimilated all the evidence by then.'</p> <p>Instead, he takes me through their work. They have 23 different witnesses seeing 23 different people on the day. Some of them may be the same person, so that should bring it down to around a dozen people that they are interested in. They would like anybody who was in the street on the day at the time to come forward even if they think they have nothing to say.</p> <p>They have also isolated seven possible explanations as to how the killer came to be in Gowan Avenue. He lists them. One, that it was pure chance that someone with a gun and a grudge against Jill Dando happened to be in the street the day she arrived home. Two, that a similar person spotted her by chance in Hammersmith and followed her home. Three, that she was followed from Chiswick. Four, that she told someone she was going to be there. Five, that they in turn told someone else. Six, that it was someone who lives on the street. And seven, after observation and analysis, the killer decided that by just waiting there he would eventually get her.</p> <p>'So let's remove the least likely options,' Campbell says, 'which is that someone happened to be there by chance, or that someone spotted her in Hammersmith by chance. As to her being followed from Chiswick, we have almost the whole montage of her journey from Chiswick through CCTV cameras. There's no evidence of her being followed. We have also talked to everybody in the street.' Which leaves just three explanations. And so the investigation narrows.</p> <p>But, Campbell admits, without a motive, that narrowed investigation is still very broad. 'How is it that we can look at someone's life in such detail and not come up with a motive?' he asks, looking at the time sheets and CCTV pictures, pinned to his wall, the familiar image of Jill, bag slung over her shoulder staring back at him. It is the question that has troubled him for a year. 'There is not a single piece of evidence that explains why Jill Dando was killed.' For a while the media spotlight moved to her ex-boyfriends both from her time at the BBC and before. As with everything else in the investigation even this intense scrutiny of the more hidden parts of her private life yielded nothing.</p> <p>He seems more bemused by this than the overall failure so far to catch her killer. There is no talk yet of downgrading the investigation. The 40 officers remain in place, ring-fenced from other duties and as long as there are still leads to follow, which he says there are, they will stay there. But it is the Jill Dando conundrum to which he keeps returning. 'I've read her diaries and her letters, seen her mementoes. I know what she did in minute detail.' He shakes his head. 'People say there must be something in her life that explains it, but there's nothing which suggests a catalyst for her killing.'</p> <p>Extraordinary events turn acquaintances into friends. In the year since her death, the loose association of people pictured in the spindly diagram pinned up beside Hamish Campbell's desk has become a tight network. Last Wednesday, that network, which includes Sir Cliff Richard, the Countess of Wessex and Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, turned out at Claridge's hotel in London to launch the Not For Nothing appeal, a campaign to raise \u00a35 million to fund a new academic faculty in Jill Dando's name for research into crime prevention.</p> <p>It was testament to the strength of the group and their common purpose that, despite various parts of the BBC being inside the loop, not a word of what was going to happen leaked out to journalists in advance.</p> <p>But more remarkable still was the performance by Alan Farthing, who is to chair the board of trustees. He has been portrayed by BBC press officers as exceptionally wary of the media and fiercely protective of his own privacy. But here, before a packed press conference, he was poised and confident. 'She was loyal, she was honest and she was true,' he said of his fianc\u00e9e in a clear steady voice. And then, confirming what Hamish Campbell has taken a year to discover, he said: 'Nobody has ever been able to find a secret side to Jill.'</p> <p>If he was dreading the moment when the floor was opened up for questions, he needn't have worried. Nobody wanted to ask him anything. At all. 'I was a little bit surprised,' he said later, sitting in the offices of Abel Hadden, a PR man who is handling the charity's launch. 'Perhaps we didn't leave that much scope for questions.' But he knows it's more than that. Alan has become the official holder of Jill's memory and, as far as journalists are concerned, that puts him off-limits. Only once did a hack overstep the mark - and he can recall it in detail - berating him through his own entryphone.</p> <p>He has only agreed to talk now because it will provide publicity for the charity appeal, even though he hates every moment of it. 'I appreciate my privacy,' he says. 'In our relationship, I was always trying not to be projected. In my bereavement, I would like to remain private.' So why do it? We are sitting in an open-plan office. He drops his voice.</p> <p>'In the first few months, I was easily recognised. Then I went through a stage of people recognising me but not being sure why. Then recently, people seemed to stop recognising me altogether. That was an encouragement to get involved because it showed me I could go back to normality.'</p> <p>And normality is both what he wants and what he feels he deserves. 'Look, I am potentially a public figure simply because I shared a love with someone who was herself a public figure. I'm under no delusions that this is my claim to fame. So I have to use myself as effectively as I can.' He points at a picture of himself with the Countess of Wessex on the front of that day's London Evening Standard taken at the launch. 'If allowing that picture to appear on the front page of the paper helps, then so be it.' Even if it makes you cringe? He nods. 'Yes, and it does make me cringe. It's surreal.'</p> <p>Outside his medical duties, the charity, a plan hatched between himself and Nick Ross last Christmas, now occupies all his time. He is involved in every detail - finding premises, obtaining desks and chairs, getting corporate sponsors, even buying an answerphone, so far the only expense. 'The time I commit to the fund is the time others commit to their families,' he says. So is it a displacement activity? His voice drops a couple more notches. 'It's a way of working through the loss, yes. And I don't deny that achieving something positive will help me. Being busy and not having time to reflect is a coping mechanism\u0085' He pauses. '\u0085 many people would argue.'</p> <p>The appeal is a limited affair. Once enough money has been raised, it will close and Alan will try to rediscover the normality he craves. But he knows it will not be the end of public interest. 'We are yet to have an arrest, a charging of somebody and a trial,' he says, displaying the same conviction as others involved that those things will still happen. 'Each one of those will be a huge event.' Each one will place demands upon him.</p> <p>He asks that we not discuss the case. Today is meant to be about the appeal. Nevertheless, he does offer one thought. 'It's unique,' he says. 'Bizarre, unprecedented. Never before in this country has a famous female TV presenter been shot dead on her doorstep.' It seems a slightly obvious comment but, as the first anniversary approaches, this may be the only real way to make any sense of the unsolved murder of Jill Dando.</p> <p>She was a journalist who read the news and presented holiday programmes. She had a relaxed style which was, depending on your point of view, either easy-going or bland but never in-your-face. People felt they knew her. Then somebody shot her dead on her own doorstep. As her fianc\u00e9 says, it's bizarre. It teaches us nothing. It's a tragic curio. And as time passes, and explanations defy discovery, it becomes only more so.</p> <p>\u0095 Donations to the Jill Dando Fund can be made by phone to 0800 015 0125, by post to the Jill Dando Fund, Lloyds TSB, 50 Notting Hill Gate, London W11 3JD or at <a href=\"http://www.jilldandofund.com\" target_new>jilldandofund.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "As chief reporter for the Bristol Evening Post, Nigel Dando has knocked on the doors of too many people whose loved ones have been murdered. 'It's the job you most dread,' he says. 'Fifty per cent will say I don't want to talk about it. Go away. The other 50 per cent will invite you in. For them, it's a therapeutic thing, I suppose, a way of expressing their grief.' Today, Nigel is being part of the 'other 50 per cent', although it's doubtful whether he views letting a reporter into his cottage in the hills outside Bath as balm to a darkened soul. Next month marks the first anniversary of his younger sister's death, by a single gun shot to the head, on her own London doorstep, and he knows that there is an appetite in the media for information. The beast must be fed. Into his living room the reporter must come. He has given statements before; carefully chosen words of regret and tribute, reactions to developments in the investigation, polite - always polite - 'No comment' where necessary. But he has never before sat down and given an answer to that question which he, like every other journalist, including his late sister, has forever had on their lips, the one which goes: how does it feel? He is not even sure he is minded to answer it now. It is not how the Dandos do things. Like his sister, he does not go in for overblown emotions or grand gestures. There is, for example, only one photograph of Jill Dando in the tidy, floral living room, a simple family shot, tucked away on a windowsill overlooking the garden. 'It's a case of not having much to say,' he says. 'The police are doing their job. We're missing Jill but we're getting on with it.' He sits in a chair side on to me, staring away at the unset fireplace, mug of coffee in hand, still. Just before Christmas, he received a number of requests for interviews. 'I knew what they wanted,' he says. 'Our first Christmas without Jill. I understood it. But I thought it would be mawkish.' All requests were refused. 'We accept Jill's gone,' he says. 'We are just trying to get on with life as best we can.' Seated here, at the heart of the story, it appears there is not one Jill Dando murder, but two. The first is the murder of Jill Dando as national event, the stuff of newspaper headlines and comment pieces on the cult of TV personality and appeals for information by the police. Last week, that Jill Dando murder was all but turned into an institution, with the launch of a charity appeal to raise funds for a faculty of crime science at University College London in her name. Then there is the other Jill Dando murder, the one that is about personal and very private loss, for her widower father Jack and her fianc\u00e9, the gynaecologist Alan Farthing, and her close friends. Nigel is unique among this tight knot of friends and family in crossing over between the two. He understands fully that his own bereavement is also a national story with a particular dynamic. It has been like that from the start. He was first told something had happened to Jill by a friend in Bristol, an area reporter for the Daily Mail, but he assumed it wasn't anything particularly important. Then he received a second call from the same source. 'He said it was quite serious. I rang her home but got the answerphone. I rang her mobile but that was just diverted back to her answerphone. I also couldn't get hold of Alan.' He was standing in the newsroom at the Bristol Evening Post at the time. 'Sky News was on the television, as it always is, and they just said Jill Dando has been shot dead on her doorstep. Even though it was a shock, I saw in a flash what size of a story it would be. I knew I was going to be besieged.' He was driven by a friend to his home town of Weston-super-Mare to check his father was all right and then he drafted a statement. 'You stand on the doorstep and you say the things you want to say and then you ask to be given space. You're not looking inward, you're looking outward.' The remarkable thing, he says, is that the journalists abided by his request. They did keep their distance and they continue to do so. It is as if, a year on, there is now some cordon sanitaire self-imposed by journalists around Jill Dando's family. 'I've had calls for comments at the office which I've refused and the journalists have said fine and gone away and I've thought to myself, well, if it had been me making the call I'd have tried a little harder than that.' Still, he says, this curious reluctance serves him well. Up to now, he has only been willing to talk if Detective Inspector Hamish Campbell, who is leading the investigation, has said it would prove helpful to the inquiry do so. 'I don't go out of my way to ring the police and fill up on the detail,' he says. 'There have been a number of leaks from the investigation and because I'm a journalist they could think I was responsible, if I knew everything that was going on. I don't want them to be in a position where they could put one and one together and make three.'

What is most striking, however, from a reading of the mountain of newspaper coverage that greeted her killing, is that after about the first six weeks all of this stops. There are no more developments, no more theories, no more real suspects. All that changes is the size of the reward. By August, it had reached \u00a3250,000. With no arrest, let alone conviction, it is still available. It is the failure of that reward to be claimed which leads Det Insp Hamish Campbell to believe the murder was carried out by an individual acting alone.

'If it were an ordinary criminal event, we would have heard something. Nothing has come to us.' But this is only a theory, perhaps little more than a 'gut feeling', and arrests are rarely made on those. Around him, in his office overlooking the Earl's Court Road in London's Kensington, he has what he hopes are the tools to find it: time sheets detailing every moment of Jill's life throughout April 1999 and before. He has maps of the area and aerial photographs. He has diagrams showing how everybody in her life fitted together. He says he is confident that this one will be solved. Forget that a year has passed.

Some of them may be the same person, so that should bring it down to around a dozen people that they are interested in. They would like anybody who was in the street on the day at the time to come forward even if they think they have nothing to say. They have also isolated seven possible explanations as to how the killer came to be in Gowan Avenue. He lists them. One, that it was pure chance that someone with a gun and a grudge against Jill Dando happened to be in the street the day she arrived home.

'People say there must be something in her life that explains it, but there's nothing which suggests a catalyst for her killing.' Extraordinary events turn acquaintances into friends. In the year since her death, the loose association of people pictured in the spindly diagram pinned up beside Hamish Campbell's desk has become a tight network. Last Wednesday, that network, which includes Sir Cliff Richard, the Countess of Wessex and Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, turned out at Claridge's hotel in London to launch the Not For Nothing appeal, a campaign to raise \u00a35 million to fund a new academic faculty in Jill Dando's name for research into crime prevention. It was testament to the strength of the group and their common purpose that, despite various parts of the BBC being inside the loop, not a word of what was going to happen leaked out to journalists in advance. But more remarkable still was the performance by Alan Farthing, who is to chair the board of trustees. He has been portrayed by BBC press officers as exceptionally wary of the media and fiercely protective of his own privacy. But here, before a packed press conference, he was poised and confident. 'She was loyal, she was honest and she was true,' he said of his fianc\u00e9e in a clear steady voice. And then, confirming what Hamish Campbell has taken a year to discover, he said: 'Nobody has ever been able to find a secret side to Jill.' If he was dreading the moment when the floor was opened up for questions, he needn't have worried. Nobody wanted to ask him anything. At all. 'I was a little bit surprised,' he said later, sitting in the offices of Abel Hadden, a PR man who is handling the charity's launch. 'Perhaps we didn't leave that much scope for questions.' But he knows it's more than that. Alan has become the official holder of Jill's memory and, as far as journalists are concerned, that puts him off-limits. Only once did a hack overstep the mark - and he can recall it in detail - berating him through his own entryphone. He has only agreed to talk now because it will provide publicity for the charity appeal, even though he hates every moment of it. 'I appreciate my privacy,' he says. 'In our relationship, I was always trying not to be projected. In my bereavement, I would like to remain private.' So why do it? We are sitting in an open-plan office. He drops his voice. 'In the first few months, I was easily recognised. Then I went through a stage of people recognising me but not being sure why. Then recently, people seemed to stop recognising me altogether. That was an encouragement to get involved because it showed me I could go back to normality.' And normality is both what he wants and what he feels he deserves. 'Look, I am potentially a public figure simply because I shared a love with someone who was herself a public figure. I'm under no delusions that this is my claim to fame. So I have to use myself as effectively as I can.' He points at a picture of himself with the Countess of Wessex on the front of that day's London Evening Standard taken at the launch. 'If allowing that picture to appear on the front page of the paper helps, then so be it.' Even if it makes you cringe? He nods. 'Yes, and it does make me cringe. It's surreal.' Outside his medical duties, the charity, a plan hatched between himself and Nick Ross last Christmas, now occupies all his time. He is involved in every detail - finding premises, obtaining desks and chairs, getting corporate sponsors, even buying an answerphone, so far the only expense. 'The time I commit to the fund is the time others commit to their families,' he says. So is it a displacement activity? His voice drops a couple more notches. 'It's a way of working through the loss, yes. And I don't deny that achieving something positive will help me. Being busy and not having time to reflect is a coping mechanism\u0085' He pauses. '\u0085 many people would argue.' The appeal is a limited affair. Once enough money has been raised, it will close and Alan will try to rediscover the normality he craves. But he knows it will not be the end of public interest. 'We are yet to have an arrest, a charging of somebody and a trial,' he says, displaying the same conviction as others involved that those things will still happen. 'Each one of those will be a huge event.' Each one will place demands upon him. He asks that we not discuss the case. Today is meant to be about the appeal. Nevertheless, he does offer one thought. 'It's unique,' he says. 'Bizarre, unprecedented. Never before in this country has a famous female TV presenter been shot dead on her doorstep.' It seems a slightly obvious comment but, as the first anniversary approaches, this may be the only real way to make any sense of the unsolved murder of Jill Dando. She was a journalist who read the news and presented holiday programmes. She had a relaxed style which was, depending on your point of view, either easy-going or bland but never in-your-face. People felt they knew her. Then somebody shot her dead on her own doorstep. As her fianc\u00e9 says, it's bizarre. It teaches us nothing. It's a tragic curio. And as time passes, and explanations defy discovery, it becomes only more so. \u0095 Donations to the Jill Dando Fund can be made by phone to 0800 015 0125, by post to the Jill Dando Fund, Lloyds TSB, 50 Notting Hill Gate, London W11 3JD or at jilldandofund.com",

      "body": "<p>'I'm afraid Ms X is not convincing in the starring role. She is clearly past her sell-by date.' I'm quoting from a recent film review. I remember it, I suppose, because the actress in question is 47, the same age as me. I was dismayed by this summary judgment, but not surprised. After all, everyone talks like that. Here is what a female friend said to me recently, when we were discussing an unhappily married mutual acquaintance: 'You do realise that Y is getting dangerously close to her sell-by date. If she's wants another crack at marriage, she'd better get out of this one very soon.'</p> <p>A cruel thought, perhaps, but an accurate reflection of current views about the sexual marketplace. When it comes down to it, most of us do believe that men have a longer shelf life than women do. Thus, a female film star is past her sell-by date from the moment she develops her first smile line. But her male counterpart can be fat, 50, bald, reeking of whisky and still be a stud. No one gasps if the girl he ends up with is young enough to be his daughter. If it's the other way around, it's just as shocking as it was 30-odd years ago, when Mrs Robinson seduced her first graduate.</p> <p>This, presumably, is why we're seeing a West End revival of the play that made her infamous. But how very tame her story is, when I compare it to the things I hear from her real-life, modern-day successors. And although I do not have the figures to prove it, it does seem to be that there are more Mrs Robinsons about these days than there used to be. Either that or I have an unusually exciting assortment of friends, relatives, and acquaintances.</p> <p>And as for their friends, all I can say is that they're having a lot more fun than I am. No two of their outrageous histories are alike, but there are some common threads. Most are divorced, most have full working lives, and most entered singledom when they too thought they were past their sell-by dates. They went into their new lives expecting solitude. Imagine their surprise when their phones started ringing off the hook.</p> <p>The phones were still ringing when I went to interview a woman we'll call Sandra. Sandra is in the music business: she assured me that most of the 28 calls she had to take during my brief visit were 'strictly business'. But I gathered from her clipped remarks that not all the men at the end of the line wanted it to stay that way. When I told her so, she nodded grimly. 'Now, I just deal with it,' she said, 'But in the beginning - this was after two marriages with total shits - it really threw me. I felt like asking, are you sure you don't have the wrong number? I mean why me? Why not some pneumatic bimbo? But then I said to myself, hey, I guess I still have what it takes.'</p> <p>Sandra describes herself as 'OK-looking and reasonably fit'. She never hides the fact that she is in her late forties, and she does not dress young. 'But yes, most of the people I have to work with are very young, so I do have to think twice about what I'm going to wear.' For my visit, she had dressed herself to look like a very expensive leopard - while her lover, a very handsome Israeli student, was wearing hardly anything at all. But his manners were perfect. 'He's nice, isn't he?' she said after he had left. 'And he's such a good dancer.' When I asked how long she thought it would last, she said: 'I'm not interested in long-term relationships anymore. At this stage of my life I'm not going to adjust for anyone.'</p> <p>She didn't think her two school-aged children should have to adjust for anyone, either. 'And then there's the age issue. When you make a serious commitment to a much younger man, what you're really doing is taking on another child.'</p> <p>This was something all the new Mrs Robinsons agreed on. While younger men were definitely more fun in the short term, in the long term they were hard work. As a woman named Cheryl put it: 'They all want the same four things: boobs, blow jobs, a captive audience so that they can talk about themselves ad nauseam, and pudding with custard. By which I mean, they like me because I can cook just like their mums.'</p> <p>When I said that made a very poor advertisement for the Mrs Robinson lifestyle, a friend of Cheryl's named Becky insisted that it wasn't so bad if your real children had already grown up and left home. She was sure she was more indulgent with her 30-year-old lover than she had been with her children's fathers, but 'he's a struggling musician and so confidence is a problem for him, but because I don't feel competitive with him, it costs me nothing to build him up.'</p> <p>She also liked introducing him to 'new things'. Hence their recent trip to Cuba. 'He couldn't believe his eyes!' They'd been able to hook up with some other musicians and do a gig. She brought out the photos, many of which showed Becky centre stage in a filmy black minidress. Then there were a few of the boyfriend wearing a pair of tight swimming trunks. In one picture, he was cut off at the neck. 'They didn't want to make a print of that one,' Becky told me. 'When I asked them why, they said it was because he didn't have a head. So I said, \"don't you see that was the whole point?\" '</p> <p>She conceded that she would never have wanted a relationship like this when she was younger. It was just as well, she thought, that she no longer wanted 'the traditional contract' because 'I don't think many men my age would be willing to meet me halfway.' But a television producer named Amelia thought that women like Becky were too quick to talk herself down. 'It's the fact that you don't need them that makes you interesting. If you are of an age when they think you should be sitting at home darning socks, and you're going out to interesting places, meeting interesting people, and having a lot of fun, they just can't bear it, and then before they know it, they can't stop thinking about you.'</p> <p>To prove her point, she let me listen to her voicemail - eight of her messages were from one man she had met and turned down at a party the previous week. Then she took me up to see her e-mails. Three of her new messages were from married men who had logged on in the middle of the night to record their fantasies for her. ('Do they count as younger men? They're all in their thirties.') The fourth, fifth, and sixth messages were from her ex-husband. ('I keep telling him to stop bothering me, and he keeps writing back to tell me what a sexy e-mail I can do when I'm angry.') Her seventh message was from an admirer at work. It was an invitation to 'lunch some time'. It ended like this: 'I hope you don't mind my telling you that I would be a very happy man if I could persuade you to wear your Barbarella suit.'</p> <p>'Now I ask you! Imagine going out in a thing like that before seven in the evening! You'd think I had nothing to do but file my nails! So no, as you see, my life is not perfect. But it's not for want of offers.

'But I think I have a right to fun and intelligent human company because otherwise what is the point of living?

The saddest thing about the Mrs Robinson myth is that it convinces so many women that they have to put up with dull men in bad marriages because it's the best they can expect. And it convinces so many men that they don't have to try very hard in their marriages once their poor wives are past their sell-by date.' She hopes that a few of them will want to start pulling their socks up after they have read this article.</p> <p>\u0095 The Graduate, starring Kathleen Turner and Matthew Rhys, opens at the Gielgud Theatre on 5 April.

Impress on him, even if it goes against what you feel, that you are not scared by his use of cannabis, perhaps that you knew anyway. This reaction will surprise him. He will not have been the devil he thought he was, so you will have undermined his reason for making a big deal of smoking it. Talk to a teacher he likes; he will have dealt with this before. It's not your fault. You're not alone. Neither is your son. L.R. of London You have to impress upon your son the risks of the situation. With hindsight, my son was probably taking cannabis when he was 15. At 19, he is about to be charged with use and intent to supply and is in financial trouble as well. I wish I'd known earlier and talked to him. You would be acting illegally if you let your son smoke in your home and lay yourself open to a search - not a pleasant experience. Please seek support from your local drugs advisory service. J.A. of London Next week's dilemma is from T.F. of London I've been friends with P since university. We've always been close, to the extent that he came on my hen night. He accepted the invitation to the wedding but didn't turn up. I hear that he was sent abroad on business at short notice, but he has never contacted me to explain this. It's a year since I got married. Now I see P at the supermarket or gym and, since I feel distressed and angry, I hide from him. If our friendship meant so little to him, I certainly don't want to resurrect it, but I don't want these incidents to get in the way of my life. What should I do? Write to Observer Review or email margaret.cook@observer.co.uk. Views on next week's dilemma to reach us by Wednesday",

Kids can now join Stuart Little clubs on the net, as well as watch free promotional clips of the hit movie. <p><b> So it's a cartoon?</b> No, no, no.

Geeks see him as the Mickey Mouse of the wired age. </p> <p><b> What's the plot?</b> Stuart (voiced by Michael J Fox) goes to live in New York with a human family called the Littles. Mum Little (Geena Davis), and Dad Little (Hugh Laurie), invite him back to their home after discovering him in an orphanage. Their son, George, quickly bonds with Stuart, but the family's white Persian cat, Snowbell, is appalled to be sharing her home with a rodent.

Need I go on?</p> <p>For me, the ultimate practitioner of perfect LBD chic was the late Jean Muir. With just a few metres of black silk jersey, Miss Muir could conjure up a dress which was a masterclass in elegance and refinement. Every six months, at her fashion show, she could be relied upon to offer a new version of this fashion classic - a fluted hem here, a scooped neckline there - which would take my breath away. Each time I would sit and watch with wonder. How could she cut a dress of such complexity and make it look so simple? In the early 80s, having become what can best be described as 'style soul mates' (we certainly made a curious pair: Miss Muir was a sober vision in navy blue, while I dressed in ripped blue denim), I was lucky enough to be invited to rifle through her archives. That afternoon, for a few hours, I was in fashion heaven.</p> <p>There can be few women who do not look like a film star when they don the right LBD. Last Christmas my mother, wearing a gorgeous stretch-velvet LBD (well, not so L, actually - Mother is not exactly what you'd call a small woman), looked as classy as Simone Signoret or Liz Taylor with nothing more than a trifling diamond brooch clasped to her ample bosom. This is perhaps why some women still favour a sliver of jet crepe or swathe of caviar chiffon when all around them fashion pundits are pushing the virtues of shocking pink or the drama of scarlet - it needs little or no dressing up. In an LBD, a woman is dressed up. Indeed, the perfect LBD has sophistication sewn into its very seams.</p> <p>If I was ever asked to list my Desert Island LBDs, it wouldn't be easy. I would have to include the satin number worn by Amanda Lear on the cover of Roxy Music's second album (designed by Antony Price), Yves Saint Laurent's jet beaded shift created for Zizi Jeanmaire, one of John Galliano's bias-cut gowns, and, of course, anything by the divine Miss M.</p> <p>\u0095 Iain R Webb is fashion director of Elle</p>",

Need I go on? For me, the ultimate practitioner of perfect LBD chic was the late Jean Muir. With just a few metres of black silk jersey, Miss Muir could conjure up a dress which was a masterclass in elegance and refinement. Every six months, at her fashion show, she could be relied upon to offer a new version of this fashion classic - a fluted hem here, a scooped neckline there - which would take my breath away. Each time I would sit and watch with wonder. How could she cut a dress of such complexity and make it look so simple? In the early 80s, having become what can best be described as 'style soul mates' (we certainly made a curious pair: Miss Muir was a sober vision in navy blue, while I dressed in ripped blue denim), I was lucky enough to be invited to rifle through her archives. That afternoon, for a few hours, I was in fashion heaven. There can be few women who do not look like a film star when they don the right LBD. Last Christmas my mother, wearing a gorgeous stretch-velvet LBD (well, not so L, actually - Mother is not exactly what you'd call a small woman), looked as classy as Simone Signoret or Liz Taylor with nothing more than a trifling diamond brooch clasped to her ample bosom. This is perhaps why some women still favour a sliver of jet crepe or swathe of caviar chiffon when all around them fashion pundits are pushing the virtues of shocking pink or the drama of scarlet - it needs little or no dressing up. In an LBD, a woman is dressed up. Indeed, the perfect LBD has sophistication sewn into its very seams. If I was ever asked to list my Desert Island LBDs, it wouldn't be easy. I would have to include the satin number worn by Amanda Lear on the cover of Roxy Music's second album (designed by Antony Price), Yves Saint Laurent's jet beaded shift created for Zizi Jeanmaire, one of John Galliano's bias-cut gowns, and, of course, anything by the divine Miss M. \u0095 Iain R Webb is fashion director of Elle",

      "body": "<p>Henry Tate was born in 1819. By the age of 26, in Liverpool, he had built up a chain of grocery shops and begun a wholesale business. In 1862 he began refining sugar. He took up a previously unexploited patent on a process for producing dry, granulated sugar. This was a success, and he opened another refinery in east London, at Silvertown, where he introduced the Langen cube process, patented by Eugen Langen, of Cologne. Tate's sugar cubes quickly replaced the conical sugar loaf in English domestic life. Henry Tate moved his family to a large mansion on Streatham Common, and began to collect art.</p> <p>The industrial architecture of Silvertown has since been rediscovered by generations of art and architecture students. Bernd and Hilla Becher's photographs of similar structures elsewhere are now well-known; there are some in the Tate Gallery's collection. In retrospect, it seems not inappropriate that the national institution of both British and modern art should have its origin in something like sugar: an energy source; the commodity of a brutal, early capitalism; a crystal, a granular solid, and finally, a white cube, produced in astronomical quantities, which quickly disappears when placed in hot water.</p> <p>In 1700, the consumption of sugar in England was only 10,000 tons a year, but by 1800, the figure had increased to 150,000 tons - more than 16kg per year per person. In England, consumption of sugar grew at the same time as that of tea. Tea drinking grew as gin drinking declined. By the end of the 18th century, tea drinking had become a national habit among all classes, and the tea was sweetened with large quantities of sugar. Henry Tate's sugar-cube fortune, his art collecting and his philanthropy, can all be seen as a product of the national habit of drinking tea.</p> <p>When Tate began refining sugar, it was nearly 30 years since slavery had been abolished, but conditions on the plantations would not have improved much. One doesn't know what he thought about this, but Henry Tate was, by all accounts, a conscientious, somewhat shy man, who remembered the predicament of the people he grew up among in Liverpool, and devoted large sums to education, hospitals and libraries, in both Liverpool and London.</p> <p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Millbank, where Tate Britain now stands, was the southern edge of marshy land behind Vincent Square. It was first developed as the site of the enormous, hexagonal Millbank Penitentiary, which was built between 1812 and 1821. The first Vauxhall Bridge was built at the same time, in 1816. When new, Millbank was the largest prison in Europe, England's principal prison for both male and female convicts, and the holding depot from which convicts were shipped to Australia. The Penitentiary's site covered 10 hectares, and it had 1,550 cells, some underground - known as 'the dark' - that were used to punish indiscipline. The layout was based on Jeremy Bentham's panopticon, though the actual design can't have permitted much visual contact. The building was disease-ridden, notorious for chronic rheumatism, ague and neuralgia, and prone to subsidence. When offered to Tate as a site for his gallery, it had been disused since 1867, and was 'surrounded by decaying buildings, obsolete machinery, coarse grass and rank weeds, whilst at its back, behind a burial ground, sat two gasometers'. Its demolition yielded 10 million second-hand bricks.</p> <p>Behind Tate's gallery, the newly-created London County Council built its exemplary Millbank Estate, one of the first great Arts and Crafts public housing projects, now gradually falling into private hands. Walking past, on my way to the gallery, I noticed recently cleaned brickwork, entryphones, and black-and-gold heritage-style nameplates on the buildings: Turner, Rossetti, Ruskin, Millais and others, more or less familiar. Ruskin and Millais face each other on either side of Herrick Street, which might be thought ironic, since Millais and Effie Ruskin fell in love while the former was painting the latter's husband's portrait.</p> <p>The steps and entrance to the gallery were packed that day with primary school-children. It's a real freedom to walk into a building like this for a few minutes without having to buy a ticket. I looked at a few paintings: Captain Thomas Lee, without his trousers; in the next room, a Lowry Industrial Landscape, which the accompanying note informed me is imaginary, but incorporates a likeness of the Stockport Viaduct, which 'constantly haunted the artist' as it does me; Paul Nash's Totes Meer. Some of the children were sitting on the floor, drawing: De Chirico's The Uncertainty of the Poet; Max Ernst's Celebes - these pictures get into people's lives. When the Tate opens at Bankside, instead of the present 20 per cent, as much as 60 per cent of the collection will be displayed, and our collective imagination will begin to change.</p> <p>When the Tate Gallery was completed in 1897, it had cost \u00a3105,000. The purchasing power of this today, in terms of retail prices, would be just over \u00a36 million. The actual cost of a similar building now would be more like \u00a3100 million. Unlike almost everything else that advanced economies produce, buildings are much more expensive than they used to be.</p> <p>I walked along Millbank and detoured through Victoria Tower Gardens. The Buxton Drinking Fountain, dilapidated, commemorates the emancipation of slaves in 1834, and a copy of Rodin's The Burghers of Calais depicts the burghers' offer of self-sacrifice in exchange for an end to English siege. It has been suggested that differences between English and European cities at least partly result from the early disappearance here of a burgher culture which still survives in Europe. I have been trying to refer to this idea in a film for television, but the trouble with burgher culture is that, in the absence of the written word, it is difficult to distinguish from burger culture.</p> <p>Burgher culture builds art galleries and invests in public transport. Entering the tube station at Westminster, I was immediately overcome by the sensation of being abroad. In fact, the scale of investment doesn't so much suggest abroad, as being in another time. Because building is so much more expensive than it used to be, and equipment so much cheaper, cities did not develop as was imagined at the beginning of the twentieth century, and Fritz Lang's Metropolis, for example, remains fiction. The new Jubilee Line extension is like a throwback to that fantasy: on the escalator at Westminster, an elegant, elderly man, in brown hat and fine check overcoat, remarked to his friend: 'What was that film? ... Metropolis.'</p> <p>At Bankside, I was escorted into the building through a big steel folding door on the south side. This part of the building is still in use as an electricity switching station. The door led to what used to be the power station's turbine hall. The association of art with already-existing industrial spaces is now so well established that it's almost unremarkable that the building should have had a previous use. It's unlikely that a new-built gallery could have justified the construction of a space like that of Bankside's turbine hall. The idea of converting an existing building might initially have seemed a merely sensible strategy to avoid the unpleasantness that would accompany any attempt to build opposite St Paul's, but in fact, the power station is a real gift. As a reworking of an existing structure, the new gallery feels immediately at ease with a present-day conception of art.</p> <p>Bankside's industrial character was established long before the power station was built. As an inhabited place, it has a much longer history than Millbank. By the sixteenth century, it was established as a place of entertainment. When theatre was banned, in 1642, there were already various industries, including a vinegar works that by the mid-nineteenth century had become the biggest in the country. The Ordnance Survey map of 1873 shows an oilcake factory, a coconut fibre works, a sealskin works, a fur works, a glass works, a whitelead works, a gun factory, a sawmill, two engineering works, an iron foundry and innumerable warehouses in the network of streets and yards immediately around the power station site. Most of the site itself was occupied by the Phoenix Gas Works. This had begun, as the Bankside Gas Works, in 1815. The gas company eventually moved their operation to Beckton, near Tate's Silvertown refinery, and the Beckton Gas Works survives, in ruins, as another destination of the present-day architectural tourist.</p> <p>The first power station at Bankside began operating in 1891. In the Forties, there was strong opposition to its being rebuilt, not least because the site was designated for offices, light industry and, interestingly, buildings for cultural purposes. In the end, the government, short of generating capacity, dismissed the objections and the new power station was built, to run on oil instead of coal, and designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. Having won the competition to build Liverpool Cathedral at the age of 22, Scott's considerable output consisted mostly of churches, but included a number of commissions to dignify large and potentially problematic buildings in sensitive locations, including Battersea Power Station, Cambridge University Library, and the New Bodleian Library, Oxford.</p> <p>I'm tempted to explore the connection between libraries and power stations - both books and fossil fuels are derived from trees and other vegetation, and given time books crumble to something like ash (strangely, Scott never built a crematorium) - but as far as the two Tate galleries are concerned, the relevant connection is between sugar and electricity. Although the imagery of a power station is grandiose - Metropolis, again - the majority of electricity consumption is domestic. As Heidegger notes of power stations: 'Even so, these buildings are in the domain of our dwelling'. When power surges threaten the national grid, it is usually because too many people have, simultaneously, decided to make some tea.</p> <p>The power station at Bankside was built in two stages, between 1948 and 1952, and between 1959 and 1963. Power generation ceased in 1981. In modern terms, it was not a large power station. When the building is 100 years old, it will have been an art gallery for about twice as long as it was a working power station, as if the building's original purpose was merely a prelude to its present use.</p> <p>\u0095 Patrick Keiller is a film maker and writer.

Henry Tate's sugar-cube fortune, his art collecting and his philanthropy, can all be seen as a product of the national habit of drinking tea. When Tate began refining sugar, it was nearly 30 years since slavery had been abolished, but conditions on the plantations would not have improved much. One doesn't know what he thought about this, but Henry Tate was, by all accounts, a conscientious, somewhat shy man, who remembered the predicament of the people he grew up among in Liverpool, and devoted large sums to education, hospitals and libraries, in both Liverpool and London. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Millbank, where Tate Britain now stands, was the southern edge of marshy land behind Vincent Square. It was first developed as the site of the enormous, hexagonal Millbank Penitentiary, which was built between 1812 and 1821. The first Vauxhall Bridge was built at the same time, in 1816. When new, Millbank was the largest prison in Europe, England's principal prison for both male and female convicts, and the holding depot from which convicts were shipped to Australia. The Penitentiary's site covered 10 hectares, and it had 1,550 cells, some underground - known as 'the dark' - that were used to punish indiscipline. The layout was based on Jeremy Bentham's panopticon, though the actual design can't have permitted much visual contact. The building was disease-ridden, notorious for chronic rheumatism, ague and neuralgia, and prone to subsidence. When offered to Tate as a site for his gallery, it had been disused since 1867, and was 'surrounded by decaying buildings, obsolete machinery, coarse grass and rank weeds, whilst at its back, behind a burial ground, sat two gasometers'. Its demolition yielded 10 million second-hand bricks. Behind Tate's gallery, the newly-created London County Council built its exemplary Millbank Estate, one of the first great Arts and Crafts public housing projects, now gradually falling into private hands. Walking past, on my way to the gallery, I noticed recently cleaned brickwork, entryphones, and black-and-gold heritage-style nameplates on the buildings: Turner, Rossetti, Ruskin, Millais and others, more or less familiar. Ruskin and Millais face each other on either side of Herrick Street, which might be thought ironic, since Millais and Effie Ruskin fell in love while the former was painting the latter's husband's portrait. The steps and entrance to the gallery were packed that day with primary school-children. It's a real freedom to walk into a building like this for a few minutes without having to buy a ticket. I looked at a few paintings: Captain Thomas Lee, without his trousers; in the next room, a Lowry Industrial Landscape, which the accompanying note informed me is imaginary, but incorporates a likeness of the Stockport Viaduct, which 'constantly haunted the artist' as it does me; Paul Nash's Totes Meer. Some of the children were sitting on the floor, drawing: De Chirico's The Uncertainty of the Poet; Max Ernst's Celebes - these pictures get into people's lives. When the Tate opens at Bankside, instead of the present 20 per cent, as much as 60 per cent of the collection will be displayed, and our collective imagination will begin to change. When the Tate Gallery was completed in 1897, it had cost \u00a3105,000. The purchasing power of this today, in terms of retail prices, would be just over \u00a36 million. The actual cost of a similar building now would be more like \u00a3100 million. Unlike almost everything else that advanced economies produce, buildings are much more expensive than they used to be. I walked along Millbank and detoured through Victoria Tower Gardens. The Buxton Drinking Fountain, dilapidated, commemorates the emancipation of slaves in 1834, and a copy of Rodin's The Burghers of Calais depicts the burghers' offer of self-sacrifice in exchange for an end to English siege. It has been suggested that differences between English and European cities at least partly result from the early disappearance here of a burgher culture which still survives in Europe. I have been trying to refer to this idea in a film for television, but the trouble with burgher culture is that, in the absence of the written word, it is difficult to distinguish from burger culture. Burgher culture builds art galleries and invests in public transport. Entering the tube station at Westminster, I was immediately overcome by the sensation of being abroad. In fact, the scale of investment doesn't so much suggest abroad, as being in another time. Because building is so much more expensive than it used to be, and equipment so much cheaper, cities did not develop as was imagined at the beginning of the twentieth century, and Fritz Lang's Metropolis, for example, remains fiction. The new Jubilee Line extension is like a throwback to that fantasy: on the escalator at Westminster, an elegant, elderly man, in brown hat and fine check overcoat, remarked to his friend: 'What was that film? ... Metropolis.' At Bankside, I was escorted into the building through a big steel folding door on the south side. This part of the building is still in use as an electricity switching station. The door led to what used to be the power station's turbine hall. The association of art with already-existing industrial spaces is now so well established that it's almost unremarkable that the building should have had a previous use. It's unlikely that a new-built gallery could have justified the construction of a space like that of Bankside's turbine hall. The idea of converting an existing building might initially have seemed a merely sensible strategy to avoid the unpleasantness that would accompany any attempt to build opposite St Paul's, but in fact, the power station is a real gift. As a reworking of an existing structure, the new gallery feels immediately at ease with a present-day conception of art. Bankside's industrial character was established long before the power station was built. As an inhabited place, it has a much longer history than Millbank. By the sixteenth century, it was established as a place of entertainment. When theatre was banned, in 1642, there were already various industries, including a vinegar works that by the mid-nineteenth century had become the biggest in the country. The Ordnance Survey map of 1873 shows an oilcake factory, a coconut fibre works, a sealskin works, a fur works, a glass works, a whitelead works, a gun factory, a sawmill, two engineering works, an iron foundry and innumerable warehouses in the network of streets and yards immediately around the power station site. Most of the site itself was occupied by the Phoenix Gas Works. This had begun, as the Bankside Gas Works, in 1815. The gas company eventually moved their operation to Beckton, near Tate's Silvertown refinery, and the Beckton Gas Works survives, in ruins, as another destination of the present-day architectural tourist. The first power station at Bankside began operating in 1891. In the Forties, there was strong opposition to its being rebuilt, not least because the site was designated for offices, light industry and, interestingly, buildings for cultural purposes. In the end, the government, short of generating capacity, dismissed the objections and the new power station was built, to run on oil instead of coal, and designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. Having won the competition to build Liverpool Cathedral at the age of 22, Scott's considerable output consisted mostly of churches, but included a number of commissions to dignify large and potentially problematic buildings in sensitive locations, including Battersea Power Station, Cambridge University Library, and the New Bodleian Library, Oxford. I'm tempted to explore the connection between libraries and power stations - both books and fossil fuels are derived from trees and other vegetation, and given time books crumble to something like ash (strangely, Scott never built a crematorium) - but as far as the two Tate galleries are concerned, the relevant connection is between sugar and electricity. Although the imagery of a power station is grandiose - Metropolis, again - the majority of electricity consumption is domestic. As Heidegger notes of power stations: 'Even so, these buildings are in the domain of our dwelling'. When power surges threaten the national grid, it is usually because too many people have, simultaneously, decided to make some tea. The power station at Bankside was built in two stages, between 1948 and 1952, and between 1959 and 1963. Power generation ceased in 1981. In modern terms, it was not a large power station. When the building is 100 years old, it will have been an art gallery for about twice as long as it was a working power station, as if the building's original purpose was merely a prelude to its present use. \u0095 Patrick Keiller is a film maker and writer.

      "body": "<p>In Britian art used to be something that happened to other people. You could go to art school, says the artist and teacher Michael Craig-Martin, but the idea of becoming a professional artist was absurd. It took the great pop artist Richard Hamilton years of teaching before he could contemplate a full-time career making his own art. Because of this, art colleges were intense, hothouse places, with brilliant, over-qualified teachers, and pupils who left with a comprehensive avant-garde education and had to find a use for it in a deeply conservative society.</p> <p>'I came to Britain in the 60s,' remembers the Irish-born, American-educated Craig-Martin, 'and was immediately teaching in a provincial art school, and I couldn't believe how good the school was. They were sophisticated about art. What you often saw were extremely bright students who had failed in the conventional education system. At art college, the things that had been a disadvantage became an advantage. But when people came out of those institutions there was nothing for them. One of the reasons for them going into other fields, including pop music, was that there was nowhere for them to have a career in Britain.'</p> <p>The art school that everybody now knows about is Goldsmiths, and its most famous pupil-teacher relationship is that between Michael Craig-Martin - known as an artist for classic conceptual works such as his claim to have transformed a glass of water into an oak tree - and Damien Hirst. In the 1980s Goldsmiths had a revolutionary teaching programme, devised by the head of the Fine Art Department, Jon Thompson. They were also taught - in a departure from the art school ethos - that they didn't have to go on the dole or become pop stars or teachers. They could have careers as artists.</p> <p>Damien Hirst was still an undergraduate at Goldsmiths when he curated Freeze, the legendary first exhibition of the new British art, in 1988. The exhibitors, all fellow students, included Mat Collishaw, Ian Davenport, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Fiona Rae, Angus Fairhurst, Anya Gallacio and Simon Patterson. Hirst himself brilliantly turned art into pop, and has created incisive, unforgettable images. In doing so, he has less in common with conventional artists than with such unconventional products of British art schools as Vivienne Westwood (Harrow Art School) and Malcolm McLaren (every art school you can think of).</p> <p>Hirst pays fulsome tribute to his teacher Michael Craig-Martin. 'I think he's great,' he says. 'He encouraged you to go out there and meet people. If you went to an opening he'd come and talk to you. In England it's like a club that's hard to get into; he smashed that door down. Michael and Jon Thompson and a lot of the other teachers were just encouraging you to do anything - at every other college you had to choose either painting, where everyone was wearing berets, or sculpture, where they all looked like rugby players. Michelangelo, all great artists, do both'.</p> <p>And the compliment is returned. 'All of that generation were on an undergraduate course,' remembers Michael Craig-Martin. 'They all had an unusual degree of self-possession about what they were doing. There were a lot of seminars that I led where they established a dialogue of critical interest in each other. As a tutor I encouraged them to think of what they wanted and not to think it's for someone else. The most striking thing about them was their unshakable conviction - which made them very stroppy.'</p> <p>If the first wave of new British artists owed a lot to Michael Craig-Martin, other artist-teachers have influenced the artists who have emerged in the 1990s. Jon Thompson is acknowleged as a brilliant teacher and influence by Turner Prize-winner Steve McQueen. The video and installation artist Susan Hiller prefers to be known for her art, but her influence is very clear on her students Douglas Gordon and Tacita Dean.</p> <p>But by being so good at producing artists, has the contemporary British art college closed off all the other things art schools have been good at since the 1960s? The peculiar world of the art school is at the heart of our culture. The more you look at recent British cultural history, the more it seems to have been mapped out over coffee in the cafeteria of some art college, argued over and fought for between students and teachers with goatee beards. This is not just about art: it is about a great tradition of subversion.</p> <p>You can construct a family tree of British artists and their pupils since the early 1960s whose branches extend not just into art but into pop music, not just to Damien Hirst but to Pete Townshend, Bryan Ferry and the Sex Pistols' manager Malcolm McLaren. You can see analogies between McLaren giving up his Goldsmiths degree with an unfinished thesis on 'the psychogeography of Oxford Street' to found his shop Sex, and the late 60s rebellion at St.Martin's out of which British conceptual art was born. You can imagine the birthpangs of punk in students who rebelled against their polo-neck-wearing teachers. The most revered British artist at the height of the 1960s was the sculptor Sir Anthony Caro. He was also the leading teacher at St. Martin's College. Caro's welded steel sculptures were championed by the American critic Clement Greenberg, who argued that Caro was not just the leading British artist but the heir to the great modernist tradition of Jackson Pollock. This was taught as holy writ at the regular St. Martin's Sculpture Forum where, a student later recalled, 'Twelve men with pipes would walk for hours around sculpture and mumble.'</p> <p>St.Martin's attracted students who wanted to be sculptors, but then found themselves totally alienated. This generation included Gilbert and George, Richard Long and Bruce McLean (who in turn taught the likes of Douglas Gordon at the Slade). They reacted violently against Caro. His art insisted that it had nothing to do with the world: they insisted theirs did. The story goes that Caro came into one of his classes to find twigs scattered on the gallery floor. He asked Richard Long what was the meaning of this. It was one-half of a two-part work, explained Long. The rest was on top of Ben Nevis. Gilbert and George sent out postcards and called them sculpture. The pipe-smokers fumed. A young dissident artist and teacher, John Latham, took Clement Greenberg's book Art and Culture out of the college library in 1966 and invited his students to come to his house and help him eat it. He got the sack.</p> <p>The family tree of the British art school and its influence might begin with Richard Hamilton, who designed the poster for the first ever pop exhibition This Is Tomorrow in 1956. Hamilton's collage Just What Is It That Makes Today's Homes So Different, So Appealing? has a subversive irony that has characterised British pop ever since - but you don't have to trace this influence subliminally. As a teacher at Newcastle University in the 1960s one of his pupils was future Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry. Ferry has always acknowledged Hamilton as his mentor. 'With pop art and Richard,' he has said, 'suddenly there was a whole new world that was relevant, and that was sexier and more potent because it had to do with everyday life'.</p> <p>Pete Townshend attributes the pop art violence and aggression of The Who in the early 60s - smashing their instruments on stage, piling up the feedback - to the man he regards as his art school mentor, 'auto-destructive' artist Gustav Metzger. 'It was 1962, the time of the Cuban missile crisis,' Townshend told me recently. 'Metzger had a profound effect on me. I was doing my first gig with The Who and took it as an excuse to smash my new Rickenbacker that I had just hocked myself to the eyebrows to buy. I really believed it was my responsibility to start a rock band that would last only three months, an auto-destructive group. The Who would have been the first punk band except that we had a hit.'</p> <p>British art has never been as internationally significant as it is today. But it would be wrong to say that art did not play a huge part in British life. Art may have seemed marginal in Britain since the Second World War, but secretly, through the art schools, it gave birth to British pop. Where did Jarvis Cocker meet the girl in Pulp's 'Common People'? He met her at St. Martin's.</p> <p>Today the talent goes into the gallery instead of the charts. Art colleges are no longer utopian centres for an alternative lifestyle but places where you learn to be an artist. That's great for British art. But if Pete Townshend, Bryan Ferry and John Lennon had all become artists when they left art school, the cultural history of Britain since the 1960s would be unrecognisable.</p> <p>Michael Craig-Martin says that in a way he regrets the professionalisation of the art schools, because it takes away their sense of difference from the university system: 'This aspect of it being seen as an alternative education has diminished.' Of all the Goldsmiths generation it is paradoxically Damien Hirst, whose first exhibition set this professionalisation of art in motion, who has most insistently tried to break out of the art world, to make pop culture. From his restaurant installations to his band Fat Les and his videos for Blur, he's the classic art school maverick - the last of the unprofessionals.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's astonishing the damage that tiny bacteria in food can do. Anyone who has experienced the horror of being struck down by vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach/head pain or even fever as a result of ingesting food-poisoning organisms will know exactly what I'm talking about. Protecting yourself when dining out in restaurants or fast-food joints that use highly processed food products is difficult, but all of us should be aware of the precautions to take to ensure that we aren't exposing ourselves to any unnecessary risks at home, which is where most cases of food poisoning occur. It is impossible to overstress the importance of hygiene and the proper preparation of dishes - one only need to recall the tragic E coli outbreaks to realise that food poisoning can kill. To start with, we should always pay attention to shelf-life dates, cooking instructions, and fridge and freezer manufacturer recommended temperatures - the guidelines are designed to minimise bacterial contamination and growth.</p> <p>The majority of fit and healthy people can be exposed to food-poisoning bacteria without there being any serious threat to their health, but individuals with compromised immune systems, such as the elderly or the sick, are much more at risk. Also at risk are pregnant women - in extreme cases, food-poisoning bugs can cause spontaneous miscarriages or brain damage. Three main types of food poisoning are of concern to expectant women: toxoplasmosis, listeria and salmonella. Toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite, but can't be transferred from person to person. This parasite is harmless to most adults, but if caught during pregnancy it can cause miscarriage or damage to the baby in the womb. Toxoplasmosis can only be diagnosed by a blood test, but sadly, symptoms described as 'mild flu-like' don't usually appear until two to three weeks after contracting the disease, by which time some damage may have already occurred. Prevention is the best cure - you can avoid exposing yourself to this parasite by keeping away from animal faeces and cats, in particular. This bug lives in cats for about three weeks and can transfer to their faeces and remain infectious for up to 18 months.</p> <p>Since it can be transmitted through the soil to other animals such as dogs, you need to take the following steps to prevent infection. Do not allow cat litter near food. Always wear rubber gloves to clean up pet mess. Wash your hands thoroughly after you have touched an animal or used the lavatory. Avoid eating undercooked or raw meat, such as steak tartare, which can harbour bacteria. Don't feed your cats and dogs raw meat, as this provides a route for infection. In addition, you should follow basic hygiene rules, such as keeping work surfaces clean, washing tea towels regularly, making sure that meat and poultry are cooked appropriately and washing all fruit and vegetables before you eat them. It is also important to keep cooked and raw foods separate in the fridge so that the bacteria from the raw foods do not infect the cooked foods. Also, use separate chopping boards for raw and cooked meat and fish, and another for vegetables and fruit.

Steer clear of foods containing raw and lightly cooked eggs, such as mayonnaise, souffl\u00e9s, sauces such as hollandaise, and mousses.

The best way to minimise your risk of developing listeriosis is to avoid all soft and blue cheeses, including pasteurised soft cheeses.

If you buy ready-made chilled or frozen meals, make sure that you heat them thoroughly - lukewarm foods provide the perfect environment for harmful bacteria.

      "bodyText": "It's astonishing the damage that tiny bacteria in food can do. Anyone who has experienced the horror of being struck down by vomiting, diarrhoea, stomach/head pain or even fever as a result of ingesting food-poisoning organisms will know exactly what I'm talking about. Protecting yourself when dining out in restaurants or fast-food joints that use highly processed food products is difficult, but all of us should be aware of the precautions to take to ensure that we aren't exposing ourselves to any unnecessary risks at home, which is where most cases of food poisoning occur. It is impossible to overstress the importance of hygiene and the proper preparation of dishes - one only need to recall the tragic E coli outbreaks to realise that food poisoning can kill. To start with, we should always pay attention to shelf-life dates, cooking instructions, and fridge and freezer manufacturer recommended temperatures - the guidelines are designed to minimise bacterial contamination and growth. The majority of fit and healthy people can be exposed to food-poisoning bacteria without there being any serious threat to their health, but individuals with compromised immune systems, such as the elderly or the sick, are much more at risk. Also at risk are pregnant women - in extreme cases, food-poisoning bugs can cause spontaneous miscarriages or brain damage. Three main types of food poisoning are of concern to expectant women: toxoplasmosis, listeria and salmonella. Toxoplasmosis is caused by a parasite, but can't be transferred from person to person. This parasite is harmless to most adults, but if caught during pregnancy it can cause miscarriage or damage to the baby in the womb. Toxoplasmosis can only be diagnosed by a blood test, but sadly, symptoms described as 'mild flu-like' don't usually appear until two to three weeks after contracting the disease, by which time some damage may have already occurred. Prevention is the best cure - you can avoid exposing yourself to this parasite by keeping away from animal faeces and cats, in particular. This bug lives in cats for about three weeks and can transfer to their faeces and remain infectious for up to 18 months. Since it can be transmitted through the soil to other animals such as dogs, you need to take the following steps to prevent infection. Do not allow cat litter near food. Always wear rubber gloves to clean up pet mess. Wash your hands thoroughly after you have touched an animal or used the lavatory. Avoid eating undercooked or raw meat, such as steak tartare, which can harbour bacteria. Don't feed your cats and dogs raw meat, as this provides a route for infection. In addition, you should follow basic hygiene rules, such as keeping work surfaces clean, washing tea towels regularly, making sure that meat and poultry are cooked appropriately and washing all fruit and vegetables before you eat them. It is also important to keep cooked and raw foods separate in the fridge so that the bacteria from the raw foods do not infect the cooked foods. Also, use separate chopping boards for raw and cooked meat and fish, and another for vegetables and fruit. If cooked food is to be kept, it must be cooled as quickly as possible, then, when cold, wrapped and refrigerated. Always reheat rice until it is piping hot, as Clostridium perfringens - another less serious, but still diarrhoea- and vomiting-causing organism - may be found in rice that has been cooked and left in a warmish environment, then not thoroughly reheated. It's also unsafe to eat food from tins which have either been dented - the protective seal may be broken, allowing bacteria to enter - or have blown ends, which could signify the presence of the bacterium that causes botulism, even if only rarely.

      "body": "<p>The Beckton Arms is a small, boozy doldrums in London's East End. On one side it is flanked by Barking Road, on the other the A13. Each night the road heaves under the weight of traffic trying to get out of the capital, but the Beckton's side road remains still. Here, on a lethargic Sunday afternoon on 5 December of last year, one of Canning Town's most notorious faces, 57-year-old Tommy Hole, met his lifelong friend, Joe 'The Crow' Evans, for an afternoon's drinking. Hole had run into Geoff Humphries, Evans's son-in-law, earlier that afternoon and the three sat at the bar. At 3pm, someone came in, scouted around and quickly left. Surrounded by regulars, Hole, Evans and Humphries carried on drinking, unperturbed.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, two men entered the Beckton by the front door. The half-light of midwinter filtered through the fake spray-on snow of the windows, but the incongruity between the pub's festive decorations and the newcomers' scarved faces stirred few. The televised crowd ripples from Football Italia occasionally eclipsed the muttering at the bar. The men walked up behind Evans and fired two shots with a handgun, the first entering the base of his skull at point-blank range. Hole's reflexes took him from his bar stool towards the back door. The two gunmen fired a further nine shots, four hitting Hole's upper body and one his head. The gunmen turned and left the pub, unflustered, walking with practised calm through the A13's underpass and disappearing into a labyrinth of cul-de-sacs. Humphries was left standing unscathed next to the landlady's children and a mother-to-be, and, despite a pub full of witnesses, the killers are still free.</p> <p>In a 35-year criminal career, Tommy Hole was a convicted armed robber, car thief, drug manufacturer and dealer, attempted murderer and probable killer, who had spent half this time in jail.</p> <p>Hole had left his wife Christina at 1.40pm that day, casually saying, 'Right, sweetheart, I'm off now, catch you later.' Christina and Tommy had married on 17 March 1995, while Hole was a voluntary resident of Rampton High Security Hospital, having completed a six-year sentence he began at Parkhurst Prison. He had been jailed in 1989 for armed robbery and for running a \u00a3400,000 amphetamine factory with his son Kevin. Father and son had adjacent cells, united in prison counterculture. They had practised a warped form of symbiosis for years, and were now inseparable. During their sentence, Kevin became ensnared in a drug deal with other inmates, and became depressed. One night in 1991 he seemed abnormally cheerful at lights out. But when Tommy walked between the neighbouring cells with his routine cup of tea the following morning, he found his son hanging dead from his cell door. The coroner's verdict was suicide. Hole suffered a nervous breakdown and was moved to Rampton.</p> <p>Tommy Hole's prison career began in June 1963, aged 21, when he was sentenced to three months for forging banknotes. During this time, he escaped from the Hammersmith Hospital ward where he was being treated. Barely six months passed before he was in the dock again, receiving five years for robbery with violence after a payroll snatch had backfired. There is a maxim which says that criminals who spend too many of their days in jail should look for different work, or a better firm, but the frequency of Hole's court appearances is more testament to his profligacy as a criminal than his ineptitude. This was the London of the Krays and Richardsons, where the organisation of protection, heists and racketeering meant that young gangsters such as Hole considered jail part of the lifestyle. And as the amount of time Tommy did grew, so did his status. In 1973, Hole and George Davis - otherwise known as 'Darkie' George - were in Chelmsford Crown Court, with three other men, charged with a \u00a347,000 whisky raid in Stratford, east London. The case leant on the evidence of supergrasses Charles Lowe and Kieran McCormack, both of whom said they were on the same raid. But Hole and Davis were seamless enough in their alibis to be found not guilty. By the time of his next conviction, Hole had increased in confidence.</p> <p>It was 1975. A local man, James Venton, fell foul of Hole. Newspaper reports neglect to mention Venton's offence, but what followed was not about exacting retribution, but building reputation. Hole and a local boxer, Billy Williams, went to Venton's home. The two men dragged him into the street, where Williams held Venton down while Hole ran over him three times with a car. The brutality of the case made the headlines and Venton agreed to act as chief witness for the prosecution. Hole was jailed for seven years for attempted murder. Forty-eight hours later, three men went to the home of Venton's family and smashed four windows. Hole had begun to amass a loyal following.</p> <p>While still serving time for attempted murder, Hole was charged with a \u00a37,000 armed robbery at the London Electricity Board in Ilford, during which a policeman was shot. Hole was cleared, but George Davis was sentenced to 20 years. On his release, Hole campaigned for Davis's conviction to be quashed. His campaign led to several unorthodox publicity stunts, including digging up the Headingley test wicket and crashing a car into the gates of Buckingham Palace. Davis was subsequently released, but never pardoned.</p> <p>It was the early 80s, however, that sealed Hole's reputation as a hard man when he was cleared of the murder of another gangster named Nicky Gerard. The sequence of events had begun with a 1970 turf war between Ronnie Knight - associate of the Krays, erstwhile husband of Barbara Windsor and a culprit in the \u00a37 million Security Express robbery in 1983 - and 'Italian Albert Dimes', who the FBI considered the US Mafia's man in London. That year, Dimes's top enforcer, Alfredo 'Eyetie Tony' Zomparelli, came to blows with Ronnie Knight in the Latin Quarter nightclub in London's Leicester Square. Knight arrived with his two brothers, Johnny and David, and Billy Hickson, whom Knight describes as a 'headcase'.</p> <p>In his biography, Living Dangerously, Knight maintains he was passive until the last, suggesting that Hickson attacked Zomparelli. In the 'war zone' that ensued, David Knight was stabbed twice in the chest by Zomparelli. Knight buried his brother in the spring of that year and swore he would see Zomparelli murdered, 'for with him alive, the hate in me would eventually kill me as well'. Knight did not, after all, have to carry out this act of supposed self-defence, as Nicky Gerard, the son of gangland boss Alfie Gerard, killer of Frank 'Mad Axe Man' Mitchell and Ginger Marks, came into Knight's Soho club with a proposition.</p> <p>Gerard offered to keep Knight's hands clean of Zomparelli's death and to do the job for him. On 4 September 1974, Zomparelli was shot dead in the Golden Goose on Old Compton Street. A couple of days later, Gerard received a thick envelope from Knight, a bonus for what doubled as a warped crime of passion - Gerard was seeing a former stripper called Rozanna, who was Zomparelli's wife. Gerard and Knight were subsequently arrested, though neither was convicted.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Nicky Gerard crossed Tommy Hole in a fight for influence in the East End underworld. On a Friday night in June 1982, in Canning Town, Gerard kissed his daughter Vicky goodnight, and left her on her 11th birthday to go to the pub for a drink. At 9.12pm he turned the ignition in his Oldsmobile and looked up to see two men a few feet from the car. They said a few words to him before opening fire with two shotguns and an automatic pistol. Gerard climbed from his car and crawled towards his house. Fifty yards from his home he was brought to a halt.

He owned a hotel in Benidorm, and was one of the wealthiest criminals in the East End. But his true nature - recidivistic, opportunistic - led to Hole stealing a car in broad daylight, on 8 September 1984.

'The light had gone from his eyes,' she tells me, as she begins their gentle story in the newly decorated flat they shared in Canning Town. She continued to visit him in hospital, returning to the man she had first courted when she was a barmaid at his local pub, the Salisbury Arms. 'Once his sentence finished, Tommy started coming home at weekends. He stayed here longer each time, until he was finally discharged,' she says.

      "bodyText": "The Beckton Arms is a small, boozy doldrums in London's East End. On one side it is flanked by Barking Road, on the other the A13. Each night the road heaves under the weight of traffic trying to get out of the capital, but the Beckton's side road remains still. Here, on a lethargic Sunday afternoon on 5 December of last year, one of Canning Town's most notorious faces, 57-year-old Tommy Hole, met his lifelong friend, Joe 'The Crow' Evans, for an afternoon's drinking. Hole had run into Geoff Humphries, Evans's son-in-law, earlier that afternoon and the three sat at the bar. At 3pm, someone came in, scouted around and quickly left. Surrounded by regulars, Hole, Evans and Humphries carried on drinking, unperturbed. Fifteen minutes later, two men entered the Beckton by the front door. The half-light of midwinter filtered through the fake spray-on snow of the windows, but the incongruity between the pub's festive decorations and the newcomers' scarved faces stirred few. The televised crowd ripples from Football Italia occasionally eclipsed the muttering at the bar. The men walked up behind Evans and fired two shots with a handgun, the first entering the base of his skull at point-blank range. Hole's reflexes took him from his bar stool towards the back door. The two gunmen fired a further nine shots, four hitting Hole's upper body and one his head. The gunmen turned and left the pub, unflustered, walking with practised calm through the A13's underpass and disappearing into a labyrinth of cul-de-sacs. Humphries was left standing unscathed next to the landlady's children and a mother-to-be, and, despite a pub full of witnesses, the killers are still free. In a 35-year criminal career, Tommy Hole was a convicted armed robber, car thief, drug manufacturer and dealer, attempted murderer and probable killer, who had spent half this time in jail. Hole had left his wife Christina at 1.40pm that day, casually saying, 'Right, sweetheart, I'm off now, catch you later.' Christina and Tommy had married on 17 March 1995, while Hole was a voluntary resident of Rampton High Security Hospital, having completed a six-year sentence he began at Parkhurst Prison. He had been jailed in 1989 for armed robbery and for running a \u00a3400,000 amphetamine factory with his son Kevin. Father and son had adjacent cells, united in prison counterculture. They had practised a warped form of symbiosis for years, and were now inseparable. During their sentence, Kevin became ensnared in a drug deal with other inmates, and became depressed. One night in 1991 he seemed abnormally cheerful at lights out. But when Tommy walked between the neighbouring cells with his routine cup of tea the following morning, he found his son hanging dead from his cell door. The coroner's verdict was suicide. Hole suffered a nervous breakdown and was moved to Rampton. Tommy Hole's prison career began in June 1963, aged 21, when he was sentenced to three months for forging banknotes. During this time, he escaped from the Hammersmith Hospital ward where he was being treated. Barely six months passed before he was in the dock again, receiving five years for robbery with violence after a payroll snatch had backfired. There is a maxim which says that criminals who spend too many of their days in jail should look for different work, or a better firm, but the frequency of Hole's court appearances is more testament to his profligacy as a criminal than his ineptitude. This was the London of the Krays and Richardsons, where the organisation of protection, heists and racketeering meant that young gangsters such as Hole considered jail part of the lifestyle. And as the amount of time Tommy did grew, so did his status. In 1973, Hole and George Davis - otherwise known as 'Darkie' George - were in Chelmsford Crown Court, with three other men, charged with a \u00a347,000 whisky raid in Stratford, east London. The case leant on the evidence of supergrasses Charles Lowe and Kieran McCormack, both of whom said they were on the same raid. But Hole and Davis were seamless enough in their alibis to be found not guilty. By the time of his next conviction, Hole had increased in confidence. It was 1975. A local man, James Venton, fell foul of Hole. Newspaper reports neglect to mention Venton's offence, but what followed was not about exacting retribution, but building reputation. Hole and a local boxer, Billy Williams, went to Venton's home. The two men dragged him into the street, where Williams held Venton down while Hole ran over him three times with a car. The brutality of the case made the headlines and Venton agreed to act as chief witness for the prosecution. Hole was jailed for seven years for attempted murder. Forty-eight hours later, three men went to the home of Venton's family and smashed four windows. Hole had begun to amass a loyal following. While still serving time for attempted murder, Hole was charged with a \u00a37,000 armed robbery at the London Electricity Board in Ilford, during which a policeman was shot. Hole was cleared, but George Davis was sentenced to 20 years. On his release, Hole campaigned for Davis's conviction to be quashed. His campaign led to several unorthodox publicity stunts, including digging up the Headingley test wicket and crashing a car into the gates of Buckingham Palace. Davis was subsequently released, but never pardoned. It was the early 80s, however, that sealed Hole's reputation as a hard man when he was cleared of the murder of another gangster named Nicky Gerard. The sequence of events had begun with a 1970 turf war between Ronnie Knight - associate of the Krays, erstwhile husband of Barbara Windsor and a culprit in the \u00a37 million Security Express robbery in 1983 - and 'Italian Albert Dimes', who the FBI considered the US Mafia's man in London. That year, Dimes's top enforcer, Alfredo 'Eyetie Tony' Zomparelli, came to blows with Ronnie Knight in the Latin Quarter nightclub in London's Leicester Square. Knight arrived with his two brothers, Johnny and David, and Billy Hickson, whom Knight describes as a 'headcase'. In his biography, Living Dangerously, Knight maintains he was passive until the last, suggesting that Hickson attacked Zomparelli. In the 'war zone' that ensued, David Knight was stabbed twice in the chest by Zomparelli. Knight buried his brother in the spring of that year and swore he would see Zomparelli murdered, 'for with him alive, the hate in me would eventually kill me as well'. Knight did not, after all, have to carry out this act of supposed self-defence, as Nicky Gerard, the son of gangland boss Alfie Gerard, killer of Frank 'Mad Axe Man' Mitchell and Ginger Marks, came into Knight's Soho club with a proposition. Gerard offered to keep Knight's hands clean of Zomparelli's death and to do the job for him. On 4 September 1974, Zomparelli was shot dead in the Golden Goose on Old Compton Street. A couple of days later, Gerard received a thick envelope from Knight, a bonus for what doubled as a warped crime of passion - Gerard was seeing a former stripper called Rozanna, who was Zomparelli's wife. Gerard and Knight were subsequently arrested, though neither was convicted. In the 1980s, Nicky Gerard crossed Tommy Hole in a fight for influence in the East End underworld. On a Friday night in June 1982, in Canning Town, Gerard kissed his daughter Vicky goodnight, and left her on her 11th birthday to go to the pub for a drink. At 9.12pm he turned the ignition in his Oldsmobile and looked up to see two men a few feet from the car. They said a few words to him before opening fire with two shotguns and an automatic pistol. Gerard climbed from his car and crawled towards his house. Fifty yards from his home he was brought to a halt. One of the masked men broke the butt of a shotgun on his skull, then a final three shotgun blasts were delivered at close range. The two men left no evidence bar a Ford Cortina parked three roads away. Hole and his son Kevin were arrested a few days later. They had in their possession passports and visas for a trip to Florida. Gangland execution aside, another, seedier motive for the killing was mooted. Like Gerard and Zomparelli's wife before him, Gerard was seeing Kevin's wife. That Tommy Hole was involved with Nicky's wife, Linda, lent the episode some symmetry. Gerard had been overstepping the mark for years. A wreath had been laid on his doorstep earlier. Even Knight refers to the killing as testament that Gerard had 'got it wrong'. Hole and his son were cleared of the murder when an ID parade proved inconclusive. Linda Gerard moved to another area. Tommy Hole was now a major criminal player.

      "body": "<b>Darren Almond<br></b> Time passing is a central theme in the work of Darren Almond - but although he grapples with often mind-boggling physical, human and psychological dimensions of time and space, he manages to do so in ways that are unexpectedly immediate and straightforward. He's transmitted a wall sized projection of an empty cell live from Pentonville Prison; he's exhibited a giant two metre long digital clock; and he has ventured where most artists of all generations have feared to tread with Oswiem, a pair of black and white films of people waiting at two bus stops in contemporary Auschwitz. In his most recent piece, a three-screen video projection, Almond continues to explore memories of the past by interviewing his father about all the physical injuries he has sustained throughout his life. <p><b>Fiona Banner</b><br> Fiona Banner is best known for her 'wordscapes', blow-by-blow written accounts of action-adventure movies that take the form of solid single blocks of text written on large surfaces, often the same shape and size as a cinema screen. She calls these textual chunks 'still movies', and they recapture in a single static image an experience that goes beyond words. Underlying all her work is a fascination with language as a form of communication - the possibilities of words as well as the way in which they so often fail us. Lately she's been making a series of sculptures of vast full stops in different fonts carved from white polystyrene - a substance that is itself a space filler, so light it's hardly there. </p> <p><b>Simon Bill</b><br> Simon Bill's paintings use materials and techniques better suited to the DIY enthusiast - or the nursery school. Working on plywood or MDF, he conjures up suggestive organic shapes out of bizarre concoctions of flexible filler, maize seeds, foam rubber chips or just a network of marker pen doodles. Yet there's nothing naive about the way in which he knowingly teases at the boundaries of what is artistically acceptable and produces at the same time queasily beautiful and richly associative images in their own right. </p> <p><b>Angela de la Cruz</b><br> Angela de la Cruz gives her works a hard time. Since 1994 she has been making what she calls 'everyday paintings', which start off conventionally enough as monochrome abstracts built up in layers of oil paint onto canvas, but which are then smashed, ripped, squashed and crumpled into strange shapes. These sad and sorry objects are presented crammed into corners, propped against walls or squeezed into unsuitable places. But by destroying her paintings she allows them to take on a new and haunting life of their own, occupying a no-man's land between painting, sculpture and performance. </p> <p><b>Jeremy Deller</b><br> Few artists have achieved such a total immersion in the world of pop music as Jeremy Deller, and he, unlike many of his contemporaries, doesn't even play in a band. Instead he involves himself in the music of others, as when he got a traditional brass band to play classic Acid House anthems. His art often takes the form of events which intervene directly in real life: he has stuck 'I love Joyriding' stickers on the bumpers of flashy cars, and organised a show of artworks referenced by the Manic St Preachers - in which serious Picassos and Pollocks lent by the likes of the Tate Gallery combined with speeches by Arthur Scargill. </p> <p><b>Rachel Lowe</b><br> Whether she is using her own films, working with pieces of found footage or borrowing from other people's snapshots, Rachel Lowe is concerned with the plethora of still and moving images that document and define our history, memory and experience. She often combines high and low-tech media - digital video, slide projections, painting, drawing, or photocopying - to manipulate images and make us question what we are seeing: sometimes figures are blacked-out into silhouettes, images are repeated, or slivers sliced out. In each case we are reminded that things are usually not what they seem, or what we want them to be. </p> <p><b>Paul Noble</b><br> At some point in their careers, most artists find themselves becoming rather too well acquainted with the social security system, but few turn the experience into art. In his satirical boardgame Doley, Noble does just that by immersing his players in the pitfalls and problems of life on income support. Doley is a nihilisitic game for losers where skill is pointless and players struggle fruitlessly for survival. There's more dystopian vision in Noble's ongoing creation Nobson, a polluted, empty fantasy town which he has been creating in drawings, sculpture and installations since 1996 - there's even a guidebook to what Noble describes as 'town planning as self portraiture'. </p> <p><b>Tim Noble and Sue Webster</b><br> Contemporary art's latest double act met at art college in Nottingham and have lived and worked together ever since. They make their dual presence felt in attention-grabbing artworks that both work with and send up the high media profile and cultish mythologising of so much contemporary art. They've covered many of the major players of the London artworld in tacky home-made tattoos, they've made neon signs, and exhibited a pile of their accumulated household rubbish which, when lit by a slide projector, projected a perfect shadow portrait of the pair's profiles. </p> <p><b>Grayson Perry</b><br> Pottery is not a medium usually associated with contemporary or even fine art, and that is precisely why it is so appealing to Grayson Perry. He describes his pots and vases as 'stealth objects, agents to get into the homes of the well-to-do'. From a distance they are handsome, classically shaped and richly ornamented vessels, but close up they teem with depraved scenes. Every taboo is flouted in these perverse pots which both subvert and play off conventions of art and craft in order to launch a more general assault on British culture, class, sexuality and taste - and on the art world, which, inevitably, laps up whatever invective he slings at it. </p> <p><b>Michael Raedecker</b><br> It's a time-honoured art historical tradition that real men don't sew. But Michael Raedecker goes one step further - he commits the ultimate artistic taboo of combining thread and paint to produce sombre-coloured, uncannily atmospheric landscapes, interiors and portraits in which sewn fabric is made to function in as many different ways as painted surfaces. Last year he won the prestigious John Moores painting Prize with an eerie canvas in which sequins, lurex and different coloured yarns were used to accentuate, not alleviate, a sense of mysterious and dreamlike emptiness. </p> <p><b>Tomoko Takahashi</b><br> There's nothing new about creating art out of everyday junk, but rather than trying to transform it into anything else, in her epic installations Tomoko Takahashi allows the rubbish to remain emphatically rubbish. Huge tides of the stuff engulf walls, floors and ceilings, often threatening to take over completely. But initial appearances are also deceptive - what may seem as random and chaotic as a force of nature is in fact meticulously arranged and carefully considered. Whether she's using the building debris of a new gallery space, the paperwork of a design agency or filling the Saatchi Gallery with a floor full of dysfunctional appliances, Takahashi describes her work as 'visual music', with each minute element orchestrated and arranged to make up an intricate whole. </p> <p><b>Keith Tyson</b><br> Keith Tyson never suffers from artist's block. This is because much of what he does is not his work at all: it is the work of the Artmachine. The Artmachine is a series of computer programmes designed by Tyson to provide an endless source of inspiration - it issues proposals for artworks and Tyson slavishly follows them to the best of his abilities. The results are often bizarre: the entire contents of the Kentucky Fried Chicken menu cast in lead; 366 painted, wallmounted breadboards; a thimblefull of paint dropped from a New York building. Tyson, who claims to be as much influenced by science as by art, is nonetheless a passionate idealist who wants his art to be 'philosophically charged - to say something about the nature of existence and origin'. </p> <p>\u0095 This is an edited extract from Louisa Buck's book, Moving Targets 2, which will be published in July 2000, priced \u00a312.99</p>",

In his most recent piece, a three-screen video projection, Almond continues to explore memories of the past by interviewing his father about all the physical injuries he has sustained throughout his life. Fiona Banner Fiona Banner is best known for her 'wordscapes', blow-by-blow written accounts of action-adventure movies that take the form of solid single blocks of text written on large surfaces, often the same shape and size as a cinema screen. She calls these textual chunks 'still movies', and they recapture in a single static image an experience that goes beyond words. Underlying all her work is a fascination with language as a form of communication - the possibilities of words as well as the way in which they so often fail us. Lately she's been making a series of sculptures of vast full stops in different fonts carved from white polystyrene - a substance that is itself a space filler, so light it's hardly there. Simon Bill Simon Bill's paintings use materials and techniques better suited to the DIY enthusiast - or the nursery school. Working on plywood or MDF, he conjures up suggestive organic shapes out of bizarre concoctions of flexible filler, maize seeds, foam rubber chips or just a network of marker pen doodles. Yet there's nothing naive about the way in which he knowingly teases at the boundaries of what is artistically acceptable and produces at the same time queasily beautiful and richly associative images in their own right. Angela de la Cruz Angela de la Cruz gives her works a hard time. Since 1994 she has been making what she calls 'everyday paintings', which start off conventionally enough as monochrome abstracts built up in layers of oil paint onto canvas, but which are then smashed, ripped, squashed and crumpled into strange shapes. These sad and sorry objects are presented crammed into corners, propped against walls or squeezed into unsuitable places. But by destroying her paintings she allows them to take on a new and haunting life of their own, occupying a no-man's land between painting, sculpture and performance. Jeremy Deller Few artists have achieved such a total immersion in the world of pop music as Jeremy Deller, and he, unlike many of his contemporaries, doesn't even play in a band. Instead he involves himself in the music of others, as when he got a traditional brass band to play classic Acid House anthems. His art often takes the form of events which intervene directly in real life: he has stuck 'I love Joyriding' stickers on the bumpers of flashy cars, and organised a show of artworks referenced by the Manic St Preachers - in which serious Picassos and Pollocks lent by the likes of the Tate Gallery combined with speeches by Arthur Scargill. Rachel Lowe Whether she is using her own films, working with pieces of found footage or borrowing from other people's snapshots, Rachel Lowe is concerned with the plethora of still and moving images that document and define our history, memory and experience. She often combines high and low-tech media - digital video, slide projections, painting, drawing, or photocopying - to manipulate images and make us question what we are seeing: sometimes figures are blacked-out into silhouettes, images are repeated, or slivers sliced out. In each case we are reminded that things are usually not what they seem, or what we want them to be. Paul Noble At some point in their careers, most artists find themselves becoming rather too well acquainted with the social security system, but few turn the experience into art. In his satirical boardgame Doley, Noble does just that by immersing his players in the pitfalls and problems of life on income support. Doley is a nihilisitic game for losers where skill is pointless and players struggle fruitlessly for survival. There's more dystopian vision in Noble's ongoing creation Nobson, a polluted, empty fantasy town which he has been creating in drawings, sculpture and installations since 1996 - there's even a guidebook to what Noble describes as 'town planning as self portraiture'. Tim Noble and Sue Webster Contemporary art's latest double act met at art college in Nottingham and have lived and worked together ever since. They make their dual presence felt in attention-grabbing artworks that both work with and send up the high media profile and cultish mythologising of so much contemporary art. They've covered many of the major players of the London artworld in tacky home-made tattoos, they've made neon signs, and exhibited a pile of their accumulated household rubbish which, when lit by a slide projector, projected a perfect shadow portrait of the pair's profiles. Grayson Perry Pottery is not a medium usually associated with contemporary or even fine art, and that is precisely why it is so appealing to Grayson Perry. He describes his pots and vases as 'stealth objects, agents to get into the homes of the well-to-do'. From a distance they are handsome, classically shaped and richly ornamented vessels, but close up they teem with depraved scenes. Every taboo is flouted in these perverse pots which both subvert and play off conventions of art and craft in order to launch a more general assault on British culture, class, sexuality and taste - and on the art world, which, inevitably, laps up whatever invective he slings at it. Michael Raedecker It's a time-honoured art historical tradition that real men don't sew. But Michael Raedecker goes one step further - he commits the ultimate artistic taboo of combining thread and paint to produce sombre-coloured, uncannily atmospheric landscapes, interiors and portraits in which sewn fabric is made to function in as many different ways as painted surfaces. Last year he won the prestigious John Moores painting Prize with an eerie canvas in which sequins, lurex and different coloured yarns were used to accentuate, not alleviate, a sense of mysterious and dreamlike emptiness. Tomoko Takahashi There's nothing new about creating art out of everyday junk, but rather than trying to transform it into anything else, in her epic installations Tomoko Takahashi allows the rubbish to remain emphatically rubbish. Huge tides of the stuff engulf walls, floors and ceilings, often threatening to take over completely. But initial appearances are also deceptive - what may seem as random and chaotic as a force of nature is in fact meticulously arranged and carefully considered. Whether she's using the building debris of a new gallery space, the paperwork of a design agency or filling the Saatchi Gallery with a floor full of dysfunctional appliances, Takahashi describes her work as 'visual music', with each minute element orchestrated and arranged to make up an intricate whole. Keith Tyson Keith Tyson never suffers from artist's block. This is because much of what he does is not his work at all: it is the work of the Artmachine. The Artmachine is a series of computer programmes designed by Tyson to provide an endless source of inspiration - it issues proposals for artworks and Tyson slavishly follows them to the best of his abilities. The results are often bizarre: the entire contents of the Kentucky Fried Chicken menu cast in lead; 366 painted, wallmounted breadboards; a thimblefull of paint dropped from a New York building. Tyson, who claims to be as much influenced by science as by art, is nonetheless a passionate idealist who wants his art to be 'philosophically charged - to say something about the nature of existence and origin'. \u0095 This is an edited extract from Louisa Buck's book, Moving Targets 2, which will be published in July 2000, priced \u00a312.99",

      "body": "<p>You are just going to have to believe me when I tell you that there is such a thing as a lazy Sunday lunch for 15 to 20 and, what's more, I propose you cook it. The reason you should believe me is that I am not someone who churns out vats of food without the merest furrowing of a brow or clenching of a knuckle. True, I like cooking, and I like my friends, but having to feed too many of them at one time can leave me positively curdled with resentment and panic. I'd like to be calm, I'd like to be unflappable, but some things are never going to come to pass.</p> <p>So, working along the premise of change what you can and accept what you can't, I've found a way of cooking that satisfies my need to be hospitable while accommodating my hostessy shortcomings. The first imperative is that there should be a great deal, indeed too much, to eat. It might sound blasphemous to say that my Jewish-mother leanings are best satisfied by a whole shoulder of pork, but I've found this to be the case. The fact that this great weight of pig needs hardly any interference while it cooks satisfies the second requirement - namely that you are not working yourself into a lather during the little free time you have. But it's not as unsatisfying for an enthusiast as it sounds: before you put the meat into the oven (where you leave it for a full day), you smother it with a fragrant paste of your own making, thereby giving yourself an essential element of pottering, without which you may as well be pinging the microwave.</p> <p>The last time I did my pig, I had 14 people coming for dinner. That turned into 16 - then another two people turned up at the last minute. I can't tell you how rewarding it felt to be cooking food that turned me into the sort of person who felt totally unflustered by that.</p> <p>Before then, you need to start off with good ingredients. The pork has to be the best pork you can get. But this is easily found. You just phone Heritage Prime (01297 489 304) and throw yourself on Denise's mercy. Their organic pork, from a farm near Lyme Regis, is better than any pork you've ever tasted, or could hope to taste (it's where the Roux brothers and Raymond Blanc get theirs). I buy Heritage Prime bacon (hand-cured) by the loadful, to be stashed in the deep-freeze and taken out and eaten in glorious abundance whenever the need for a first-rate bacon sandwich hits (which is often).</p> <p>You can order any part of the pig (or a whole one, butchered) or other meat, but it is the pork shoulder I regularly go for, asking them to score the skin diagonally to aid crisping (and eating). It's \u00a38.70 a kilo (\u00a3 3.95 a lb), which, considering the quality and the cost of rearing, is not at all bad. Last time, Denise sent me a photo of 'the girls' on the bluebell-flecked hill overlooking Lyme Bay, which I've stuck on my fridge. Although I realise it might sound macabre to be gazing at a picture of live pigs while cooking a dead one, it is healthier than buying sanitised packets of clingfilmed meat from the supermarket that pretends to have no relationship to its source. It tastes a lot better, too.</p> <p>The paste I spread on this pork is made of ginger, garlic, chilli and sherry vinegar - which has a Chinesey tone to it. Indeed, the pork when it's finished - the crackling glazed and crisp, the flesh beneath melting and to be torn rather than carved - reminds me obscurely of Peking duck. There's the same mixture between velvet-tender meat and seared-crisp skin. Correspondingly, I suggest aromatic plums to follow, the syrup in which they're poached resonant with star anise and cinnamon.</p> <p>If you have only a single oven, I suggest you cook the plums a day early, then just heat them over a gentle flame on the hob at the last minute (though it wouldn't be ridiculous to start cooking them once you take the pork out). After all, this is meant to be a lazy Sunday lunch.</p> <p><b> Slow-roasted shoulder of pork</b></p> <p>I first got the idea of cooking a shoulder of pork over 24 hours from the second River Cafe Cookbook ; my take on it is really a de-Italianified version. Any mixture of herbs or spices you want would do: this isn't a recipe so much as a suggestion.</p> <p>1 shoulder of pork, skin scored (approximately 9.5 kilos) <br>6 garlic cloves <br>1cm of fresh ginger <br>2 fresh red chillies or 1 tsp dried red chilli flakes <br>3 tbsps olive oil (not extra virgin) <br>4 tbsps sherry vinegar</p> <p>So, if you're planning to eat this for Sunday lunch, at about Saturday lunchtime, preheat your (clean) oven to the hottest it will go. Sit the pork skin side up on a rack over a roasting tin. I like to use a pestle and mortar to make my paste, because it makes me feel good, but you could just grate the garlic and ginger (one of those microplane graters available from Lakeland or Divertimenti is the tool for the job) and stir in chilli flakes, a tablespoonful of oil and two of vinegar if you want. Otherwise, pound together the peeled cloves and peeled chopped ginger with the fresh chilli, adding a tablespoonful of oil and two of vinegar when they're squished and paste-like.</p> <p>Using your fingers, rub this paste over the scored skin, pushing bits into the cut lines of rind. Stagger across to the oven and put in the tray, leaving it for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the two remaining tablespoons each of oil and vinegar into the bowl in which you mixed the paste. When the pork's had its half an hour, remove it from the oven, switching it to 125C or gas mark \u00bd as you do so. Now turn the pork over: I find it easiest to lift it by hand wearing ovengloves.</p> <p>Pour the oil and vinegar over the underside (which is now uppermost on the rack) and put the pork back in the low oven, leaving it there for 23 hours.</p> <p>Actually, you could leave it longer. One of the joys of this is that it cannot over cook. Anyway, after 23 hours, or 30 to 40 minutes before you actually want to eat, turn the oven back to the highest it will go, remove the pork and turn it crackling side up. Put it back in the oven for 30 minutes in which time it will get hot and crisp, though you can give it another 10 minutes, if you feel it needs it.</p> <p>Remove, slice off the crackling in a horizontal swipe of the knife and break it into manageable pieces, then start carving or pulling at the tender meat.</p> <p>I like cabbage with this - just slice it in the processor so you've got a huge pile of shard-like shavings - as well as broccoli (I'm lazy and buy it already floretted), though if you want potatoes, by all means cook potatoes. If you're not going in for the poached plums afterwards, you could think of setting a jar of hoisin sauce on the table, but, for me, there must always be a pot of English mustard.</p> <p><b> Baked spiced aromatic plums</b></p> <p>When you poach fruit like this in the oven, it keeps its shape while cooking to gentle tenderness. Although plums are the food of late summer and early autumn, there are good red fruit around at the moment that will particularly benefit from immersion in this aromatic syrup.</p> <p>2.25 kilos plums <br>1 bottle of red wine <br>4 bay leaves <br>2 cinnamon sticks or a tsp ground cinnamon <br>4 cloves <br>2 star anise <br>seeds from 8 cardamom pods or scant half tsp ground <br>750g honey (either runny or thick)</p> <p>Set oven to 170 F/gas mark 3. Since you want the halved plums to lie flat in one layer, you'll certainly need two baking dishes, maybe even three. Whatever, they need to be shallow dishes, and the plums should fit snugly, or you won't have enough syrup.</p> <p>Cut the plums in half, remove stones and divide them between the dishes, cut side down. Then put all the other ingredients into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Pour over the plums, cover the dishes tightly with foil (or a lid, of course, if you've one that fits) and bake for about an hour, or until the plums are tender.</p> <p>If you want to make these in advance, do - just keep the cooled, covered fruit in the fridge for three or so days until you need them, then reheat them gently on the hob. Opinions in my household are divided as to what goes best with these spicy, wine-dark plums. There is a custard contingent, but what I really love is something my grandmother used to make.

      "bodyText": "You are just going to have to believe me when I tell you that there is such a thing as a lazy Sunday lunch for 15 to 20 and, what's more, I propose you cook it. The reason you should believe me is that I am not someone who churns out vats of food without the merest furrowing of a brow or clenching of a knuckle. True, I like cooking, and I like my friends, but having to feed too many of them at one time can leave me positively curdled with resentment and panic. I'd like to be calm, I'd like to be unflappable, but some things are never going to come to pass. So, working along the premise of change what you can and accept what you can't, I've found a way of cooking that satisfies my need to be hospitable while accommodating my hostessy shortcomings. The first imperative is that there should be a great deal, indeed too much, to eat. It might sound blasphemous to say that my Jewish-mother leanings are best satisfied by a whole shoulder of pork, but I've found this to be the case. The fact that this great weight of pig needs hardly any interference while it cooks satisfies the second requirement - namely that you are not working yourself into a lather during the little free time you have. But it's not as unsatisfying for an enthusiast as it sounds: before you put the meat into the oven (where you leave it for a full day), you smother it with a fragrant paste of your own making, thereby giving yourself an essential element of pottering, without which you may as well be pinging the microwave. The last time I did my pig, I had 14 people coming for dinner. That turned into 16 - then another two people turned up at the last minute. I can't tell you how rewarding it felt to be cooking food that turned me into the sort of person who felt totally unflustered by that. Before then, you need to start off with good ingredients. The pork has to be the best pork you can get. But this is easily found. You just phone Heritage Prime (01297 489 304) and throw yourself on Denise's mercy. Their organic pork, from a farm near Lyme Regis, is better than any pork you've ever tasted, or could hope to taste (it's where the Roux brothers and Raymond Blanc get theirs). I buy Heritage Prime bacon (hand-cured) by the loadful, to be stashed in the deep-freeze and taken out and eaten in glorious abundance whenever the need for a first-rate bacon sandwich hits (which is often). You can order any part of the pig (or a whole one, butchered) or other meat, but it is the pork shoulder I regularly go for, asking them to score the skin diagonally to aid crisping (and eating). It's \u00a38.70 a kilo (\u00a3 3.95 a lb), which, considering the quality and the cost of rearing, is not at all bad. Last time, Denise sent me a photo of 'the girls' on the bluebell-flecked hill overlooking Lyme Bay, which I've stuck on my fridge. Although I realise it might sound macabre to be gazing at a picture of live pigs while cooking a dead one, it is healthier than buying sanitised packets of clingfilmed meat from the supermarket that pretends to have no relationship to its source. It tastes a lot better, too. The paste I spread on this pork is made of ginger, garlic, chilli and sherry vinegar - which has a Chinesey tone to it. Indeed, the pork when it's finished - the crackling glazed and crisp, the flesh beneath melting and to be torn rather than carved - reminds me obscurely of Peking duck. There's the same mixture between velvet-tender meat and seared-crisp skin. Correspondingly, I suggest aromatic plums to follow, the syrup in which they're poached resonant with star anise and cinnamon. If you have only a single oven, I suggest you cook the plums a day early, then just heat them over a gentle flame on the hob at the last minute (though it wouldn't be ridiculous to start cooking them once you take the pork out). After all, this is meant to be a lazy Sunday lunch. Slow-roasted shoulder of pork I first got the idea of cooking a shoulder of pork over 24 hours from the second River Cafe Cookbook ; my take on it is really a de-Italianified version. Any mixture of herbs or spices you want would do: this isn't a recipe so much as a suggestion. 1 shoulder of pork, skin scored (approximately 9.5 kilos) 6 garlic cloves 1cm of fresh ginger 2 fresh red chillies or 1 tsp dried red chilli flakes 3 tbsps olive oil (not extra virgin) 4 tbsps sherry vinegar So, if you're planning to eat this for Sunday lunch, at about Saturday lunchtime, preheat your (clean) oven to the hottest it will go. Sit the pork skin side up on a rack over a roasting tin. I like to use a pestle and mortar to make my paste, because it makes me feel good, but you could just grate the garlic and ginger (one of those microplane graters available from Lakeland or Divertimenti is the tool for the job) and stir in chilli flakes, a tablespoonful of oil and two of vinegar if you want. Otherwise, pound together the peeled cloves and peeled chopped ginger with the fresh chilli, adding a tablespoonful of oil and two of vinegar when they're squished and paste-like. Using your fingers, rub this paste over the scored skin, pushing bits into the cut lines of rind. Stagger across to the oven and put in the tray, leaving it for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, pour the two remaining tablespoons each of oil and vinegar into the bowl in which you mixed the paste. When the pork's had its half an hour, remove it from the oven, switching it to 125C or gas mark \u00bd as you do so. Now turn the pork over: I find it easiest to lift it by hand wearing ovengloves. Pour the oil and vinegar over the underside (which is now uppermost on the rack) and put the pork back in the low oven, leaving it there for 23 hours. Actually, you could leave it longer. One of the joys of this is that it cannot over cook. Anyway, after 23 hours, or 30 to 40 minutes before you actually want to eat, turn the oven back to the highest it will go, remove the pork and turn it crackling side up. Put it back in the oven for 30 minutes in which time it will get hot and crisp, though you can give it another 10 minutes, if you feel it needs it. Remove, slice off the crackling in a horizontal swipe of the knife and break it into manageable pieces, then start carving or pulling at the tender meat. I like cabbage with this - just slice it in the processor so you've got a huge pile of shard-like shavings - as well as broccoli (I'm lazy and buy it already floretted), though if you want potatoes, by all means cook potatoes. If you're not going in for the poached plums afterwards, you could think of setting a jar of hoisin sauce on the table, but, for me, there must always be a pot of English mustard. Baked spiced aromatic plums When you poach fruit like this in the oven, it keeps its shape while cooking to gentle tenderness. Although plums are the food of late summer and early autumn, there are good red fruit around at the moment that will particularly benefit from immersion in this aromatic syrup. 2.25 kilos plums 1 bottle of red wine 4 bay leaves 2 cinnamon sticks or a tsp ground cinnamon 4 cloves 2 star anise seeds from 8 cardamom pods or scant half tsp ground 750g honey (either runny or thick) Set oven to 170 F/gas mark 3. Since you want the halved plums to lie flat in one layer, you'll certainly need two baking dishes, maybe even three. Whatever, they need to be shallow dishes, and the plums should fit snugly, or you won't have enough syrup. Cut the plums in half, remove stones and divide them between the dishes, cut side down. Then put all the other ingredients into a saucepan and bring to the boil. Pour over the plums, cover the dishes tightly with foil (or a lid, of course, if you've one that fits) and bake for about an hour, or until the plums are tender. If you want to make these in advance, do - just keep the cooled, covered fruit in the fridge for three or so days until you need them, then reheat them gently on the hob. Opinions in my household are divided as to what goes best with these spicy, wine-dark plums. There is a custard contingent, but what I really love is something my grandmother used to make. She called it Barbados cream, but it is just yogurt mixed with cream, topped with brown sugar and left covered for a day until the sugar melts into syrup which drips down the cool whiteness of the cream: cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e without the crunch and with a desirably sharp edge. Barbados cream It's difficult to be precise about measurements. The idea is to stir together equal quantities of yogurt (I always use Greek) and double cream and then sprinkle over a good covering of brown sugar. In other words - especially where sugar is concerned - go by eye, by volume, rather than the scales. The quantities below make enough to fill a large shallow bowl (and it must be a shallow bowl) measuring about 30cm in diameter. I know this doesn't make a lot, but with the poached plums you really don't need a lot. 750ml double cream 750ml Greek yogurt 150g light muscovado sugar or more as needed Mix the cream and Greek yogurt together then beat till fairly thick. Pour into a shallow bowl (or a couple of shallow bowls). Sprinkle over a thick carpet of brown sugar, cover with clingfilm and leave somewhere cool for at least 12 hours, or better still 24.",

      "body": "<b>Jamie Osborne</b> <br>Having fallen on my head once too often at the Cheltenham Festival in 1999, I decided to end my 15-year riding career and put into operation a long-term ambition to become a trainer of horses on the flat. Now I've got more than 50 horses and I employ 20 people in my yard at Kingsdown in Upper Lambourn, Berkshire. When I started, my priority was to get a good head lad, and the man I targeted was Ron Thomas because of his experience and his top-class reputation in the business. Peter Walwyn, who for years had been one of the best flat trainers in the country, had announced his retirement and Ron had been his head lad for 30 years. <p>I was lucky to get him. Walwyn was very protective towards his staff and insisted on interviewing me before he would let me even talk to Ron. But things worked out and I told Ron what I was planning to do and that I would like him to work for me as head lad. Walwyn gave him the green light and he said 'Yes'. There are parts of the job where I lack Ron's experience. He may be called a lad, but he's 55 years old and he's spent every day of the past 30 years feeling the legs of two-year-olds. He was helping to train Derby winners when I was still in nappies, so he knows everything there is to know about the fragile structure of a horse. Also, I need a head lad I get on with and trust absolutely because, when I'm not here in the yard, he is absolutely in charge. He looks after the staff, has the power to hire and fire them, issue instructions and bollock them when necessary. </p> <p>We have a board in the tack room which we use to plan the next day's work and we run a list every day. There is a metal tab for each horse, and in the evening we go through the list, allocating riders. All the lads are accomplished horsemen or women, but, of course, some are better than others and some are better suited to certain types of horse. So, depending on the progress and training requirements of the horse and the ability of the lad concerned, we juggle the timetable for the next day. </p> <p>I am on the gallops early in the morning and responsible for the training regime. Ron and I discuss the work schedules for each horse. We both have our input but ultimately the buck stops with me. Ron spends every day, all day in the yard. He knows the intricacies of every horse we have. Racehorses are prone to all sorts of physical problems. Ron must diagnose their ailments and problems very quickly. </p> <p>There are other things on my mind apart from the business. I got married last autumn and Katie, my wife, is expecting our first child in May. We live in Upper Lambourn, just around the corner from the yard. She paints for a living, under the name Katie O'Sullivan. I'd love to have some of her paintings, but I can't afford them.</p> <p>Although I'm responsible for the training, I have to spend much of my time away from the yard. For instance, I will go to the sales in the autumn and I will probably be at the races three or four days a week during the season. I have more than 100 owners and it is my job to look after them. </p> <p>I try to call them every week and give them a progress report. Most people own horses for fun and, if they make a bit of money, it's a bonus, but they quite rightly expect the trainer to be there when the horse is running. So much of my time is taken up with getting on with my owners and promoting my yard, Kingsdown, to new ones. This means putting myself about a bit and there have been one or two occasions when Ron is in the yard at five in the morning at the same time as I am arriving home after a night entertaining clients. It's a hard life, but somebody's got to do it.</p> <p><b>Ron Thomas</b><br> Jamie knew exactly what he wanted to do when he called me up last summer, and I liked the sound of it. There's no bullshit about him - what you see is what you get. He was one of the greatest national hunt jockeys of all time and won everything except the Grand National and the Gold Cup, although he was second in both races. He makes quick decisions but he discusses them with you first and he's never shy of asking for advice. He's worked with horses all his life and has a feel for them. It's early days, but I am certain he will be a successful trainer.</p> <p>The yard was in a dreadful state when we moved in. There was shit caked all over the walls in the boxes and the air vents in the roof hadn't been opened for years. There was a plague of rats and the lads' quarters were filthy. The covered ride was flooded and the roof had collapsed. And there were pot holes everywhere. We spent a week cleaning up, redecorating the offices and the quarters, and washing out all the boxes. Now the yard is something to be proud of. Everybody mucked in. Jamie's dad helped and it created a good bond between us all. </p> <p>Owners like coming here because the atmosphere is good, and that is because the lads are happy and Jamie is a good employer. He has provided all sorts of incentives for them and tried to create pride in the yard.</p> <p>I live about 10 minutes' drive away with my wife and daughter, so I can get to the yard early. Most days we will watch the horses and discuss their progress. Jamie will ride out himself or we will drive up on the gallops and watch them exercise together. They are mainly two-year-olds bought at last year's autumn sales. When they arrived here, they were just babies, most were not broken. Now we have a collection of horses which will soon be ready to race. We have had to teach them to run in a straight line and to do what the jockey tells them. They have been monitored until we know everything about them. We will discuss their individual strengths and weaknesses and then work to bring them in peak condition at just the right time. </p> <p>I had nothing to do with the selection of the horses, but I am more than happy with what we have. Jamie disappeared up to Newmarket and Doncaster, bought them on credit and then found them owners. Most people start in a small way, find the owners and then buy the horses. Jamie did it the other way round. That took nerve. </p> <p>I think he thrives on tension. If it goes wrong, he's in big trouble, but he never seems to even contemplate the possibility. He knows he is going to succeed.</p> <p>We are just training flat horses and the season starts soon. Jamie and I have been working as a team since last autumn and I can truthfully say that we get on well. </p> <p>One of his strengths is that he was a great jockey who always used his head. He's still cocky and he's still got the brains and the touch but he's willing to learn. There is nothing autocratic in his nature. It is very important that people like you in this game, and you can't help liking Jamie.</p>",

They are mainly two-year-olds bought at last year's autumn sales. When they arrived here, they were just babies, most were not broken. Now we have a collection of horses which will soon be ready to race. We have had to teach them to run in a straight line and to do what the jockey tells them. They have been monitored until we know everything about them. We will discuss their individual strengths and weaknesses and then work to bring them in peak condition at just the right time. I had nothing to do with the selection of the horses, but I am more than happy with what we have. Jamie disappeared up to Newmarket and Doncaster, bought them on credit and then found them owners. Most people start in a small way, find the owners and then buy the horses. Jamie did it the other way round. That took nerve. I think he thrives on tension. If it goes wrong, he's in big trouble, but he never seems to even contemplate the possibility. He knows he is going to succeed. We are just training flat horses and the season starts soon. Jamie and I have been working as a team since last autumn and I can truthfully say that we get on well. One of his strengths is that he was a great jockey who always used his head. He's still cocky and he's still got the brains and the touch but he's willing to learn. There is nothing autocratic in his nature. It is very important that people like you in this game, and you can't help liking Jamie.",

      "body": "<p>It was Thomas Hoving, a former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, who famously declared, 'Art is sexy! Art is money-sexy! Art is money-sexy-social-climbing fantastic!' I think the social-climbing bit only applies in America but the art-money-sexy exclamation mark still stands. I've been artstruck for the past eight years and keep waiting for the excitement to wear off but it never does. I love the wild contrasts of the art world, the gambler's highs and lows, the wacky juxtapositions of extreme glamour and extreme grottiness, the exhilarating absence of any sensible stripped-pine middle-class bits in between. One day it's dinner at Anthony d'Offay's in Regents Park with Charles Saatchi and Jerry Hall, the next day it's out to the unused pages of the A to Z in search of some artists' co-op in El5. Basically the more serious you are about contemporary art, the further eastwards you have to travel: no serious art happens west of Bond Street.</p> <p>Everyone in the art world seems to be either terribly rich or terribly poor - it's a bit like horseracing in that respect - but with the rich for once in the subservient role. That's why art parties are a liggers' charter - I've seen pinstriped men break away from Brompton Cross blondes to pursue some terrible smelly sleeping-bag-clutching crusty because hovering at the back of their minds is the unspoken question: Are you a homeless alky who's just wandered in off the street or are you an important New Neurotic Realist? Appearances are always deceptive at art parties. I'd seen someone I assumed was a ligger for years before he turned up on telly being Matthew Collings presenting Channel 4's This is Modern Art.</p> <p>The combination of geographical and social adventure with non-stop alcohol are as it were the perks of the art world - but what about the art? I grew up with all the usual prejudices about contemporary art and in fact retained them well into my forties: why can't they draw, why can't they paint, why can't they paint things that look like things; why can't they paint like Vermeer, why can't they do a decent portrait; why do they charge so much for their work; how do we know we're not being conned? The fear of being conned by art seems to run very deep in the British psyche - it's been going on at least since Whistler. As I will explain in a minute, there is a simple way of freeing yourself from the fear of being conned. But let me go on a bit about my conversion.</p> <p>I saw Rachel Whiteread's Ghost - her plastercast of a room - in, I think, 1992 and couldn't get it out of my mind. My first reaction was the kneejerk - 'But it's only a load of old plaster, not beautiful, what's the point?' Nevertheless Ghost haunted me, and when Whiteread cast her House at Bow in 1993 I rushed to see it. This time, perhaps because I'd been fretting about Ghost so much, I didn't need to ask what was the point - I felt I knew immediately: to dignify an ordinary house by making it into art, to honour it and make it unforgettable.</p> <p>Getting the point felt like a great achievement, so I was possessively distressed when I learned that House was to be demolished. And who should be responsible for demolishing it but my old friend, Eric Flounders, the Leader of Tower Hamlets council. I decided it would be a simple matter to take Eric out to lunch, suck up to him a bit, and then say 'By the way, Eric, please don't demolish House'. Unfortunately he snarled like an enraged pit bull when I raised the subject. With all the many many problems of Tower Hamlets, he ranted, this effing House was the only thing to get an ounce of media attention or public concern. He stomped off in a fury, so then I decided to write an article trying to enlist public support - again, it did no good at all, and House was demolished a few weeks later. But my article caught the eye of Doris Saatchi, who took me to lunch and gently suggested that perhaps I should write more about contemporary art. I said my total ignorance was a handicap, but she said not necessarily - if I interviewed artists I would probably learn something. Up till then I had thought there was a great Trespassers Will Be Prosecuted sign outside the art world - it was as if she had handed me the key to the gate.</p> <p>My first problem was getting rid of the notion that artists had to be able to draw or paint or at least do something I couldn't do. I wanted them to have a 'God-given talent', the equivalent of perfect pitch, that made it OK for them to be artists and me not. But I eventually saw, by analogy with my own field, writing, that the skill side is unimportant. I mean, with writing - there are people who can turn out grammatically perfect essays with every word correctly spelled, but you still don't want to read them because they're boring. And then there are other people whose spelling is wonky and grammar fallible but you hang in there and read them because they've got something interesting to say. So with art: technical skill is useful but not enough - in fact not anything without ideas. In theory, any of us could have gone to Charles Saatchi and said, 'I'd like you to pay for me to import a l4-foot tiger shark from Australia and put it in a tank and show it in your gallery' - but as Damien Hirst always says, unanswerably, 'But you didn't, did you?'</p> <p>It was Damien Hirst, of course, who started it all with his l988 Freeze show - and what an incredibly generous act that was, for an art student to organise a show for his fellow students. It meant that a whole generation came out of Goldsmiths like an army, instead of being picked off singly by the Cork Street dealers. And it was Damien Hirst who enlisted Charles Saatchi (who up till then had mainly collected American art) and set him off on his great British buying spree. Saatchi's advertising background and Damien's natural showmanship created the perfect synergy for launching Britart - with Damien's shark, as it were, the brand logo.</p> <p>Of course there is controversy about Saatchi's role and about his taste. Some complain that he goes for 'soundbite art', that he favours the quick sensational statement; others complain that his taste is too fleeting, that he buys art almost like pop singles and then discards it; others again maintain that he is purely a dealer. But let's just say for the moment that Saatchi was a Maecenas to an important generation of British artists, and that even if he never buys another painting, or mounts another show, we should be grateful to him for giving us Sensation.</p> <p>Damien, of course, played the role that David Hockney played for Britart in the Sixties - he made art 'sexy' in media terms. He took the flak, raised the hype, enraged the Mail and Telegraph -readers and created an atmosphere of controversy and excitement that ultimately benefited the whole art scene. The fact that he was so likeable and came from a non-art background - his father actually told the press, 'I can't for the life of me see the art in his work' - were all to the good, and obviously pickled sharks and dissected cows were a gift for cartoonists. He has tactfully retreated in the last couple of years and left the way clear for other artists to grab the spotlight, as Tracey Emin so enjoyably did last year.</p> <p>But media attention inevitably leads on to money, and this is where it all gets sticky. Again, Damien put it best: 'Art is about life; the art world is about money'. The artists themselves are clearly not money-motivated: on the contrary, they tend to be extremely left-wing, anti-capitalist, anti-consumerist. And yet they sustain this glossy artbiz pyramid which is all about money. Some of the dealers seem more like City traders than art lovers - some of them actually were City traders - quite a few of them still wear pinstriped suits. Britart in the Nineties attracted not only serious collectors, but also speculators, and the Saatchi auction in l998 revealed that they were onto a good thing - most of the big names had doubled or tripled or quadrupled in value in less than a decade. Artists get very shifty if you try and talk about the money side - they say they leave all that to their dealers. But the disparity between intention and end-use is very striking. Artists make art for themselves - the fact that it ends up as a luxury status object in a millionaire's penthouse is something they prefer not to address.</p> <p>Money is the fly in the ointment, the goad in the flank, the thing that makes the Great British Public so suspicious of art. But why should we care? We're not actually buying this stuff - no one expects us to. That's the great point about contemporary art: we don't have to buy it. If a few collectors want to pay high prices for it, then fine, especially if, like Charles Saatchi, they want to show it to the public - great. But would we honestly want to own, say, Sarah Lucas's Two Fried Eggs and a Kebab and have to cook it new fried eggs every day? And what would we do with Marc Quinn's Self - his head made out of his blood - or Damien Hirst's A Thousand Years ('steel, glass, flies, maggots, MDF, insect-o-cutor, cow's head, sugar, water') when the electricity went off? The curatorial problems of contemporary art are a nightmare, so we should thank our lucky stars that we don't own it, and don't have to.</p> <p>And once you clear your mind of the idea that you might actually buy any of this art, then all the old worries about am I being conned fly out of the window. If all you have to do is look at it, the worst that can happen is that you can waste an hour looking at something boring, which God knows we do often enough when we switch on the television. A lot of contemporary art can be seen for free in public or commercial galleries; even the Saatchi only costs \u00a34, and although the staff in the commercial galleries often look rather snotty, I have found they are touchingly grateful for human contact - they get lonely in their gloss-white cubes.</p> <p>I used to consider myself an art-lover because I was happy to spend a day in the National Gallery, or to drive round the back roads of Tuscany in search of another Piero. I now feel that that sort of art-love is necrophilia. If you care about art at all, then you must engage with contemporary art, however difficult or irritating you find it. It's no use saying Matisse or Michelangelo did it better - doubtless they did, but they would never have flourished if the society of their day only admired dead art. That is why, much though I enjoy Brian Sewell's writing, I think he does a disservice to art. Art is too important to consign to the heritage cupboard: we need it now; we need more of it; and we are very very lucky to be living in a golden age for British art. People will say, 'To think that Rachel Whiteread, Damien Hirst, Gary Hume, Sarah Lucas all walked the streets of London at the same time'. And now we've got the fun of seeing who will be their equivalents in the next generation. The portents are good - there's tons of new art out there in an enormous diversity of styles. Some of it will turn out to be trash but some of it won't, and you don't have to worry about what it costs because you're not going to buy it. Just look at it, and enjoy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Politically and commercially, 'British' has become a dubious or dirty word. The union which comprises Great Britain is fraying; in advance of its collapse, corporations already treat Britishness as a self-love which no longer dares to speak its name. British Airways briefly banned the flag from its tail fins, while British Petroleum and British Telecom cover their embarrassment by using only initials. All well and good, since the idea of Britain was never much more than a governmental fiction, serving to cover the family quarrels between four different nations.</p> <p>In art, however, Britishness can still safely be celebrated. Modernism internationalised art, eliminating differences between Europe's separate schools. Britain, luckily, resisted the modern revolution in painting, and remained true to its own quirky national tradition. When Nikolaus Pevsner delivered the 1955 Reith lectures on 'The Englishness of English Art', he dolefully concluded that 'England has no Michelangelo, no Rembrandt, nor a D\u00fcrer or Gr\u00fcnewald, a Greco or Velasquez'.</p> <p>He was only half right. We do possess such gods, but not in the visual arts: our British Michelangelo is Milton, and we have our own Rembrandt in the person of Shakespeare, while Dickens might be our Gr\u00fcnewald. British painters may not have painted cosmological ceilings like Michelangelo or fiercely exalted altar-pieces like Greco. Their achievements are less supernatural, but for that reason all the more comprehensible and lovable. They ignore angels in favour of domestic pets; instead of witchy divinities like the Mona Lisa, they study people who are as resolutely individualistic as Britain itself - Hogarth's Shrimp Girl or the equine country ladies of Gainsborough, Stanley Spencer's Patricia Preece with her sagging boobs or David Hockney's weary, worn, yet somehow beatific mother.</p> <p>Classical art revered the ideal, a statuesque, platonically perfect improvement of the actual human form. Renaissance art emphasised the sanctity of the image: in the work of Giotto or Mantegna, the invisible face of the deity materialises before our eyes, as if on the Turin shroud. British art has always defied the precepts of both classical Greece and Renaissance Italy. Hogarth argued that the 'line of beauty' was irregular, rampantly energetic, lacking the poise and rectitude valued by classical design. The Victorian painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema tried to imagine Olympus, but his bathing nymphs have waxy flesh, and look as if they are taking part in an antique advertising campaign for cosmetics.</p> <p>British art is earthy, worldly, and has scant respect for sanctity. In Constable's Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows, that yearningly vertical spire is grounded by a team of muddy horses mired in a pond in the foreground, just as in Turner's Ploughing Up Turnips, Near Windsor, the hazy outline of the castle is upstaged by the peasants with their grubby piles of vegetables.</p> <p>Our indigenous saints and martyrs never manage to lift off from the soil in which turnips are grown. In Stanley Spencer's St Francis and the Birds, painted in 1935, the pantheistic saint is a fat man in dressing gown and slippers, preaching to a rowdy congregation of barnyard fowls. Francis Bacon's career began in 1944 with an attempt to portray the crucifixion. But, characteristically, he saw the sadistic tableau from below, studying some twisted, screeching figures at the foot of the cross (and modelling their stricken mouths on some illustrations of oral diseases he found in a medical text book).</p> <p>Ruskin hoped to establish a more respectable lineage for British art, which ought - he believed - to promote 'the chief worship which lay in the nation's heart'. 'In Athens,' he said, 'we have the triumph of Pallas; and in Venice, the Assumption of the Virgin.' He looked to Turner, born on St George's Day, to perform the local version of such miracles by slaying the dragon, which for Ruskin symbolised the mercenariness of philistine Britain. But Turner declined to fulfil the prophecy, and Ruskin sadly acknowledged that 'here in England, our great spiritual fact is the Assumption of the Dragon'. He should not have been dismayed. Turner's insular originality enabled him to paint a god of a new kind - the dynamo of industrial locomotion, the creative and destructive force which agitates nature in Rain, Steam, and Speed.</p> <p>British art rejects the luminous pallor of the classical statue, or the gilded heaven of the Byzantine icon. Its tones tend to be murky, smudged and leaden like the overcast skies favoured by Constable. British artists are virtuosi of bad weather, from Turner's blizzards to Howard Hodgkin's Rain, in which inky clouds and the drenching squalls they disgorge cause the dry, solid world to deliquesce.</p> <p>Rather than smoothing flesh into marble or refining it into the spirit's semi-transparent envelope, our painters emphasise the ruddy, meaty physicality of the world. A tradition extends from bleeding sirloin in Hogarth's Roast Beef of Old England to the cattle hacked into sections by Damien Hirst, or from the pustules in Blake's sketch of Satan Smiting Job with Boils to the soiled sheets aired by Tracey Emin in last year's Turner Prize show.</p> <p>Dickens likened the narrative of Oliver Twist, which mingles sentimentality and grotesquerie, to the layers of 'streaky bacon'; Shakespeare's double plots alternate in the same way between tragedy and comedy, anguish and folly. Joshua Reynolds painted a great Shakespearean actor hesitating between the solemn exhortations of the tragic muse and the wanton enticements of her comic sister. Garrick's uncertainty, in this portrait painted in 1760-1, catches the mixed motives of British art, which attempts to balance what Matthew Arnold called 'high seriousness' with a more instinctive, barbaric low humour.</p> <p>The earliest native craftsmen, during the Roman occupation, changed the faces they carved: classic heads were given bug eyes, elongated jaws, or nastily thinned lips. Gargoyles with toothache grimace on the rooftops of medieval churches.</p> <p>By the eighteenth century, caricaturists like Thomas Rowlandson practised a physiognomic black magic, outraging the edicts of classical humanism as they showed men regressing to beasts. Another unbroken continuity extends from James Gillray's John Bull in 1798 - a piggish guzzler, feeding his belly with frigates - to the latex ogres of Spitting Image: Roy Hattersley with his incontinent spitting and spluttering, grey John Major, and the blowsy, tipsy royal dowagers.</p> <p>But the British version does not merely relish the ugliness and abasement of Shakespeare's 'bared forked animal'. It corrects classical and Renaissance theories of beauty and acclimatises them to these eccentric islands by finding treasure in dross, or splendour - as Wordsworth put it - in the humble, downtrodden grass. Constable declared that he loved 'old rotten planks, slimy posts' and decayed brickwork, and envied Shakespeare's capacity to 'make everything poetical', even the bedraggled sheep-cotes and creaky mills frequented by Poor Tom, the mad mendicant in King Lear.</p> <p>The point was repeated in the twentieth century by Algernon Newton, who believed that 'a gasometer can make as beautiful a picture as the Grand Canal'. The canals so lovingly painted by Newton were far from grand: they are the neglected industrial conduits of suburban London - sunken, secretive, moodily desolate.</p> <p>The Victorian classicist Lord Leighton admiringly recalled the public honour accorded to painters in Renaissance Italy. In his picture of Cimabue's celebrated Madonna carried in Procession through the streets of Florence, he recreated the ceremonial parade on a canvas almost 20 feet long, and identified Giotto and Dante in the throng of lookers-on: this is a society unified and immortalised by art.</p> <p>George Eliot, reflecting on the same Florentine festivities in her novel Romola, claimed that, 'There has been no great people with processions.' In Britain, however, painters have had better luck with the random jostling of crowds or mobs. Hence the idyllic indiscipline of W.P. Frith's Derby Day, with its yobs, yokels, swells, oafs, guttersnipes, acrobats, fallen women and quarrelsome dogs, none of them paying any attention to the race they have supposedly come to see. A critic in 1858 aptly remarked that the gathering was 'the great Saturnalia of British sport'. It is as if Chaucer's Canterbury pilgrims had made a detour to Epsom Downs, forgetting that their destination was meant to be a cathedral.</p> <p>History painting, which depicts momentous political events, has never been at home in Britain (though it throve in nineteenth-century America, where art helped to confer identity on a new nation). Constable toiled to record the pomp which commemorated the opening of Waterloo Bridge in 1817, but could not prevent his attention from straying. The ranked dignitaries are submerged by the turbid river, and the city is obliterated by a showery sky.</p> <p>Like Thackeray in Vanity Fair , who reduces the battle of Waterloo to noises off, British artists see history from the sidelines. W.R. Sickert in 1932 painted Miss Earhart's Arrival as a blurred and unsatisfactory epiphany. The flyer Amelia Earhart has landed in London after a solo flight across the Atlantic; the achievement is epic, but the painter has no more than a distant glimpse of her plane, obscured by craning well-wishers, colliding umbrellas, and the customary gauze of rain. In 1942, Richard Eurich attempted to paint the plucky Allied forces during the landing at Dieppe. Once again, the grand occasion is scarcely visible, erased by Turneresque pyrotechnics in the sky and by geysers of sea spray which blot out the naval convoy.</p> <p>Rather than painting battles, British war artists tend to show how the violence of history is absorbed into a somnolent, unchanging landscape. At Cowley in 1941, Paul Nash painted a cemetery of downed German planes by moonlight. He called the result Dead Sea, because the scene looked to him like a silver, inundating ocean, a static surf of metal.</p> <p>Retreating from the public arena, British artists concentrate on the private life. An unknown painter in the first decade of the 17th century showed The Cholmondeley Sisters sitting up in a shared bed cradling their new babies, born on the same day. The infants, tightly swaddled and packaged for display, are as inert as wood carvings; the braided costumes and stiff ruffs of the mothers are equally formal. But their wan, wary faces look startlingly contemporary: you might have seen them yesterday in a maternity ward, illustrating a television news item about the NHS.</p> <p>Renaissance paintings were destined for churches or palaces. British artists expect their work to hang in less grandiose settings, and adjust art to the confessional intimacy of the home. In Marriage \u00e0 la Mode and The Rake's Progress, Hogarth analysed the moral condition of his subjects by keeping an eye on their ostentatious or squalid housekeeping. In 1853 in Holman Hunt's The Awakening Conscience, a kept woman rebels against the shame of confinement in a suburban villa; for the sake of verisimilitude, the painter took over a 'maison de convenance' in St John's Wood as his studio. Tracey Emin may intend to shock us by embroidering a tent with the tawdry list of her sexual conquests or publicising her unmade bed, which doubles as an ash tray. If you remember the traditional domesticity of British art, nothing could be more boringly conservative.</p> <p>A domesticated art requires house-trained pets. Samuel Johnson made a profound comment on the priorities of British art - and on the downright, steadfastly lowbrow posture of British character - when he said 'I had rather see the portrait of a dog I know than all the allegories you can show me'. Dogs are omnipresent in all periods of British painting. A gun dog noses a dead rabbit, part of the squire's catch in William Dobson's portrait of Endymion Porter, painted in the 1640s, and in 1725 a blue-blooded, elegantly emaciated greyhound could well be a relative of the patricians in Philip Mercier's Schutz Family. The pug in Hogarth's 1745 self-portrait advertises the pugnacity of its master.</p> <p>In Victorian paintings, dogs acquire human emotions and lachrymose eyes. Eventually they outgrow their status as companions and qualify as subjects in their own right, like Cedric Morris's Belle of Bloomsbury, painted in 1948. No, Belle is not some Virginia Woolf wannabe. She is a bull terrier bitch with droopy pink dugs and a supercilious gaze - every bit as erotically self-possessed as a courtesan by Goya or an Ingres odalisque.</p> <p>Though the canon is overwhelmingly canine, British art does contain one unforgettable cat. Its name (allegedly) is Percy, and it sits in Ossie Clark's lap, digging its nails into his groin with characteristic feline arrogance, in Hockney's 1971 conversation piece Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy. Acting on an aesthetic whim, Hockney changed the cat's name and sex: it was actually called Blanche. But the creature ignores all such human designs on it by turning away to gaze out the window. Despite this disdain, I would sooner converse with Percy than with the fatuous, fashionable Clarks. In due course Hockney transferred his affection from cats to dogs, and during the Nineties he made multiple portraits of his dachshunds, as gregarious and yappingly loquacious as their owner.</p> <p>There are heroic figures in British art, but they are not conquerors like David's Napoleon, rearing on his mount as he crosses the Alps. In fact they are generally not even human. In Britain, an epic hero is likely to have antlers: look at the stoical, beleaguered stags painted by Edwin Landseer. George Stubbs's horses are nobler and more valiant - especially when savaged by lions - than any military eminence who might hoist himself on to their backs.</p> <p>Heroes have vertical ambitions. British artists have always preferred horizontal bodies, like the pensive Sir Brooke Boothby who uses a riverbank as his chaise longue in Joseph Wright of Derby's portrait, painted in 1781. The pre-Raphaelite Ophelia of John Everett Millais gently reclines on her watery bier; Henry Moore's reclining women share their fecundity with the terrain from which their alabaster bodies have been carved.</p> <p>More often than not, these figures lolling in the landscape have nodded off. In 1793, Henry Fuseli painted The Shepherd's Dream, visualising a metaphor from Milton's Paradise Lost: the shepherd's unconscious mind has conjured up a pagan orgy of maenadic fairies. The mad Richard Dadd, who murdered his father, painted an even more alarming wonderland or underworld in The Fairy-Feller's Master-Stroke, which he worked on obsessively between 1855 and 1864. In a thicket of dry grass, littered with prickly nuts, dwarfish gnomes and saturnine elves cavort, their sinister revels supervised by Oberon and Titania from A Midsummer Night's Dream. The Dreamer in Landscape sketched by John Craxton in 1942 dozes among the stalks, pods and thrusting tendrils of a riotously overgrown nature.</p> <p>What are all these slumbrous characters dreaming about? They have a shared reverie, which is the recurring refrain of British art. Their unleashed imaginations make pictures of a paradise lost, or a lost childhood (which is the same thing). Hockney's A Bigger Splash shows the precise instant when the bland peace of Eden is disrupted, marred by that explosion on the surface of the swimming pool; Peter Blake's Toy Shop leads the way back to innocence with its window display of harmless targets, miniature fighter planes, tiny trains - and of course a painter's palette and a bristling set of paintbrushes. Artists, who are wiser and also more unguardedly naive than the rest of us, continue to believe that we can locate the door in the wall which will open on to a secret garden, where unfallen Eden is preserved.</p> <p>Ruskin, with his usual mad literalness, thought that his Guild of St George could reconstruct Jerusalem, and pledged to make 'some small piece of English ground, beautiful, peaceful and fruitful'. Derek Jarman had more success in persuading the vision to take root and grow when he planted his resilient garden of herbs and wild flowers in pebbly soil on the coast at Dungeness. Ruskin vowed to banish railways from his utopian allotment; Jarman, resigned to grim actuality, laid out his garden next to the fuming towers of a nuclear power station.</p> <p>At best we live in what Shakespeare's John of Gaunt half-heartedly calls a 'demi-paradise'. Even so, artists still tenderly keep the myth alive. Whether or not political federation happens, these islands will remain imaginatively offshore, unabsorbed by the continent. From the beginning of its history to the end, British art has always been dottily and incorrigibly romantic. The British pretend to be pragmatists, anchored by their empiricism. Art confirms a very different truth: this is a country of visionaries, fantasists and idiosyncratic zanies. No wonder Shakespeare sent Hamlet from Denmark to England - for there, to expand the comment of a sagacious clown, all the men (or at least all the artists) are as wickedly funny and as lyrically lunatic as he is.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Politically and commercially, 'British' has become a dubious or dirty word. The union which comprises Great Britain is fraying; in advance of its collapse, corporations already treat Britishness as a self-love which no longer dares to speak its name. British Airways briefly banned the flag from its tail fins, while British Petroleum and British Telecom cover their embarrassment by using only initials. All well and good, since the idea of Britain was never much more than a governmental fiction, serving to cover the family quarrels between four different nations. In art, however, Britishness can still safely be celebrated. Modernism internationalised art, eliminating differences between Europe's separate schools. Britain, luckily, resisted the modern revolution in painting, and remained true to its own quirky national tradition. When Nikolaus Pevsner delivered the 1955 Reith lectures on 'The Englishness of English Art', he dolefully concluded that 'England has no Michelangelo, no Rembrandt, nor a D\u00fcrer or Gr\u00fcnewald, a Greco or Velasquez'. He was only half right. We do possess such gods, but not in the visual arts: our British Michelangelo is Milton, and we have our own Rembrandt in the person of Shakespeare, while Dickens might be our Gr\u00fcnewald. British painters may not have painted cosmological ceilings like Michelangelo or fiercely exalted altar-pieces like Greco. Their achievements are less supernatural, but for that reason all the more comprehensible and lovable. They ignore angels in favour of domestic pets; instead of witchy divinities like the Mona Lisa, they study people who are as resolutely individualistic as Britain itself - Hogarth's Shrimp Girl or the equine country ladies of Gainsborough, Stanley Spencer's Patricia Preece with her sagging boobs or David Hockney's weary, worn, yet somehow beatific mother. Classical art revered the ideal, a statuesque, platonically perfect improvement of the actual human form. Renaissance art emphasised the sanctity of the image: in the work of Giotto or Mantegna, the invisible face of the deity materialises before our eyes, as if on the Turin shroud. British art has always defied the precepts of both classical Greece and Renaissance Italy. Hogarth argued that the 'line of beauty' was irregular, rampantly energetic, lacking the poise and rectitude valued by classical design. The Victorian painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema tried to imagine Olympus, but his bathing nymphs have waxy flesh, and look as if they are taking part in an antique advertising campaign for cosmetics. British art is earthy, worldly, and has scant respect for sanctity. In Constable's Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows, that yearningly vertical spire is grounded by a team of muddy horses mired in a pond in the foreground, just as in Turner's Ploughing Up Turnips, Near Windsor, the hazy outline of the castle is upstaged by the peasants with their grubby piles of vegetables. Our indigenous saints and martyrs never manage to lift off from the soil in which turnips are grown. In Stanley Spencer's St Francis and the Birds, painted in 1935, the pantheistic saint is a fat man in dressing gown and slippers, preaching to a rowdy congregation of barnyard fowls. Francis Bacon's career began in 1944 with an attempt to portray the crucifixion. But, characteristically, he saw the sadistic tableau from below, studying some twisted, screeching figures at the foot of the cross (and modelling their stricken mouths on some illustrations of oral diseases he found in a medical text book). Ruskin hoped to establish a more respectable lineage for British art, which ought - he believed - to promote 'the chief worship which lay in the nation's heart'. 'In Athens,' he said, 'we have the triumph of Pallas; and in Venice, the Assumption of the Virgin.' He looked to Turner, born on St George's Day, to perform the local version of such miracles by slaying the dragon, which for Ruskin symbolised the mercenariness of philistine Britain. But Turner declined to fulfil the prophecy, and Ruskin sadly acknowledged that 'here in England, our great spiritual fact is the Assumption of the Dragon'. He should not have been dismayed. Turner's insular originality enabled him to paint a god of a new kind - the dynamo of industrial locomotion, the creative and destructive force which agitates nature in Rain, Steam, and Speed. British art rejects the luminous pallor of the classical statue, or the gilded heaven of the Byzantine icon. Its tones tend to be murky, smudged and leaden like the overcast skies favoured by Constable. British artists are virtuosi of bad weather, from Turner's blizzards to Howard Hodgkin's Rain, in which inky clouds and the drenching squalls they disgorge cause the dry, solid world to deliquesce. Rather than smoothing flesh into marble or refining it into the spirit's semi-transparent envelope, our painters emphasise the ruddy, meaty physicality of the world. A tradition extends from bleeding sirloin in Hogarth's Roast Beef of Old England to the cattle hacked into sections by Damien Hirst, or from the pustules in Blake's sketch of Satan Smiting Job with Boils to the soiled sheets aired by Tracey Emin in last year's Turner Prize show. Dickens likened the narrative of Oliver Twist, which mingles sentimentality and grotesquerie, to the layers of 'streaky bacon'; Shakespeare's double plots alternate in the same way between tragedy and comedy, anguish and folly. Joshua Reynolds painted a great Shakespearean actor hesitating between the solemn exhortations of the tragic muse and the wanton enticements of her comic sister. Garrick's uncertainty, in this portrait painted in 1760-1, catches the mixed motives of British art, which attempts to balance what Matthew Arnold called 'high seriousness' with a more instinctive, barbaric low humour. The earliest native craftsmen, during the Roman occupation, changed the faces they carved: classic heads were given bug eyes, elongated jaws, or nastily thinned lips. Gargoyles with toothache grimace on the rooftops of medieval churches. By the eighteenth century, caricaturists like Thomas Rowlandson practised a physiognomic black magic, outraging the edicts of classical humanism as they showed men regressing to beasts. Another unbroken continuity extends from James Gillray's John Bull in 1798 - a piggish guzzler, feeding his belly with frigates - to the latex ogres of Spitting Image: Roy Hattersley with his incontinent spitting and spluttering, grey John Major, and the blowsy, tipsy royal dowagers. But the British version does not merely relish the ugliness and abasement of Shakespeare's 'bared forked animal'. It corrects classical and Renaissance theories of beauty and acclimatises them to these eccentric islands by finding treasure in dross, or splendour - as Wordsworth put it - in the humble, downtrodden grass. Constable declared that he loved 'old rotten planks, slimy posts' and decayed brickwork, and envied Shakespeare's capacity to 'make everything poetical', even the bedraggled sheep-cotes and creaky mills frequented by Poor Tom, the mad mendicant in King Lear. The point was repeated in the twentieth century by Algernon Newton, who believed that 'a gasometer can make as beautiful a picture as the Grand Canal'. The canals so lovingly painted by Newton were far from grand: they are the neglected industrial conduits of suburban London - sunken, secretive, moodily desolate.

If I could pass legislation I would make it legal for any school to select its pupils on the basis of ability provided the school could show its selection procedure had a sound scientific basis. This would involve proving that the pre-First World War theory on which it is based is true and that supporters can demonstrate what human intelligence is, as well as measure it. They would also have to explain why the 11-plus got it wrong about millions of people. David Smith London E10 \u0095 Blunkett would have us believe that what many people interpreted as a pledge regarding selective education was really no more than a bit of fun? The joke is lost on this former member of the Labour Party. God knows how much fun the other parties will have at New Labour's expense in the run-up to the next general election. Good luck to them.

      "body": "<b>10.20am </b>I go down a little street off the Cambridge Heath Road in Hackney and get buzzed in a square grey door. Big black letters spell out 21 Herald Street. Tiny letters over the buzzer spell out Interim Art. Outside it's all charming and working-class picturesque. Next door is the Built On The Rock evangelist church, with its slogan: 'God is too big to fail and too strong to let you down.' Inside the Interim Art gallery, all is gleaming. <p>Maureen Paley is the perfect dealer or gallerist of now. Perfect for the job. It's a weird job. You have to behave in an unreal way. Already, at 10 in the morning, she's hard at work being unreal. I've known her for 20 years, ever since she first came to London from New York. The way I cope with the act is to compliment her on it. 'Wow, this space is good!' 'Yes I think of it as my Dia Foundation! Don't you love it?' </p> <p>I do! At least for now! At other times I might feel there has to be some kind of human resistance to the rising tide of these weirdo perfect gallerist types, the Jay Joplings and so on. In fact, I start to think about his second space about to open in Hoxton Square, with a little '2' next to the 'White Cube'. Can't he see the '2' is redundant and it makes the whole gag redundant? </p> <p>But now isn't the time for hostility. I can see Maureen is riding high, with her thick black hair pulled back tight, her red lipstick, white face, gold flower-shaped ear rings, all-black outfit, new black shoes and black fluffy trim down her black cardigan. She tours me round the place and I marvel at the sights. She designed the gallery herself, with its lovely chrome toilet area, magnificent office, good storage and luxurious showing space. </p> <p>She says she still lives in her house in Beck Road, half a mile away, where the old Interim Art used to be. She started it in the early Eighties. She originally got the house from the subsidised artists' space organisation Acme. We smile at the memory of the old ethos of Acme. Cold, lonely, subsidised artists' spaces were the rule. </p> <p>She says it was a more socialist era, adding quickly that she loves that. 'Oh yes, me too!' I say. 'Now I suppose it's more a style era?' I venture. 'Yes!' she says. </p> <p>She doesn't just think toward a single point nowadays. There was a time when single-point thinking was right. But now it's all-round thinking, or all-over or something. I nod and frown and absolutely agree, inwardly wondering what we're talking about while outwardly keeping the stylish leaning and swaying and gesturing going, for the benefit of Tony, The Observer's photographer, who is clicking away, revving us up to great feats of intellectual posing. </p> <p>Two young assistants - their combined ages would add up to the age that Maureen and I both are - rustle papers in the background. The phone rings. Maureen takes the call and immediately goes into a slightly different accent. 'I will speak with Wolfgang,' she says in an unmistakable German way yet without using any actual German. 'I know of your collection. We will send a presentation.' </p> <p>In a few hours she's going to be on her way to New York for the city's annual international art fair. It's called The Armory Show, an ironic reference to the real venue of the exhibition in 1917, where Marcel Duchamp first exhibited a real urinal. Art fairs - like car fairs or yacht fairs, basically trade fairs - are for contacts, not just for selling, I learn. There's ambassadorial work to be done, fronting the gallery, but the main thing is meeting up with like-minded colleagues from abroad. 'It's like insider information - people telling you about things before the news has broken.' </p> <p>I imagine the drift of the information exchange: how is the backlash against young British artists going? Is it real or only an intellectual pose? A pose of course! Although at the same time everybody knows who the good YBAs are: the ones Maureen and the unrealist colleagues have signed up! Of course the actual conversation would be much more difficult to understand, more serious, more multilingual. </p> <p><b>11.05am </b>The light falls in Rachel Whiteread's studio off the Kingsland Road, between Dalston and Shoreditch, in beautiful dusty diagonal rays. Assistants work on big plaster things and carry equipment around. On a surface in the corner of one space are piles of remaindered hardback books. Unusually for an artist's studio, they look like books somebody might read, the novel Gorky Park for example. In fact they're for casting. When they've been used for bookshelf sculptures they're so ridden with concrete or plaster or gel or other bits of matter they can't be re-cycled and they have to be thrown away. </p> <p>Today, Rachel is working on a secret public art commission. She hasn't officially submitted it yet so she can't talk about it. She agrees to do a bit of filing on some plaster casts of the backs of human heads so Tony can photograph her at work. She seems unused to the activity and holds the file half-heartedly. Maybe it's already filed enough. </p> <p>But also, I suppose, filing and sanding and so on is probably more the kind of work her assistants are paid to do. A lot of her work is planning more than sanding - behind the scenes work; working out how to get a very clear, apparently simple sculptural idea not to crack or sag or fall down or turn an unpleasant colour. She has to commission special firms to come up with new types of resin, new mixes for concrete - technical things that have never been done before. </p> <p>I notice the heads are a bit like something I've seen in a Dali painting. This gives her pain. She tries to avoid thinking about him, she says. 'Ha ha! I know what you mean!' I say. I'm full of goodwill, having decided on the way here that I'm on her side. I used to be against her art because of its aesthetic of cool designer minimalist elegance. Now I feel that kind of thing is a relief rather than an annoyance. I used to feel uncomfortable with the pretentious death rhetoric that automatically goes with any art critical mention of her art. But after all, it's not her fault what art writers say. She's only done one piece that was directly about death, she says, a work about her father. </p> <p>She's already designed her Trafalgar Square plinth on a plinth - a transparent resin version of the existing stone plinth, which will stand upside down on the real thing. I look at computer-generated slides of it with her now. I find it looks good. I feel much better liking it than not liking it. </p> <p>She says she's finding the new secret project quite hard. She had to give a slide presentation the other day to the commissioners, offering examples of good public art and bad public art. </p> <p>'Oh, what were they?' The good example was the Vietnam memorial in Washington. I agree that no one could complain about that. I imagine she would be reluctant to say what the bad example was, probably something like Bill Woodrow's bronze sculpture of a writhing tree growing out of a head rising out of the ground that's due to go up on the Trafalgar Square plinth before her one. </p> <p>But in fact it's a holocaust memorial in Austria. The memorial has a lot of stone figures of wailing victims and another victim kneeling on the ground scrubbing the streets. Apparently the kneeling figure was so often and so completely defaced by graffiti that the city council had it covered in barbed wire, which made for a rather unfortunate image. </p> <p>Her own holocaust memorial in Vienna is presently surrounded by wooden planks and will be un-planked in October. </p> <p>She says she found the whole Vienna experience harrowing and frightening. She explains that it's all quite complicated because some of the fiercest opposition has come from the Jewish community, who'd much rather have more wailing figures than the huge inside-out library that Whiteread has designed. </p> <p>This monumental work is ingenious, with smaller sections of library housed within the hollow structure, ready to be installed on the outside if any of the outside sections are too badly defaced by hostile graffiti-ists. She's had endless rows with the city. One of them was over air bubbles. An uneven surface is part of the aesthetic but the city wanted a surface that would be less expensive to clean. </p> <p>'What do you think about Gilbert &amp; George leaving your gallery?' I ask. Her gallery is Anthony d'Offay. I feel sure she won't want to be thought of as a gossip but in fact she laughs and says they probably wanted to go somewhere sexier like White Cube. </p> <p><b>1.10pm</b> Horrible foetuses in jars are lined up in rows on shelves at the Royal College of Surgeons in Lincoln's Inn Fields. One is a big overweight thing with wrinkled fingers. The horrors go on endlessly. There's a real skull with another one grown out the top. Apparently it was an Indian child who died from a cobra bite. Before that, the eyes in the top head had functioned as well as the ones in the bottom head. </p> <p>Jenny Saville, the painter, walks up the long rows, explaining the sights. She's been coming here for years for inspiration, as long as she's been a painter. It's part of her work. I don't really believe her obsession, and find it depressing. But I don't feel strongly about it, she can do what she likes, I think. </p> <p>'Why do you paint like Lucian Freud?' I ask. She says she doesn't any more. It's de Kooning she likes now. She likes the slipperiness of his surfaces. It's a look she's trying to get in her own work. </p> <p>Next month, her wall-length painting of naked women lying squashed together, making an impression of several pale women fused into one fleshy thing, will go up at the Saatchi gallery as part of the Ant Noises show, Saatchi's anagrammatic follow-up to Sensation. She shows me the nineteenth century foetuses fused in a row that inspired the arrangement. </p> <p>This is the first time I've met her. Because her painted women are enormous I imagined she would be too but in fact she's the opposite. Recently she had a sell-out show at Larry Gagosian in New York, a gallery even more powerful and sexy than White Cube. Gagosian sold her painting of Della Grace for over a hundred thousand pounds to the collector S. I. Newhouse, the publisher, who now has it in his house between a Warhol Marilyn and Jeff Koons's Eighties stainless steel cast of an inflatable bunny rabbit. </p> <p>The painting is huge, it shows in graphic painterly detail the sex-change stuff Della Grace has had done over the years, including a recent operation to have her clitoris built out so it projects like small penis. </p> <p>'What's she like?' I ask, grateful to be outside in the fresh air on the college steps. 'He,' she corrects me. But after a bit of a lecture about gender terrorism she gets going on the subject of Della Grace's character, which she admires, and soon lapses into unselfconscious 'her's and 'she's. It was a confrontation at first, she admits, the sight of Del's hairy buttocks and chest. But she's fascinated by cosmetic surgery. When the breasts come off at Del's next op, she's going to paint another portrait. I'm not sure I can bear any more of it. </p> <p>She says she thinks outrageous cosmetic surgery is the future. She's attended quite a few ops as an observer. She asks if I'd ever consider surgery. I say no, false teeth is enough - would she? No, she says, she's heard the kinds of comments the surgeons make in cosmetic surgery ops. What, do they go 'phwoar'? 'Yeah!' she says. </p> <p><b>3.17pm</b> I race out of Holborn in my Golf, calling ahead on my mobile to the Delfina Art Trust to let the director know we'll be too late for lunch. I sense Tony (who comes from Baja in California, and is an experienced driver as well as a very good portrait photographer) beside me, cowering and wincing and attempting to combine the two expressions with mimed apologies to pedestrians as I ride over sections of pavement. </p> <p><b>3.45pm</b> The Delfina, in Bermondsey Street, near Tower Bridge, is a magnificent example of the new era's art values. It's a top restaurant that takes all major credit cards, with a gallery attached and a lot of artist's studios. The artists are from Britain and the rest of the world. They have to apply to come here. They can stay for two years for no rent, or for a little rent if they are rich. </p> <p>The set-up is exclusive in that only artists who know where art is at or who are fancied by the Delfina applications board to know where it's at, will ever get on to the programme. But after that, it's admirably free. The artists all go to each other's studios; they meet at lunch where critics and curators drop by and there's an atmosphere of friendly open chat about how to get shows; or, I should say, serious discourse about the issues. </p> <p>The Delfina restaurant, one of the best in London, has works on display by some of the art stars who have passed through. There is a drawing of Leonardo DiCaprio by Karen Kilimnik and a wall-size photo by Wim Delvoye of a mountain beside a city. Carved into the side of the mountain in mighty capitals is the legend: 'MUM THE KEYS ARE YOU KNOW WHERE.' </p> <p>Glancing at this marvel of expensive digitally altered contemporary art noodling, I head for the receptionist in front of the gallery space. She calls up the director David Gilmour on the phone and he quickly appears to greet me. He takes me off to meet Urs Fischer, an enormous German with a densely tattooed left arm, who is hard at work making exact facsimiles of his studio walls which will be shipped off soon to an important exhibition in Ghent. 'Fantastic, Urs!' I say. </p> <p>Then Urs joins David and me and another German artist for a visit to Keith Tyson's studio over the road at The Tannery, a former warehouse, now a studio complex, and Tony photographs another artist, Gary Webb, assisting Keith on the making of a humorous sculpture. Keith, a big, friendly 30-something, is one of the Delfina board, along with installation artist Anya Gallacio. I know his name but I have never seen his work before. I immediately recognise it as, well, bullshit. But he is energetic and his bullshit has energy too. </p> <p>'Ha ha it's great!' I say, looking around at his blackboard scribbles, or texts, soon to be shipped off to the same exhibition in Ghent that Urs is going to be at, which it turns out is organised by top international curator Jan Hoet. While Keith explains that some of the texts on the blackboard installation are a self-invented language and the whole ensemble relates to the notion of mapping, I find myself thinking I'd like to have a studio at Delfina. I like the atmosphere of easy give-and-take, of creative people saying what they feel. I make a mental note to apply very soon to Keith for admission. </p> <p><b>4.10pm </b>Although Tony was feeling much better after photographing Keith and the picturesque, atmospheric bustle of the Delfina scenario, I can tell his whole mood has dropped right down again now we've got to Dot, a little gallery in Teesdale Yard near Shoreditch. For one thing he can't tell what makes it a gallery and I can't really explain it. Maybe it isn't one. It's run by the artist Elizabeth Price. Her project here is to archive material that artists have been invited to send in over the course of a year. </p> <p>'What kind of material?' I ask. Anything they like, it turns out. To the naked eye it seems to be abject or idiotic material. Jigsaw puzzles from junk shops brought round by Matthew Thomson, whose practice as an artist is to assemble the puzzles. A box of notes by Margarita Gluzberg; the notes are just scraps but the box has been specially made by a professional box maker. It says 'Important Thoughts of Margarita Gluzberg' on the lid. And junk mail from the Czech artist Pavel Buchler, each unopened envelope stamped with his name. </p> <p>Dot is in a former workshop. The surrounding streets seem genuinely poor, the council blocks genuinely run-down. There are no restaurants anywhere. Elizabeth takes us out into the yard where she fly-posts a poster by Bank, the artists' collective. One of them, Millie Thomson, is out here with us, drinking tea. More archivists mill. Everyone is talkative. It's a post-Sensation contemporary art situation - words, thoughts, tea and talk, instead of expensive consumer objects. </p> <p>The posters are agitprop parodies in resonant but non-existent European languages. One shows a cartoon of a little man shrugging gormlessly. The words read: 'Redical nonnnsplus SPEKKEN'. Another one says: 'Non-dialektic nilder'. </p> <p><b>4.45pm </b>I phone ahead to Gilbert &amp; George to apologize for missing tea time. 'Good morning,' a recorded voice says. 'You have telephoned the answer machine of George and Gilbert.' Then it explains that they're out and they'll get back to whoever's calling when it's convenient. 'Leave a brief message. Goodbye. And good riddance.' Then George picks up and cheerfully asks if everything's OK. 'Don't worry at all,' he says when I start to talk. 'We've got nothing better to do than to wait for you!' </p> <p><b>5.00pm</b> I arrive at the famous Fournier Street location, off Brick Lane, and they're at the door in their light brown suits, each with a gleaming new tie with a minty-coloured abstract pattern. They get differently patterned ones sent over free throughout the year by an admirer in Europe. 'A maniac!' they say. 'We like him very much.' </p> <p>Tony, quite nervous again, follows me following them down the hall and into the wood-panelled front room. This is the first time I've noticed a painting of Jesus on their wall. 'It was always there,' they say. In fact, on this visit I notice the presence of the Lord everywhere. His portrait in their front room, in an unusual pink robe, was bought at an auction and is thought to be by Palmer. They've got a kind of stone Christian drinking fountain in the little garden between their house and studio, with a touching carved inscription on it, welcoming those who are thirsty to come and drink. </p> <p>In the studio, there's not much sign of labour because they've just finished a big project, recently shipped off to Bonn - a giant photo-work commemorating the end of the Millennium. A version for their files, in watercolour, still taped to the wall, has notes in the margins recording shutter speeds. Every bit of street graffiti they've incorporated into the image is pencilled-in. Gilbert laughs at the obscenities on park benches - 'They want to spoil everything that's provided for them!' They're very polite. They make tea and bring out champagne and chat to Tony about life in London compared to Baja. </p> <p>We try photographing them against a projection of a photo of their own spit but it's too dark. Then we use their own powerful studio lights to light a shot of them draped on their enlarger, which looks like something industrial or even military, maybe First World War, with its khaki colouring. I look at their photos of pieces of insect wing shot with a microscope lens. ('Mosquitoes have killed more people than all the totalitarian dictators put together - more than Stalin! And do you know, they're all women!') </p> <p>'Why did you leave d'Offay,' I ask, not expecting a totally forthright answer, knowing how guarded the art world is about professional things. 'Because he's a cunt,' they laugh. 'He only likes the world's most expensive artists,' Gilbert says. 'And that's not us!' But they won't say where they're going, if it's sexy White Cube or sexy Gagosian (who's about to open a space in London.) </p> <p>George sees us out. The evening shadows are drawing in. The little yard with its Pugin bench and Arts and Crafts objects is charming and calm. They're great aesthetes. They know all about Pugin and Eastlake and William Burgess and William de Morgan. There are atmospheric creepers and trellises, and views either side of more of the same in intricate silhouette patterns. George points at the sky - 'Rather beautiful peach coloured clouds,' he says, and so they are. </p> <p>In the hall he hands out gifts. 'Have you got a word processor, Tony?' he asks. 'Yes.' 'Here's a Gilbert &amp; George mouse mat.' Because I know they walk everywhere I ask if they'd ever get a train out to the countryside and go for a walk. 'Are you mad!' They love the beauty of nature but they don't like the bigotry out there. They prefer to take their chances in the urban melting pot. They only go to the country once a year to stay in the Norfolk (or somewhere) holiday home of top German curator Rudi Fuchs, to show loyalty. 'Good morning!' they once said to a young couple with a pram outside a lovely church near his house. 'Fuck off you weird looking prats!' came the reply. </p> <p><b>7.30pm</b> Now it's the evening, the time everyone in the art world goes to private views to unwind. I walk through the darkness of Northburgh Street, off Goswell Road, in Clerkenwell, with my partner, Emma Biggs, an intellectual and a staggering beauty who runs a world wide mosaic company in Holloway Road. With us are two of her children, Peter and Claudine. We approach an anonymous-looking brick rectangle; perhaps not so much anonymous as kind of community hall or scout hut. It's the Cabinet Gallery, recently relocated here from Brixton. Inside I have no difficulty recognising the art works. They are the things dotted around the place or hanging from the ceiling. </p> <p>I introduce my little family to Tony who has already been here for some time arranging his lights. After we've looked about, admiring a mirror thing, a cork tile thing and a straggly unwound cassette tape thing, he sets us up near a yellow thing and we wait for people to come and talk to us. </p> <p>The first one is one of the two Cabinet directors, Andrew Wheatley. He admires his own floor colour, a warm pale khaki grey. 'No artist is going to repaint this floor!' he says. We get on to Cabinet's first ever exhibition which was called To Hell. It was their abjection phase. We're quite a long way into the discussion before I realise he's not talking about Mike Kelley, one of the international kings of abjection in art in the Nineties, but Mary Kelly, a feminist artist of the Seventies. I'm just trying to get used to the idea of Mary Kelly's make-over by Cabinet, from boring to interesting, when it turns out he means Mary Kelly, the nineteenth century murderee, one of Jack the Ripper's victims. </p> <p>Peter is complaining that the art is crap. 'Oh no,' I say, 'It's good. It's minimalist. Look, this one's all diamonds.' It's a 3-D diamond shape made of painted card on a kind of bird table. 'It's a functionalist aesthetic,' Emma corrects me, 'Not a minimalist one.' 'Yeah, functionalist,' I say. 'And this one's like cubism! Those checkered diamond shapes are like the patterns in cubism!' Peter insists it's still dull. 'I didn't say it wasn't dull, just not crap.' Then an artist comes up and says it is crap. </p> <p>I make my way to another part of the gallery to say hello to Matthew Higgs, one of the curators of The British Art Show, which starts touring the country in April. He's sitting at a white table with computers and beer bottles and catalogues on it, reading the Masculin/Feminin catalogue he just brought back from the Pompidou Centre today. It's an exhibition about sexuality and theory. Paul Noble, one of the most successful artists at Maureen Paley's Interim Art, widely tipped to be nominated for the Turner Prize this year, is looking over his shoulder. 'Awesome!' he's saying, 'She's holding his knob!' I try to interest Claudine in the negative diamond shapes in a metal security grill over one of the windows. </p> <p>As the time-honoured strategy at private views is to stand still and wait for someone to come up to you, so no one will think you haven't got any friends, nobody is moving much. Emma gets into a conversation with the artists' collective, Bank. They're known as a collective but in fact there's only two left now. 'The first one that went was only marginal anyway,' Simon Bedwell, one of the remaining pair, says. 'What about the other one?' 'Well you'll have to ask Millie about him.' But when Millie (who I saw earlier today at Dot) joins in, we're already onto the subject of some books they are reviewing for a special edition of Modern Painters which I'm editing. </p> <p>'How are the reviews coming on?' I ask. They say they've been reviewing them aesthetically. One by Julian Stallabras, the Courtauld Institute lecturer, has a curious transparent pink colour on the cover, they've noticed. And one by the art historian T.J. Clark - a cri de coeur about the age of disillusionment after the demise of modernism - has a pronounced coffee table aesthetic. They say when it comes to painting both writers seem to be desperately reaching for their cravats and pipes. Then Millie says another book they're reviewing, by Picasso's biographer, John Richardson, about the art collector Douglas Cooper, makes them out to be a right pair of poshies poshing around Europe. And it makes Picasso out to be a miserable git. We enjoy ourselves in this way a bit more and then get leave from Tony to be off. </p> <p>At Granita restaurant in Islington, later on, Emma's oldest son, Luke, joins us. A precocious gourmet, Luke admires the sauce on his quail: 'I say, isn't that juniper berries!' He is scratching the scab shape on the back of his hand, an upside-down cross, to keep up with his Satanist classmates at his expensive public school opposite the new Tate Gallery at Bankside. Emma says she enjoyed talking to Bank, but was aware of the strain of agreeing all the time and also of the loudness of her own voice and posh accent. As I'm laughing and trying not to notice Luke's festering symbol the mobile goes and it's Tony to say he thinks he may have knocked the mirror thing over. </p> <p>\u0095 Matthew Collings is the author and presenter of Channel Four's This is Modern Art.</p>",

There's ambassadorial work to be done, fronting the gallery, but the main thing is meeting up with like-minded colleagues from abroad. 'It's like insider information - people telling you about things before the news has broken.' I imagine the drift of the information exchange: how is the backlash against young British artists going? Is it real or only an intellectual pose? A pose of course! Although at the same time everybody knows who the good YBAs are: the ones Maureen and the unrealist colleagues have signed up! Of course the actual conversation would be much more difficult to understand, more serious, more multilingual. 11.05am The light falls in Rachel Whiteread's studio off the Kingsland Road, between Dalston and Shoreditch, in beautiful dusty diagonal rays. Assistants work on big plaster things and carry equipment around. On a surface in the corner of one space are piles of remaindered hardback books. Unusually for an artist's studio, they look like books somebody might read, the novel Gorky Park for example. In fact they're for casting. When they've been used for bookshelf sculptures they're so ridden with concrete or plaster or gel or other bits of matter they can't be re-cycled and they have to be thrown away. Today, Rachel is working on a secret public art commission. She hasn't officially submitted it yet so she can't talk about it. She agrees to do a bit of filing on some plaster casts of the backs of human heads so Tony can photograph her at work. She seems unused to the activity and holds the file half-heartedly. Maybe it's already filed enough. But also, I suppose, filing and sanding and so on is probably more the kind of work her assistants are paid to do. A lot of her work is planning more than sanding - behind the scenes work; working out how to get a very clear, apparently simple sculptural idea not to crack or sag or fall down or turn an unpleasant colour. She has to commission special firms to come up with new types of resin, new mixes for concrete - technical things that have never been done before. I notice the heads are a bit like something I've seen in a Dali painting. This gives her pain. She tries to avoid thinking about him, she says. 'Ha ha! I know what you mean!' I say. I'm full of goodwill, having decided on the way here that I'm on her side. I used to be against her art because of its aesthetic of cool designer minimalist elegance. Now I feel that kind of thing is a relief rather than an annoyance. I used to feel uncomfortable with the pretentious death rhetoric that automatically goes with any art critical mention of her art. But after all, it's not her fault what art writers say. She's only done one piece that was directly about death, she says, a work about her father. She's already designed her Trafalgar Square plinth on a plinth - a transparent resin version of the existing stone plinth, which will stand upside down on the real thing. I look at computer-generated slides of it with her now. I find it looks good. I feel much better liking it than not liking it. She says she's finding the new secret project quite hard. She had to give a slide presentation the other day to the commissioners, offering examples of good public art and bad public art. 'Oh, what were they?' The good example was the Vietnam memorial in Washington. I agree that no one could complain about that. I imagine she would be reluctant to say what the bad example was, probably something like Bill Woodrow's bronze sculpture of a writhing tree growing out of a head rising out of the ground that's due to go up on the Trafalgar Square plinth before her one. But in fact it's a holocaust memorial in Austria. The memorial has a lot of stone figures of wailing victims and another victim kneeling on the ground scrubbing the streets. Apparently the kneeling figure was so often and so completely defaced by graffiti that the city council had it covered in barbed wire, which made for a rather unfortunate image. Her own holocaust memorial in Vienna is presently surrounded by wooden planks and will be un-planked in October. She says she found the whole Vienna experience harrowing and frightening. She explains that it's all quite complicated because some of the fiercest opposition has come from the Jewish community, who'd much rather have more wailing figures than the huge inside-out library that Whiteread has designed. This monumental work is ingenious, with smaller sections of library housed within the hollow structure, ready to be installed on the outside if any of the outside sections are too badly defaced by hostile graffiti-ists. She's had endless rows with the city. One of them was over air bubbles. An uneven surface is part of the aesthetic but the city wanted a surface that would be less expensive to clean. 'What do you think about Gilbert &amp; George leaving your gallery?' I ask. Her gallery is Anthony d'Offay. I feel sure she won't want to be thought of as a gossip but in fact she laughs and says they probably wanted to go somewhere sexier like White Cube. 1.10pm Horrible foetuses in jars are lined up in rows on shelves at the Royal College of Surgeons in Lincoln's Inn Fields. One is a big overweight thing with wrinkled fingers. The horrors go on endlessly. There's a real skull with another one grown out the top. Apparently it was an Indian child who died from a cobra bite. Before that, the eyes in the top head had functioned as well as the ones in the bottom head. Jenny Saville, the painter, walks up the long rows, explaining the sights. She's been coming here for years for inspiration, as long as she's been a painter. It's part of her work. I don't really believe her obsession, and find it depressing. But I don't feel strongly about it, she can do what she likes, I think. 'Why do you paint like Lucian Freud?' I ask. She says she doesn't any more. It's de Kooning she likes now. She likes the slipperiness of his surfaces. It's a look she's trying to get in her own work. Next month, her wall-length painting of naked women lying squashed together, making an impression of several pale women fused into one fleshy thing, will go up at the Saatchi gallery as part of the Ant Noises show, Saatchi's anagrammatic follow-up to Sensation. She shows me the nineteenth century foetuses fused in a row that inspired the arrangement. This is the first time I've met her. Because her painted women are enormous I imagined she would be too but in fact she's the opposite. Recently she had a sell-out show at Larry Gagosian in New York, a gallery even more powerful and sexy than White Cube. Gagosian sold her painting of Della Grace for over a hundred thousand pounds to the collector S. I. Newhouse, the publisher, who now has it in his house between a Warhol Marilyn and Jeff Koons's Eighties stainless steel cast of an inflatable bunny rabbit. The painting is huge, it shows in graphic painterly detail the sex-change stuff Della Grace has had done over the years, including a recent operation to have her clitoris built out so it projects like small penis. 'What's she like?' I ask, grateful to be outside in the fresh air on the college steps. 'He,' she corrects me. But after a bit of a lecture about gender terrorism she gets going on the subject of Della Grace's character, which she admires, and soon lapses into unselfconscious 'her's and 'she's. It was a confrontation at first, she admits, the sight of Del's hairy buttocks and chest. But she's fascinated by cosmetic surgery. When the breasts come off at Del's next op, she's going to paint another portrait. I'm not sure I can bear any more of it. She says she thinks outrageous cosmetic surgery is the future. She's attended quite a few ops as an observer. She asks if I'd ever consider surgery. I say no, false teeth is enough - would she? No, she says, she's heard the kinds of comments the surgeons make in cosmetic surgery ops. What, do they go 'phwoar'? 'Yeah!' she says. 3.17pm I race out of Holborn in my Golf, calling ahead on my mobile to the Delfina Art Trust to let the director know we'll be too late for lunch. I sense Tony (who comes from Baja in California, and is an experienced driver as well as a very good portrait photographer) beside me, cowering and wincing and attempting to combine the two expressions with mimed apologies to pedestrians as I ride over sections of pavement. 3.45pm The Delfina, in Bermondsey Street, near Tower Bridge, is a magnificent example of the new era's art values. It's a top restaurant that takes all major credit cards, with a gallery attached and a lot of artist's studios. The artists are from Britain and the rest of the world. They have to apply to come here. They can stay for two years for no rent, or for a little rent if they are rich. The set-up is exclusive in that only artists who know where art is at or who are fancied by the Delfina applications board to know where it's at, will ever get on to the programme. But after that, it's admirably free. The artists all go to each other's studios; they meet at lunch where critics and curators drop by and there's an atmosphere of friendly open chat about how to get shows; or, I should say, serious discourse about the issues. The Delfina restaurant, one of the best in London, has works on display by some of the art stars who have passed through. There is a drawing of Leonardo DiCaprio by Karen Kilimnik and a wall-size photo by Wim Delvoye of a mountain beside a city. Carved into the side of the mountain in mighty capitals is the legend: 'MUM THE KEYS ARE YOU KNOW WHERE.' Glancing at this marvel of expensive digitally altered contemporary art noodling, I head for the receptionist in front of the gallery space. She calls up the director David Gilmour on the phone and he quickly appears to greet me. He takes me off to meet Urs Fischer, an enormous German with a densely tattooed left arm, who is hard at work making exact facsimiles of his studio walls which will be shipped off soon to an important exhibition in Ghent. 'Fantastic, Urs!' I say. Then Urs joins David and me and another German artist for a visit to Keith Tyson's studio over the road at The Tannery, a former warehouse, now a studio complex, and Tony photographs another artist, Gary Webb, assisting Keith on the making of a humorous sculpture. Keith, a big, friendly 30-something, is one of the Delfina board, along with installation artist Anya Gallacio. I know his name but I have never seen his work before. I immediately recognise it as, well, bullshit. But he is energetic and his bullshit has energy too. 'Ha ha it's great!' I say, looking around at his blackboard scribbles, or texts, soon to be shipped off to the same exhibition in Ghent that Urs is going to be at, which it turns out is organised by top international curator Jan Hoet. While Keith explains that some of the texts on the blackboard installation are a self-invented language and the whole ensemble relates to the notion of mapping, I find myself thinking I'd like to have a studio at Delfina. I like the atmosphere of easy give-and-take, of creative people saying what they feel. I make a mental note to apply very soon to Keith for admission. 4.10pm Although Tony was feeling much better after photographing Keith and the picturesque, atmospheric bustle of the Delfina scenario, I can tell his whole mood has dropped right down again now we've got to Dot, a little gallery in Teesdale Yard near Shoreditch. For one thing he can't tell what makes it a gallery and I can't really explain it. Maybe it isn't one. It's run by the artist Elizabeth Price. Her project here is to archive material that artists have been invited to send in over the course of a year. 'What kind of material?' I ask. Anything they like, it turns out. To the naked eye it seems to be abject or idiotic material. Jigsaw puzzles from junk shops brought round by Matthew Thomson, whose practice as an artist is to assemble the puzzles. A box of notes by Margarita Gluzberg; the notes are just scraps but the box has been specially made by a professional box maker. It says 'Important Thoughts of Margarita Gluzberg' on the lid. And junk mail from the Czech artist Pavel Buchler, each unopened envelope stamped with his name. Dot is in a former workshop. The surrounding streets seem genuinely poor, the council blocks genuinely run-down. There are no restaurants anywhere. Elizabeth takes us out into the yard where she fly-posts a poster by Bank, the artists' collective. One of them, Millie Thomson, is out here with us, drinking tea. More archivists mill. Everyone is talkative. It's a post-Sensation contemporary art situation - words, thoughts, tea and talk, instead of expensive consumer objects. The posters are agitprop parodies in resonant but non-existent European languages. One shows a cartoon of a little man shrugging gormlessly. The words read: 'Redical nonnnsplus SPEKKEN'. Another one says: 'Non-dialektic nilder'. 4.45pm I phone ahead to Gilbert &amp; George to apologize for missing tea time. 'Good morning,' a recorded voice says. 'You have telephoned the answer machine of George and Gilbert.' Then it explains that they're out and they'll get back to whoever's calling when it's convenient. 'Leave a brief message. Goodbye. And good riddance.' Then George picks up and cheerfully asks if everything's OK. 'Don't worry at all,' he says when I start to talk. 'We've got nothing better to do than to wait for you!' 5.00pm I arrive at the famous Fournier Street location, off Brick Lane, and they're at the door in their light brown suits, each with a gleaming new tie with a minty-coloured abstract pattern. They get differently patterned ones sent over free throughout the year by an admirer in Europe. 'A maniac!' they say. 'We like him very much.' Tony, quite nervous again, follows me following them down the hall and into the wood-panelled front room. This is the first time I've noticed a painting of Jesus on their wall. 'It was always there,' they say. In fact, on this visit I notice the presence of the Lord everywhere. His portrait in their front room, in an unusual pink robe, was bought at an auction and is thought to be by Palmer. They've got a kind of stone Christian drinking fountain in the little garden between their house and studio, with a touching carved inscription on it, welcoming those who are thirsty to come and drink. In the studio, there's not much sign of labour because they've just finished a big project, recently shipped off to Bonn - a giant photo-work commemorating the end of the Millennium. A version for their files, in watercolour, still taped to the wall, has notes in the margins recording shutter speeds. Every bit of street graffiti they've incorporated into the image is pencilled-in. Gilbert laughs at the obscenities on park benches - 'They want to spoil everything that's provided for them!' They're very polite. They make tea and bring out champagne and chat to Tony about life in London compared to Baja. We try photographing them against a projection of a photo of their own spit but it's too dark. Then we use their own powerful studio lights to light a shot of them draped on their enlarger, which looks like something industrial or even military, maybe First World War, with its khaki colouring. I look at their photos of pieces of insect wing shot with a microscope lens. ('Mosquitoes have killed more people than all the totalitarian dictators put together - more than Stalin! And do you know, they're all women!') 'Why did you leave d'Offay,' I ask, not expecting a totally forthright answer, knowing how guarded the art world is about professional things. 'Because he's a cunt,' they laugh. 'He only likes the world's most expensive artists,' Gilbert says. 'And that's not us!' But they won't say where they're going, if it's sexy White Cube or sexy Gagosian (who's about to open a space in London.) George sees us out. The evening shadows are drawing in. The little yard with its Pugin bench and Arts and Crafts objects is charming and calm. They're great aesthetes. They know all about Pugin and Eastlake and William Burgess and William de Morgan. There are atmospheric creepers and trellises, and views either side of more of the same in intricate silhouette patterns. George points at the sky - 'Rather beautiful peach coloured clouds,' he says, and so they are. In the hall he hands out gifts. 'Have you got a word processor, Tony?' he asks. 'Yes.' 'Here's a Gilbert &amp; George mouse mat.' Because I know they walk everywhere I ask if they'd ever get a train out to the countryside and go for a walk. 'Are you mad!' They love the beauty of nature but they don't like the bigotry out there. They prefer to take their chances in the urban melting pot. They only go to the country once a year to stay in the Norfolk (or somewhere) holiday home of top German curator Rudi Fuchs, to show loyalty. 'Good morning!' they once said to a young couple with a pram outside a lovely church near his house. 'Fuck off you weird looking prats!' came the reply. 7.30pm Now it's the evening, the time everyone in the art world goes to private views to unwind. I walk through the darkness of Northburgh Street, off Goswell Road, in Clerkenwell, with my partner, Emma Biggs, an intellectual and a staggering beauty who runs a world wide mosaic company in Holloway Road. With us are two of her children, Peter and Claudine. We approach an anonymous-looking brick rectangle; perhaps not so much anonymous as kind of community hall or scout hut. It's the Cabinet Gallery, recently relocated here from Brixton. Inside I have no difficulty recognising the art works. They are the things dotted around the place or hanging from the ceiling. I introduce my little family to Tony who has already been here for some time arranging his lights. After we've looked about, admiring a mirror thing, a cork tile thing and a straggly unwound cassette tape thing, he sets us up near a yellow thing and we wait for people to come and talk to us. The first one is one of the two Cabinet directors, Andrew Wheatley. He admires his own floor colour, a warm pale khaki grey. 'No artist is going to repaint this floor!' he says. We get on to Cabinet's first ever exhibition which was called To Hell. It was their abjection phase. We're quite a long way into the discussion before I realise he's not talking about Mike Kelley, one of the international kings of abjection in art in the Nineties, but Mary Kelly, a feminist artist of the Seventies. I'm just trying to get used to the idea of Mary Kelly's make-over by Cabinet, from boring to interesting, when it turns out he means Mary Kelly, the nineteenth century murderee, one of Jack the Ripper's victims. Peter is complaining that the art is crap. 'Oh no,' I say, 'It's good. It's minimalist. Look, this one's all diamonds.' It's a 3-D diamond shape made of painted card on a kind of bird table. 'It's a functionalist aesthetic,' Emma corrects me, 'Not a minimalist one.' 'Yeah, functionalist,' I say. 'And this one's like cubism! Those checkered diamond shapes are like the patterns in cubism!' Peter insists it's still dull. 'I didn't say it wasn't dull, just not crap.' Then an artist comes up and says it is crap. I make my way to another part of the gallery to say hello to Matthew Higgs, one of the curators of The British Art Show, which starts touring the country in April. He's sitting at a white table with computers and beer bottles and catalogues on it, reading the Masculin/Feminin catalogue he just brought back from the Pompidou Centre today. It's an exhibition about sexuality and theory. Paul Noble, one of the most successful artists at Maureen Paley's Interim Art, widely tipped to be nominated for the Turner Prize this year, is looking over his shoulder. 'Awesome!' he's saying, 'She's holding his knob!' I try to interest Claudine in the negative diamond shapes in a metal security grill over one of the windows. As the time-honoured strategy at private views is to stand still and wait for someone to come up to you, so no one will think you haven't got any friends, nobody is moving much. Emma gets into a conversation with the artists' collective, Bank. They're known as a collective but in fact there's only two left now. 'The first one that went was only marginal anyway,' Simon Bedwell, one of the remaining pair, says. 'What about the other one?' 'Well you'll have to ask Millie about him.' But when Millie (who I saw earlier today at Dot) joins in, we're already onto the subject of some books they are reviewing for a special edition of Modern Painters which I'm editing. 'How are the reviews coming on?' I ask. They say they've been reviewing them aesthetically. One by Julian Stallabras, the Courtauld Institute lecturer, has a curious transparent pink colour on the cover, they've noticed. And one by the art historian T.J. Clark - a cri de coeur about the age of disillusionment after the demise of modernism - has a pronounced coffee table aesthetic. They say when it comes to painting both writers seem to be desperately reaching for their cravats and pipes. Then Millie says another book they're reviewing, by Picasso's biographer, John Richardson, about the art collector Douglas Cooper, makes them out to be a right pair of poshies poshing around Europe. And it makes Picasso out to be a miserable git. We enjoy ourselves in this way a bit more and then get leave from Tony to be off. At Granita restaurant in Islington, later on, Emma's oldest son, Luke, joins us. A precocious gourmet, Luke admires the sauce on his quail: 'I say, isn't that juniper berries!' He is scratching the scab shape on the back of his hand, an upside-down cross, to keep up with his Satanist classmates at his expensive public school opposite the new Tate Gallery at Bankside. Emma says she enjoyed talking to Bank, but was aware of the strain of agreeing all the time and also of the loudness of her own voice and posh accent. As I'm laughing and trying not to notice Luke's festering symbol the mobile goes and it's Tony to say he thinks he may have knocked the mirror thing over. \u0095 Matthew Collings is the author and presenter of Channel Four's This is Modern Art.",

      "body": "<p>Martin Creed, Martin Creed. Will people just shut up about Martin Creed. Martin Creed is the most talked-about young artist in London, and that's saying something. Martin Creed has one of his works on the cover of the Tate Gallery publication Moving Targets 2. Martin Creed, everyone says, is a shoo-in for this year's Turner Prize shortlist. Martin Creed has been commissioned to make a large neon sign celebrating the opening of Tate Britain.</p> <p>It wasn't always so. He once sent a crumpled-up ball of paper to the Director of the Tate Gallery, Nicholas Serota. This was not just any ball of paper but a work of art, Martin Creed's Work 88: a sheet of A4 paper crumpled into a ball. Serota's secretary sent it back. The paper had been neatly flattened to fit into an envelope.</p> <p>That ball of paper would be worth a lot of money today. You can see another version of it in a glass case on a white plinth in Martin Creed's retrospective, MartinCreedWorks, currently at Southampton City Art Gallery. A retrospective, and he's only 32. And he's just had an artwork unveiled in Times Square, New York, commissioned by the city's prestigious Public Art Trust.</p> <p>Who is this Martin Creed? He's an artist who since 1987 - when he was 19, and a student at the Slade - has been engaged in a systematic series of comically slight, yet straightfaced artworks with titles like Work 79: some Blu-Tack kneaded, rolled into a ball, and depressed against a wall. At least that appears on a wall at about the height of a painting, so you can see a resemblance to a work of art. With other items in the Creed corpus, like Work 100: on a tiled floor, in an awkward place, a cubic stack of tiles built on top of one of the existing ones, you don't know there's any art in the room until you trip over it.</p> <p>Creed is also a musician. He's the guitarist, singer and songwriter in Owada, an art rock band, whose gigs and recordings are part of his work as an artist. Creed's songs are numbered items in the same series as his visual art, and share the same spartan aesthetic; songs such as 1234, whose lyrics go, 'One, two, three, four, One, two, three, four.'</p> <p>When I meet Creed he tries to explain his art, talking in the same soft Glaswegian accent he sings in. He reminds me of Ivor Cutler, a drily funny eccentric character, a natural star. 'Things are a weight on my mind,' says Creed, 'you know, physical things. One of the reasons that I like music is that music when it happens, it happens in the air; it's not a physical thing. Things are... I do find them a weight.'</p> <p>Britain leapt to the forefront of contemporary art in the Nineties with excess and drama. We've had sharks and unmade beds, we've had violence, horror, confession, mess. Perhaps it was inevitable that in its search for the next big thing the art world would veer the other way, and that Minimalism would become the hottest ticket in town. Cue Martin Creed.</p> <p>Except that Creed is not really a Minimalist and his work is much more original than the way he sometimes talks about it. The Sixties Minimalists rejected the idea of the transcendent work of art, the painting or sculpture you looked through to discover a meaning. They made godless art objects that were just objects, that aimed to make you self-aware, to throw you back on yourself. Dan Flavin put fluorescent strip lights on the wall; Carl Andr\u00e9 arranged bricks on the floor. These are still the most awkward, frustrating works of modern art - and the moment you see one of Martin Creed's works you realise how much and how little he owes them.</p> <p>The first thing you encounter in Creed's exhibition at Southampton City Art Gallery - touring to Leeds, Liverpool and London - is the work that on paper sounds the most ludicrously Minimalist of all: Work 127: a door opening and closing and a light going on and off . At Southampton it has been set up just on your left as you enter the exhibition, using the door and light of a curator's office, whose filing cabinets, desk and pinboard decorated with posters and postcards you peer at as the door mysteriously opens on to the darkened room. Suddenly, as the door swings back towards you, the light comes on: you stare into the eyes of Christ in a German Renaissance painting and try to take in the post-it notes... then the light snaps off, and the door is shut. It starts to swing open again, and you stretch for another glimpse into the room. Again, just as you're getting the feel of the place, the door swings shut.</p> <p>This is a wonderful, introspective installation. The pleasures of Creed's art have nothing to do with their formal nature and everything to do with the stories and social encounters they generate. He's a poet of the everyday. Looking into the curator's office, you feel tantalised by and excluded from someone's private world. Creed's art is not really about numbers, or things. It's about inner worlds and secret feelings, and it veers between melancholia and exuberance.</p> <p>I've never encountered an artist who so transcends the rules he sets himself, who seems so parsimonious on paper and so generous in the gallery. Creed's touring exhibition of public museums flirts brilliantly with the museum's grandeur; there's even an installation called 'all the sculpture in a collection', which consists of all the sculpture in the collection of Southampton City Art Gallery, from Rodin to Rachel Whiteread, placed higgledy-piggledy in one room. Max Wall, a Victorian admiral, a Degas bronze... it's somehow a sad spectacle. Nearby there is a neon sign that says THINGS. Every so often it lights up in hellish red.</p> <p>'I like things a lot, I like things a lot,' sings Creed on his latest CD. At the end of this manically enthusiatic paean to objects he suddenly cries, 'No, No'. Things do have a horror, they pile up, gather dust. When Martin Creed is miserable he sees the world crushed by things, but when his art is happy it is about, as he says, 'feeling free, aye, you know'.</p> <p>Creed was brought up in the suburbs of Glasgow, and he thinks his art is quite Scottish - 'a bit anal'. And there's something else as well: 'My parents are Quakers. Do you know about Quakers? The Society of Friends - and they worshipped in silence. I used to go to Quaker Sunday school when I was a child. A Quaker meeting consists of one hour of silence. There's no hierarchy. If anyone wants to say anything they stand up and say it. In court you used to have to swear on the Bible to tell the truth and Quakers had exemption from that because they believed you should always tell the truth.'</p> <p>One of the exhibits in Creed's show con sists of 30 metronomes in a row, all running at slightly different speeds. Clackety clack, clackety clack. As you look along the line of furiously beating instruments you think of time itself running to different beats. The orderly ticking of the metronome is something Creed grew up with. He had a musical childhood, learning the violin when he was four, switching to the piano in an act of rebellion when he was 12. This musical training is crucial to his art. There are musical scores and songs in his series of numbered artworks, ranging from purely visual jokes on musical notation to actual recordings.</p> <p>In the Sixties, John Cale, a musically prodigious child from the South Wales valleys, went to the United States on a classical music scholarship and ended up playing in Andy Warhol's Velvet Underground. There's something about Creed that makes you think of Cale - 'I love the Velvet Underground,' he confirms. Cale played in the ensemble of classical musician La Monte Young, one of the founders of the Fluxus movement who invented the 'instructional' artwork, which consists of an instruction - musical or otherwise - which would then be interpreted in unpredictable ways. 'When I started doing installations like the light going on and off,' says Creed, 'the way that all those works exist is on paper. The work is the score for the piece. All the works are like pieces of music in the sense that they're scores, they're instructions, which makes me feel better about them in the sense that it makes the actual physical object less important, less precious. It doesn't matter if it gets damaged or thrown away.'</p> <p>Creed's most extravagant work to date is Work 200: Half the Air In A Given Space, whose instructions are as follows: 'Choose a space. Calculate the volume of the space. Using air, blow up white 12in balloons until they occupy half the volume of the space. As usual the space should be full of air, but half of it should be inside balloons...'</p> <p>This is a work of art that has no weight, no permanent shape, no certainties of any kind - except that when you are in the room, everything you do changes the room for everyone else. It's not difficult to see what he's getting at. It's not the artwork that matters, but the way it sets up relationships between people. You become a member of an airy commonwealth. In Southampton, the balloon room seemed warm and funny. Funnier still when parents edged in with children who went crazy, running as fast as they could through the undulating mass. The balloons no longer filled 'half the air in a given space'. They filled perhaps a third or a quarter of the room. Some were shrunk and shrivelled. No one cared. It was beautiful.</p> <p>Creed's passion comes through most of all in his neon public artworks. On the classical portico which is all that's left of the London Orphan Asylum visible from Clapton High Street in London, white neon letters promise EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT. Creed put this up a year ago, a commission by the Peer Trust with Hackney Historic Buildings Trust. The sign was meant to come down last summer, but instead it has become a fixture, a public artwork local people like.

      "bodyText": "Martin Creed, Martin Creed. Will people just shut up about Martin Creed. Martin Creed is the most talked-about young artist in London, and that's saying something. Martin Creed has one of his works on the cover of the Tate Gallery publication Moving Targets 2. Martin Creed, everyone says, is a shoo-in for this year's Turner Prize shortlist. Martin Creed has been commissioned to make a large neon sign celebrating the opening of Tate Britain. It wasn't always so. He once sent a crumpled-up ball of paper to the Director of the Tate Gallery, Nicholas Serota. This was not just any ball of paper but a work of art, Martin Creed's Work 88: a sheet of A4 paper crumpled into a ball. Serota's secretary sent it back. The paper had been neatly flattened to fit into an envelope. That ball of paper would be worth a lot of money today. You can see another version of it in a glass case on a white plinth in Martin Creed's retrospective, MartinCreedWorks, currently at Southampton City Art Gallery. A retrospective, and he's only 32. And he's just had an artwork unveiled in Times Square, New York, commissioned by the city's prestigious Public Art Trust. Who is this Martin Creed? He's an artist who since 1987 - when he was 19, and a student at the Slade - has been engaged in a systematic series of comically slight, yet straightfaced artworks with titles like Work 79: some Blu-Tack kneaded, rolled into a ball, and depressed against a wall. At least that appears on a wall at about the height of a painting, so you can see a resemblance to a work of art. With other items in the Creed corpus, like Work 100: on a tiled floor, in an awkward place, a cubic stack of tiles built on top of one of the existing ones, you don't know there's any art in the room until you trip over it. Creed is also a musician. He's the guitarist, singer and songwriter in Owada, an art rock band, whose gigs and recordings are part of his work as an artist. Creed's songs are numbered items in the same series as his visual art, and share the same spartan aesthetic; songs such as 1234, whose lyrics go, 'One, two, three, four, One, two, three, four.' When I meet Creed he tries to explain his art, talking in the same soft Glaswegian accent he sings in. He reminds me of Ivor Cutler, a drily funny eccentric character, a natural star. 'Things are a weight on my mind,' says Creed, 'you know, physical things. One of the reasons that I like music is that music when it happens, it happens in the air; it's not a physical thing. Things are... I do find them a weight.' Britain leapt to the forefront of contemporary art in the Nineties with excess and drama. We've had sharks and unmade beds, we've had violence, horror, confession, mess. Perhaps it was inevitable that in its search for the next big thing the art world would veer the other way, and that Minimalism would become the hottest ticket in town. Cue Martin Creed. Except that Creed is not really a Minimalist and his work is much more original than the way he sometimes talks about it. The Sixties Minimalists rejected the idea of the transcendent work of art, the painting or sculpture you looked through to discover a meaning. They made godless art objects that were just objects, that aimed to make you self-aware, to throw you back on yourself. Dan Flavin put fluorescent strip lights on the wall; Carl Andr\u00e9 arranged bricks on the floor. These are still the most awkward, frustrating works of modern art - and the moment you see one of Martin Creed's works you realise how much and how little he owes them. The first thing you encounter in Creed's exhibition at Southampton City Art Gallery - touring to Leeds, Liverpool and London - is the work that on paper sounds the most ludicrously Minimalist of all: Work 127: a door opening and closing and a light going on and off . At Southampton it has been set up just on your left as you enter the exhibition, using the door and light of a curator's office, whose filing cabinets, desk and pinboard decorated with posters and postcards you peer at as the door mysteriously opens on to the darkened room. Suddenly, as the door swings back towards you, the light comes on: you stare into the eyes of Christ in a German Renaissance painting and try to take in the post-it notes... then the light snaps off, and the door is shut. It starts to swing open again, and you stretch for another glimpse into the room. Again, just as you're getting the feel of the place, the door swings shut. This is a wonderful, introspective installation. The pleasures of Creed's art have nothing to do with their formal nature and everything to do with the stories and social encounters they generate. He's a poet of the everyday. Looking into the curator's office, you feel tantalised by and excluded from someone's private world. Creed's art is not really about numbers, or things. It's about inner worlds and secret feelings, and it veers between melancholia and exuberance. I've never encountered an artist who so transcends the rules he sets himself, who seems so parsimonious on paper and so generous in the gallery. Creed's touring exhibition of public museums flirts brilliantly with the museum's grandeur; there's even an installation called 'all the sculpture in a collection', which consists of all the sculpture in the collection of Southampton City Art Gallery, from Rodin to Rachel Whiteread, placed higgledy-piggledy in one room. Max Wall, a Victorian admiral, a Degas bronze... it's somehow a sad spectacle. Nearby there is a neon sign that says THINGS. Every so often it lights up in hellish red. 'I like things a lot, I like things a lot,' sings Creed on his latest CD. At the end of this manically enthusiatic paean to objects he suddenly cries, 'No, No'. Things do have a horror, they pile up, gather dust. When Martin Creed is miserable he sees the world crushed by things, but when his art is happy it is about, as he says, 'feeling free, aye, you know'. Creed was brought up in the suburbs of Glasgow, and he thinks his art is quite Scottish - 'a bit anal'. And there's something else as well: 'My parents are Quakers. Do you know about Quakers? The Society of Friends - and they worshipped in silence. I used to go to Quaker Sunday school when I was a child. A Quaker meeting consists of one hour of silence. There's no hierarchy. If anyone wants to say anything they stand up and say it. In court you used to have to swear on the Bible to tell the truth and Quakers had exemption from that because they believed you should always tell the truth.' One of the exhibits in Creed's show con sists of 30 metronomes in a row, all running at slightly different speeds. Clackety clack, clackety clack. As you look along the line of furiously beating instruments you think of time itself running to different beats. The orderly ticking of the metronome is something Creed grew up with. He had a musical childhood, learning the violin when he was four, switching to the piano in an act of rebellion when he was 12. This musical training is crucial to his art. There are musical scores and songs in his series of numbered artworks, ranging from purely visual jokes on musical notation to actual recordings. In the Sixties, John Cale, a musically prodigious child from the South Wales valleys, went to the United States on a classical music scholarship and ended up playing in Andy Warhol's Velvet Underground. There's something about Creed that makes you think of Cale - 'I love the Velvet Underground,' he confirms. Cale played in the ensemble of classical musician La Monte Young, one of the founders of the Fluxus movement who invented the 'instructional' artwork, which consists of an instruction - musical or otherwise - which would then be interpreted in unpredictable ways. 'When I started doing installations like the light going on and off,' says Creed, 'the way that all those works exist is on paper. The work is the score for the piece. All the works are like pieces of music in the sense that they're scores, they're instructions, which makes me feel better about them in the sense that it makes the actual physical object less important, less precious. It doesn't matter if it gets damaged or thrown away.' Creed's most extravagant work to date is Work 200: Half the Air In A Given Space, whose instructions are as follows: 'Choose a space. Calculate the volume of the space. Using air, blow up white 12in balloons until they occupy half the volume of the space. As usual the space should be full of air, but half of it should be inside balloons...' This is a work of art that has no weight, no permanent shape, no certainties of any kind - except that when you are in the room, everything you do changes the room for everyone else. It's not difficult to see what he's getting at. It's not the artwork that matters, but the way it sets up relationships between people. You become a member of an airy commonwealth. In Southampton, the balloon room seemed warm and funny. Funnier still when parents edged in with children who went crazy, running as fast as they could through the undulating mass. The balloons no longer filled 'half the air in a given space'. They filled perhaps a third or a quarter of the room. Some were shrunk and shrivelled. No one cared. It was beautiful. Creed's passion comes through most of all in his neon public artworks. On the classical portico which is all that's left of the London Orphan Asylum visible from Clapton High Street in London, white neon letters promise EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT. Creed put this up a year ago, a commission by the Peer Trust with Hackney Historic Buildings Trust. The sign was meant to come down last summer, but instead it has become a fixture, a public artwork local people like. He's just done another public text, this time for Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. This one reads: DON'T WORRY. Are these messages reassuring or anxiety-provoking? 'When I made that,' says Creed about the orphanage sign, 'I was very depressed. I was going through a really bad time.' With both signs, Creed seems to be telling us that everything will be fine - eventually. When everything has changed. For the opening of Tate Britain he's putting a neon sign across the building, Work 143, reading: THE WHOLE WORLD + THE WORK = THE WHOLE WORLD. Which you could read as meaning either that art should assimilate itself entirely to the world or that art adds nothing to the world. Is it an optimistic or pessimistic statement? 'It depends on your mood,' says Creed's friend Andrew Wheatley at the Cabinet Gallery, which has represented Martin Creed since it was run from the Brixton flat of Wheatley's partner Martin McGeown. I don't think the statement is ambiguous at all. I don't think Martin Creed's art is pessimistic at all. When you experience it you understand immediately what he is saying, that things are only things, and the only way they matter is in their capacity to connect people to each other. Martin Creed makes artworks that are as light as air. Despise it, burst the balloon, that's your decision. Laugh with it, dive in the balloons and you'll have more fun. \u0095 MartinCreedWorks is on show in Southampton until 26 March, and then tours the country.",

Under the Act real harm to a child or future likelihood of harm became the starting-point justification for taking protective court proceedings - and for removing children from their families if necessary through court orders. When the Children Act was being introduced, my impression was that many social workers took the view that the Act and associated guidance was intended to assist in raising the level of social-work practice, not to keep children with their families whether they were at unacceptable risk or not. The Children Act was child-centred legislation, not a parents' charter to abuse or a social services' charter to let abuse continue. John Ellison Member of Law Society Children Panel London N1 \u0095 Seven years ago, two confused 10-year-old boys killed a toddler in a brutal attack. They were subjected to an unfair trial and the outrage and abuse of the press. Talk of their release and rehabilitation is still taboo. Now you report the case of an adult couple with responsibility for the care of their seven children. This responsibility was not met. Three children died, and the others were subjected to an horrific catalogue of abuse and neglect. The parents were acquitted of murder due to a legal technicality, and after countless visits by police and social services, have only just been convicted of cruelty and neglect. Strangely, this is the first I have heard of the dreadful story. There is no tabloid outcry baying for the blood of these cruel parents. We seem to live in a society which more readily accepts that mature and rational adults kill children, than that immature and irrational children kill other children. Kate Hough Manchester",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of teenage boys broke out of a juvenile detention centre on the outskirts of Bangkok yesterday in a protest against what they said were overly harsh disciplinary measures. Armed with metal rods, staves of wood and bottles, more than 200 detainees rampaged through the streets nearby. They played a rough game of cat-and-mouse with dozens of riot police before order was restored and most were returned to the Karuna Observation Centre in the city's Bang-na district. The boys, all aged between 14 and 19, occupied buildings yesterday morning and threatened to burn them down to highlight what they said were unpleasant living conditions and harsh discipline implemented by a new director. They accused him of using violent punishment against rule-breakers. Some of the boys told the ITV television network that they have been caned for not behaving well or listening to instructions. The police, under orders not to hurt the escapees, used fire hoses and tear gas to try to contain them.",

The three men and one woman are suspected of taking part in international terrorist operations, including hijackings, embassy seizures and attempted murders, more than a quarter of a century ago. Despite the suspects' advanced age - Masao Adachi is 59, Nariko Yamamoto is 58, Haruo Wako is 50 and Kazuo Tohira is 46 - and the fact that the once-feared Red Army has not been active for more than a decade, police took no chances in a large-scale operation to seize them as soon their plane touched down at Narita Airport. The four had flown on a private jet from Amman in Jordan, where they had been handed over to Japanese diplomats in a long-awaited coup for the government in Tokyo. Japan has been trying for decades to bring these senior Red Army members to justice. Three of the group are on an international wanted list for attempted murder. Wako is believed to have led a Red Army guerrilla unit after being trained in Beirut. He allegedly played a key role in the seizure of the French Embassy in the Netherlands in 1994. Adachi is seen as the group spokesman. He issued a statement for the organisation when a Red Army-led assault team hijacked a Japan Airlines plane over the Netherlands in 1973. Yamamoto reportedly acted as liaison officer between the Red Army and Palestinian guerrilla groups. She was expelled from France in August 1974. Although their actions were an embarrassment for Japan, they have long been treated as anti-Israeli war heroes in Lebanon, where they have been sheltering for more than a decade.

      "body": "<p>The career of Pedro Sanchez mirrors the wealth revolution in modern Britain. In the Sixties, he was leading a Jeeves-like lifestyle as butler to the aristocracy. In the Seventies and Eighties, he was taking the shilling of industrialists and Arab princes. These days, his ambition is to work for a pop star - preferably his idol, Eric Clapton - before he hangs up his perfectly pressed jacket for good.</p> <p>In the meantime, like thousands of others, he is happy to work for the new super-rich: the merchant bankers, lawyers, entrepreneurs and minor celebrities who are making domestic service one of the fastest growing areas of the UK economy. Most live in London and have large, country retreats. Many have staff in both locations.</p> <p>The Canadian newspaper proprietor Conrad Black recently advertised for a man with Sanchez's experience. He was prepared to pay \u00a360,000 plus the perks a butler expects - a flat and living expenses are just the start.</p> <p>This is why so many people are signing up to pamper the rich, says the boss of one of the more established domestic service agencies. Demand for help is so strong that international conglomerate Unilever has set up a domestic service subsidiary. In the UK alone, home-help spending has doubled to \u00a34 billion in a single year.</p> <p>In 1901, when the British population was 38 million and every middle-class home had at least one servant, there were 1.7 million women and 140,000 men in service. Now there are two million out of a population of 59 million. When former Beatle George Harrison is employing more than 30 people just to keep his garden nice, business really is booming.</p> <p>Domestic staff are no longer rigidly demarcated as butlers, housekeepers or chauffeurs. 'Back in the Sixties, the Beatles used to have a personal staff of at least 12,' Sanchez recalls. Today's pop stars such as Geri Halliwell and the Gallagher brothers make do with fewer people. Sanchez says he is expected to perform various roles.</p> <p>The greatest demand, though, is for nannies. Nearly two-thirds of couples with young children are both working. Sanchez says winning over the lady of the house is crucial for good upstairs/downstairs relations: 'They are very rich and very bored and often their husbands are off travelling the world, sometimes with the secretary, so who are they going to take this out on? The staff of course.'</p> <p>Even those who don't work can find a nanny is not enough: they have maternity nurses like Veronica Doyle, who guides women through the first four months of motherhood. Now working for a wealthy merchant banker's wife in Chelsea, Doyle cared for Lucas Morad, the love-child of Mick Jagger and Luciana Morad, who last week had her claim for \u00a323,000 a month in child support reduced to \u00a36,250. The first 10 weeks of Lucas's life were spent in Manhattan besieged by paparazzi. Doyle was hounded by reporters who, she says, made up things. 'I was devastated when they printed things I was supposed to have said about Mick Jagger. He was paying my wages, for goodness sake.'</p> <p>She has also looked after Jemima and Zac Goldsmith, whose mother, Lady Annabelle, she describes as a 'a real lady', even though she did not mind doing a spot of hoovering herself.</p> <p>Doyle admits to having worked for 'difficult' employers whose new-found wealth had not prepared them for handling servants.</p> <p>Her 'apprenticeship' was served with the aristocratic Drummond family in Scotland in the late Fifties, with whom she is still in touch. 'It was the best experience I could have possibly had. A lot of these younger girls have not had enough experience to have confidence and are terribly exploited.</p> <p>'But there is another side to the coin. Some ask for so much now. They want not just a flat, but a flat with their own entrance, their own phone, even their own car.'</p> <p>Sanchez says self-confidence is the key to a happy working relationship: 'Employers are like dogs. They can smell fear. You must show you are confident in your ability and you are always professional. I have worked for difficult, awkward men, but I have almost always handled it. I worked for Lord Hanson for more than three years - very few people have lasted so long with him - and he was a difficult but marvellous man. But John Aspinall was so difficult that even I left after a matter of weeks. The problem was respect. It wasn't going to work.'</p> <p>Hanson was a stickler for punctuality - lunch was served at one o' clock sharp and was finished by 2pm, drinks were at six. Those were rules Sanchez could live with.</p> <p>'The real aristocracy know exactly how to behave because they grew up with servants,' says Sanchez. 'They respect the people who work for them. A lot of the people with new money find staff make them feel claustrophobic and they don't know what to expect. They are the ones who are most likely to expect staff to wear uniforms and be very subservient.'</p> <p>Portuguese and Filipino staff are particularly popular, Katherine Shields of Staff of Distinction says, because they are 'very adaptable and willing to please', which is a polite way of saying subservient. Australian nannies are more popular than their British counterparts because they are less stuffy and 'always cheerful'.</p> <p>Confidentiality agreements such as the one signed by the Blair nanny, Ros Mark, are a recent development.</p> <p>'When I began we would have been insulted by such an agreement,' says Sanchez. 'Discretion is vitally important. Butlers have to learn not to listen. When I worked for Lord Hanson there would be regular dinners attended by people like Lady Thatcher. It is better to develop the skill of allowing what you hear to go in one ear and out the other. I have seen people do all sorts of things, but I will never say what they were.'</p> <p>He believes that bosses are not always being suspicious when they demand a confidentiality contract.

      "bodyText": "The career of Pedro Sanchez mirrors the wealth revolution in modern Britain. In the Sixties, he was leading a Jeeves-like lifestyle as butler to the aristocracy. In the Seventies and Eighties, he was taking the shilling of industrialists and Arab princes. These days, his ambition is to work for a pop star - preferably his idol, Eric Clapton - before he hangs up his perfectly pressed jacket for good. In the meantime, like thousands of others, he is happy to work for the new super-rich: the merchant bankers, lawyers, entrepreneurs and minor celebrities who are making domestic service one of the fastest growing areas of the UK economy. Most live in London and have large, country retreats. Many have staff in both locations. The Canadian newspaper proprietor Conrad Black recently advertised for a man with Sanchez's experience. He was prepared to pay \u00a360,000 plus the perks a butler expects - a flat and living expenses are just the start. This is why so many people are signing up to pamper the rich, says the boss of one of the more established domestic service agencies. Demand for help is so strong that international conglomerate Unilever has set up a domestic service subsidiary. In the UK alone, home-help spending has doubled to \u00a34 billion in a single year. In 1901, when the British population was 38 million and every middle-class home had at least one servant, there were 1.7 million women and 140,000 men in service. Now there are two million out of a population of 59 million. When former Beatle George Harrison is employing more than 30 people just to keep his garden nice, business really is booming. Domestic staff are no longer rigidly demarcated as butlers, housekeepers or chauffeurs. 'Back in the Sixties, the Beatles used to have a personal staff of at least 12,' Sanchez recalls. Today's pop stars such as Geri Halliwell and the Gallagher brothers make do with fewer people. Sanchez says he is expected to perform various roles. The greatest demand, though, is for nannies. Nearly two-thirds of couples with young children are both working. Sanchez says winning over the lady of the house is crucial for good upstairs/downstairs relations: 'They are very rich and very bored and often their husbands are off travelling the world, sometimes with the secretary, so who are they going to take this out on? The staff of course.' Even those who don't work can find a nanny is not enough: they have maternity nurses like Veronica Doyle, who guides women through the first four months of motherhood. Now working for a wealthy merchant banker's wife in Chelsea, Doyle cared for Lucas Morad, the love-child of Mick Jagger and Luciana Morad, who last week had her claim for \u00a323,000 a month in child support reduced to \u00a36,250. The first 10 weeks of Lucas's life were spent in Manhattan besieged by paparazzi. Doyle was hounded by reporters who, she says, made up things. 'I was devastated when they printed things I was supposed to have said about Mick Jagger. He was paying my wages, for goodness sake.' She has also looked after Jemima and Zac Goldsmith, whose mother, Lady Annabelle, she describes as a 'a real lady', even though she did not mind doing a spot of hoovering herself. Doyle admits to having worked for 'difficult' employers whose new-found wealth had not prepared them for handling servants. Her 'apprenticeship' was served with the aristocratic Drummond family in Scotland in the late Fifties, with whom she is still in touch. 'It was the best experience I could have possibly had. A lot of these younger girls have not had enough experience to have confidence and are terribly exploited. 'But there is another side to the coin. Some ask for so much now. They want not just a flat, but a flat with their own entrance, their own phone, even their own car.' Sanchez says self-confidence is the key to a happy working relationship: 'Employers are like dogs. They can smell fear. You must show you are confident in your ability and you are always professional. I have worked for difficult, awkward men, but I have almost always handled it. I worked for Lord Hanson for more than three years - very few people have lasted so long with him - and he was a difficult but marvellous man. But John Aspinall was so difficult that even I left after a matter of weeks. The problem was respect. It wasn't going to work.' Hanson was a stickler for punctuality - lunch was served at one o' clock sharp and was finished by 2pm, drinks were at six. Those were rules Sanchez could live with. 'The real aristocracy know exactly how to behave because they grew up with servants,' says Sanchez. 'They respect the people who work for them. A lot of the people with new money find staff make them feel claustrophobic and they don't know what to expect. They are the ones who are most likely to expect staff to wear uniforms and be very subservient.' Portuguese and Filipino staff are particularly popular, Katherine Shields of Staff of Distinction says, because they are 'very adaptable and willing to please', which is a polite way of saying subservient. Australian nannies are more popular than their British counterparts because they are less stuffy and 'always cheerful'. Confidentiality agreements such as the one signed by the Blair nanny, Ros Mark, are a recent development. 'When I began we would have been insulted by such an agreement,' says Sanchez. 'Discretion is vitally important. Butlers have to learn not to listen. When I worked for Lord Hanson there would be regular dinners attended by people like Lady Thatcher. It is better to develop the skill of allowing what you hear to go in one ear and out the other. I have seen people do all sorts of things, but I will never say what they were.' He believes that bosses are not always being suspicious when they demand a confidentiality contract. 'There are a lot of young peo ple coming into the business now who are in it for what they can get.' It is not always the bosses who do the exploiting: butler John Percival Hole waited until his boss Rodney Price (former chairman of the Thistle hotel group) went away before he threw a party, 'borrowed' the Bentley Turbo and sold it before embarking on a drink-and-drugs binge in Germany. He was arrested, charged and imprisoned. John Morgan, author of Debrett's New Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners, and style commentator Peter York are divided about the nouveaux riches . Morgan says they can be 'chippy and unconfident', even 'penny-pinching' about perks. York says the new rich are 'not saddled with sentimental noblesse oblige'.",

The author's apocalyptic vision of the future centres on new technologies which will be able to replicate themselves, without human help - nightmarish scenarios in which technologies exceed man's power to control them.

For Jason Lanier, a pioneer in the field of virtual reality, one remedy would be to reject machine-centred designs that supplant human decision-making. A simple example of this is the common function in word processors that inserts capital letters at the start of sentences and periods at the end. Joy's concerns centre on three areas, many of which have been addressed by science-fiction writers and technologist-authors such as Ray Kurzweil in The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence , Hans Moravec in Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind , and George Dyson in Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence . Joy predicts that by 2030, computers will be a million times more powerful than today, lending the possibility that robots may exceed humans in intelligence and have the ability to replicate themselves. Primitive examples of the kind of thing Joy is talking about include 'replication attacks' in the virtual world of computer viruses, the kind which have caused shutdowns of Internet sites and e-mail systems. He also points to nanotechnology - the science of creating minute machines atom by atom - that could in time produce tiny, self-reproducing mechanisms, and warns these could wreak havoc if released accidently or by malicious intent. In genetics, he supposes that the widening availability of knowledge about powerful genetic engineering could lead to a 'white plague' - an artificially designed disease that can kill selectively. In making his argument, Joy finds he's walking in the shoes of Theodore Kaczynski, the lapsed scientist widely discredited as a madman who conducted a 17-year bombing campaign against scientists in protest at technology, the so-called 'Unabomber'. Though he unequivocally condemns Kaczynski's use of violence, he notes he now shares the jailed bomber's terror of the 'unintended consequences, a well-known problem with the design and use of technology'. Like Kaczynski, Joy fears the potential positive applications of science are outweighed by the dangers: 'I have always believed making software more reliable, given its many uses, will make the world a safer and better place,' Joy writes. 'If I were to come to believe the opposite, then I would be morally obligated to stop this work. I can now imagine that such a day may come.'",

      "body": "<p>They'll go round North Wales again this year. By coach. It will rain. They will stop for cups of tea. In the roadside caffs they will be careful with the pennies, for money doesn't grow on trees - never did, of course, but especially not at their age it doesn't.</p> <p>They went last year, and it was nice, but it wasn't great. Jean, being stone blind, had to spend days sitting in the swaying fug listening to Arthur as he tried, gamely, to describe the passing sights. She's a good-natured old bird, stoic and uncomplaining of life, but even she admits - as I struggle to work out precisely how many seconds I could have lasted in the same seat before spontaneous combustion occurred or I tried to choke off life by eating my own headscarf - that it got 'a little bit boring'.</p> <p>So they'll go again this year, and it will, says Jean, be the greatest holiday she's ever had. She's looking forward to seeing Wales. To seeing the sea, the hills, the other people's faces. And the colours. Most of all, more than anything, she's looking forward to the colours.</p> <p>Miracles don't seem to favour the rich and famous, and perhaps with good reason; they've happened to them, by definition, already. They tend to happen to the unknown and the ordinary, the civilians, the millions usually drowned out by the caterwaul of wealthy, gossipy media London yelling at its navel. And so it's nice - well, it's more than nice, it's lovely, but nice seems to be our word for the day - to find a tale that can still stop you in your tracks and bring the sun out; and to find a couple who remind you of another country, an older Britain, simpler and duller but still resonant; a Britain that has, like Jean and Arthur themselves, never quite got around to giving up.</p> <p>It was in 1982 that Jean was, quite massively wrongly, registered blind, at the age of 59. She had never seen well, wearing glasses from the age of nine, and her sight had been getting progressively worse throughout the Seventies. 'By 1982 I could hardly see a face in front of me - the right eye had gone completely, and the left was just a blur.' She had only had cataracts - huge, clouding cataracts, but operable nonetheless - but the hospital didn't realise. She was registered blind, and given a white stick. 'And it got even worse. It was black, pretty black, most of the time. I didn't question the diagnosis, for there is a family problem: my mother, sister and brother all went blind.'</p> <p>Because of the years of failing sight, going blind was, she says philosophi cally, perhaps easier for her than most. She took herself off to classes, learning Moon, a blind-language set in raised shapes, rather than Braille. She had her friends. She had her (then) husband, Alf. She could hear, and she would crouch next to the television, struggling to make out a faint moving shadow as she listened to the soaps - 'The soaps were my saviour. Movies were more difficult, with the silences, but the great thing about the soaps is that there was always someone talking.'</p> <p>Since she began talking, last week, about her sudden recovery, in case there's someone else out there in the same situation, she has come across as big-hearted, unresentful and, yes, stoic. But as we talk a little further about the black years, she remembers more and, if not with bitterness, then with an ineffable sadness.</p> <p>The little, daily things. Standing at a crossroads for 20 minutes at a time, waiting for all sounds to die away. Trying to cook: 'I'd get terribly frustrated. After I'd got the pot on, I couldn't tell if the gas was lit or not, so I'd put my head down to smell for gas, and my hair would singe. And with the oven... always getting burns on my arms. Or trying to read: the Moon system is good, but takes up a lot of space; so if I tried to read a book - oh, you know, mostly weepies, love stories, what most women read - I'd need 24 boxes in the house. It was too much.'</p> <p>The poignant things. 'I would get out the photographs' - her and Alf, the four children, the 11 grandchildren - 'and stare and stare at them. I knew I couldn't see them, but it didn't stop me trying. Sometimes with the telly too. I used to love wildlife programmes. And so I'd hear them say, \"And now the elephant finally appears\", and I'm going, \"Where is it? Where is it? \" I so wanted to see that elephant.'</p> <p>And the tears. The one thing her eyes were still able to do was cry, especially after Alf died in 1990. 'The worst part was that I couldn't go about on my own. I'd lost my independence. Did I cry? Yes. A lot. Especially at night. Especially after I lost my first husband. I felt very... alone. Blindness does that to you: even when you're in a crowd, you feel you're the only one.'</p> <p>Arthur, her husband today, was married to Jean's cousin, Flossie. He 'lost' her, as the euphemism goes, around the same time. The four had always been close; it was that kind of life, that kind of generation. Arthur, the driving instructor; Alf, the delivery man who had to retire because of TB; Jean, who left her job in a psychiatric ward to care for him; Flossie, who joined them every Friday night for friendly foursomes of knockout whist, and could never get the hang, as Arthur remembers fondly, of following his lead. And so, in 1992, it was only natural that the remaining pair should get together to talk about the old days, and then, in love and in need, get married.</p> <p>Jean had always worn her glasses, even though they were no good; she felt friends wouldn't recognise her otherwise. And then, last year, the indomitable, patient, loving Arthur, whom Jean had by then nursed through a stroke, said to her: 'You've worn those glasses for 39 years. Time you got them changed.' He had an appointment for new reading glasses, and put Jean's name down too. 'I said rubbish, but he insisted I went.'</p> <p>Her appointment was from 3pm to 3.30. The optometrist, Ruth Douse, who was eight years old when Jean went fully blind, had found huge and heavy cataracting, and wanted her to see a specialist as soon as possible. Dr Roger Wilson, consultant surgeon at the East Surrey Hospital, operated on her left eye six weeks ago, under local anaesthetic, and asked Arthur to take off the patch gently in the morning.</p> <p>'I was scared,' says Jean. 'They had told me not to hope for too much, but I was scared nothing would have happened. Of course, you hope.' She sat down in the living room, facing the window. 'Arthur lifted off the patch. And I just shouted: 'Oh, my God!'</p> <p>'He was worried, thought I was upset 'cos nothing had happened. But it was the opposite. \"Will you look at those colours!\" I said. \"Will you look at that grass out there?\" I had never seen the world as bright as that. Even from the old days, when I could see, the colours I remember were duller; the colours were always pale.' They held each other, and wept.</p> <p>The left eye was done shortly afterwards and there were surprises, of course. Eighteen years in the dark... she had had to imagine a lot. She smiles as I ask her about public figures. 'I had always thought Diana had dark hair - long, curly, dark hair; I knew she was pretty but thought it was in a different way.' And there's her own face; it was a shock. The lines and wrinkles were a shock.</p> <p>But the delights are everywhere. Arthur quietly went up to the attack and brought down all Jean's summer clothes, hung them in her wardrobe, and told her to go and have a look. She cried again; she had always thought she was dressed in black. Plants - bright, zinging pot plants, guaranteed to burst open in the spring - have been ordered for the front door. 'Even now, I still say, \"Look at that colour, isn't it beautiful?\"</p> <p>'I say it everywhere. In Sainsbury's; suddenly I'll stop, and say, \"Oh look at the colour on those tins; look at that row of jars.\" He hurries me on, says people will think I'm mad. Well, I might be, but I'm happy.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>You don't need to be an expert in feng shui to understand the benefits of a thoroughly good clear-out. Your rooms will look bigger, you will cut down on cleaning time - and instead of being surrounded by guilt-inducing reminders of unfortunate impulse buys, you will get a warm glow from knowing that you've done your bit for the world's poor by depositing your unwanted stuff at the local charity shop. </p> <p>Not convinced? You must be a member of the 'you never know when it might come in handy' brigade. So, presumably, was the man who lost the entire contents of his loft to thieves who got in through the loft space of a house further down the terrace. The burglary was bad enough, but his biggest headache was the insurance claim. </p> <p>'We did everything we could to help,' says Sue Winston of Norwich Union, 'but the problem was that he had no idea what was in the loft, so he didn't know what to claim for.' </p> <p>But at least his claim was met. Even if you can remember all the things you've got stashed away in the loft, cellar, garage or garden shed, how sure are you that they are adequately insured? </p> <p>What many people don't realise, according to Winston, is that with new-for-old policies, even semi-discarded items need to be insured for their full replacement value (irrespective of whether you would actually want to replace them).

Your rooms will look bigger, you will cut down on cleaning time - and instead of being surrounded by guilt-inducing reminders of unfortunate impulse buys, you will get a warm glow from knowing that you've done your bit for the world's poor by depositing your unwanted stuff at the local charity shop. Not convinced? You must be a member of the 'you never know when it might come in handy' brigade. So, presumably, was the man who lost the entire contents of his loft to thieves who got in through the loft space of a house further down the terrace. The burglary was bad enough, but his biggest headache was the insurance claim. 'We did everything we could to help,' says Sue Winston of Norwich Union, 'but the problem was that he had no idea what was in the loft, so he didn't know what to claim for.' But at least his claim was met. Even if you can remember all the things you've got stashed away in the loft, cellar, garage or garden shed, how sure are you that they are adequately insured? What many people don't realise, according to Winston, is that with new-for-old policies, even semi-discarded items need to be insured for their full replacement value (irrespective of whether you would actually want to replace them). If they are not, you risk having any future claim on your contents policy scaled down, or not paid at all. Insuring all those belongings you can't do without shouldn't add too much to your premium. At Norwich Union, for example, an extra \u00a35,000 on the sum insured will add about \u00a315 a year to your insurance bill.

This could be the case if your employer provides a decent sick-pay scheme, you could rely on a partner's income or your savings - or a redundancy payout - could cover your mortgage payments for a year.

The interest rates they charge (see table) are more than twice the rate of much better value credit cards. </p> <p> Which? magazine says someone running a \u00a3400 store-card debt could pay an extra \u00a355 in interest a year compared with a 'best buy' credit card from Capital One (0800 952 5252). The John Lewis and Waitrose cards were a lot less expensive, but still cost an extra \u00a35. </p> <p><strong> Chuck out the cheques</strong> </p> <p>No one is suggesting you do away with your current-account cheque book, but a strong candidate for the bin is the chequebook some issuers provide with their credit card. </p> <p>When you write a credit-card cheque, the amount is added to your card bill, so they can be convenient if whoever you are paying doesn't take plastic. But purchases made like this are treated as cash advances, so interest (at a rate usually higher than for purchases) starts clocking up as soon as the item hits your account. </p> <p>On top of the interest, some card issuers charge a handling fee. Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, charges 1.5 per cent of the value of the cheque (minimum charge \u00a31.50); the same percentage is charged on those linked to an Alliance and Leicester Money Back card, but the minimum charge is \u00a32. However, there's no handling fee on cheques with cards from Beneficial, the Co-operative Bank and MBNA. </p> <p>But cost is not the only factor. Another good reason for abandoning these cheques is that you're not covered by the Consumer Credit Act if something goes wrong with the goods you have bought and the retailer won't help. Credit card issuers aren't obliged to come to your rescue in the way they are if a purchase is made with plastic, and the goods cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. </p> <p><strong> Cut your consumption</strong> </p> <p>Unless you already manage to survive with one or two cards, why not get rid of the others? It'll solve the problem of where to keep all the shop loyalty cards you may have, there will be fewer payment dates to remember and you'll have a lot less paper to keep track of. But which ones should go? </p> <p>If you are among the estimated 40 per cent of people who always pay bills off in full every month, first to go should be those aimed at people running a debt on their card which give no interest-free credit. Moneyfacts says these include Alliance &amp; Leicester Diamond, Bank of Scotland One Visa, Co-op Bank Advantage Visa (both normal and gold versions), Halifax Visa Balance, Hamilton Direct Bank Visa and Sainsbury's Bank Merit Visa. </p> <p>Once you've cut up and cancelled these, consider ditching those for which you pay a fee ,such as American Express Blue Amex, Clydes-dale Mastercard, Co-op Bank Gold Base Rate Visa, HSBC Platinum Visa, Popular Bank Gold Visa and the Woolwich Secured Mastercard, as well as those which may be about to charge. Cards which don't have a first-year fee but do after that include American Express Gold Amex and Green Amex, Capital Bank Sterling Visa, Halifax Gold Mastercard, HSBC Gold Visa and Ulster Bank Gold Mastercard. </p> <p>With Barclaycard and Barclaycard Gold, First Direct Gold Visa, Halifax Visa and NatWest's Amex card, you'll avoid the fee only if you meet the card issuer's minimum spending requirements. </p> <p>Ideally, that leaves cards which give something back, as a donation to charity, in Air Miles (or other loyalty points) or as hard cash. </p> <p>Sainsbury's customers collecting Air Miles with a NatWest credit card may like to know that switching to the Classic Visa from Sainsbury's Bank (0500 405060) could more than treble their miles. </p> <p>If you would rather have money, the most generous cashback card is from Egg (apply at <a href=\"http://www.egg.com\">www.egg.com</a> it gives 1 per cent of anything you spend (2 per cent of purchases at its online shopping zone). If you don't have Internet access, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (0800 917 1333) refunds 0.5 per cent of spending up to \u00a32,000; 1 per cent on amounts over that. The MoneyBack cards from Alliance &amp; Leicester (0500 838383) apply the same percentages, but you won't get the higher rate until your spending exceeds \u00a34,000. </p> <p><strong> Dust off your debts</strong> </p> <p>If you are running credit card debts, your best way of getting cash back is to reduce the interest you pay. </p> <p> Which? reckons someone transferring a \u00a31,000 debt from a card with an APR of 19.9 per cent to a card with a six-month introductory 'teaser' rate of 5 per cent or less, with a follow-up rate of around 15 per cent, could save around \u00a370; the savings are more if the teaser rate stays until the balance is paid. </p> <p>Debts transferred to Tesco Visa (0800 406050) attract a teaser rate of 4.9 per cent until the end of this year; those to Egg Visa, a rate of 4.5 per cent for six months. After that it is a cheapish 9.9 per cent. </p> <p>Rather than offer a teaser rate on debt transfers, some cards offer a low rate only for new purchases, so check the small print. The best deal if you want to use a credit card to spread the cost of a new purchase over several months is from Capital One (0800 952 5252). Its Premier Visa Card charges no interest on new purchases until the end of June, followed by a reasonable 11.9 per cent. </p> <p><strong> Current account quiz</strong> </p> <p>Before you can declare your spending power truly pristine, take a hard look at your cashcard and the current account it belongs to. If you give a helping hand to the shareholders of Alliance &amp; Leicester, Barclays, Co-op, Lloyds TSB or NatWest by paying a monthly fee when you overdraw, you should consider changing your bank arrangements. Overdrafts from Abbey National, Bank of Scotland, First Direct, the Halifax, HSBC, Nationwide and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) are fee-free. </p> <p>Paying from \u00a348 to \u00a3108 a year even when you are in credit is unnecessary. Even if the perks with 'packaged' accounts such as Barclays Additions, First Direct Premier Cheque, Lloyds TSB Gold Service or Select, NatWest Advantage Gold and the RBS Royalties accounts seem attractive, they are rarely worth the fees. In most cases, you will do better to take your business elsewhere. </p> <p>If your current account costs you nothing, now sift your savings accounts to ensure they are not lagging behind the best on offer (see Databank, page 18).</p>",

If they are saying you're carrying around expensive, unnecessary clutter, the time has come to give them the once over. But where to start? Say no to store cards If you are striving for simplicity in your financial affairs, the first thing to go should be any store cards. Since the demise of its 'no credit cards' policy last September, you really have no excuse for hanging on to a John Lewis or Waitrose card - even if it did always stand out as a reasonable deal compared with other stores' cards. Marks &amp; Spencer Charge-card holders can cite the convenience of shopping on credit as a good excuse for holding on to their cards only until after May, when M&amp;S plans to start taking 'normal' credit cards (although this could happen earlier). As far as cards from other stores go, unless you genuinely make use of their temptations to spend more in the form of sales previews, special offers and/or a free catalogue, they are just cluttering up your purse or wallet and adding to your pile of statements. If you use the store cards to borrow, you should definitely get rid of them. The interest rates they charge (see table) are more than twice the rate of much better value credit cards.

The John Lewis and Waitrose cards were a lot less expensive, but still cost an extra \u00a35. Chuck out the cheques No one is suggesting you do away with your current-account cheque book, but a strong candidate for the bin is the chequebook some issuers provide with their credit card. When you write a credit-card cheque, the amount is added to your card bill, so they can be convenient if whoever you are paying doesn't take plastic.

Another good reason for abandoning these cheques is that you're not covered by the Consumer Credit Act if something goes wrong with the goods you have bought and the retailer won't help. Credit card issuers aren't obliged to come to your rescue in the way they are if a purchase is made with plastic, and the goods cost between \u00a3100 and \u00a330,000. Cut your consumption Unless you already manage to survive with one or two cards, why not get rid of the others? It'll solve the problem of where to keep all the shop loyalty cards you may have, there will be fewer payment dates to remember and you'll have a lot less paper to keep track of. But which ones should go? If you are among the estimated 40 per cent of people who always pay bills off in full every month, first to go should be those aimed at people running a debt on their card which give no interest-free credit. Moneyfacts says these include Alliance &amp; Leicester Diamond, Bank of Scotland One Visa, Co-op Bank Advantage Visa (both normal and gold versions), Halifax Visa Balance, Hamilton Direct Bank Visa and Sainsbury's Bank Merit Visa. Once you've cut up and cancelled these, consider ditching those for which you pay a fee ,such as American Express Blue Amex, Clydes-dale Mastercard, Co-op Bank Gold Base Rate Visa, HSBC Platinum Visa, Popular Bank Gold Visa and the Woolwich Secured Mastercard, as well as those which may be about to charge. Cards which don't have a first-year fee but do after that include American Express Gold Amex and Green Amex, Capital Bank Sterling Visa, Halifax Gold Mastercard, HSBC Gold Visa and Ulster Bank Gold Mastercard. With Barclaycard and Barclaycard Gold, First Direct Gold Visa, Halifax Visa and NatWest's Amex card, you'll avoid the fee only if you meet the card issuer's minimum spending requirements. Ideally, that leaves cards which give something back, as a donation to charity, in Air Miles (or other loyalty points) or as hard cash. Sainsbury's customers collecting Air Miles with a NatWest credit card may like to know that switching to the Classic Visa from Sainsbury's Bank (0500 405060) could more than treble their miles. If you would rather have money, the most generous cashback card is from Egg (apply at www.egg.com it gives 1 per cent of anything you spend (2 per cent of purchases at its online shopping zone). If you don't have Internet access, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (0800 917 1333) refunds 0.5 per cent of spending up to \u00a32,000; 1 per cent on amounts over that. The MoneyBack cards from Alliance &amp; Leicester (0500 838383) apply the same percentages, but you won't get the higher rate until your spending exceeds \u00a34,000. Dust off your debts If you are running credit card debts, your best way of getting cash back is to reduce the interest you pay. Which? reckons someone transferring a \u00a31,000 debt from a card with an APR of 19.9 per cent to a card with a six-month introductory 'teaser' rate of 5 per cent or less, with a follow-up rate of around 15 per cent, could save around \u00a370; the savings are more if the teaser rate stays until the balance is paid. Debts transferred to Tesco Visa (0800 406050) attract a teaser rate of 4.9 per cent until the end of this year; those to Egg Visa, a rate of 4.5 per cent for six months. After that it is a cheapish 9.9 per cent. Rather than offer a teaser rate on debt transfers, some cards offer a low rate only for new purchases, so check the small print. The best deal if you want to use a credit card to spread the cost of a new purchase over several months is from Capital One (0800 952 5252). Its Premier Visa Card charges no interest on new purchases until the end of June, followed by a reasonable 11.9 per cent. Current account quiz Before you can declare your spending power truly pristine, take a hard look at your cashcard and the current account it belongs to. If you give a helping hand to the shareholders of Alliance &amp; Leicester, Barclays, Co-op, Lloyds TSB or NatWest by paying a monthly fee when you overdraw, you should consider changing your bank arrangements. Overdrafts from Abbey National, Bank of Scotland, First Direct, the Halifax, HSBC, Nationwide and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) are fee-free. Paying from \u00a348 to \u00a3108 a year even when you are in credit is unnecessary. Even if the perks with 'packaged' accounts such as Barclays Additions, First Direct Premier Cheque, Lloyds TSB Gold Service or Select, NatWest Advantage Gold and the RBS Royalties accounts seem attractive, they are rarely worth the fees. In most cases, you will do better to take your business elsewhere. If your current account costs you nothing, now sift your savings accounts to ensure they are not lagging behind the best on offer (see Databank, page 18).",

She explains: 'As with, I suspect, many people in the run-up to retirement, I am becoming anxious as to just how comfortable we will be.' </p> <p>She and her husband Timothy, have no money problems at the moment. They can comfortably afford their mortgage, they have been able to save quite a bit, and their two sons are grown up and self-sufficient. But Monica is concerned about the income they will have to live on once Timothy retires. She wants to know whether they ought to restrict their spending now to ensure they will have enough later on. </p> <p>She explains: 'It has got to the stage when my first thought about any expenditure of a vaguely major nature, such as a modest holiday or having the bathroom retiled is: Can we afford it? We can afford it now, but can we afford to eat into our savings?' </p> <p>She does not know how much income Timothy's pensions will produce, nor how much they will need to live on. She adds sadly: 'Some of the pleasure has gone out of life because of all this worrying.' </p> <p>Timothy will retire in 2007 when he is 65. He is a weather forecaster on offshore oil rigs. His basic salary is around \u00a324,000, although actual pay depends on overtime. He will get a Civil Service pension based on some 14 years' previous service, paying around \u00a33,500 a year. In his present job, he is in a non-contributory company pension scheme, but his employer contributes only \u00a3290 a month and, since 1983, his pensions have grown to just \u00a395,500. He also has a free-standing AVC worth \u00a334,000, but stopped paying into this in 1998 because he thought he had been sold the wrong product. </p> <p>Instead, every spare penny is going, or has gone, into unit trusts, investment trusts, Peps, Isas, Tessa, and 'any other scheme I can find', says Monica. She has thought carefully about what to buy, so these are spread across the UK, Europe, US and the Far East. </p> <p>But she still feels she needs to save as much as she can, particularly in Isas. This may involve switching some of the unit trusts outside Peps or Isas: 'I plan to save the maximum in maxi Isas, using money from salary and unit trust or share sales. </p> <p>She pleads: 'If you were able to help set my mind at rest and give me some idea of how much income we can expect in retirement, I would be extremely grateful.' </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Ian Millward</strong></p> <p>Monica is sensible to put retirement at the top of her agenda: they still have seven years to save. </p> <p>Timothy's pension seems low. They should check which fund the money is paid into: this close to retirement, they should not take too much risk. It may not be worth restarting the FSAVCs, as annuity rates are poor at the moment. </p> <p>They will almost certainly need investment income to supplement their pensions. They should choose investments from which they can withdraw 5 per cent a year after tax but where capital keeps pace with inflation. Based on their current savings, they could draw income of \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000. </p> <p>Monica is right to want to put the maximum into Isas, but if this involves selling shares or unit trusts, cost is the issue. She could use the windfall shares to part-fund a Maxi Isa. But, if she wants to use her existing unit trusts, the best policy is to buy them back with the current manager. Many, but not all, groups take the pragmatic approach that it is in their interests to hang on to the money so the cost can be minimal. Monica should check beforehand in case they try to charge a new bid-offer spread. </p> <p>\u0095 Ian Millward works for Bath-based Chase de Vere</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Paul Garwood</strong></p> <p>Timothy should get pension valuations from the Civil Service, his personal pension and the Benefits Agency. The Civil Service pension could provide around \u00a33,650 a year, increasing with inflation and including a 50 per cent widow's pension. </p> <p>His personal pension, based on 7 per cent growth, should give about \u00a3220,000 at retirement to buy an annuity. This could provide \u00a315,400 with no reduction on Timothy's death, or \u00a317,160 halving on his death, or \u00a320,350 with no pension for Monica. </p> <p>They have \u00a372,000 in stock market-based investments, and \u00a340,000 in cash. They should regularly check that the interest they receive is competitive. </p> <p>Their stock market investments might produce income of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, while cash deposits should pay at least 6 per cent. This provides an annual income of about \u00a34,200, hopefully with capital growth. </p> <p>My only concern is that, the starting pensions look reasonable, but they ought to consider inflation protection, either by taking a lower starting pension or by foregoing income in favour of capital growth. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Garwood works for Smith &amp; Williamson in London </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only. </p>",

Instead, every spare penny is going, or has gone, into unit trusts, investment trusts, Peps, Isas, Tessa, and 'any other scheme I can find', says Monica. She has thought carefully about what to buy, so these are spread across the UK, Europe, US and the Far East. But she still feels she needs to save as much as she can, particularly in Isas. This may involve switching some of the unit trusts outside Peps or Isas: 'I plan to save the maximum in maxi Isas, using money from salary and unit trust or share sales. She pleads: 'If you were able to help set my mind at rest and give me some idea of how much income we can expect in retirement, I would be extremely grateful.' Adviser 1: Ian Millward Monica is sensible to put retirement at the top of her agenda: they still have seven years to save. Timothy's pension seems low. They should check which fund the money is paid into: this close to retirement, they should not take too much risk. It may not be worth restarting the FSAVCs, as annuity rates are poor at the moment. They will almost certainly need investment income to supplement their pensions. They should choose investments from which they can withdraw 5 per cent a year after tax but where capital keeps pace with inflation. Based on their current savings, they could draw income of \u00a35,000 to \u00a36,000. Monica is right to want to put the maximum into Isas, but if this involves selling shares or unit trusts, cost is the issue. She could use the windfall shares to part-fund a Maxi Isa. But, if she wants to use her existing unit trusts, the best policy is to buy them back with the current manager. Many, but not all, groups take the pragmatic approach that it is in their interests to hang on to the money so the cost can be minimal. Monica should check beforehand in case they try to charge a new bid-offer spread. \u0095 Ian Millward works for Bath-based Chase de Vere Adviser 2: Paul Garwood Timothy should get pension valuations from the Civil Service, his personal pension and the Benefits Agency. The Civil Service pension could provide around \u00a33,650 a year, increasing with inflation and including a 50 per cent widow's pension. His personal pension, based on 7 per cent growth, should give about \u00a3220,000 at retirement to buy an annuity. This could provide \u00a315,400 with no reduction on Timothy's death, or \u00a317,160 halving on his death, or \u00a320,350 with no pension for Monica. They have \u00a372,000 in stock market-based investments, and \u00a340,000 in cash. They should regularly check that the interest they receive is competitive. Their stock market investments might produce income of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, while cash deposits should pay at least 6 per cent. This provides an annual income of about \u00a34,200, hopefully with capital growth. My only concern is that, the starting pensions look reasonable, but they ought to consider inflation protection, either by taking a lower starting pension or by foregoing income in favour of capital growth. \u0095 Paul Garwood works for Smith &amp; Williamson in London Advice is for guidance only.",

Well, apart from impressing people, it is portable wealth that in hard times can be converted into cash - perhaps \u00a3500 from a dealer for a stainless steel Rolex Oyster, or \u00a32,000, if he is lucky, for an Oyster Perpetual Chronometer, Explorer model. </p> <p>Pawnbrokers love Rolexes, whereas dealers, auctioneers and 'wristie' aficionados shake their heads over them, saying they are over-hyped. They are not hand-made; Rolex's production line churns out 200,000 of them a year, compared with the mere 10,000-15,000 genuinely hand-made watches assembled by the skilled craftsmen of Patek Philippe. </p> <p>But that's Rolex for you. They are in a class of their own, a singular example of a commodity that holds its value because of constant demand by the undiscerning - rather than the opinion of connoisseurs. Never mind what the experts say; most people still think Rolex is the best watch you can buy - so they remain valuable. </p> <p>Richard Chadwick, watch specialist at Christie's South Kensington, in London, names two other makes, apart from Patek Philippe, that are almost as well known as Rolex: Cartier and Vacheron &amp; Constantin. </p> <p>As timepieces, they may be better value than Rolex, but they are more vulnerable to changes in fashion and ups and downs in the economy. Rolex prices were hardly shaken during the recession of the early Nineties, whereas Patek Philippe prices fell by up to two-thirds, especially at the top end of the market. </p> <p>Classic watches are luxuries, the first items to be unloaded when unemployment looms. But whereas discerning City slickers may rush to trade in their Patek Philippes, undiscerning lorry drivers tend to hang on to their Rolexes until the bailiffs knock. </p> <p>Watch prices fell two years ago, perhaps because of the strength of the pound, but are now on the mend. Private buyers are rapidly overcoming their fear of auctions and bidding against dealers - having realised that they can buy a secondhand watch at auction for as little as a third of its retail price and half the price asked by dealers. About 30 per cent of bidders at Christie's South Kensington's watch sales are private buyers - double the number three years ago. </p> <p>The result is that the market is being driven increasingly by fashion. But - investors note - because private buyers are becoming more discerning, the fashion is to buy makes whose quality has gone unrecognised: the opposite of the Rolex syndrome. </p> <p>Chadwick tips as up-and-comers these lesser-known quality watches: Breguet, Audemars Piguet, Jaeger Le Coultre and Blancpain. But his favourite is Omega. Until recently, Omegas were regarded as second- division, mainly because their bold, chunky Seventies designs had become unfashionable. They are now regarded as period pieces. Omega craftsmanship overtook Rolex's between 1930 and 1950, scoring a greater number of impressive observatory certificates for timekeeping in extreme cold and heat. </p> <p>It was the first make to be chosen as official timekeeper for the Olympic Games, in 1932, and the RAF chose them for its servicemen during the war. Omega's highly accurate chronometer model, launched in 1952, had overtaken Rolex in sales by 1958. </p> <p>But while Rolex's publicity successes tend to be remembered - the first woman Channel swimmer of 1927 wore one, Sherpa Tensing conquered Everest in one, and Paul Newman had one named after him - Omega's have been forgotten - except, perhaps, for the triumph of Neil Armstrong's Omega Speedmaster Professional, which he wore as he became the first man on the moon in 1969. Omega watches have since been on more than 50 space missions. </p> <p>Three years ago, you could pick up an Omega Speedmaster Professional at auction for \u00a3400 or less. At Chadwick's dedicated Omega auction last November, marking the thirtieth anniversary of the moon landing, a Speedmaster Professional 1994 sold for \u00a31,092 (including 15 per cent premium) and another, from 1990, for \u00a3970. </p> <p>As a whole, classic Omegas that sold for \u00a3250 at auction three years ago are now pushing \u00a31,000. They will rise further, judging by the demand from educated private buyers for historic, collectable models. Omega led the race to make a commercial waterproof watch and its Marine model of the Thirties, with ingenious sliding case, fetched \u00a32,070 at the November auction, against an estimate of \u00a31,000-\u00a31,500. Three years ago, the likely price would have been between \u00a3300 and \u00a3500. </p> <p>Among other quality up-and-comers is Jaeger Le Coultre, especially its clever Reverso model, with a reversible dial pivoted in a frame. It was originally designed in the early Thirties for British Army polo players in India, who kept smashing their watch dials. They are still in production. </p> <p>A recently made one is estimated at \u00a32,000-\u00a33,000 in Christie's South Kensington's next sale this month. A couple of years ago, only \u00a31,500 might have been expected. A Thirties Reverso in the same sale is estimated at \u00a31,500-\u00a32,500. It might have fetched \u00a31,000 a couple of years ago. </p> <p>The only way to ensure that the watch you buy is in perfect condition is to buy new. Unlike dealers, auctioneers give no guarantees. And a few dealers maintain that a secondhand watch that has gone without cleaning for two years is irreversibly past its best. Chadwick disputes this. Doubts about condition are probably the biggest factor discouraging bidding at auction by private buyers, who do not know their way around a watch's innards. But is the premium price of the brand-new worth it, when at auction you can buy recently made watches for as little as a third of their retail value? </p> <p>All watches sold at Christie's have had their insides examined by the auctioneers, and you can ask for a free condition report on the watches you intend to bid for. </p> <p>More and more private buyers are plucking up the courage to compete with dealers in the saleroom. After all, a dealer must drop out of the bidding if the bids approach the price at which he knows he can sell at a profit. Private buyers may vex dealers by pumping up prices, but many privateers are carrying off watches at below dealers' prices. </p> <p>Watches seem likely to become one of those auction markets - such as furniture, modern design and contemporary art - that will reach sustainable highs because of pressure of demand from private buyers. </p> <p>In this month's auction, will it be a private buyer or a dealer who snaps a up an eccentric Vacheron &amp; Constantin watch with a map of Thailand on its dial, at an estimated \u00a312,000-\u00a315,000? It was bought brand new only last December - for a whopping \u00a338,000 - and comes complete with box, booklet and original packaging. </p> <p>If you are really, really, smart, you will already have put your name down for a new Cosmograph Daytona, with the intention of bunging it straight into auction. The retail price is \u00a33,300, but there is a waiting list and they have been selling at auction for between \u00a34,000 and \u00a35,000 - a nice little earner. The make? Rolex. </p> <p>\u0095 Important Watches, Christie's South Kensington, 29 March (2pm). Call 020-7581 7611</p>",

At Chadwick's dedicated Omega auction last November, marking the thirtieth anniversary of the moon landing, a Speedmaster Professional 1994 sold for \u00a31,092 (including 15 per cent premium) and another, from 1990, for \u00a3970. As a whole, classic Omegas that sold for \u00a3250 at auction three years ago are now pushing \u00a31,000. They will rise further, judging by the demand from educated private buyers for historic, collectable models. Omega led the race to make a commercial waterproof watch and its Marine model of the Thirties, with ingenious sliding case, fetched \u00a32,070 at the November auction, against an estimate of \u00a31,000-\u00a31,500. Three years ago, the likely price would have been between \u00a3300 and \u00a3500. Among other quality up-and-comers is Jaeger Le Coultre, especially its clever Reverso model, with a reversible dial pivoted in a frame. It was originally designed in the early Thirties for British Army polo players in India, who kept smashing their watch dials. They are still in production. A recently made one is estimated at \u00a32,000-\u00a33,000 in Christie's South Kensington's next sale this month. A couple of years ago, only \u00a31,500 might have been expected. A Thirties Reverso in the same sale is estimated at \u00a31,500-\u00a32,500. It might have fetched \u00a31,000 a couple of years ago. The only way to ensure that the watch you buy is in perfect condition is to buy new. Unlike dealers, auctioneers give no guarantees. And a few dealers maintain that a secondhand watch that has gone without cleaning for two years is irreversibly past its best. Chadwick disputes this. Doubts about condition are probably the biggest factor discouraging bidding at auction by private buyers, who do not know their way around a watch's innards. But is the premium price of the brand-new worth it, when at auction you can buy recently made watches for as little as a third of their retail value? All watches sold at Christie's have had their insides examined by the auctioneers, and you can ask for a free condition report on the watches you intend to bid for. More and more private buyers are plucking up the courage to compete with dealers in the saleroom. After all, a dealer must drop out of the bidding if the bids approach the price at which he knows he can sell at a profit. Private buyers may vex dealers by pumping up prices, but many privateers are carrying off watches at below dealers' prices. Watches seem likely to become one of those auction markets - such as furniture, modern design and contemporary art - that will reach sustainable highs because of pressure of demand from private buyers. In this month's auction, will it be a private buyer or a dealer who snaps a up an eccentric Vacheron &amp; Constantin watch with a map of Thailand on its dial, at an estimated \u00a312,000-\u00a315,000? It was bought brand new only last December - for a whopping \u00a338,000 - and comes complete with box, booklet and original packaging. If you are really, really, smart, you will already have put your name down for a new Cosmograph Daytona, with the intention of bunging it straight into auction. The retail price is \u00a33,300, but there is a waiting list and they have been selling at auction for between \u00a34,000 and \u00a35,000 - a nice little earner. The make?

      "body": "<p>For a progressive forward-looking organisation which is regarded as a high-tech, leading-edge pioneer of remote banking, First Direct - winner of the best customer service overall category - has a refreshingly traditional explanation for its success. </p> <p>'It's our people,' says First Direct chief executive Alan Hughes. 'Our customers don't want to buy financial services. They want to feel good. They want reassurance that they are in control, that they are known as an individual. </p> <p>'We're happy to show our competitors around our operations. Often we'll come to the end of the tour and they'll shake their heads and say, \"but we still don't understand what it is that you do differently\". Our people, we tell them, are the only difference. </p> <p>'In the way that we recruit our people and manage them, we are encouraging them to treat the customers as their friends and to let their personalities shine through.' </p> <p>To work at First Direct, conversational skills are of paramount importance. 'The ticket to the game may be the banking transaction, but customers don't remember the transaction,' says Hughes. 'But they do remember the conversation.' </p> <p>First Direct has had the field to itself since it leapfrogged the banking world more than 10 years ago by offering the UK's first 24-hour telephone banking service. It now has almost a million customers and more are joining up - at the rate of 10,000 every month. </p> <p>The bank's record on customer service is staggeringly impressive. In a recent NOP survey, 86 per cent of customers said that they were either 'extremely' or 'very' satisfied with the service it provides; 80 per cent said banking with First Direct was better than banking with other banks; and 76 per cent had recommended First Direct to friends and colleagues in the past 12 months. </p> <p>Now 24-hour banking is an industry standard. Which bank doesn't have a telephone banking arm? So how has First Direct maintained its competitive edge? According to Hughes, more bank customers are transferring their accounts to First Direct than to any other bank. </p> <p>'Customers want to be known as an individual,' explains Hughes. 'And when they call us again, they can pick up exactly from where they left off. It's as if the 4,000 of us are one. Even if you know that staff at your local branch, it's unlikely that you'll get that kind of attention to detail.' </p> <p>According to Hughes, First Direct looks to the world of retail for its inspiration. 'Most of our customers bank only with us - but they do deal with other retailers, and that's who they judge us against.' </p> <p>Hughes' favourite retailer? 'It would have to be the John Lewis Partnership, because when I talk to someone there it is evident that they care, that they want to serve you, that they're actually on your side.' </p> <p>As might be expected, First Direct is investing heavily in Internet banking. But while other banks may have been quicker to roll out their websites, First Direct has been working at its own pace, trying to work out ways of injecting some personality online. </p> <p>'We are dubbing our firstdirect.com initiative the Internet bank you can talk to,' says Hughes. 'The technology is changing, but the principles remain the same. </p> <p>'One in five of our customers already deals with us via the screen. But we've found that while the routine enquiries are done over the screen, customers prefer to call us when they want to do something more complex. With Internet banking, the number of calls may fall, but the level of intensity within calls will go up. </p> <p>'Banking with a screen enables us to give our customers a greater choice of information. It makes it simple for them to be in control, and it shifts the balance of power in their favour. We won't be afraid, for example, to give our customers information on what other products and services there are in the marketplace. </p> <p>'Banks are only just learning about retailing. Some may say that giving customers more information is a dangerous strategy. But in our opinion the only dangerous strategy is not giving customers what they want.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "For a progressive forward-looking organisation which is regarded as a high-tech, leading-edge pioneer of remote banking, First Direct - winner of the best customer service overall category - has a refreshingly traditional explanation for its success. 'It's our people,' says First Direct chief executive Alan Hughes. 'Our customers don't want to buy financial services. They want to feel good. They want reassurance that they are in control, that they are known as an individual. 'We're happy to show our competitors around our operations. Often we'll come to the end of the tour and they'll shake their heads and say, \"but we still don't understand what it is that you do differently\". Our people, we tell them, are the only difference. 'In the way that we recruit our people and manage them, we are encouraging them to treat the customers as their friends and to let their personalities shine through.' To work at First Direct, conversational skills are of paramount importance. 'The ticket to the game may be the banking transaction, but customers don't remember the transaction,' says Hughes. 'But they do remember the conversation.' First Direct has had the field to itself since it leapfrogged the banking world more than 10 years ago by offering the UK's first 24-hour telephone banking service. It now has almost a million customers and more are joining up - at the rate of 10,000 every month. The bank's record on customer service is staggeringly impressive. In a recent NOP survey, 86 per cent of customers said that they were either 'extremely' or 'very' satisfied with the service it provides; 80 per cent said banking with First Direct was better than banking with other banks; and 76 per cent had recommended First Direct to friends and colleagues in the past 12 months. Now 24-hour banking is an industry standard. Which bank doesn't have a telephone banking arm? So how has First Direct maintained its competitive edge? According to Hughes, more bank customers are transferring their accounts to First Direct than to any other bank. 'Customers want to be known as an individual,' explains Hughes. 'And when they call us again, they can pick up exactly from where they left off. It's as if the 4,000 of us are one. Even if you know that staff at your local branch, it's unlikely that you'll get that kind of attention to detail.' According to Hughes, First Direct looks to the world of retail for its inspiration. 'Most of our customers bank only with us - but they do deal with other retailers, and that's who they judge us against.' Hughes' favourite retailer? 'It would have to be the John Lewis Partnership, because when I talk to someone there it is evident that they care, that they want to serve you, that they're actually on your side.' As might be expected, First Direct is investing heavily in Internet banking. But while other banks may have been quicker to roll out their websites, First Direct has been working at its own pace, trying to work out ways of injecting some personality online. 'We are dubbing our firstdirect.com initiative the Internet bank you can talk to,' says Hughes. 'The technology is changing, but the principles remain the same. 'One in five of our customers already deals with us via the screen. But we've found that while the routine enquiries are done over the screen, customers prefer to call us when they want to do something more complex. With Internet banking, the number of calls may fall, but the level of intensity within calls will go up. 'Banking with a screen enables us to give our customers a greater choice of information. It makes it simple for them to be in control, and it shifts the balance of power in their favour. We won't be afraid, for example, to give our customers information on what other products and services there are in the marketplace. 'Banks are only just learning about retailing. Some may say that giving customers more information is a dangerous strategy. But in our opinion the only dangerous strategy is not giving customers what they want.'",

When I went to the dole office to sign on, they told me I could not get any more money for two weeks. This is how the system works. My money was gone by the end of the first week and I needed to eat. So I burgled a hotel room while the people were downstairs.' </p> <p>He lived off credit card fraud for a few days - but was caught and back inside within a fortnight. 'It's not easy to get a job with a criminal record. Far too often, people get so fed up being rejected that they get out the addresses of people they met inside, and they do a job.' </p> <p> Like most other criminals, he says, he never felt guilt while stealing people's wallets or other belongings: 'Criminals very rarely have a conscience: if you did, you'd be racked with guilt.' Eventually, he ended up in a humane jail, Grendon Underwood in Buckinghamshire, where, in therapy and counselling, he analysed his criminality and set it aside.

Nationwide is the best and most broad-minded, he says; Lloyds TSB is the worst. Another campaign is to prevent the disaster he expects will follow the start of the Criminal Records Agency by the end of this year - an easy way for employers to check on criminal records.

Even Presidents Clinton and Blair have tumbled to this, as witnessed by their well-intentioned but vacuous statement last week about patenting the human genome. But while the IP problems posed by genetic research lie some distance ahead, those posed by the Internet and the US Office of Trademarks and Patents are very real and present. </p> <p>Most people assume you have to be clever to be awarded a patent.

Even Presidents Clinton and Blair have tumbled to this, as witnessed by their well-intentioned but vacuous statement last week about patenting the human genome. But while the IP problems posed by genetic research lie some distance ahead, those posed by the Internet and the US Office of Trademarks and Patents are very real and present.

If not, you could end up chasing vacancies that don't exist - or even find your CV landing on your own manager's desk. The Department of Trade and Industry recently proposed changes to the Employment Agencies Act specifically designed to curb unethical practices among Internet recruiters. Concerns include websites copying vacancies from one another and fabricating jobs to attract CVs and the indiscriminate circulation of CVs potentially compromising a job hunter's position with his own employer. But doubts remain about whether the proposed law, due for debate in Parliament later this year, will be enforceable. 'The changes in legislation are not enough,' says Dave Ferguson, chief executive of ethical online recruitment firm 1st-Wave.com.
