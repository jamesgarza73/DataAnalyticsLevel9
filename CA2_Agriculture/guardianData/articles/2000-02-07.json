For if this were routine, football would surely have to carry a health warning for those of a nervous disposition. </p> <p>Such was the level of testosterone engulfing Sunderland's palatial home that the beating of chests was louder at times than the pre-match beating of tribal drums. But if Operation Tyne-Wear was not a place for the faint-hearted, those of stronger stuff will remember the 120th derby as that collectors' item, a game that lived up to all the hype with an atmosphere to match. The upshot of a captivating north-east skirmish brimming with blood and thunder, not to mention occasional moments of thud and blunder, was a deserved point apiece but indisputably a moral victory for Sunderland after salvaging an improbable draw to go with the 2-1 win that hastened Gullit's removal from office at St James' Park last September. </p> <p>At one stage it had looked like a damage-limitation exercise after early goals from Didier Domi and Helder had given Newcastle the chance to wrench back local bragging rights. But that view did not take into account the predatory instincts of Kevin Phillips, the man who used to clean Shearer's boots and now threatens to fill them as the country's finest striker. </p> <p>His near-telepathic understanding with Niall Quinn made sure Newcastle's two- goal lead lasted little more than 60 seconds and his equaliser eight minutes from time, albeit from an apparently offside position, sparked unbridled scenes of pandemonium among all but 2,000 of a 42,902 stadium-record crowd. Perhaps it had been tempting fate for Newcastle's Greek defender Nikos Dabizas to dismiss Phillips' little-and-large partnership with Quinn as \"predictable\". \"I suppose it has become a bit predictable, them scoring all the time,\" mused Peter Reid. </p> <p>Through clenched teeth Robson declared that he had enjoyed the occasion, but his demeanour told another story. Newcastle had enough first-half chances to put the game beyond doubt, and the broken leg suffered by their left-back Alessandro Pistone in a heavy challenge from Gavin McCann added to the irritation. \"I didn't like the tackle, put it that way,\" said Robson. </p> <p>Phillips has now scored 21 goals in only 22 Premiership games - already more than the previous two Golden Boot winners - and this month he may well partner Shearer in England's attack against Argentina. There is certainly no one better qualified. </p> <p>\"England have a lot of good strikers but Kevin recommends himself,\" said Sunderland's midfielder Stefan Schwarz. \"The best striker I have ever played with is Gabriel Batistuta [at Fiorentina] but Kevin is almost there. He is not happy with what he has achieved; he always wants more, and that makes him a special player.\"</p>",

His near-telepathic understanding with Niall Quinn made sure Newcastle's two- goal lead lasted little more than 60 seconds and his equaliser eight minutes from time, albeit from an apparently offside position, sparked unbridled scenes of pandemonium among all but 2,000 of a 42,902 stadium-record crowd. Perhaps it had been tempting fate for Newcastle's Greek defender Nikos Dabizas to dismiss Phillips' little-and-large partnership with Quinn as \"predictable\". \"I suppose it has become a bit predictable, them scoring all the time,\" mused Peter Reid. Through clenched teeth Robson declared that he had enjoyed the occasion, but his demeanour told another story. Newcastle had enough first-half chances to put the game beyond doubt, and the broken leg suffered by their left-back Alessandro Pistone in a heavy challenge from Gavin McCann added to the irritation. \"I didn't like the tackle, put it that way,\" said Robson. Phillips has now scored 21 goals in only 22 Premiership games - already more than the previous two Golden Boot winners - and this month he may well partner Shearer in England's attack against Argentina. There is certainly no one better qualified. \"England have a lot of good strikers but Kevin recommends himself,\" said Sunderland's midfielder Stefan Schwarz. \"The best striker I have ever played with is Gabriel Batistuta [at Fiorentina] but Kevin is almost there. He is not happy with what he has achieved; he always wants more, and that makes him a special player.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\"Her house,\" says Michael Foot, standing alone in a sitting room in Hampstead. \"Her garden.\" He is leaning against the door jamb, the weight of his body seemingly held in one gripped hand. He says this in a curt, matter-of-fact way. He nods his head towards the bay window, but he doesn't look through it. \"Her garden. Nothing to do with me. All hers. I'm afraid.\" And then he makes a strange noise, a sort of audible full stop, \"ny'hem\", which sounds like a laugh but could be a groan.</p> <p>He is very rickety. He bangs his body with his hands as if reminding himself where it is, thumps his knee as if urging his other limbs to be still. When he loses a word he puts a finger in his ear as if trying to retune. And when he walks, it's a negotiation between the world and his one good eye, one arm out to judge the distance. You have to keep remembering that he is 86 and that he has always been frail; that even as Labour leader during the 1983 election, he had the appearance of an old man. He does it to clothes too. There was the famous donkey jacket back then and today there is a voluminous knitted cardigan, coffee-stained and ink-splattered, that looks as if it's 50 years old. He got it for Christmas. But, for all this, everyone always said that in the company of his wife he lost years, that he twinkled, that they teased and flirted, that he always had one arm on her. Now that arm flails in the empty air.</p> <p>He took a time getting to the front door (and opening it, but that, to use one of his phrases, \"is another matter altogether\"). He had been looking at Byron's Letters, which he had read with her in Venice. \"It was 1978 when I was supposed to be in the bloody government and have no other interests but that. But we had a wonderful holiday. I suppose that's how we could afford it. We had some great holidays together. We've been to Venice many, many times. And then more recently to Dubrovnik, but that's another matter. Come to that later. But it was in Venice, in 1978, I first got on to Byron. Very late in life. I'm sorry to say. She was critical of him on some matters but gradually I put the case. So that was done with Jill. As everything.\" He slows down and takes a deep breath between each word. \"Pretty. Well. Was.\"</p> <p>It is less than two months since the death of Jill Craigie, film-maker, feminist, socialist, political and literary sparring partner. She was 85. She and Foot had been married for 50 years. She made her last film, Two Hours from London - a documentary about the Yugoslav conflict, paid for out of their life savings - only four years before. This time last year, she was giving sprightly interviews about her rape by Arthur Koestler in 1951. (She had always kept quiet about it, but the matter surfaced in a spat between David Cesarani, Koestler's biographer, and Frederic Raphael, who believed Craigie and Koestler's other victims should have been \"honoured\".) \"A good witness,\" said Foot fondly of his wife at the time.</p> <p>Then, last summer, she slipped in the bathroom and fractured her hip. There were complications with her heart, and for her last six months she was either in the Royal Free or in a bed in this sitting room, a room like all the rooms in the house, full of pictures and faded colour and books. Foot read to her every day.</p> <p>\"I still thought, you know, that we would have three or four more years when she'd come back,\" says her husband. He is talking with the same declamatory cadences one might use to give a political speech. \"Especially in the garden which was looking wonderful all the year so . . .\" He waves towards the window but still doesn't look up. \"BUT,\" the word comes as an explosion, out of the side of his mouth, \"when it actually happened finally there was a complication with her kidneys and the rest of it. Didn't work. SO it happened much more suddenly.\"</p> <p>They had talked a bit in the past about who would go first. \"We thought the chances were just about even.\" They had no children together, though she had a daughter from a previous marriage. Would she be worrying about you? \"Huh.\" He looks down at his hands, which are doing invisible crocheting. \"I don't know. She'd be laughing.\" I ask rather hopelessly if he still sees her in the house around him. \"No,\" he says. \"Both of us had the same views on these matters. We didn't believe in any afterlife or that kind of stuff. So . . . aaaaa, aye . . . aa . . . no, she's, you know. I'm not saying we didn't have a number of quarrels at varying times, I'm not going to go into that. But over the last 10 years I suppose we were getting closer on many things. So. It knocks the charm out of life.\"</p> <p>They married in 1949 - \"up there at Hampstead town hall\" - but had been lovers since they had met four years earlier in Plymouth, where Craigie was making a film and Foot was an MP. There were holidays even then, first in Nice. \"It was just after the end of the war and we were in this huge great palace hotel and hardly anyone else in the bloody place. But we were so nervous about bloody scandal we had to book two different rooms and I crawled around this big hotel late at night . . .\" When they got back to Hampstead there were reporters on the doorstep. \"And I said if they print anything derogatory about us, we'll print something derogatory about their proprietors in Tribune the week after. I knew about Beaverbrook, obviously, and even more so about the antics of Lord Rothermere. And they dispersed.\"</p> <p>Jill, \"My Jill\" as he says at one point, charmed everyone he knew. Beaverbrook, who employed him on the Express. His father, who adored her. Tom Driberg, \"who would come back from one these escapades in Moscow and used to walk up and down this room and pour things out to Jill he wouldn't mention to me\". Henry Moore and Stanley Spencer, about whom she made a film. Everyone fell in love with her, then? \"You bet. Yes. You bet. The whole lot.\" And did he find that difficult? He gives a grim laugh. \"That's a different question altogether.\"</p> <p>When he talks about their life together, it is people, but mainly books, that come to mind. The things they read, the things they talked about, disagreed about, came together over: Byron and Oscar Wilde and William Morris, and Rebecca West, whose rehabilitation he is adamant is due to the friendship and encouragement of Craigie. He refers to the last book Craigie read to herself, Francis Wheen's biography of Karl Marx (\"and she was very much in favour of it\"); the last book he read to her, Rebecca West's Letters in typescript.</p> <p>Politics, on the other hand, seem to impinge very little on his memory. Political discussions, yes. Craigie's arguments with Barbara Castle: \"Many here in this room\". Watching Nye Bevan speak in Devonport, and Craigie saying \"here's the chap to lead us\". Friendship with Donald Dewar, who used to live in the flat upstairs: \"not exactly a raging leftwinger, but a very fine chap\". But on the nitty gritty, the victories and the massive defeats of his political involvement, he is supremely detached. Of his own involvement he says \"supposed\" a lot, and is free with his expletives. \"When I was leader of the House of Commons and responsible, I suppose, for the legislation that was going through the bloody House of Commons . . .\" he says at one point. When, just after he had been elected leader of the Labour party, he went into hospital with a broken leg, \"I didn't want to take those damned Blue Books, so I took Don Juan.\" People often said, he goes on, that Jill had \"put me up to standing as leader, but that's not true at all\". However, she would, he says, \"have run Chequers very well, believe me\".</p> <p>Was she happy with Blair's government? \"N'yaaaaaaa,\" he says. \"I don't see it. No, she was anxious about a lot of things, you know.\" Her main disagreement, he says, \"was about the bomb and all that, because Jill is still, both of us, strong CND supporters. The government could certainly do much much more along those lines, and we still think they might. I miss her terribly on that front. Everything that happens . . . since . . . I'd like to have known what her views are.\"</p> <p>In her last few weeks she was very interested in the Hamilton trial. \"I used to go in there every day for the last week and say, 'What do you want first? The Hamiltons or not?' Not that she was a sadist - she was quite the opposite - but she was also interested in gossip and she thought the business of politicians taking these bloody bribes was a disgrace and she was very glad to see it exposed. She would have been very satisfied, in my opinion, with the result but I fear that it happened just two or three days after her . . . death.\"</p> <p>Foot has been holding a cup of coffee during the interview, which at times has looked as if it might spill on to the sofa cushions below his waving hand. Only now does he take a long gulp. He wipes his mouth. He says he has things he can get on with. The memorial service is behind him now, but there is to be a celebration of Craigie in Dubrovnik, where she is \"the uncrowned queen\". There is talk of a biography. He has a \"junket\" to Bermuda. Something else in Paris.</p> <p>Was she as proud of you, I ask, as you obviously were of her? He stutters for a while. He taps his leg. \"I don't know. She was wonderful to me without any doubt. Most of the fun I've had out of life is due to her and the things we did together. Was she proud of me? I don't know. She was not . . . ah . . .\" He opens his mouth but nothing comes out. Finally, he starts again: \"On political questions she was in agreement with what I wanted to do.\"</p> <p>There is a long silence while he fiddles with his ear. Then he says, \"She said, 'Lots of people will come and look after you, you know.' And I said, 'You're the only one I want.'\" And we both look out at the garden then.</p>",

Thus, Germany in 1947 turned its back on simple-minded PR and plumped for a mixed member proportional way to encourage stable coalitions.

They, to a man, can't think of another country lumbered with such a spatchcock collection of methods. It is not unusual to find varying methods selected for contrasting purpose: the two houses of the Australian parliament do that. Nor is it impossible to find more complex mixtures: the French blend first past the post, list systems and two-round systems on the way up the chain from parish council to national assembly - but their mixing, in the spirit of Napoleon, is determined and precise.

They are wobbling because their foundations don't fit.</p> <p>The logic of additional member PR for devolution looked impeccable. The Liberal Democrats wanted it, of course, but the arguments ran rather deeper. Devolution was Labour's way of ditching the Scots Nats. The electoral system, therefore, had to deliver a succession of coalitions which would keep Salmond's stags at bay in perpetuity in a way that first past the Edinburgh post could never do. There was much talk of kinder, gentler, more consensual politics. But is that really possible when the rhythm of national politics is still so overwhelmingly set by Westminster? Politicians like Donald Dewar, Jim Wallace and Salmond himself wear two irreconcilable hats, one Scottish, one British. The issues they bat back and forth - Section 28, student fees - have the same two dimensions, the calm and the ritually confrontational.

Already, just a handful of months in, Alun Michael's minority regime stands on the edge of collapse. Kinder, gentler? Just watch New Labour's FPTP byelection in Ceredigion turn up the PR heat in Cardiff. The two systems aren't separate, producing different kinds of behaviour. On the contrary, the Westminster way infects those who have to work in its shadow.</p> <p>See Dewar reel soon when Labour loses Ayr. That verdict will be conveniently read in Millbank as Scotland's verdict on its first devolved chief minister - but in fact the judgment of the voters will be delivered by a system specifically excluded from the Scottish dimension. Crazy! The Nats may not be able to throw Labour out of the Edinburgh action, but they can keep on driving first posts through its heart on the London line.</p> <p>The coming disasters, so considered, are absolutely foredoomed. They aren't the debacles of proportional representation or the old, hallowed model. They have nothing to do with Europe and everything to do with a muddled apology for a system which doesn't make sense. Austria couldn't keep Haider in his bottle. Tony Blair will haplessly guarantee the Nats their eventual glory unless he can make the pieces fit.

      "bodyText": "Royal Bank of Scotland last night found itself on the wrong end of bid speculation after reports that it is about to become the target of a hostile offer from Lloyds TSB. The speculation comes at a crucial time in RBS's own battle in competition with Bank of Scotland to take over NatWest Bank but chief executive Sir George Mathewson was quick to try to turn the situation to his bank's advantage. \"Clearly, Royal Bank of Scotland is seen as credible and capable of launching a major challenge to Lloyds TSB and beyond. Every business needs a good competitor and Lloyds TSB would view RBS-NatWest in this light.\" With the influential investors in NatWest, such as Prudential, Phillips &amp; Drew and Schroders, expected to decide today or tomorrow which of the outcomes for the clearing bank to support, rumours about a heavy hitting bid by Lloyds has the potential to cause further confusion. Lloyds refused to comment, but industry observers played down the chances of its wading into the battle, pointing out it had its hands full with its takeover of Scottish Widows, which is expected to be completed next month. It might also face competition concerns in Scotland where TSB, which it took over four years ago, has a substantial business. Sir George, along with his counterparts at BoS and NatWest, will this week meet big investors for the last time, to try to win their support.

The Wall Street Journal, one of the world's most famous newspapers, unleashes its long-awaited onslaught on European markets today with a redesign of its European edition, hefty investment to back expansion plans, and much improved coverage of the e-economy. </p> <p>Backed by $60m (\u00a336m) of investment and more staff, the European strategy is also designed to boost subscription numbers to the Journal's online edition and marks a huge escalation in the battle for eyeballs on business news websites. </p> <p>Frederick Kempe, editor and associate publisher of the Wall Street Journal Europe, says the move coincides with a change in European attitudes to business - as the euro begins to knit European business closer together and ordinary families begin to buy into share ownership. </p> <p>This enthusiasm for buying shares, Kempe says, is being fanned by the creation of a new economy. Technology is driving change into the way people work, invest and live. The Journal has covered technology more comprehensively than most papers for some time. With its reach into the west coast of America one way, and its strength in Asia the other, Kempe hopes that his new European edition will give readers a far better service than is available from, say, the Financial Times. </p> <p>If this sounds familiar, it should. The FT, owned by the media group Pearson, recently unveiled a joint venture with CBS.MarketWatch.com to set up a European business news service aimed at the private investor. </p> <p>But there is a huge difference between the Journal and the services offered by the Financial Times and its affiliates. Pearson is wedded to the concept of giving its online news content to users free, making money from advertising and e-commerce. </p> <p>The Journal is taking precisely the opposite line. Peter Kann, chairman and chief executive of Dow Jones which publishes the WSJ, says he is committed to the paid model, where users subscribe to the online service. This, he argues, protects the printed paper from being devalued by association with a give-away service, and will be better for advertisers too. </p> <p>In Europe on a flying visit to launch the redesign, Kann admits that neither he nor any newspaper publisher can know what the internet will do to their businesses in the long run. But he seems unflustered by the prospect of steering one of the world's most eminent papers on to the web. </p> <p>Formerly a staff reporter who worked in the Pittsburgh and Los Angeles news bureaux, Kann was the paper's first resident reporter in Vietnam and, from 1969 to 1975, covered Asian affairs. It was another war, though, that brought him into the limelight. In 1972 he won a Pulitzer for his coverage of the conflict between India and Pakistan. </p> <p>Kann is keen to protect the value of the WSJ brand by charging a hefty amount for the paper too. The cover price of the European edition will be cut from today to \u00a31 from \u00a31.25 as part of the plan to put the squeeze on the FT (price 85p). </p> <p>Kann's philosophy appears to fly in the face of conventional wisdom about how to succeed on the web, where users are accustomed to free services. In reality the marketing strategy makes more sense once the wealth of the European Journal's readership is known: 80% of the paper's readers are European nationals with an average household income of more than $330,000 (\u00a3205,000). </p> <p>Kann is aware that most US newspapers have made a hash of switching their content to the online world. Dow Jones has decided that it must try to leverage its different operations so that each reinforces, rather than detracts from, the other. This is not a new approach in the communications industry, where technology is forcing companies to operate in several media at once. At the Journal, the most obvious sign of this approach is in the redesigned European edition, where a navigation bar across the first page is a clear indication of its integration with wsj.com. </p> <p>Dow Jones will also be using its wire services to update wsj.com. Bylined pieces from the wires are already used in the paper. The aim is to take the wire feeds and re-edit them for a wider audience via the website. In this way wsj.com should emerge as a strong blend of analysis and moving news. </p> <p>Dow Jones executives argue that the wires may prove to be their best weapon in the battle ahead: no other rival internet-based service could justify the cost of 800 staff to provide dynamic news, but Dow Jones has this number on its wires already. The printed Journal, by contrast, has 600. </p> <p>Kann is also explicitly linking the online and paper editions by giving European subscribers to the printed Journal a free subscription to the online version for the rest of this year. </p> <p>\"The two can coexist and complement each other, performing different functions,\" he says. He also stresses that different people subscribe to the online version. Two-thirds of wsj.com's 375,000 subscribers do not take the printed paper (paid global circulation, 2.3m). Kann says wsj.com growth will come from both online-only subscribers and people taking it as a package with the paper. </p> <p>That people should want both may seem strange, given the surfeit of information already flying around. But it may be evidence that the Journal is managing to strike a balance between its different services. </p> <p>Kann says people turn to the paper for analysis and to the online edition for up-to-date breaking news. But he stresses that the common denominator is quality of information. And that in turn leads him to a defence of traditional media as much more reliable in the main than fledgling internet start-ups. \"In defence of traditional media, it has standards and generally doesn't want to sacrifice these across different media and that is right.\" </p> <p>Kann faces some tough challenges ahead, not least in the management of his people. He has yet to make up his mind on how to incentivise the staff and ensure that they are not poached wholesale by rivals, but points out that the company already offers bonuses to some. </p> <p>He has also to decide how far integration of the wires, online edition and printed paper should go. For the moment, not that far seems to be the view. He says the editors of the different editions work alongside one another while remaining focused on their respective charges. He dismisses out of hand the concept of a centralised editing team to act as a clearing house for material - \"just another level of bureaucracy\" - and is happy for now with this looser arrangement. </p> <p>Kann acknowledges that the Journal is not a typical publication. The average household income of its readers is high, and its content based mostly on one slice of life. But other newspaper publishers will be watching the Dow Jones strategy closely, and not just in Europe. For if Kann succeeds, he may shatter forever the notion that the internet has to be based on free delivery. Publishers, if not readers, will be grateful.</p>",

The script which has been kept under wraps because of right-wing violence during the making of Mehta's first two films, <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0116308\">Fire</a> and <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0150433\">Earth</a>, is thought to be about the sexual exploitation of impoverished widows during the 30s and an inter-caste relationship. Home Secretary L.K. Advani has said that there must be consensus between the producer and the protestors before the film can continue.</p> <p> \u0095 Despite her recent negative pronouncements on feminism <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,42337,00.html\">Kate Winslet</a> has turned down an opportunity to play every feminist's bete-noir, Bridget Jones. Hollywood has just finished the complicated translation of Helen Fielding's fragmentary novel, The Diary of Bridget Jones, to screenplay, and hopes to start filming this summer with someone of Winslet's stature playing the role of the helpless thirty-something desperate to get a man, but Winslet isn't interested. A source close to star says, \"Kate is a serious actor, so how could she be expected to be convincing as a woman who agonises between an expedition to the fridge or a journey to the bathroom scales?\" </p> <p>The news should please Fielding, who has always indicated that she would prefer an unknown actor to bring Bridget's diary to life.

The order came after a supporter of the militant Hindu Shiv Sena party tried to commit suicide in protest against the film, the last part in the Indian-born director's trilogy about her homeland. The script which has been kept under wraps because of right-wing violence during the making of Mehta's first two films, Fire and Earth, is thought to be about the sexual exploitation of impoverished widows during the 30s and an inter-caste relationship. Home Secretary L.K. Advani has said that there must be consensus between the producer and the protestors before the film can continue. \u0095 Despite her recent negative pronouncements on feminism Kate Winslet has turned down an opportunity to play every feminist's bete-noir, Bridget Jones. Hollywood has just finished the complicated translation of Helen Fielding's fragmentary novel, The Diary of Bridget Jones, to screenplay, and hopes to start filming this summer with someone of Winslet's stature playing the role of the helpless thirty-something desperate to get a man, but Winslet isn't interested. A source close to star says, \"Kate is a serious actor, so how could she be expected to be convincing as a woman who agonises between an expedition to the fridge or a journey to the bathroom scales?\" The news should please Fielding, who has always indicated that she would prefer an unknown actor to bring Bridget's diary to life. She says, \"I keep seeing girls who would be perfect for the role - my favourite was a girl in the gym who was sitting on a machine reading a magazine and not exercising at all.

By buying stocks to stabilise the index while raising interest rates to stabilise the currency, the government won the bet. </p> <p>Today, scared by emerging-market experiences, the world's bulls are clustered in New York. The bet has been even more heavily one way, and the stakes are even more uncomfortably high. After their chart-topping start to 2000, US equity markets are waking up to the improbable profit growth needed to justify their present valuations. </p> <p>In letting reckless equity investors and their creditors off the hook, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan hoped that they would stop the boom becoming a bubble. But the counterpunch against credit crunch proved too successful. </p> <p>\"Momentum\" investing resumed its inversion of traditional buy low logic, and a flood of \"virtual\" collateral opened the way for penniless day traders to chase profitless internet stocks. The Dow has doubled to almost 12,000 since Greenspan's warning of \"irrational exuberance\". </p> <p>Until their latest, longest upturn, Americans tended to put their money where their stock market strength was. Some even credited the US with the world's first private-sector socialism, as employees acquired the means of production through mutual and pension funds. \"Pension fund socialism\" drew strength from low taxes and low interest rates and from commercial bank separation from equity business, pushing savers towards corporate shares and bonds for the best long-term return. </p> <p>But New York's present bull market has inverted the old virtue, leading private socialism into the temptations that tripped up the public version. </p> <p>US households have stopped saving, relying on rising equity wealth to let them spend more than they earn. Mr Greenspan now risks being damned if he tightens monetary policy in order that stock prices \"correct\" and doubly damned if he stays off the brakes so the bulls continue rampaging. </p> <p>Little wonder that the Fed chairman has recently rediscovered his Ayn Rand roots, and subtly signalled his conversion to the \"new economy\". </p> <p>The story goes that the United States is leading the world into a new era of technology-driven productivity growth, permitting output to rise without inflation and profits to outpace real wages despite full employment. </p> <p>The Americans can sustain their trade gap and even watch their currency rise against that of the externally balanced euro zone, because Japan and other high-saving economies are willing to invest their export surpluses in US financial assets. </p> <p>The Asian \"tigers\" need to feed the American bear because no other economy can spend so far above its means as to absorb the export surpluses with which post-Asian crisis debts must be repaid. But even if they do exist free lunches cannot last forever. No consumer, however hegemonic, has indefinite, unsecured credit. </p> <p>The global demand gap now in prospect when the US finally turns around its current account, and the likely downward overshoot of the dollar if it does not, threaten to make the present pattern of globalisation - the poorest lending to help the richest buy them out of poverty - as economically unsustainable as it is immoral. </p> <p>Enter the president and the federal budget surplus. Mr Clinton's opening plea is for spare funds to be set aside for a state employees' and low-paid baby boomers' retirement party. But ever the compromiser and faced with the stormiest sort of market forces, his last act may be to bargain away both the tax cut and the debt repayment plans - and persuade congress to put in the money where panicked investors are taking it away. </p> <p>Both sides agree that returns sufficient to fund next generation pension and Medicare bills can only be attained on the equity markets. With looming Fed rate rises and earnings disappointments finally threatening to reinsert some traditional valuation methods into new economy madness, Washington's budgetary cushion may have arrived just in time to combat New York's vertigo. </p> <p>With correct timing, Mr Clinton could kill two bulls with one stone: scooping post-\"correction\" bargains on behalf of America's poorest citizens while breaking the fall of the middle-class gamblers. </p> <p>\u0095 Alan Shipman is an economist at Judge Institute of Management Studies and author of The Market Revolution and its Limits.</p>",

But the counterpunch against credit crunch proved too successful. \"Momentum\" investing resumed its inversion of traditional buy low logic, and a flood of \"virtual\" collateral opened the way for penniless day traders to chase profitless internet stocks. The Dow has doubled to almost 12,000 since Greenspan's warning of \"irrational exuberance\". Until their latest, longest upturn, Americans tended to put their money where their stock market strength was. Some even credited the US with the world's first private-sector socialism, as employees acquired the means of production through mutual and pension funds. \"Pension fund socialism\" drew strength from low taxes and low interest rates and from commercial bank separation from equity business, pushing savers towards corporate shares and bonds for the best long-term return. But New York's present bull market has inverted the old virtue, leading private socialism into the temptations that tripped up the public version. US households have stopped saving, relying on rising equity wealth to let them spend more than they earn. Mr Greenspan now risks being damned if he tightens monetary policy in order that stock prices \"correct\" and doubly damned if he stays off the brakes so the bulls continue rampaging. Little wonder that the Fed chairman has recently rediscovered his Ayn Rand roots, and subtly signalled his conversion to the \"new economy\". The story goes that the United States is leading the world into a new era of technology-driven productivity growth, permitting output to rise without inflation and profits to outpace real wages despite full employment. The Americans can sustain their trade gap and even watch their currency rise against that of the externally balanced euro zone, because Japan and other high-saving economies are willing to invest their export surpluses in US financial assets. The Asian \"tigers\" need to feed the American bear because no other economy can spend so far above its means as to absorb the export surpluses with which post-Asian crisis debts must be repaid. But even if they do exist free lunches cannot last forever. No consumer, however hegemonic, has indefinite, unsecured credit. The global demand gap now in prospect when the US finally turns around its current account, and the likely downward overshoot of the dollar if it does not, threaten to make the present pattern of globalisation - the poorest lending to help the richest buy them out of poverty - as economically unsustainable as it is immoral. Enter the president and the federal budget surplus. Mr Clinton's opening plea is for spare funds to be set aside for a state employees' and low-paid baby boomers' retirement party. But ever the compromiser and faced with the stormiest sort of market forces, his last act may be to bargain away both the tax cut and the debt repayment plans - and persuade congress to put in the money where panicked investors are taking it away. Both sides agree that returns sufficient to fund next generation pension and Medicare bills can only be attained on the equity markets. With looming Fed rate rises and earnings disappointments finally threatening to reinsert some traditional valuation methods into new economy madness, Washington's budgetary cushion may have arrived just in time to combat New York's vertigo. With correct timing, Mr Clinton could kill two bulls with one stone: scooping post-\"correction\" bargains on behalf of America's poorest citizens while breaking the fall of the middle-class gamblers. \u0095 Alan Shipman is an economist at Judge Institute of Management Studies and author of The Market Revolution and its Limits.",

      "bodyText": "Eight passengers were freed from the hijacked jet at Stansted airport today as negotiations continued to secure the release of the remaining 157 hostages. Two women and a man were released from the rear of the Boeing 727 shortly after 3pm - 13 hours after it touched down at the Essex airport. Shortly after midday today, five hostages - one woman, two children and two men - left the aircraft parked at Stansted. Essex police said the released hostages, who were taken to an undisclosed police station following their release, appeared to have been well treated by their captors. An Essex police spokeswoman said: \"The five are being spoken to at a police station and early indications are that they were treated well. The other three released will also be spoken to by police.\" The release of the passengers, which included a family of four, was followed by the delivery of food supplies to the jet, parked on an isolated concrete apron close to the perimeter fence on the northern side of the airport. A number of boxes containing provisions for a hot meal were unloaded from a police Land Rover parked to the rear of the aircraft shortly before 4pm as negotiators embarked on a series of \"confidence-building\" measures. The Boeing 727 flown was seized after leaving the capital Kabul en route to Mazar-e-Sharif at 5.30am GMT on Sunday. There were 165 people on board when the aircraft touched down at Stansted, including 23 children, 20 women and 14 crew. One of the hostages was suffering from a kidney complaint, according to police. Police negotiators at Stansted made contact with the jet soon after it arrived, after a flight from Moscow across western Europe. The airport was closed in the wake of the hijack drama, but a near-normal service was expected to be operated from the busy hub from later this evening. Tony Blair was woken to be alerted about the hijack shortly after British authorities learned it was heading for UK airspace at around 1am, the prime minister's official spokesman said. The decision to allow the aircraft into Britain was taken by foreign office minister John Battle, who was the duty minister, while the cabinet office immediately formed its emergency unit designed to deal with such crises. Senior police officers underlined their priority was the care and safety of the passengers on board the jet as they entered their 36th hour of captivity. Essex's deputy chief constable Charles Clark told reporters that the hijackers had asked for supplies to make the hostages' ordeal more comfortable. He said: \"This clearly remains a very sensitive and difficult situation. We are still working towards a peaceful resolution and that remains our primary aim. \"I understand that the occupants of the plane are as comfortable as they possibly can be.\" Requests made for the passengers included tea bags and cans of soft drink as well as the hot food which was later delivered. The Afghan Islamic Press, an independent news agency in Pakistan, reported that the hijackers were demanding the release of Ismail Khan, a key opposition figure who was jailed by the ruling Taliban fundamentalist regime in 1997. Mr Khan was detained by the Islamic Taliban movement after it swept to power in 1996 on its way to controlling some 90% of the war-torn state. But a representative of the Afghan government in Europe said his government would not negotiate with \"terrorists\" led by opposition leader Ahmed Shah Masoo, who he claimed were behind the hijack. General Rahmatulla Safi said he was confident that the \"professionalism\" of the British forces would bring an end to the hijacking. He said: \"We are not going to have any negotiations by any means or under any circumstances with hijackers. We are condemning terrorism. This is terrorism.\" Stansted is the latest airport of call for the hijacked plane and is the usual destination when planes taken over by terrorists are ordered to land in the UK. After being seized, the plane first landed in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, then took off after about four hours after 10 passengers were allowed off. The plane was next forced to land in the northern Kazak city of Aktyubinsk because of a leak in its right fuel tank. Kazak special forces surrounded the aircraft and officials negotiated with the hijackers before allowing it to leave. The plane later landed at Moscow where a further nine passengers were reported to have been released before it took off again last night. It is understood that the hijackers had specifically requested to come to London. The hijacking comes six weeks after an eight-day hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane ended peacefully in southern Afghanistan. The hijackers in that case freed their hostages after India released three pro-Kashmiri militants from jail. The Taliban condemned both hijackings, which created headaches for a movement already swamped with security problems. The ruling Taliban militia, with its rigid application of Islamic law, has been ostracised by all but a handful of nations since taking control of most of the country in 1996.

      "body": "<p><strong>DJETOU SUMMIT</strong></p> <p>They've already won the Premiership, so apart from the small matter of trying to win Big Cup, Manchester United have nothing left to do this season except plan ahead for next year. It must be thrilling to follow them.</p> <p>As a result, Alex Ferguson has been on the hunt for new players, and the Fiver has been told he likes the cut of Monaco defender Martin Djetou's jib. The 25-year-old from the Ivory Coast would cost \u00a37m and is tall, strong and fearsome - so he should complement Jaap Stam nicely, then. Djetou looks like arriving in the summer, especially now that Monaco spokeswoman Genevieve Berti-Banide has said, \"We are not prepared to lose him.\"</p> <p>However, if you want to embellish your squad with new talent like Djetou, you've got to ship some old faces out first. Which would explain Fergie's efforts to get rid of bald-but-also-bouffanted Jordi Cruyff. He's touted him around Premiership clubs, but none were interested in the midfielder or striker (or whatever he's supposed to be).</p> <p>Having tried and failed to persuade Liverpool to take Cruyff for the rest of the season, Fergie offered the ex-Barca player to Leicester. For free. But Martin O'Neill declined, as he's more interested in signing Stan Collymore. At this point, Fergie thought it best to step in and save Cruyff's honour. \"Jordi is going nowhere,\" he insisted. You're right there, Alex.</p> <p><strong>BUY JORGE</strong></p> <p>Poor Jorge Cadete. All he wanted to do was to sign for Bradford. Today, having finally skipped, danced and heel-clicked all the way to West Yorkshire to put his name to a short-term contract, his whole world came crashing around him. Actually, that's a bit melodramatic - the transfer's only been put on hold while he recovers from the flu. Still, when you get that close to your dream...</p> <p>Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond explained the situation: \"Jorge Cadete is returning to Benfica for the next seven to 10 days. At this moment in time he is recovering from a slight hamstring injury. Additionally he is on a course of antibiotics following a fever last week. He is obviously unable to undergo a medical... both parties, however, are confident there will be no problem.\"</p> <p>Cadete certainly hasn't let this setback get him down. \"My aim is to fully recover and play for Bradford against Aston Villa at the end of the month - should the gaffer pick me,\" promised the modest Cadete. \"I am very happy to move to Bradford and the club is also happy with my move,\" continued a man clearly not from the same stock as Stan Collymore. The Fiver keeps its fingers crossed for him.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I've worked with some terrific strikers - Gary Lineker, Andy Gray, Graeme Sharp, Clive Allen and Wayne Clarke - and he's certainly up there with the best of them.\" - Peter Reid compares Kevin Phillips to four of the greats.</p> <p><strong>DON'T REED TOO MUCH INTO IT</strong></p> <p>Referees are impartial paragons of sound judgment and fair thinking. The Fiver is not, and was surprised when card-flourishing favourite Mike Reed was spotted punching the air in triumph as Patrick Berger scored the crucial goal for Liverpool against Leeds on Saturday.</p> <p>Reed says his goal celebration was simply a spot of professional self-congratulation for allowing an advantage to be played: \"The ref loves to see the ball in the back of the net when he has played an advantage,\" Reed explained.

      "bodyText": "DJETOU SUMMIT They've already won the Premiership, so apart from the small matter of trying to win Big Cup, Manchester United have nothing left to do this season except plan ahead for next year. It must be thrilling to follow them. As a result, Alex Ferguson has been on the hunt for new players, and the Fiver has been told he likes the cut of Monaco defender Martin Djetou's jib. The 25-year-old from the Ivory Coast would cost \u00a37m and is tall, strong and fearsome - so he should complement Jaap Stam nicely, then. Djetou looks like arriving in the summer, especially now that Monaco spokeswoman Genevieve Berti-Banide has said, \"We are not prepared to lose him.\" However, if you want to embellish your squad with new talent like Djetou, you've got to ship some old faces out first. Which would explain Fergie's efforts to get rid of bald-but-also-bouffanted Jordi Cruyff. He's touted him around Premiership clubs, but none were interested in the midfielder or striker (or whatever he's supposed to be). Having tried and failed to persuade Liverpool to take Cruyff for the rest of the season, Fergie offered the ex-Barca player to Leicester. For free. But Martin O'Neill declined, as he's more interested in signing Stan Collymore. At this point, Fergie thought it best to step in and save Cruyff's honour. \"Jordi is going nowhere,\" he insisted. You're right there, Alex. BUY JORGE Poor Jorge Cadete. All he wanted to do was to sign for Bradford. Today, having finally skipped, danced and heel-clicked all the way to West Yorkshire to put his name to a short-term contract, his whole world came crashing around him. Actually, that's a bit melodramatic - the transfer's only been put on hold while he recovers from the flu. Still, when you get that close to your dream... Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond explained the situation: \"Jorge Cadete is returning to Benfica for the next seven to 10 days. At this moment in time he is recovering from a slight hamstring injury. Additionally he is on a course of antibiotics following a fever last week. He is obviously unable to undergo a medical... both parties, however, are confident there will be no problem.\" Cadete certainly hasn't let this setback get him down. \"My aim is to fully recover and play for Bradford against Aston Villa at the end of the month - should the gaffer pick me,\" promised the modest Cadete. \"I am very happy to move to Bradford and the club is also happy with my move,\" continued a man clearly not from the same stock as Stan Collymore. The Fiver keeps its fingers crossed for him. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I've worked with some terrific strikers - Gary Lineker, Andy Gray, Graeme Sharp, Clive Allen and Wayne Clarke - and he's certainly up there with the best of them.\" - Peter Reid compares Kevin Phillips to four of the greats. DON'T REED TOO MUCH INTO IT Referees are impartial paragons of sound judgment and fair thinking. The Fiver is not, and was surprised when card-flourishing favourite Mike Reed was spotted punching the air in triumph as Patrick Berger scored the crucial goal for Liverpool against Leeds on Saturday. Reed says his goal celebration was simply a spot of professional self-congratulation for allowing an advantage to be played: \"The ref loves to see the ball in the back of the net when he has played an advantage,\" Reed explained. He'll have to tell that one in a written report to the Premier League. Liverpool last loved Reed in 1996, when he denied Newcastle a blatant penalty at Anfield during Liverpool's 4-3 win. A year ago, he lost his popularity on Merseyside for sending off Jamie Carragher against Charlton. An FA inquiry cleared Reed, leaving Gerard Houllier to call him \"biased\" and the decision \"the greatest injustice of my life\". Reed retires at the end of the season and obviously wants to make amends for a career antagonising virtually every club in the land. One down, 91 to go. THE RUMOUR MILL Sergei Rebrov is a \u00a312m target for Arsenal and Chelsea, according to the Daily Mail. The Dynamo Kiev striker is also wanted by AC Milan and Barcelona. Juventus are interested in Sol Campbell and Darren Anderton from Spurs. Campbell would cost the Turin giants in the region of \u00a315-20m but Anderton is available on a Bosman free come the summer. NEWS IN BRIEF Stan Collymore's proposed move to Leicester is on hold. Leicester manager Martin O'Neill said: \"There is still a fair way to go yet.

But Larsson has had a steel pin inserted in his right leg, and a run-out in the Celtic under-21 side before the end of the month has been mooted. Wendy Toms will become the first woman to officiate in a major Wembley final when she runs the line at the Worthington Cup final.

You, unfortunately, are just entering phase one of the new media revolution. In the US they are hitting phase three. Phase three is total convergence. It will see the internet move from a print-based medium to an audio- and visual-based medium accessible via telephone, television or computer. As the power of the computer chip doubles every year and bandwidth explodes, enabling more content to be received by more people, the whole world will soon be wired for interactive communication.</p> <p>I am a television producer interested in the future of our medium. I travelled to the US last week with a working party funded by Scottish Enterprise. We are putting together a paper outlining a Scottish strategy for new media, to be presented to the Scottish parliament. I was amazed at what we saw.</p> <p>The key question is: has anybody in the burgeoning world of information outlets actually got anything to say? New media is experiencing a phenomenon best described as a content gap; technology has run ahead of our ability to do anything interesting with it. The cyber-revolutionaries have the cash and the technology, but can they find a creative use for either?</p> <p>For example, the mobile telephone giant Ericsson controls 40% of the world's cellular infrastructure and so is typical of a new media player entering phase three. Ericsson's telephones can access the web and stream video, its palm-tops are mini-computers, whilst its computers are telephones. If you want technology then Ericsson has got it. If you want to know what to do with the technology, well, have you got any ideas? Jonas Peterson, business development director at the Ericsson cyber-lab in New York, compares Ericsson's position to a bookshop with no books - without the books no one will enter the shop. Ericsson needs ideas to drive the sales of its handsets and increase the use of its extensive global cellular infrastructure.</p> <p>Ericsson is not alone in the search for original content or the killer application. Thousands of miles away in the cultural vacuum of Dallas the billionaire owners of Broadcast.com are struggling with the same issues as they search for content that will justify their multi-million dollar investment in new broadcast technology. Broadcast.com has the ability to broadcast live concerts, events, radio, television networks and corporate messages online, completely blurring the historic divisions between television, radio, computer and video-phone.</p> <p>Its single-storey warehouse in a tough part of downtown Dallas resembles a prison and not the office of some of America's wealthiest new media moguls. Inside is row after row after row of servers pushing out video and audio to the computers of the world. Marc Montoya of Broadcast.com likes to think of the company as a giant stage, but with a global audience. The only problem is that at the moment the stage is empty. </p> <p>NTL is another victim of the content gap. Its cabling networks circle the globe, it is the biggest independent telecommunication company in Britain, it has done the unthinkable and sponsored two of football's greatest sporting rivals, Celtic and Glasgow Rangers, and it has done a deal with Microsoft. NTL's use of a Microsoft platform will enable it to deliver enhanced interactive television services as part of its digital terrestrial television and telephony packages for UK customers.</p> <p>This will include interactive programming, \"personal TV\" and core internet services such as web browsing, email and chat. The service will also offer \"personal TV\", where a built in digital video recorder can download programmes and interactive services to a hard drive; not tape. This will give the viewers the ability to schedule their own viewing selection, in essence making channel schedulers a thing of the past. But what are they going to put on it? As the chairman, Berkley Napp, says \"what we don't have is the value proposition that will drive the traffic\". NTL's recent acquisition of shares in Aston Villa might do the trick, but for how long can distributors rely on premiership football to fill the space that ideas have left behind?</p> <p>In the search for content, the Ericsson cyber-lab has gone a step further. They are giving their technology and office space free to anybody that can come up with a good application for their mobile phones. They are not even doing an equity for space deal, they are not taking a cut of what these freelancers develop. Peterson justifies this generosity by saying that the more applications there are for the cellular phone \"the more phones they will sell\", and with the Chinese market just beginning to open up they are looking to sell a lot of phones.</p> <p>Ericsson is based in Silicon Alley, New York's self-styled centre of new media content creators. Silicon Alley, surrounded by the vast wealth of Wall Street and the traditional media empires of publishing and television, is America's big hope for the big idea. The Alley is a stretch of once-cheap warehouse space that was set aside for new media by the New York City economic development corporation as part of an attempt to wrestle some new media business away from the West Coast.</p> <p>The corporation's frank message - \"we want your business\" - has worked. Silicon Alley does not have the cash or kudos of its west coast namesake, Silicon Valley, but it trumps it on attitude and creativity. Silicon Alley has positioned itself as the hip ideas factory against the Valley's chip factory - the Alley is software, the Valley is hardware. At the heart of this New York phenomenon is 55 Broad Street which at some considerable expense has been re-wired for all media access and now hosts a dozen promising start-ups as well as multi-million dollar international conglomerates.</p> <p>The Ericsson cyber-lab is on its 15th floor. The 5,000 sq ft of office space with a to-die-for view of the Hudson eschews the traditional office look in favour of stressed concrete, mobile furniture on outsized wheels and conceptual art work, badly hung on peeling walls. It has every appearance of a start-up, which is exactly its intention.</p> <p>Like many established players, Ericsson feels it is missing out on the good ideas because the young wunderkinds only want to be involved in start-ups with their share options and goldmine pay packages. The cyber-lab is Ericsson's response to this brain drain. It is a well funded playpen for the under-30s and it works. A dozen cyber-kids pick their way across miles of cabling as they dedicate themselves to developing a wireless future. Where the Alley rubs shoulders with Broadway, a large banner reads: \"DoubleClick welcomes you to Silicon Alley\". DoubleClick, an online advertising company, is one of the Alley's huge success stories.</p> <p>This once shoestring operation is now one of the most viable businesses on the net. It employs over 800 people in New York alone and occupies an office of overwhelming opulence. Last year it posted its one billionth advert online and now services 500m adverts on a daily basis. The technology to post ads anywhere within the net's one billion plus pages is awesome, and as a result DoubleClick's control room makes Nasa look like the driver's cabin of a double-decker bus.</p> <p>DoubleClick is a typical third-phaser, it is awash with technology and cash, but like all third-phasers it needs traffic to justify its existence, and traffic is the by-product of original and innovative content which for all the Alley's creative pretensions is in short supply.</p> <p>Success stories like DoubleClick keep the new media myth alive. In Silicon Alley, groups of creatives that have turned their backs on highly paid jobs in traditional media and finance live for the elusive online deal. A magazine, Ally Cat News, further promotes the group's sense of identity while street banners welcome the uninitiated. Warehouse gatherings turn into impromptu seminars, the cafes and restaurants are full of bright young things living in hope, and New York's business agencies are quickly setting up more \"plug and go\" offices to feed the demand.</p> <p>New media groupies have colonised this slither of New York as much as the gay and arts communities colonised Greenwich Village in the 70s. It is ironic then that for all the internet talk of creating global, virtual communities not restricted by nationality or geography, actual physical communities are springing up all over the world built around this shared interest. Perhaps new media's seamless web of interactive technology is only a means to an end; a way of creating communities that add real content to the lives of all those involved.</p> <p>Will Silicon Alley be a success? Financially yes, e-commerce is generating millions of dollars of new business, mostly through its ability to dramatically reduce overheads. To sell an air ticket over the counter costs $8 (\u00a35); to sell it over the web costs $1 (60p), but is that it? Is the internet simply a way of re-configuring business models? Let's hope not. New media is a new industry and needs new ideas to fuel it. These ideas might come from traditional businesses, they might come from traditional media, but not necessarily so.</p> <p>As a new industry, new media deserves radical new applications, it needs to redefine communities and find new ways of servicing their needs, not old ideas or old business models redesigned.</p> <p>\u0095 Zad Rogers is director of Ideal World Media</p>",

      "body": "<p>The BBC has lost the British film industry's most prestigious event to Sky just a week after Greg Dyke took over as director-general. </p> <p>For the first time in the event's 52-year history, the satellite broadcaster will screen the Bafta film awards ceremony. </p> <p>The loss of the British equivalent of the Oscars is the first on-screen setback for Mr Dyke, although the deal was done before he took over. In the latter days of Sir John Birt's director- generalship the BBC was criticised for losing Des Lynam to ITV, Test cricket to Channel 4 and the Oscars to Sky. </p> <p>A Sky insider yesterday described its coup as \"another nail in the coffin for the BBC's coverage of films and the movie industry\". </p> <p>Since poaching the film critic Barry Norman from the BBC two years ago, Sky has moved to capitalise on its movie channels to establish itself as the home of film. </p> <p>Last year, when Sky swiped the Oscars, the BBC retaliated by saying that the American late-night timing of the Oscars made it unattractive to audiences. But the loss of the Baftas, which has attracted up to 10m viewers, is a far greater statement to British viewers. </p> <p>Sky has been aiming to build up its film coverage for some time.

      "bodyText": "The BBC has lost the British film industry's most prestigious event to Sky just a week after Greg Dyke took over as director-general. For the first time in the event's 52-year history, the satellite broadcaster will screen the Bafta film awards ceremony. The loss of the British equivalent of the Oscars is the first on-screen setback for Mr Dyke, although the deal was done before he took over. In the latter days of Sir John Birt's director- generalship the BBC was criticised for losing Des Lynam to ITV, Test cricket to Channel 4 and the Oscars to Sky. A Sky insider yesterday described its coup as \"another nail in the coffin for the BBC's coverage of films and the movie industry\". Since poaching the film critic Barry Norman from the BBC two years ago, Sky has moved to capitalise on its movie channels to establish itself as the home of film. Last year, when Sky swiped the Oscars, the BBC retaliated by saying that the American late-night timing of the Oscars made it unattractive to audiences. But the loss of the Baftas, which has attracted up to 10m viewers, is a far greater statement to British viewers. Sky has been aiming to build up its film coverage for some time. Insiders say its strategy is to \"own\" film, in the same way that it has become the biggest broadcaster of sport. It is understood that Sky plans to emphasise its connection with the ceremony by treating the event like the Oscars: screening Bafta-winning films around the event and producing substantially more build-up coverage than the BBC ever did. Bafta split its film and television awards, which used to be alternated as one ceremony between ITV and BBC1, into separate events in 1998. BBC1 won the right to screen the film awards last year. Sky is thought to be negotiating a further two-year deal to screen the event. The BBC played down losing the Baftas yesterday. A spokeswoman said: \"It comes as no surprise that the Bafta awards will be screened on Sky this year. The event has a minority appeal compared to the TV awards which will continue to be screened on an alternating basis with ITV.\" She confirmed, however, that the BBC had been trying to negotiate with Bafta. Last year's Bafta ceremony was hailed as the most glittering yet as Hollywood stars including Elizabeth Taylor, who was awarded a fellowship of the academy, and Gwyneth Paltrow joined homegrown talent at a glittering bash in London.

I envisaged a few lessons, a test (although in my imagination even this part mainly involved good luck cards and attention), swiftly followed by lots of driving around in sunglasses with the radio on. </p> <p>That was at the beginning. (Actually, it wasn't quite the beginning; there was a brief prologue to my driving career a few years earlier, when as a student I took some lessons with a joyless man called Brian who told me at the end of my first lesson that he'd never in his career encountered anyone with less natural feel for driving, but - perhaps not surprisingly - my enthusiasm for the project quickly waned.) By January 1998 I was developing a three-cabs-a-day habit that, although handy for learning impressive short cuts, was clearly a road to financial ruin. Besides, at 24 years old, not being able to drive was becoming embarrassing. I bought a new set of L-plates and a course of 10 lessons with BSM, and hit the roads. </p> <p>Like so many battles, my driving campaign didn't go to plan. Although my new instructor, Steve, was faultlessly diplomatic, by the time I'd written the cheque for the third course of lessons, I was beginning to suspect Brian's comment hadn't been sexist, or even mean, but simply honest. By the summer, the initial thrill of being in the driving seat had subsided, and I was dug into a demoralising struggle. Never before had a basic skill eluded me so completely: I was just terrible at driving. I'm terrible at singing, too, but I can live with that because singing well is a rare talent. Being terrible at driving, however, was utterly galling, because it seemed to be a piece of cake for almost everyone except me. Being sworn at by spotty 17-year-old drivers when I stalled at junctions was beginning to get me down. </p> <p>But by autumn, I was making progress. Abandoning the admittedly unconventional standing-on-the-driving-seat technique made things more straightforward, and I had figured out which pedal was which. OK, I was still shaky on reversing around corners, but the car no longer hopped and lurched about like a rabbit with hiccups. In the absence of spatial skills or common sense, I had mastered the driving-by-numbers methods for reverse parking, with the help of bits of masking-tape on the windows to show me where to start and stop steering. By winter, I had been learning for a year; at Steve's prompting, I booked a test. </p> <p>By the time Big Day Number One dawned, I was feeling fairly hopeful. Almost all my friends had passed first time, after all, and some of them still can't park eight years later. How hard could it be? I carefully chose my most responsible, I-never-coast-round-corners outfit, and even remembered not to wear the kitten-heeled mules that Steve had sweetly suggested weren't helping matters. Even my examiner's serial-killer eyes didn't faze me. I started the car and followed his instructions, ostentatiously mirror-signal-manoeuvring my heart out. When he asked me to pull over just past a corner, I knew what was coming. Steeling myself, I reversed around the corner with mathematical precision, but my jubilation quickly subsided when I realised that in my determination to maintain the correct distance from the kerb, I hadn't looked over my shoulder once - an automatic fail. </p> <p>All pretensions at taking it on the chin evaporated back at work, when I burst into tears at the first inquiry as to how I'd got on. I began to see that telling absolutely everyone I knew that I was taking my test had been a mistake. The second time around, I told just a few people. Not that it calmed my nerves much: in fact, when Big Day Number Two dawned, I was far more nervous than at the first attempt. I was shaking so much that I could hardly get the key in the ignition. Not surprisingly, since I probably appeared to be a complete basket case, I failed. The reactions of those I had told were different this time around. The first time you fail, it's normal; the second, you get sympathy. By the third attempt (when I failed because of something to do with a roundabout) the tests were a closely guarded secret, but those who did know couldn't help trying to get me to see the funny side of it. After the fourth fail (hit the kerb during parking - schoolgirl error) no one knew what to say. </p> <p>When I finally passed, it was the operative at my sister's paging company I told first. (He congratulated me warmly, which I thought was very sporting.) By this time, having had well over 100 lessons, even I could drive fairly competently; without the shakes, it went fine. When I heard the words \"I'm pleased to tell you...\" I almost fainted. Steve, who had, I suspect, begun to wonder if he was ever going to see the back of me, was almost as pleased as I was. </p> <p>Saying goodbye to Steve was rather sad. If you're 17 years old, have eight lessons and pass first time, you probably don't spare a second thought for the person who sat in the passenger seat, but I'd been through a lot with Steve - there was the driving, of course, but more importantly, the one whole and two half football seasons. As an Arsenal supporter being taught by a lifelong Manchester United fan, we'd been through a double for my team and a triple for his, with an hour each week to discuss them. </p> <p>Apart from being a brilliant excuse to buy champagne (easier now BSM isn't syphoning off half my salary), passing my test hasn't changed my life much. I don't think I'll get a car; I walk to work, and when I'm not at work I'm generally drunk (that's a joke, Mum). Besides, it wouldn't seem a particularly positive contribution to London's traffic problems when there are all those jolly buses and comfy black cabs out there. But that's not the point.

      "body": "<p> Despite being very long and sparsely populated, Norway is as keen to cut global smog as your average Brit with a brace of Jags. Even there, 70% of car usage is within urban confines and, despite all those open roads, the average A-to-B speed of the average Norwegian car is a miserable 25mph. All of which raises the question: why buy a filthy fume-spewer when something battery-powered can do the job just as effectively? </p> <p>And imagine if you didn't even need to burn fossil fuel elsewhere to charge your nickel-cadmiums, but could produce the necessary leccy via a local waterfall. Wouldn't everyone be happy? Clearly a Norwegian would, which is why this car is now rolling out of a plant near Oslo. Meet not only Norway's first self-built car, but a true e-car for Europe. </p> <p>There are plenty of well-rehearsed arguments for lashing out on a three-pin plug and matching motor. However, they tend to wobble when you get behind the wheel, mostly because e-cars are dreadful to drive. Still, the team behind the Nordic Think City's design and marketing have some tidy balance sheets and diagrams to show how fleet operators will get a return on their investment, including such noteworthy trade-offs as no annual petrol bill for a few pennies' worth of Economy 7. Furthermore, in the Think's case, there is no need to budget for bashes because the panels are all made of sturdy anti-scratch plastic. </p> <p>From this side of the flip chart, the Think, at \u00a311,583 (plus a lease of about \u00a3100 per month for battery maintenance), seems, economy-wise, to be well thought out. However, even Bengt Heggertveit, Nordic's sales and servicing boss, admits that the private buyer makes a heart-led decision based on brand perception, with scant regard for long-term economics beyond the forecourt price. If governments incentivise e-cars by making them elegible for free road tax, no VAT and free toll passes (as they do in Norway), long-term wear and tear to the wallet looks reasonable. Ahead of a wider European launch after 2000, Think's initial sales target is Scandinavia, where it needs to prove itself as something more than an eccentric political statement. So is it? </p> <p>Well, before it moves, it's off to a decent start.

      "bodyText": "Despite being very long and sparsely populated, Norway is as keen to cut global smog as your average Brit with a brace of Jags. Even there, 70% of car usage is within urban confines and, despite all those open roads, the average A-to-B speed of the average Norwegian car is a miserable 25mph. All of which raises the question: why buy a filthy fume-spewer when something battery-powered can do the job just as effectively? And imagine if you didn't even need to burn fossil fuel elsewhere to charge your nickel-cadmiums, but could produce the necessary leccy via a local waterfall. Wouldn't everyone be happy? Clearly a Norwegian would, which is why this car is now rolling out of a plant near Oslo. Meet not only Norway's first self-built car, but a true e-car for Europe. There are plenty of well-rehearsed arguments for lashing out on a three-pin plug and matching motor. However, they tend to wobble when you get behind the wheel, mostly because e-cars are dreadful to drive. Still, the team behind the Nordic Think City's design and marketing have some tidy balance sheets and diagrams to show how fleet operators will get a return on their investment, including such noteworthy trade-offs as no annual petrol bill for a few pennies' worth of Economy 7. Furthermore, in the Think's case, there is no need to budget for bashes because the panels are all made of sturdy anti-scratch plastic. From this side of the flip chart, the Think, at \u00a311,583 (plus a lease of about \u00a3100 per month for battery maintenance), seems, economy-wise, to be well thought out. However, even Bengt Heggertveit, Nordic's sales and servicing boss, admits that the private buyer makes a heart-led decision based on brand perception, with scant regard for long-term economics beyond the forecourt price. If governments incentivise e-cars by making them elegible for free road tax, no VAT and free toll passes (as they do in Norway), long-term wear and tear to the wallet looks reasonable. Ahead of a wider European launch after 2000, Think's initial sales target is Scandinavia, where it needs to prove itself as something more than an eccentric political statement. So is it? Well, before it moves, it's off to a decent start. Deliberately designed to appeal to young high-spenders, the Think has more than a smattering of Smart Car about it, though it's more grown up; okay, it has only two seats, but unlike the Smart, the Think has enough space for four hefty suitcases.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Alan Ruddock's fragile grasp on the editorship of the Scotsman finally slipped away last week. He returned to his native Dublin to contemplate his difficult 21 months at the helm of the Edinburgh-based broadsheet. His departure was dressed up, as usual, as a resignation, but there isn't the least doubt that he was pushed. </p> <p>He had gradually lost the confidence of the paper's publisher and editor-in-chief, Andrew Neil. The official reason offered by both men rests on the fact that Ruddock had grown weary of his weekly commuting from Ireland. \"It just hasn't worked out as I expected,\" said Ruddock. </p> <p>Sticking to the script, Neil said: \"When Alan was appointed, it was agreed that he and his family would move to Edinburgh, but it never happened. Not only did the commute begin to take [its] toll on him, it meant he wasn't able to put his imprint on the paper in the way he should have done. You have to live and breathe Scotland if you're Scotsman editor. You need to be mixing with the people at the weekends to get the feel for the place.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt that Neil retains a fondness for Ruddock, who is generally regarded as a charmer. He is also widely respected for his intelligence, but successful editors require a dynamism and ruthlessness which some say that Ruddock didn't exhibit. </p> <p>Although Neil won't be drawn into criticising Ruddock's performance, and has shown faith in his abilities by offering him a post on the group's Sunday Business title, other executives say that their relationship has recently grown increasingly fraught. </p> <p>Some staff whisper that Neil interfered too often in the editorial decision-making process. According to one of Neil's sympathetic executives, this was understandable - Ruddock was \"so laid back he was practically horizontal\". </p> <p>What is certain is that Ruddock did not take the paper in the direction agreed in advance with Neil and his senior lieutenant, Sue Douglas, who spends one day a week in Edinburgh overseeing strategy for features coverage. </p> <p>Neil scoffs at my suggestion that he has been a sort of puppet-master, pulling his editor's strings from London. \"It's just not true to say that I've been micro-managing the paper,\" he says. \"But I did begin to get frustrated by the lack of direction. In those circumstances, it's only human to push it along. </p> <p>\"I'll tell you what did happen. Things seemed to be lacking momentum and changes that we agreed should be implemented were just not being made. There is no question that I got more involved and it did get to the level that wasn't healthy for him or me. </p> <p>\"Look, I don't want to edit the Scotsman. I have too many other things going on. I have four newspapers to run and two dot com companies going gangbusters. We're looking to buy more newspapers all the time. I have my BBC career. I speak all over the place. I live in France part of the year. I spend a lot of time in New York. </p> <p>\"I want to get back to a situation in which I am the editor-in-chief so that the day-to-day running of the paper is left to the editor. Sure, I'll always have my tuppence worth. But it's for the editor to get on with the job.\" </p> <p>He also dismisses the notion that his own deep scepticism about devolution could have had any effect on his editor or that it infects the paper's political coverage. \"The Scotsman is a cheerleader for devolution. What I do think is that it's time for the paper to be more pro-active, helping to set the agenda to make Scotland a better place, acting as a forum for ideas.\" </p> <p>The other charge is that it is Neil's own personality, his brash self-confidence allied to his Unionist politics, which is a problem. \"That's all chattering-class, blathering-class nonsense,\" he says. \"It's nice to be thought of as so important, but when people go to the news-stands in the morning - except perhaps for Alex Salmond and one or two of his cronies - they don't decide whether to buy based on what they think of me or my views. </p> <p>\"If we were losing sales to the Glasgow Herald there might just be some truth in it. But we're not. The readers we have lost have gone to the English papers, the Times and the Daily Telegraph.\" </p> <p>Although the Scotsman's circulation has slipped in the past year, from 80,000 last January to about 75,000 in the past month, Neil doesn't appear overly concerned, saying \"It's a temporary blip\". It certainly doesn't seem to be the reason for Ruddock's departure. </p> <p>Neil did not assume complete control of the Barclay brothers' newspaper division until last summer, adding the role of commercial overlord to his editorial responsibilities when the veteran newspaper executive Bert Hardy retired, due to illness. </p> <p>The group had already gone through the trauma of closing the ailing European, and his job was to ensure that the three Scottish titles - the Scotsman, Scotland on Sunday and the Edinburgh Evening News - were placed on a solid footing, along with the new baby, Sunday Business. </p> <p>\"I put the Scotsman on the back-burner last year because I had three other priorities. The first was to invest in Scotland on Sunday to fight off the newly launched Sunday Herald. That took time and treasure, but it has worked. Last week we sold 114,000. The Sunday Herald is claiming a sale of 56,000 but they're lucky if it's 40 [thousand]. They're giving it away. Mind you, it's a good paper and I like it. But we had to protect our franchise, and we're expecting to go for 120,000 soon.\" </p> <p>Neil's second interest was in relaunching the Evening News ahead of competition from the giveaway Metro. \"We had to move it out of the Daily Record market and into middle market, to make it more like the London Evening Standard. That's been quite expensive but the result is that circulation has stabilised at 75,000 with more ABC1 readers and a tone befitting a city with a parliament.\" </p> <p>Then he tackled Sunday Business's hidden problems. Although, in its two-year history, the paper has won favourable coverage, a number of awards and enjoyed ballooning sales, Neil discovered it was \"on the brink of being a financial disaster\". </p> <p>To cure the problem, he has taken the drastic step of doubling the cover price to \u00a31. Advertising revenues have been \"transformed\" since he put the Scotsman's London ad team in charge of selling space, but he must wait to see if the unprecedented price rise gamble comes off. </p> <p>For all that, the Scotsman is the group's flagship and Neil recognises that its success is of key importance. He is eager to reposition the paper, \"making it more accessible to peo ple\". Its political coverage is excellent, but that doesn't attract readers. \"It needs to broaden out, with more humanity, appealing more to women and to those people who aren't obsessed with what's happening on the Mound. That doesn't mean dumbing down. </p> <p>\"I have a war chest, the biggest any broadsheet in Scotland has ever had, ready to spend in the market in order to reposition the paper. I've got to get the Scotsman out of this mentality that its competition is the Glasgow Herald. It's not. </p> <p>\"People in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee should take their local papers, but they should take us too. Our competition is the Times and the Telegraph and the FT. We cover the national and international news through Scottish eyes. That's our unique selling point.\" </p> <p>So is Ruddock's caretaker replacement, his former deputy, Tim Luckhurst, the man for the job? Neil says: \"He's the acting editor, the man playing for position. It's up to him to show me that he can do it.\" </p> <p>Luckhurst will be a new name to many. Aged 37, he was born in Sheffield of English parents but was taken as a baby to live in the Shetlands, and then grew up in Peebles before reading history at Cambridge. He initially worked as a researcher in the Commons before becoming press officer to Donald Dewar - now Scotland's first minister - and for the Scottish Labour group. </p> <p>In the 1987 election, he stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate before joining the BBC's Today programme as a producer. Stints as a foreign correspondent in the Gulf, Romania and Washington followed. He later spent two years as editor of news programmes at BBC Scotland. He joined the Scotsman in 1997, initially as deputy to Ruddock's predecessor, Martin Clarke. </p> <p>Luckhurst is married, to a Tory party activist, and is a fanatical supporter of the unfashionable Glasgow football team, Partick Thistle. Neil, a Rangers supporter, is convinced he and Luckhurst can kick the Scotsman into shape. \"He's rolling up his sleeves,\" says Neil. \"I think he'll do it.\"</p>",

In those circumstances, it's only human to push it along. \"I'll tell you what did happen. Things seemed to be lacking momentum and changes that we agreed should be implemented were just not being made. There is no question that I got more involved and it did get to the level that wasn't healthy for him or me. \"Look, I don't want to edit the Scotsman. I have too many other things going on. I have four newspapers to run and two dot com companies going gangbusters. We're looking to buy more newspapers all the time. I have my BBC career. I speak all over the place. I live in France part of the year. I spend a lot of time in New York. \"I want to get back to a situation in which I am the editor-in-chief so that the day-to-day running of the paper is left to the editor. Sure, I'll always have my tuppence worth. But it's for the editor to get on with the job.\" He also dismisses the notion that his own deep scepticism about devolution could have had any effect on his editor or that it infects the paper's political coverage. \"The Scotsman is a cheerleader for devolution. What I do think is that it's time for the paper to be more pro-active, helping to set the agenda to make Scotland a better place, acting as a forum for ideas.\" The other charge is that it is Neil's own personality, his brash self-confidence allied to his Unionist politics, which is a problem. \"That's all chattering-class, blathering-class nonsense,\" he says. \"It's nice to be thought of as so important, but when people go to the news-stands in the morning - except perhaps for Alex Salmond and one or two of his cronies - they don't decide whether to buy based on what they think of me or my views. \"If we were losing sales to the Glasgow Herald there might just be some truth in it. But we're not. The readers we have lost have gone to the English papers, the Times and the Daily Telegraph.\" Although the Scotsman's circulation has slipped in the past year, from 80,000 last January to about 75,000 in the past month, Neil doesn't appear overly concerned, saying \"It's a temporary blip\". It certainly doesn't seem to be the reason for Ruddock's departure. Neil did not assume complete control of the Barclay brothers' newspaper division until last summer, adding the role of commercial overlord to his editorial responsibilities when the veteran newspaper executive Bert Hardy retired, due to illness. The group had already gone through the trauma of closing the ailing European, and his job was to ensure that the three Scottish titles - the Scotsman, Scotland on Sunday and the Edinburgh Evening News - were placed on a solid footing, along with the new baby, Sunday Business. \"I put the Scotsman on the back-burner last year because I had three other priorities. The first was to invest in Scotland on Sunday to fight off the newly launched Sunday Herald. That took time and treasure, but it has worked. Last week we sold 114,000. The Sunday Herald is claiming a sale of 56,000 but they're lucky if it's 40 [thousand]. They're giving it away. Mind you, it's a good paper and I like it. But we had to protect our franchise, and we're expecting to go for 120,000 soon.\" Neil's second interest was in relaunching the Evening News ahead of competition from the giveaway Metro. \"We had to move it out of the Daily Record market and into middle market, to make it more like the London Evening Standard. That's been quite expensive but the result is that circulation has stabilised at 75,000 with more ABC1 readers and a tone befitting a city with a parliament.\" Then he tackled Sunday Business's hidden problems. Although, in its two-year history, the paper has won favourable coverage, a number of awards and enjoyed ballooning sales, Neil discovered it was \"on the brink of being a financial disaster\". To cure the problem, he has taken the drastic step of doubling the cover price to \u00a31. Advertising revenues have been \"transformed\" since he put the Scotsman's London ad team in charge of selling space, but he must wait to see if the unprecedented price rise gamble comes off. For all that, the Scotsman is the group's flagship and Neil recognises that its success is of key importance. He is eager to reposition the paper, \"making it more accessible to peo ple\". Its political coverage is excellent, but that doesn't attract readers. \"It needs to broaden out, with more humanity, appealing more to women and to those people who aren't obsessed with what's happening on the Mound. That doesn't mean dumbing down. \"I have a war chest, the biggest any broadsheet in Scotland has ever had, ready to spend in the market in order to reposition the paper. I've got to get the Scotsman out of this mentality that its competition is the Glasgow Herald. It's not. \"People in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee should take their local papers, but they should take us too. Our competition is the Times and the Telegraph and the FT. We cover the national and international news through Scottish eyes. That's our unique selling point.\" So is Ruddock's caretaker replacement, his former deputy, Tim Luckhurst, the man for the job? Neil says: \"He's the acting editor, the man playing for position. It's up to him to show me that he can do it.\" Luckhurst will be a new name to many. Aged 37, he was born in Sheffield of English parents but was taken as a baby to live in the Shetlands, and then grew up in Peebles before reading history at Cambridge. He initially worked as a researcher in the Commons before becoming press officer to Donald Dewar - now Scotland's first minister - and for the Scottish Labour group. In the 1987 election, he stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate before joining the BBC's Today programme as a producer. Stints as a foreign correspondent in the Gulf, Romania and Washington followed. He later spent two years as editor of news programmes at BBC Scotland. He joined the Scotsman in 1997, initially as deputy to Ruddock's predecessor, Martin Clarke. Luckhurst is married, to a Tory party activist, and is a fanatical supporter of the unfashionable Glasgow football team, Partick Thistle. Neil, a Rangers supporter, is convinced he and Luckhurst can kick the Scotsman into shape. \"He's rolling up his sleeves,\" says Neil. \"I think he'll do it.\"",

      "body": "<p>In an echo of Peter Mandelson when he resigned his cabinet post after his unorthodox housing loan, Mirror editor Piers Morgan is describing the events of the last five days as \"a humbling experience\". But Morgan has not lost his job. After a swift inquiry into his share-dealing activities, the board of Trinity-Mirror has decided that, though he has been foolish, he has not broken the law nor even breached the industry's ethical code. </p> <p>Independent investigations by the Stock Exchange and the Press Complaints Commission may yet reach different conclusions, which could conceivably threaten his position, but Trinity's own probe appears to have been thorough enough to dispel any immediate worries. </p> <p>Morgan survives, his giant ego bruised and his credibility severely undermined, but the problem itself is far from over. A claim in yesterday's Sunday Times that his deputy, Tina Weaver, also bought shares in a company tipped by the Mirror's City column now requires explanation. </p> <p>There are also question marks over the activities of the paper's two share-tipping journalists, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, who run the City Slickers column. Investigators are particularly interested in Bhoyrul's ownership of shares in two companies that he has persistently tipped, Belgo and Dialog, and in dealings in four others companies - Amstrad, Blakes Clothing, Medi@invest and NewMedia Spark - which saw their prices rocket after being tipped by the Slickers. </p> <p>In spite of these revelations, and allowing for the possibility that more might emerge in the coming days as rival City hacks trawl through share registers, it is important to maintain a sense of proportion. Morgan has, as one Trinity director observed, \"once again illustrated his immaturity and inexperience, but the lad hasn't done anything wrong. He wasn't up to no good. We're convinced of that.\" </p> <p>He added: \"A lot of what's happened is because of the Sun taking advantage of the situation. They've made capital out of it.\" </p> <p>Indeed they have, which is hardly surprising. Ever since David Yelland became Sun editor, Morgan has taken every opportunity in the Mirror to pour scorn on his rival and, would you believe it, his old friend. </p> <p>Yelland was hardly likely to miss this kind of opportunity. The Sun splashed the story twice, ran four leaders and on Saturday published a vicious cartoon which drew a parallel between Morgan and the late Robert Maxwell. </p> <p>To equate Maxwell's theft of \u00a3600m pension funds with Morgan's \u00a320,000 investment is, of course, ridiculous, but Fleet Street wars are like that. The Sun saw that there was a commercial advantage in attacking the Mirror. Even so, who can deny that it was a genuine story? Every other paper gave it lots of space too. </p> <p>The episode began on January 17 when Morgan bought a \u00a320,000 stake in Viglen Technology, owned by Sir Alan Sugar. Later that night, at about 11.30pm, as he was going through his paper's first edition, Morgan says he noted \"with amusement\" that his City Slickers were tipping Viglen because it was launching an internet division. This \"exclusive\" was nothing of the sort. The internet revelation had been revealed weeks before and the Slickers had already tipped the share on January 1. </p> <p>Morgan now realises that, next morning, he should have declared to his bosses his dilemma. He had bought the shares openly, in his own name, through his usual broker. He didn't know that his City pair were going to write about it. Evidently, it's not his habit to read the City page until it is published, an admission which has rightly earned him criticism from the rest of Fleet Street. Tabloid editors usually know every page lead and, in most cases, read virtually every word in their paper before publication. </p> <p>Morgan didn't and the result of the Slickers' story was a surge in the share price of Viglen from 181p to 366p. If Morgan had cashed in his holding straight away he would have made \u00a320,000 profit. </p> <p>The fact that he didn't do so is the most significant pointer to his innocence. He held on to his stake because, as he later explained, it was always meant to be a long-term investment. Well placed sources on the Trinity-Mirror board say that the fact that he didn't make a killing clears him of any culpability. </p> <p>Nor, on the face of it, is he guilty of breaching the editors' code of practice. He had not profited from advance financial information. Though his paper had previously tipped Viglen shares, he had not bought the shares with any personal intention of his paper writing about them. </p> <p>Once the storm broke, Morgan was summoned to explain himself to his board, which brought in the legal firm, Lovells, to help in the inquiry. Morgan gave them details of all of his share dealings in the past five years, amounting to some 30 transactions. No correlation was found between any of these dealings and stories in the Mirror, nor was any link discovered between the trades and City Slickers' tips since their column began in April 1998. </p> <p>Morgan, mortified by his own naivete and distressed at the media coverage, immediately decided to sell his Viglen stock, which had begun to fall once more, and donated the profit, by now some \u00a313,000, to charity. </p> <p>That might just have drawn a line under the affair. But the Guardian's revelation that Bhoyrul had bought stock in Belgo, a restaurant chain he had repeatedly tipped, ensured continuing interest. The Stock Exchange immediately widened its probe and the PCC accepted a second complaint. </p> <p>Bhoyrul's defence is ingenious. Though he has clearly broken the letter of the code, which outlaws journalists buying shares in companies \"about which they have written recently or intend to write about in the near future\", he takes the view that his actions have been transparent. He has made it clear in his articles that he is \"piling in\" on a certain stock. \"Readers like that,\" said a Mirror editorial executive. \"They like to see a man putting his money where his mouth is.\" </p> <p>Bhoyrul is adamant that he has done nothing wrong. \"I have volunteered my share holdings to anyone who has asked me,\" he said, speaking in detail for the first time about the row. \"In the past two years I have tipped 692 companies and written positive stories about another 500 maybe. I've owned shares in just four of those: Mirror Group, Belgo, Booth and Dialog. My total investment has been about \u00a32,000, of which I'm sitting on a loss of \u00a3800.\" </p> <p>In company with Morgan, and at least one other Fleet Street editor, Bhoyrul thinks it's a fuss generated largely by the Sun. \"To devote a leader calling for my resignation is so pathetic,\" he says. \"Who the fuck am I?

I was asked by one journalist why I was on the electoral register twice. The fact is, I wanted to keep hold of my car park permit at my former flat, and I admit to that scam which, OK, is naughty but nothing more.\" </p> <p>The phenomenon of the City Slickers, modelled on the kind of showbiz column pioneered by Morgan in his Sun days, is evidence of the changed nature of investing and investors. Bhoyrul, 33, and Hipwell, 34, were specifically engaged by Morgan and Kelvin MacKenzie, when he was at Mirror group, to reinvent business coverage. </p> <p>They make an unlikely pairing. Hipwell is a quiet, deliberate character with public school accent, deep base laugh and a weakness for horseracing - he part owns a horse with the Mirror's lawyer Martin Cruddace. Bhoyrul is the more cavalier charmer who takes delight in the absurd. </p> <p>The two met at Tom Rubython's short lived Sunday Business in which Bhoyrul was a director and, briefly, editor. The ride there was no less colourful than the Mirror. He escaped charges of contempt two years ago when Rubython's paper ran a series of pre-trial articles about the Bruce Grobbelaar match-fixing case. Two judges at the high court cleared him after deciding that the paper's circu lation was too limited to have made it likely a juror would have read the articles. </p> <p>Morgan believed that the rash of get-rich-quick stories from investors in info-tech shares, along with the ease of online dealing and an increasingly financially-literate audience meant the City had become the province of the red tops. The fact that a single story in the Mirror did indeed affect the market is testimony to Morgan's vision. </p> <p>But the Slickers' approach remains controversial, drawing criticism even from within the Mirror Group. One senior figure likened Bhoyrul and Hipwell to the characters in Wayne's World. But the affair raises several important questions. Is share-tipping by newspapers ethically sound? Most papers refuse to do so because they think it wrong. But the Mirror sees it in much the same way as tipping racehorses. </p> <p>The difference is that the effect of a horse tip sends the price down, while a share tip tends to send the price up. So the City tipster stands to benefit from his or her tip, unlike his racecourse colleague. Should newspaper editors deal in shares? Inquiries by the Guardian reveal that almost none of them do so. Some do have shares in their own companies and have savings in managed funds, but they don't deal. Most financial journalists avoid dealing in equities too. The Financial Times and Sunday Business have clear rules which demand transparency within their offices. </p> <p>We contacted seven national newspaper editors - six of them stated that they do not deal in shares and nor do they believe that they should be allowed to do so. </p> <p>What matters here is perception. Even if everything is above board, the kind of dilemma faced by Morgan shows how difficult it is to convince people of the truth. By dealing at all, an editor lays him or herself open to charges of having inside knowledge. </p> <p>Should the editors' code be tightened? It is doubtful whether the code itself, which is considered fair by sensible financial journalists, needs amending. But there has been a flurry of activity in every paper's legal department since the Morgan story broke because, frankly, few papers ever considered this kind of problem before. </p> <p>There appear to be only unwritten custom-and-practice guidelines in place. One City editor said he uses \"the Private Eye test\". He asks his staff to think before they buy shares: \"How would this deal look if it appeared in Private Eye?\" </p> <p>In the circumstances, it would surely be wise for the PCC to encourage papers to draw up guidelines for staff, especially editors and senior executives, in order to satisfy the public, and sceptical politicians, about the probity of editorial share-dealing. </p> <p>Undoubtedly the best advice, followed by the majority of editors past and and present who I have called in the past couple of days, is not to trade at all. As one former editor said: \"The present bunch are already earning a fortune. Why do they need to make more?\" </p> <p>What is certain is that the previously cocksure Morgan has learned a lesson and is unlikely to add to his portfolio in the coming months. \"It's the worst thing I've had to endure,\" he says.</p>",

Most of the significant contenders for the presidency don't want the cut-and-thrust of serious question-and-answer, or the danger of unrehearsed conversation - the mother's milk, after all, of any political journalism worthy of the name. </p> <p>And these days their handlers go to extraordinary lengths to prevent it. You lose count of the times it happens in this campaign. There you are, standing on the rope line that segregates media from one of those carefully-choreographed campaign stops. The candidate inches towards your camera, shaking hands, patting backs, dispensing kisses and hugs. He is six feet away from you, looking your way, knows who and what you are. Then the minder appears, ducking below your camera, pointing the finger, whispering \"no questions, no questions\". </p> <p>If you do your job, and shout your question anyway, you get a yellow card and a handler takes your name and organisation, hinting darkly about privileges denied. That happened to me twice last week, once with Al Gore and again with George Bush. A BBC colleague thought he was about to be arrested one day for trying to get up too close and too personal to a candidate, in his case Bill Bradley. </p> <p>This is a far cry from Bill Clinton's campaign in 1992, even Bob Dole's in 1996. Clinton once told me how useful he found the banter on the rope-line, felt it made him a sharper candidate. \"I learn what's on your mind from your questions, I have a sense of the day's news agenda from talking to you all,\" he said. </p> <p>\"These days it's a farce, compared to what it was, and what it should be,\" says Joe Klein, writer for the New Yorker magazine. \"Politicians who say they want to talk to people now go out of their way to avoid journalists.\" </p> <p>The foreign correspondent in me knows that, of course, you are worth few votes. The years teach you that you represent a low priority for the campaign gurus, understandably so. </p> <p>In my world, on a campaign like this, you make your own luck. You engineer your chances to talk with a candidate, and you shoot straight when the moment comes. You cultivate those close to them, asking whatever is on your mind. You talk to as many ordinary people, those voters, as you can, constantly weighing the discrepancy between spin and reality. But you never treat a spin doctor as a friend, because that's when you stop asking your questions. </p> <p> What's so telling is that US journalists, even the important and illustrious, often have time with most of the candidates on strict, new terms. Questions are invariably pre-agreed, limited to specific areas, confined to three or four soundbites that a campaign wants to communicate that day. \"It's a bit embarassing,\" says one network producer as she waited for Governor George Bush to be interviewed. \"You want your correspondent to be seen asking questions, but the answers are pre-scripted bites . . . it's all formula now.\" </p> <p>Of course, some journalists go beyond that. A handful do spend time with the candidate of their choice, they do have unfettered access. But, increasingly, that does not produce impromptu exchanges that might take us beyond the daily diet of spin and prescribed messaging. </p> <p>One of the sights of this New Hampshire campaign was Ted Koppel, the doyen of TV news questioners, using his undoubted access to ask Vice-President Al Gore why he doesn't stop and talk to reporters, take questions, speak to the millions on the other end of the cameras. \"I'm too busy trying to talk to the people,\" Gore insisted before abruptly ending their conversation. </p> <p>When we saw Koppel the day after, he was wondering aloud about the state we are all in. \"It's getting harder all the time to do real journalism,\" he remarked. Three days later, in the immediate aftermath of Gore's victory, Koppel asked the vice-president the same, relatively simple question three times on the air. He didn't get an answer. </p> <p>Happily, there has been one notable exception to the Rule 2000, the code of candidate silence - John McCain. To watch McCain, on a rolling press conference of a bus called the Straight Talk Express, is to watch a seasoned practitioner at work: a candidate comfortable enough with himself, his views, his strengths, his weaknesses to shoot the breeze with reporters at any time of day or night. A politician smart enough to know he can talk his way on to an airwave that might, otherwise, cost him a fortune. </p> <p>Having spent a morning with him in the dark days of last November, when he barely registered a blip on the radar poll, and having seen him again last week, I know McCain's candidacy was built this way. He knows no other way. And, in any event, there wasn't the cash for anything else. </p> <p>\"I was a bit sceptical about his wish for open access at the beginning, I imagined all the holes he might dig for himself,\" says Mike Murphy, the witty, rather quirky Republican figure who is McCain's campaign guru. \"Then you think about the image he creates. There he is, night after night, riding our bus, taking questions from all you guys. It's a powerful image of authenticity and open government.\" </p> <p>Significantly, exit pollsters found voters making positive reference to those TV images of candidate candour on McCain's bus as they gave McCain a landslide victory in New Hampshire. \"I believe it is the most important message coming out of New Hampshire,\" says Klein, who works harder than most at asking his questions. \"After Clinton, people want to know they have a guy who can take any question, look them in the eye, and tell them what he knows or believes. McCain does that every day, on the bus or at town meeting, and people sense that.\" </p> <p>And so this campaign moves on to South Carolina, Michigan, New York, California. The window for asking questions, for a candidate's straight talk, grows ever smaller. Before long, this race will be defined by paid advertisements on the telly. But the opening round suggests the ultimate variable - public opinion - is demanding a lot less spin machinery: a little more journalism. Alastair Campbell might want to watch. </p> <p>David Smith is Washington correspondent for Channel 4 News. This is the first of his regular reports from the campaign trail.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Censorship arrived on my doorstep before dawn one December morning in 1998 on 12 legs, two of them female. As a nocturnal Celt I am not at my best before 10am. So when I answered the insistent knock, I had to count the legs and divide by two in order to register the reality of Freedom of Expression in Blair's Britain. A team of six detectives from the ministry of defence clustered together on the path before my tiny Herefordshire cottage. In the gloom they might have been a collective, pantomime dragon. </p> <p>Undeterred by the fact that I am a civilian and that their jurisdiction covers Defence property and people, they arrested me and searched the house (including the soiled linen) for almost eight hours. When they left, my computer, files and floppies went with them, never to return. I was ushered into their unmarked car and we went in search of the local nick. I, their prisoner, had to direct them there so that they could begin a five-hour session of interrogation and imprisonment. </p> <p>The cause of all this fuss is still, in some significant details, unclear but I gathered that it all had to do with my most recent book, The Irish War, an account of The Troubles. They have got me into trouble more than once. During the illegal military curfew imposed upon the Falls Road, Belfast, in 1970, I was arrested at gunpoint (theirs, not mine) and accused of behaviour likely to break the peace. As it happened, I was the only person in sight who was not armed and dangerous . . . but that is another story. </p> <p>This time, to judge from the questions put to me, the trouble was that I had mentioned the generic names of some software programmes and had somehow breached section 5 of the official secrets act 1989. There was one small problem with this scenario. Nothing I had written had damaged military security (as the law sensibly requires for a crime of this sort to be proved). Nor had I put lives at risk. Even more curious, those pursuing me already had a shrewd idea that they were barking up the wrong tree. My own inquiries since have confirmed that the MoD knew that I had caused embarrassment to one or two sensitive souls but no damage to military operations. </p> <p>Thirteen months later, a newly appointed attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, intervened to halt the prosecution of me. I had lost most of a year's work - a serious matter for a professional, self-employed writer - and much else. The MoD felt confident enough to write to my publisher, HarperCollins, strongly advising the firm not to publish the paperback version of a book that remained on sale as a hardback, untouched by official action. HarperCollins, colluding with this act of censorship, obligingly suppressed the book. </p> <p>My work as military consultant to a television drama team was blighted by the MoD's warning that I was, effectively, blacklisted from setting foot on military property. The drama, entitled Bomber and screened as a two-parter earlier this month, was shot at an army camp. </p> <p>The knife was twisted further by a claim that the \"damage\" I had caused was financial - around \u00a3170,000, the alleged cost of changing software names - and that I should be forced to make it good. And then, coincidentally, came a series of poison-pen letters and telephone calls to my allies around the country, made by an anonymous \"friend of Tony Geraghty\", and calculated to blacken my reputation. What might have started as a legal process now looked more like a private vendetta. </p> <p>To begin to comprehend this bizarre series of events, it is necessary to look at what television drama calls \"the back story\". Over the years, as an experienced military writer, I have learned to trust my sources and discuss with them, on equal terms, the way I am shaping their experiences. It is a sophisticated version of the journalistic lobby system. I have learned not to trust the officially appointed channels for such transactions. The MoD has more than one. Civilian writers are expected to volunteer their unpublished work for \"clearance\" by the secretary of the defence, press and broadcasting advisory committee. </p> <p>This body includes token journalists to give it a patina of democratic cover. In practice, manuscripts submitted to it by gullible, if patriotic, authors are leaked to a variety of departments, ranging from MI5 to the SAS. These in turn run a textual analysis on the material and begin a mole hunt for the author's sources. How do I know that such leaks occur? Because I was the intended beneficiary of one: a proof copy of the uncensored version of Mark Urban's book about Ireland, Big Boys' Rules. </p> <p>The other, more powerful censorship team is run from the secretariat, home and special forces of MoD. It is this department which feels sufficiently confident to instruct publishers what they will and will not publish, without troubling with such trifles as injunctions or other legal processes. Through the back stairs of the ministry, the avuncular secretary of the D-notice committee, as my inquiries have discovered, works in practice for the secretariat, a body which does not include journalists among its ranks. </p> <p>In August 1998, two months before The Irish War was due to appear, the secretary - a retired rear-admiral - contacted HarperCollins, seeking sight of part of the book devoted to the activities of the SAS. I refused access. Not only did I distrust the system: I had tried, at the outset of my research, to involve the army at a senior level, on lobby terms, in my attempt to reconstruct the essential truths of Britain's last colonial war. This time, following an unannounced restriction on co-operation of that sort, I was left to go my own way. That was no problem. But I assuredly resented the implication that when the work was done, I would accept the hidden hand of the censor to edit the manuscript. I said as much to HarperCollins. </p> <p>The admiral was not a happy sailor. He took advice and decided to let the matter go rather than seek an injunction and accept the odium of public censorship. Had he followed that legal route, it would have blown the hypocritical cover that the D-notice system is voluntary. Still, he wrote to say that once the book was published he would look at it again and notify HarperCollins of anything he thought necessary. The book appeared. He took no action. But his controller in secretariat, home and special forces, did move. The result was the raid on my home; two interrogation sessions, an appearance in the dock at Bow Street and prosecution for an offence which, on conviction, could have put me in prison for two years. </p> <p>At the end of it all, the crown prosecution service concluded that there was insufficient evidence against me. Or, to put it another way, the prosecution did not have a viable case. The MoD will not have entirely wasted its time. The next time an author is invited to \"volunteer\" his work for censorship, he will think twice before refusing. Refusal, as my case demonstrates, may be followed by a year's harassment, threat of financial ruin and imprisonment. That is how it is in the Kingdom of the Blair, where the one-eyed man, if he is wise, will pretend to be as blind as the rest. </p> <p>There is no unalloyed pleasure in this life, even in Whitehall. The negative outcome of the aborted action against me will tempt some bold writers to use classified documents without inhibition in future, so long as they avoid damage. The signs are that this is beginning to happen. Within days of my release from official harassment, BBC Radio 4 uniquely announced that it was quoting from \"classified\" military material to reveal shortcomings in the British invasion of Kosovo. Clearly, knowledge of such failures would help the next potential enemy. But no one seemed anxious to raid the BBC or arrest its excellent correspondent, Andrew Gilligan.</p>",

The cause of all this fuss is still, in some significant details, unclear but I gathered that it all had to do with my most recent book, The Irish War, an account of The Troubles. They have got me into trouble more than once. During the illegal military curfew imposed upon the Falls Road, Belfast, in 1970, I was arrested at gunpoint (theirs, not mine) and accused of behaviour likely to break the peace. As it happened, I was the only person in sight who was not armed and dangerous . . . but that is another story. This time, to judge from the questions put to me, the trouble was that I had mentioned the generic names of some software programmes and had somehow breached section 5 of the official secrets act 1989. There was one small problem with this scenario. Nothing I had written had damaged military security (as the law sensibly requires for a crime of this sort to be proved). Nor had I put lives at risk. Even more curious, those pursuing me already had a shrewd idea that they were barking up the wrong tree. My own inquiries since have confirmed that the MoD knew that I had caused embarrassment to one or two sensitive souls but no damage to military operations. Thirteen months later, a newly appointed attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, intervened to halt the prosecution of me. I had lost most of a year's work - a serious matter for a professional, self-employed writer - and much else. The MoD felt confident enough to write to my publisher, HarperCollins, strongly advising the firm not to publish the paperback version of a book that remained on sale as a hardback, untouched by official action. HarperCollins, colluding with this act of censorship, obligingly suppressed the book. My work as military consultant to a television drama team was blighted by the MoD's warning that I was, effectively, blacklisted from setting foot on military property. The drama, entitled Bomber and screened as a two-parter earlier this month, was shot at an army camp. The knife was twisted further by a claim that the \"damage\" I had caused was financial - around \u00a3170,000, the alleged cost of changing software names - and that I should be forced to make it good. And then, coincidentally, came a series of poison-pen letters and telephone calls to my allies around the country, made by an anonymous \"friend of Tony Geraghty\", and calculated to blacken my reputation. What might have started as a legal process now looked more like a private vendetta. To begin to comprehend this bizarre series of events, it is necessary to look at what television drama calls \"the back story\". Over the years, as an experienced military writer, I have learned to trust my sources and discuss with them, on equal terms, the way I am shaping their experiences. It is a sophisticated version of the journalistic lobby system. I have learned not to trust the officially appointed channels for such transactions. The MoD has more than one. Civilian writers are expected to volunteer their unpublished work for \"clearance\" by the secretary of the defence, press and broadcasting advisory committee. This body includes token journalists to give it a patina of democratic cover. In practice, manuscripts submitted to it by gullible, if patriotic, authors are leaked to a variety of departments, ranging from MI5 to the SAS. These in turn run a textual analysis on the material and begin a mole hunt for the author's sources. How do I know that such leaks occur? Because I was the intended beneficiary of one: a proof copy of the uncensored version of Mark Urban's book about Ireland, Big Boys' Rules. The other, more powerful censorship team is run from the secretariat, home and special forces of MoD. It is this department which feels sufficiently confident to instruct publishers what they will and will not publish, without troubling with such trifles as injunctions or other legal processes. Through the back stairs of the ministry, the avuncular secretary of the D-notice committee, as my inquiries have discovered, works in practice for the secretariat, a body which does not include journalists among its ranks. In August 1998, two months before The Irish War was due to appear, the secretary - a retired rear-admiral - contacted HarperCollins, seeking sight of part of the book devoted to the activities of the SAS. I refused access. Not only did I distrust the system: I had tried, at the outset of my research, to involve the army at a senior level, on lobby terms, in my attempt to reconstruct the essential truths of Britain's last colonial war. This time, following an unannounced restriction on co-operation of that sort, I was left to go my own way. That was no problem. But I assuredly resented the implication that when the work was done, I would accept the hidden hand of the censor to edit the manuscript. I said as much to HarperCollins. The admiral was not a happy sailor. He took advice and decided to let the matter go rather than seek an injunction and accept the odium of public censorship. Had he followed that legal route, it would have blown the hypocritical cover that the D-notice system is voluntary. Still, he wrote to say that once the book was published he would look at it again and notify HarperCollins of anything he thought necessary. The book appeared. He took no action. But his controller in secretariat, home and special forces, did move. The result was the raid on my home; two interrogation sessions, an appearance in the dock at Bow Street and prosecution for an offence which, on conviction, could have put me in prison for two years. At the end of it all, the crown prosecution service concluded that there was insufficient evidence against me. Or, to put it another way, the prosecution did not have a viable case. The MoD will not have entirely wasted its time. The next time an author is invited to \"volunteer\" his work for censorship, he will think twice before refusing. Refusal, as my case demonstrates, may be followed by a year's harassment, threat of financial ruin and imprisonment. That is how it is in the Kingdom of the Blair, where the one-eyed man, if he is wise, will pretend to be as blind as the rest. There is no unalloyed pleasure in this life, even in Whitehall. The negative outcome of the aborted action against me will tempt some bold writers to use classified documents without inhibition in future, so long as they avoid damage. The signs are that this is beginning to happen. Within days of my release from official harassment, BBC Radio 4 uniquely announced that it was quoting from \"classified\" military material to reveal shortcomings in the British invasion of Kosovo. Clearly, knowledge of such failures would help the next potential enemy. But no one seemed anxious to raid the BBC or arrest its excellent correspondent, Andrew Gilligan.",

Edinburgh's legal circles are always awash with delicious rumours and scandals. Like legal gossip everywhere, these are usually of a parochial nature but the build up to the Lockerbie trial is spawning a new level of conspiracy theory. </p> <p>The rumour now being circulated by well-placed lawyers is that the trial is being partly funded by the American justice department. Part of the price for that funding is the presence of a private camera in the courtroom. That camera will send an encrypted signal to the victims of the relatives and, one assumes, justice department officials in Washington. A sort of private television show, not for use by the general public. </p> <p>That's what I'm being told off the record, but what is as clear as day is that the Scottish legal establishment seems determined not to allow any other camera into their courtroom. Last Wednesday, lawyers representing BBC Scotland applied to the high court in Edinburgh for leave to discuss allowing television reporting of the Lockerbie trial. </p> <p>The judge dismissed the application without even hearing the BBC's case because, he decided, that the BBC had \"no locus\". In other words, it had no right to be heard at all and the question of whether the trial should be filmed was simply nothing to do with them. No cameras in court was the emphatic message. </p> <p>I heard the news from a well-placed insider in Edinburgh legal circles. He and I have been talking about the Lockerbie issue on and off since autumn 1998. At times, we have been optimistic about the chances of filming this trial, but increasingly our mood has been one of utter frustration. It has been announced that the BBC will go back to court for another try next month but the Scottish judiciary looks determined to keep the cameras out of what will be the most important criminal trial in British legal history. In the process, they will waste a golden opportunity to show the world that this trial is fair. </p> <p>In 1998, when the issue first arose the atmosphere was very different. Scotland's senior judge, the Lord President, reassured interested parties that filming of the trial would be possible and that it would be governed by the usual guidelines. </p> <p>These guidelines had been drawn up in 1994 to allow limited filming of trials in Scotland. This was possible simply because the 1925 criminal justice act, which banned cameras in court in England and Wales, had never been passed in Scotland. </p> <p>In the early 90s, Scotland's progressive and self-confident judiciary felt that it would be a good idea to allow limited television access, and so open up the administration of justice to an audience rather wider than the scattering of oddballs that usually inhabits the public gallery. </p> <p>That this spirit of glasnost seemed likely to extend to the Lockerbie trial echoed the flexibility and imagination shown by Scotland's senior judiciary and prosecuting authorities in their handling of the Lockerbie case throughout 1998. Their masterstroke had been to arrange for the trial to take place under Scottish law, but in the safe neutral venue of a disused military base in the Netherlands. </p> <p>As soon as they knew the trial was definitely going to take place, television news organisations turned their attention to getting their cameras into court. Led by BBC Scotland, the arguments for getting access to the court, and for amending the 1994 guidelines, were prepared. </p> <p>As they stood, the guidelines would only allow filming of a trial for use in a \"documentary\" to be transmitted after the case was over. As a documentary-maker, that has always suited me, but BBC Scotland, like every other UK and American news operation, wanted on-the-day news access. </p> <p>The usual argument against this is that contemporaneous coverage could prejudice a jury. But in this case there was to be no jury, just a panel of senior judges, and so no risk of prejudice. This was one of the issues that the BBC wanted to argue in court. </p> <p>But the arguments never got aired and it seems that the whole issue was decided privately in a series of quiet chats among senior legal figures in Edinburgh some time last year. The Lord Advocate has let it be known that the trial would not be filmed. </p> <p>Quite why the announcement came from the prosecution side as opposed to the court administration is unclear. Either way, it looks like a fait accompli since this hard-line stance appears to have been accepted by all parties. Many are surprised that the defence appears happy to miss the opportunity for their trial to take place under the scrutiny of television coverage, although I do know that one of their solicitors, Alistair Duff, is opposed to allowing cameras into court as a matter of principle. </p> <p>Equally, we don't know why the judiciary wants to keep the case as low-profile as possible. On a personal level, I find it ironic that the Lockerbie trial judge is Lord Sutherland, whom I worked with in 1994, while making the BBC series The Trial. Then he calmly and very happily presided over the first ever trial to be filmed in a Scottish high court. </p> <p>But the policy of quietly ruling out any filming has caused some problems. \"What about us?\" say the families of the victims, who understandably aren't happy about having to spend months in the Netherlands if they want to see the alleged murderers of their loved ones face justice. After all, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia down the road in The Hague successfully allows continuous coverage of its cases, so it's perfectly possible. </p> <p>The answer the families received seems clever but is in fact bizarre. Last August, Lord Hardy told the relatives that they would be able to watch the trial via a specially encrypted narrow-cast available only to them. The world's news cameras will have to wait outside the courthouse while inside the entire proceedings will be filmed and shown to select audiences in Scotland, England and the US. </p> <p>It appears that the US justice department's office for the victims of crime will pay for the satellite link back to America. It is an idea lifted from the Oklahoma bombing trial, where it was felt that live coverage of that recent and appalling crime might prejudice a local jury. </p> <p>Yet with Lockerbie the case is more than 11 years old, and there is no jury. The truth is that there is no technical or legal reason why their signal should not be pooled with TV news, which is another issue the BBC and interested news organisations would have liked to raise in court. </p> <p>What puzzles me and anyone else who knows the guidelines and the system for filming in Scottish courts is how the court can justify the presence of a narrow-cast system. The guidelines refer only to the presence of cameras - not the audience to which those pictures will be shown. Live or near live coverage of criminal trials is specifically banned. In addition, cameras are only allowed into court with the consent of everyone who will be filmed. At Wednesday's brief hearing, the issue was raised in conversation and much confusion ensued. Those who were present tell me that it was abundantly clear that neither the trial judge nor the defence had ever been asked for their consent. So, seven months after the victims families' had been promised their own private coverage of the trial it transpired that the key players had not been consulted. </p> <p>Yet by Friday morning, Joshua Rozenberg, the BBC's legal affairs correspondent, was running a news piece saying that Lord Sutherland had agreed to allowing coverage. My understanding is that a meeting took place in Lord Sutherland's chambers soon after the embarrassing scenes in the high court and a deal was struck. What infuriates many onlookers is that such a deal can be cut in private while the perfectly legitimate interest that the world's media have in applying to film the trial doesn't even get heard in court. </p> <p>Even more puzzling is the question of how that deal could be so quickly arranged. And what about the strict rules that require every witness to have given written consent before the camera is switched on? There was no mention of this in the announcement and there is no way that every witness has given their consent in advance. Perhaps the court has decided that the viewing rooms in the US, London and Dumfries can be treated as annexes of the court in the Netherlands and so the guidelines can be ignored. We don't know because no explanation has been offered. What is clear that the existing rules which are applied with such rigour to the people they were intended to help, television companies, have been hurriedly waived in order to keep the influential and vocal American relatives, and the US justice department, happy. </p> <p>None of the media or legal figures I have spoken to has with keeping the relatives properly informed via a TV link. What we all object to is the way in which the deals have been done behind closed doors, and organisations, such as the BBC, which do have a legitimate interest in covering the trial, have been totally shut out. </p> <p>If the Scottish judiciary are worried that on-the-day news coverage will cause problems then they can simply stick to the existing rules and allow documentary filming that will only be shown after the trial is long over. Perhaps they are concerned that witnesses may be unhappy about being filmed, but this problem has been overcome in previous cases by the simple expedient of instructing the camera operator not to film the witness's face. </p> <p>Perhaps they are worried that the presence of cameras will turn Lockerbie into an OJ-style media bun fight. Yet the dry and meticulous nature of this case, added to the distinctly non-celebrity status of the two accused, means that any such fear is groundless. </p> <p>By bending the rules to suit the Americans, the Scottish legal establishment have set the scene for a difficult few months. The trial begins on May 3. Before then, the BBC will have returned to court in a final attempt to be allowed to film. Several American news organisations are planning to join the action in what will be a formidable transatlantic alliance. </p> <p>It will be increasingly difficult for the Scottish courts simply to ignore the application. By agreeing to allow narrow-casting of the trial, their position has been seriously weakened. In the past they could argue that modifying the guidelines to allow, say, news coverage, was not an option. </p> <p>But now they have been seen to drive a coach and horses through the existing rules and can no longer argue that they are sacrosanct. Of course, they can stick it out and simply refuse to countenance allowing TV coverage but the pressure is going to mount and mount. Perhaps they should now show the same flexibility, and courage, that has characterised their handling of the Lockerbie saga so far, and rethink their position. If they don't, they will miss a chance to show a worldwide audience that justice is being done. </p> <p>\u0095 Nick Catliff, an expert in the televising of trials, is a director of Lion TV</p>",

      "body": "<p>Yesterday morning, on another glorious day, the Azzurro awoke in almost nonchalant triumph. The world had said theirs was an impossible dream. But the world was wrong. They had made sporting history and, wherever they looked, Italy had the bounce of spring in its jaunty step. </p> <p>For those who had come to Rome for the novel but exquisite sight of watching Six Nations rugby in the Eternal City, the thrill of seeing Italy win their first match in the sport's oldest tournament was irresistible. </p> <p>And if the shock of the new brought its inevitable confusion, at least it was a shared bewilderment. Rugby union had finally made the Italian front pages. Yet, even in celebration, it was still swamped by a different sport: sailing rather than football. </p> <p>Overnight the Italian yacht Luna Rossa had swept into the final of the America's Cup in Auckland by beating the American favourite in the deciding ninth race. Italy was captivated. Serie A, for once, stepped back in admiration. </p> <p>But even the Italians could not ignore the magnificent feat of their habitually ignored rugby team. They are still bamboozled by the oval game but, in Rome, they always recognise a miracle. </p> <p>The front page of Corriere dello Sport found the most representative way of fusing together a strange sporting trinity. A 'Luna Rossa, si!' banner headline dominated the more expected plea of 'Lazio e Roma, forza!' And then, at the very bottom, a heroic Six Nations debut effort was hailed - with the promise of more rugby on page 24. </p> <p>For world rugby, however, Italy's astonishing 34-20 demolition of Scotland will remain the story of 2000. On a day when England and France reaffirmed their superiority by crushing Ireland and Wales, Italy saved the inaugural Six Nations weekend from numbing predictability. </p> <p>Though the championship may be settled as early as a week on Saturday when England travel to Paris, the Italian adventure has just begun. European rugby should get down on its creaking knees in thankful tribute. </p> <p>Yet, an hour before the match, it had felt markedly different. 'The day is very beautiful,' Giuseppe Perotti had murmured, 'but I think the result will be very ugly.'

      "bodyText": "Yesterday morning, on another glorious day, the Azzurro awoke in almost nonchalant triumph. The world had said theirs was an impossible dream. But the world was wrong. They had made sporting history and, wherever they looked, Italy had the bounce of spring in its jaunty step. For those who had come to Rome for the novel but exquisite sight of watching Six Nations rugby in the Eternal City, the thrill of seeing Italy win their first match in the sport's oldest tournament was irresistible. And if the shock of the new brought its inevitable confusion, at least it was a shared bewilderment. Rugby union had finally made the Italian front pages. Yet, even in celebration, it was still swamped by a different sport: sailing rather than football. Overnight the Italian yacht Luna Rossa had swept into the final of the America's Cup in Auckland by beating the American favourite in the deciding ninth race. Italy was captivated. Serie A, for once, stepped back in admiration. But even the Italians could not ignore the magnificent feat of their habitually ignored rugby team. They are still bamboozled by the oval game but, in Rome, they always recognise a miracle. The front page of Corriere dello Sport found the most representative way of fusing together a strange sporting trinity. A 'Luna Rossa, si!' banner headline dominated the more expected plea of 'Lazio e Roma, forza!' And then, at the very bottom, a heroic Six Nations debut effort was hailed - with the promise of more rugby on page 24. For world rugby, however, Italy's astonishing 34-20 demolition of Scotland will remain the story of 2000. On a day when England and France reaffirmed their superiority by crushing Ireland and Wales, Italy saved the inaugural Six Nations weekend from numbing predictability. Though the championship may be settled as early as a week on Saturday when England travel to Paris, the Italian adventure has just begun. European rugby should get down on its creaking knees in thankful tribute. Yet, an hour before the match, it had felt markedly different. 'The day is very beautiful,' Giuseppe Perotti had murmured, 'but I think the result will be very ugly.' Like so many other ordinary Italian supporters, Perotti's flag twitched behind his back as he trudged towards Stadio Flaminio. 'Some of us,' he sighed, 'dreamed about this day since we were small boys. But now we are frightened.' Perotti waved at a bunch of kilted Scots drinking beer down a side street. 'Maybe we shock you today,' he shouted at the flushed flowers of Scotland, 'or maybe we don't . . .' The eventual shock was less that Italy were galvanised by the occasion into overcoming a slump which had seen them concede 599 points in their preceding 10 matches. It was more a surprise that Scotland were as terrible in Rome as they had been sublime in Paris when clinching the Five Nations last April. Though the rugby was flawed, the drama was raw.

For those to whom Autant-Lara meant quality French cinema in the 1940s and 1950s, associated with memories of Jean Gabin, Fernandel, Bourvil, Odette Joyeux, Gerard Philipe and Danielle Darrieux, it must have been a shock to realise that the neo-fascist and the once leftish film creator were one and the same. </p> <p>Autant-Lara subsequently resigned as an MEP, and as vice president of the Academy of Fine Arts, after the furore over his anti-semitic comments about Simone Weil, a former president of the parliament and Nazi death camp survivor. He told the left-wing magazine Globe: \"She plays the violin about that. When I hear talk of genocide, I reply, 'Well, they missed old Weil.' Whether you like it or not, she is from an ethnic group that is political and tries to take root and dominate.\" </p> <p>Some people pleaded that these were merely an old man's ravings; others pointed to a hatred, born out of disappointments in his film career. The turning point seems to have come when Autant-Lara was beached by the French new wave, which, he said in 1963, had \"made a mess of our industry and undoubtedly most of them will sink . . . Those intellectual pictures like Last Year In Marienbad are terrible and boring. People only went to see them out of snobbery. They are twisted in some way.\" </p> <p>As late as 1977, at the time of his last film, Gloria, a circus melodrama, he was still complaining that the new wave had emptied the cinemas, although he had shared the credits with Jean-Luc Goddard as one of the six directors on The Oldest Profession (1967). </p> <p>Autant-Lara had been an essential part of mainstream cinema for 30 years, and he saw new-wave upstarts shoving him aside. Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, in particular, through the pages of Cahiers du cinema, condemned the \"well-made\" film or the \"cinema du papa\" as exemplified by Autant-Lara. Like Marcel Carn\u00e9, who blamed his lack of acclaim and difficulties in getting films made on \"a government too close knit with the Jews\", Autant-Lara attacked the \"decadent left\" and the \"Jewish conspiracy\", in which he had included the directors that had displaced him - none of whom was Jewish. </p> <p>This paranoid anti-semitism might have dated from the late 1930s, when his Jewish producer boss, Maurice Lehmann, insisted on claiming a co-director credit on three films which Autant-Lara had virtually directed himself. One of them had been Fric-Frac, a slangy comic heist movie starring Arletty, Michel Simon and Fernandel. </p> <p>Autant-Lara was the son of architect Edouard Autant and actress Louise Lara. Because of his mother's pacifist views (which she instilled in her son), she exiled herself and the child to England during the first world war. When they returned, Autant-Lara studied art at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, before entering films in his teens as a designer. </p> <p>With Fernand L\u00e9ger and Alberto Cavalcanti, he de signed sets for Marcel L'Herbier's modernist L'Inhumaine (1924), and was responsible for the lavish decor and costumes of Jean Renoir's Nana (1926). In later years, Autant-Lara wrote scathingly about Renoir, although the latter had given the 23-year-old his best opportunity to date. After assisting Ren\u00e9 Clair on a couple of films, he made a number of avant-garde shorts, including Construire Un Feu (1927), the first film to achieve a widescreen effect through the use of Henri Chr\u00e9tien's anamorphic lens. </p> <p>In the early 1930s, Autant- Lara was hired by MGM to direct the French versions of several comedies in Hollywood, including two starring Buster Keaton - Parlor, Bedroom And Bath and The Passionate Plumber. He returned to France to make his first feature, Ciboulette (1933), based on Reynaldo Hahn's charming operetta. </p> <p>During the war, he directed four light and elegant films (only \"escapist\" pictures were possible under the Nazis), starring Odette Joyeux. Among them was Douce, about an aristocratic daughter in late 19th-century Paris who falls for her manservant. Joyeux also played the 16-year-old heroine in Sylvie Et La Fantome (Sylvie And The Ghost), who becomes enamoured of a nobleman she sees in a painting. It was an entertaining comedy- romance in which Jacques Tati, as the ghost, made his first feature film appearance. </p> <p>Postwar, Aulant-Lara's reputation was established as a tormenter of middle-class morality. In Le Diable Au Corps (Devil In The Flesh, 1947), G\u00e9rard Philipe, as a 17-year-old schoolboy, has an affair with a young married woman (Micheline Presle) while her husband is away at the front. The film caused outrage in some quarters, although the film can now be seen as a sensuous love story, framing two touching performances. </p> <p>Occupe-Toi D'Amelie (1949), a sparkling adaptation of Feydeau, with Danielle Darrieux as the Parisian cocotte, incurred local bans in Britain, and enraged American critics, who considered it lewd and immoral. The film retains the theatrical proscenium but, using a provincial family visiting the theatre for the first time, moves out into the audience, the streets, and back again, to maximum effect. </p> <p>It took the British censor six years to pass The Red Inn (1951) uncut because of its allegedy blasphemous aspects. Amusing and macabre, it had Fernandel as a 19th-century monk trying to prevent a coachload of travellers from being robbed and murdered. Le Ble en Herbe (The Ripening Seed, 1953) intelligently adapted from Colette's tender triangular tale about an adolescent boy's seduction by an older woman (Edwige Feu- illere), was condemned as \"immoral and obscene\" by the church, and banned in Nice and Chicago. </p> <p>Two sumptuous, if superficial, Technicolor adaptations from classic novels, Le Rouge Et Le Noir (1954) and The Gambler (1958), had the advantage of G\u00e9rard Philipe's sensitive embodiment of both Stendhal's and Dostoevsky's heroes respectively. </p> <p>One of Autant-Lara's best pictures was La Traverse\u00e9 De Paris (A Pig Across Paris) in 1956, with Jean Gabin and Bourvil transporting four suitcases of blackmarket pork across Paris during the occupation. The only work exempted by Truffaut in his attack on Autunt-Lara, it was one of the first French films to recognise that there was cowardice, stupidity, apathy and hypocrisy among the populace during the period. </p> <p>Autant-Lara's prolific output in the 1950s included a number of films whose attraction abroad lay in what was then considered French naughtiness: Marguerite De La Nuit (1955), an art deco updating of the Faust legend to the 1920s, with Yves Montand and Michele Morgan; En Cas De Malheur (Love Is My Profession, 1958), based on a Georges Simenon novel, with veteran Gabin as a lawyer being vamped by his young client Brigitte Bardot, who had an obligatory nude scene; and La Jument Verte (The Green Mare's Nest 1959), the film comedy in which Bourvil first became widely known outside France. </p> <p>Autant-Lara continued to court controversy towards the end of his film career with two well-meaning, didactic films, Thou Shalt Not Kill (1962) and Journal d'Une Femme en Blanc (Woman in White, 1965), which argued the rights of women to contraception. The theme of the former, sympathetic to a second world war conscientious objector, lost him financial backing. It was eventually made in Yugoslavia, and denied a release in France and Italy for some time. </p> <p>Perhaps this was a further factor in turning Claude Autant-Lara into an embittered old man. </p> <p>\u0095 Claude Autant-Lara, film director, born August 5 1903; died February 12 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "In 1989, almost every member of the European parliament walked out when the French MEP and former film director Claude Autant-Lara, who has died aged 96, spoke on behalf of Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front. For those to whom Autant-Lara meant quality French cinema in the 1940s and 1950s, associated with memories of Jean Gabin, Fernandel, Bourvil, Odette Joyeux, Gerard Philipe and Danielle Darrieux, it must have been a shock to realise that the neo-fascist and the once leftish film creator were one and the same. Autant-Lara subsequently resigned as an MEP, and as vice president of the Academy of Fine Arts, after the furore over his anti-semitic comments about Simone Weil, a former president of the parliament and Nazi death camp survivor. He told the left-wing magazine Globe: \"She plays the violin about that. When I hear talk of genocide, I reply, 'Well, they missed old Weil.' Whether you like it or not, she is from an ethnic group that is political and tries to take root and dominate.\" Some people pleaded that these were merely an old man's ravings; others pointed to a hatred, born out of disappointments in his film career. The turning point seems to have come when Autant-Lara was beached by the French new wave, which, he said in 1963, had \"made a mess of our industry and undoubtedly most of them will sink . . . Those intellectual pictures like Last Year In Marienbad are terrible and boring. People only went to see them out of snobbery.

      "body": "<p>Section 28, the controversial legislation banning the promotion of homosexuality, has encouraged the spread of homophobic bullying, according to independent research published today.</p> <p>The study came as the government faces a crushing defeat over repeal of the clause in the Lords tonight with up to 40 rebel Labour peers expected to join forces with Conservatives and crossbenchers.</p> <p>The resistance has been strengthened by a statement from Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools, that there was no evidence of section 28 causing problems for teachers.</p> <p>But a study by the institute of education at London university has found the clause created \"an atmosphere of confusion and fear\" that was discouraging staff from intervening to stop an epidemic of homophobic abuse in school playgrounds and corridors.</p> <p>The problem was explored in in-depth confidential interviews with teachers. \"Because they do not know how to comply with section 28, they err on the side of caution. As a result, they choose to ignore homophobic harassment and bullying whenever possible. This creates a permissive environment in which pupils believe they can, and do, get away with it,\" said Debbie Epstein who led the interviews.</p> <p>One teacher told her: \"Schools have been intimidated out of making sexuality part of equal opportunities. Certainly the huge amount of bullying is manifested as homophobic abuse.\"</p> <p>Dr Epstein said the problem impacted on all pupils - lesbian, gay, bisexual or heterosexual. \"It is the most widespread form of abuse in schools. Any child who seems different may be subjected to it.</p> <p>\"Boys struggle to avoid being called gay, poofter, bumboy, queer or whatever the local term is. Boys who work hard are often labelled as gay and this may deter them.\"</p> <p>Her findings reinforce earlier work by the institute showing 82% of teachers were aware of homophobic verbal bullying and 26% of homophobic physical abuse. While almost all schools had anti-bullying policies, only 6% of these dealt with homophobic abuse.</p> <p>Four in five teachers wanted further clarification of section 28 and 56% said its continuing existence made it difficult to meet the needs of lesbian, gay and bisexual pupils.</p> <p>Hilary Armstrong, the local government minister, yesterday said Labour had a \"duty\" to tackle discrimination. \"Children and young people, growing up in what is a very difficult environment, need appropriate and sensitive counselling and guidance,\" she told Sky News.</p> <p>\"No one is talking about promotion. What we are talking about is giving young people the right framework so that they can face problems, concerns, fears and do that in confidence that their teachers will work with them.\"</p> <p>The government will be able to rely tonight on the votes of 54 Liberal Democrat peers. But ministers are braced for up to 40 defections among Labour peers and Catholic ones who take their cue from the strong opposition by their church's hierarchy.</p> <p>Labour has around 200 peers. Faced with 160 crossbenchers, many of the 26 bishops and the 227 Conservatives, most of whom are expected to vote no, that will not prove enough.</p> <p>Lady Young, the former Thatcher cabinet minister, is leading the campaign to retain section 28 which forbids local authorities to use public money to \"promote\" gay sexuality. She is staging displays of \"gay propaganda\" in the Lords to the dismay of some colleagues.</p> <p>Labour's best chance is an amendment tabled last week by Michael Nazir-Ali, the Anglican bishop of Rochester, who has a compromise to entrench what he calls \"the provision of comprehensive and ethically-based sex education\".</p> <p>Peter Tatchell, of the gay rights group OutRage! said: \"Baroness Young is creating an atmosphere of anti-gay intolerance that will almost certainly lead to an increase in queer-bashing violence. All that we want is for teachers to encourage acceptance.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Section 28, the controversial legislation banning the promotion of homosexuality, has encouraged the spread of homophobic bullying, according to independent research published today. The study came as the government faces a crushing defeat over repeal of the clause in the Lords tonight with up to 40 rebel Labour peers expected to join forces with Conservatives and crossbenchers. The resistance has been strengthened by a statement from Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools, that there was no evidence of section 28 causing problems for teachers. But a study by the institute of education at London university has found the clause created \"an atmosphere of confusion and fear\" that was discouraging staff from intervening to stop an epidemic of homophobic abuse in school playgrounds and corridors. The problem was explored in in-depth confidential interviews with teachers. \"Because they do not know how to comply with section 28, they err on the side of caution. As a result, they choose to ignore homophobic harassment and bullying whenever possible. This creates a permissive environment in which pupils believe they can, and do, get away with it,\" said Debbie Epstein who led the interviews. One teacher told her: \"Schools have been intimidated out of making sexuality part of equal opportunities. Certainly the huge amount of bullying is manifested as homophobic abuse.\" Dr Epstein said the problem impacted on all pupils - lesbian, gay, bisexual or heterosexual. \"It is the most widespread form of abuse in schools. Any child who seems different may be subjected to it. \"Boys struggle to avoid being called gay, poofter, bumboy, queer or whatever the local term is. Boys who work hard are often labelled as gay and this may deter them.\" Her findings reinforce earlier work by the institute showing 82% of teachers were aware of homophobic verbal bullying and 26% of homophobic physical abuse. While almost all schools had anti-bullying policies, only 6% of these dealt with homophobic abuse. Four in five teachers wanted further clarification of section 28 and 56% said its continuing existence made it difficult to meet the needs of lesbian, gay and bisexual pupils. Hilary Armstrong, the local government minister, yesterday said Labour had a \"duty\" to tackle discrimination. \"Children and young people, growing up in what is a very difficult environment, need appropriate and sensitive counselling and guidance,\" she told Sky News. \"No one is talking about promotion. What we are talking about is giving young people the right framework so that they can face problems, concerns, fears and do that in confidence that their teachers will work with them.\" The government will be able to rely tonight on the votes of 54 Liberal Democrat peers. But ministers are braced for up to 40 defections among Labour peers and Catholic ones who take their cue from the strong opposition by their church's hierarchy. Labour has around 200 peers. Faced with 160 crossbenchers, many of the 26 bishops and the 227 Conservatives, most of whom are expected to vote no, that will not prove enough. Lady Young, the former Thatcher cabinet minister, is leading the campaign to retain section 28 which forbids local authorities to use public money to \"promote\" gay sexuality. She is staging displays of \"gay propaganda\" in the Lords to the dismay of some colleagues. Labour's best chance is an amendment tabled last week by Michael Nazir-Ali, the Anglican bishop of Rochester, who has a compromise to entrench what he calls \"the provision of comprehensive and ethically-based sex education\". Peter Tatchell, of the gay rights group OutRage! said: \"Baroness Young is creating an atmosphere of anti-gay intolerance that will almost certainly lead to an increase in queer-bashing violence. All that we want is for teachers to encourage acceptance.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>We are all in the thin-air business these days. It is slightly frightening to work out just how little supports most of our livelihoods. In the past, people made their living by extracting ore, mining coal, making steel, manufacturing cars, bringing cattle to market. They mined, they made, they forged. Work was hard physical labour. As Bertrand Russell, the philosopher, put it in In Praise of Idleness: \"Work is moving things around at or near to the earth's surface.\" The output of this labour could be weighed on scales, shipped in railway cars, measured with rules, stockpiled. </p> <p>These days most people in most advanced economies produce nothing that can be weighed: communications, software, advertising, financial services. They trade, write, design, talk, spin and create; rarely do they make anything. The assets they work with are as ephemeral as their output. Of course many of us work in large buildings, offices and factories and we work with machinery and equipment, computers and robots. Yet the real assets of the modern economy come out of our heads not out of the ground: ideas, knowledge, skills, talent and creativity. Indeed, the richer and more powerful the person, the more likely it is that they make their money by manipulating ephemera and intangibles rather than from labour in any recognisable sense.</p> <p>There is no better example of this than one of the most successful thin-air businesses ever created, the British Royal Family, and one of the world's leading practitioners of thin-air economics, the late Diana, Princess of Wales.</p> <p>The British Royal Family has no output other than symbolism, a vague sense of well-being it occasionally induces in its citizenry and a lot of gossip. Of course, the Royal Family is very rich. It owns a lot of prime real estate. But that is not the source of its power or standing. People do not come to see Buckingham Palace because it is a beautiful or striking building. They come because the Queen lives there. The Royal Family's value is as a national symbol: it's a brand. Its power and influence stem entirely from the ephemeral world of gestures and symbols. Its most precious assets are not physical but intangible: public popularity, loyalty, affection and the dwindling stock of human capital that are its members. Princess Diana proved particularly adept at thriving in this thin-air business.</p> <p>While the Royal Family remained rooted in the past, imprisoned by the assets and protocol which were once its strength, Princess Diana exploited one of the first laws of thin-air economics: those with the best image and ideas are more agile, quicker to adapt and better able to communicate directly with people than those weighed down by tradition, trapped by protocol or encumbered by physical assets which have outlived their usefulness. The Royal Family was trapped by its past, like a lazy, complacent incumbent in an industry it had long dominated: the very lucrative monarchy franchise for the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Diana was the upstart challenger, an entrepreneur who used new technology to outmanoeuvre the established but tired incumbent. For the Royal Family, read IBM; for Diana, read Microsoft and the new challengers in the computer industry which have emerged in the last decade. For the Royal Family read Barclays and NatWest; for Diana, read First Direct and the telephone and electronic banks which are the new competitors.</p> <p>Diana's celebrity was a product of modern economics. She was a celebrity on a global scale because we live in an era of global media, which allows a kind of global gossip. Celebrities have risen in tandem with the communications technology that makes them possible: it started with telegraph and wireless, now it is satellites and the Internet. When Charles and Diana got married in 1981 there were 11.7 television sets per 100 people in the world; now there are 23 per 100 people and broadcasting has been transformed by a digital revolution which is spawning hundreds of channels.</p> <p> It took 38 years for radio to reach 50 million users in the US. It took 16 years before the same number of Americans used personal computers. The Internet reached 50 million Americans within four years of being available to ordinary consumers. Global communications allow instant distribution of news and images at little cost to tens of millions of people. Pictures travel better than words. Words have to be translated; Diana's face was universal. Lennon and Churchill came up with memorable phrases; Diana came up with memorable looks. Gestures and symbols are the currency of global communications. Diana became a celebrity in the era in which Coke, McDonald's, Nike and Calvin Klein all became truly global brands, with symbols that could be recognized instantly from rural Turkey to Tokyo. So did Diana's smile. Images cross geographic and social borders far more easily than words. Diana was a largely silent star in a cacophonous age. Her life was meant to be seen, not heard. When she opened her mouth she destroyed her classless appeal and we remembered that she was just another Sloane. Princess Diana was a creature of the modern communications revolution. The current Royal Family, like so many of our other outmoded institutions, is rooted to its Victorian origins.</p> <p>But visual images alone do not sell; brands need personality. We seem increasingly attached to celebrities, through whom we live vicariously. Although Diana was rich, jetted about for endless holidays and lived behind high railings, she managed to conjure a reputation for being popular and accessible. She broke through protocol and convention to talk in public about bulimia and adultery. Celebrities of old were meant to be flawless heroes who were held up as moral exemplars: intrepid explorers, ingenious discoverers, inspired performers, visionary leaders. </p> <p>Diana, on the contrary, was compelling because she was flawed and seemed to acknowledge it. We knew more about Diana than most of us know about our neighbours. Diana was an intimate celebrity. Intimate celebrities - the famous people that ordinary punters feel close to and can trust - are among the most valuable commodities in the modern economy. They sell global products.</p> <p>Consumer-goods companies increasingly use celebrities to promote their brands: they want that mixture of excellence, ubiquity and intimacy that celebrities offer. Nike is the prime example of a company which built its brand around its association with idolised sporting celebrities: Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. There is a good economic reason for this. It's a response to competition. As markets become more crowded and competitive, it becomes ever more important for products to stand out by being distinctive. One way to achieve that is to associate the product with a celebrity the consumers admire, by investing his or her character in the product.

      "bodyText": "We are all in the thin-air business these days. It is slightly frightening to work out just how little supports most of our livelihoods. In the past, people made their living by extracting ore, mining coal, making steel, manufacturing cars, bringing cattle to market. They mined, they made, they forged. Work was hard physical labour. As Bertrand Russell, the philosopher, put it in In Praise of Idleness: \"Work is moving things around at or near to the earth's surface.\" The output of this labour could be weighed on scales, shipped in railway cars, measured with rules, stockpiled. These days most people in most advanced economies produce nothing that can be weighed: communications, software, advertising, financial services. They trade, write, design, talk, spin and create; rarely do they make anything. The assets they work with are as ephemeral as their output. Of course many of us work in large buildings, offices and factories and we work with machinery and equipment, computers and robots. Yet the real assets of the modern economy come out of our heads not out of the ground: ideas, knowledge, skills, talent and creativity. Indeed, the richer and more powerful the person, the more likely it is that they make their money by manipulating ephemera and intangibles rather than from labour in any recognisable sense. There is no better example of this than one of the most successful thin-air businesses ever created, the British Royal Family, and one of the world's leading practitioners of thin-air economics, the late Diana, Princess of Wales. The British Royal Family has no output other than symbolism, a vague sense of well-being it occasionally induces in its citizenry and a lot of gossip. Of course, the Royal Family is very rich. It owns a lot of prime real estate. But that is not the source of its power or standing. People do not come to see Buckingham Palace because it is a beautiful or striking building. They come because the Queen lives there. The Royal Family's value is as a national symbol: it's a brand. Its power and influence stem entirely from the ephemeral world of gestures and symbols. Its most precious assets are not physical but intangible: public popularity, loyalty, affection and the dwindling stock of human capital that are its members. Princess Diana proved particularly adept at thriving in this thin-air business. While the Royal Family remained rooted in the past, imprisoned by the assets and protocol which were once its strength, Princess Diana exploited one of the first laws of thin-air economics: those with the best image and ideas are more agile, quicker to adapt and better able to communicate directly with people than those weighed down by tradition, trapped by protocol or encumbered by physical assets which have outlived their usefulness. The Royal Family was trapped by its past, like a lazy, complacent incumbent in an industry it had long dominated: the very lucrative monarchy franchise for the United Kingdom. Diana was the upstart challenger, an entrepreneur who used new technology to outmanoeuvre the established but tired incumbent. For the Royal Family, read IBM; for Diana, read Microsoft and the new challengers in the computer industry which have emerged in the last decade. For the Royal Family read Barclays and NatWest; for Diana, read First Direct and the telephone and electronic banks which are the new competitors. Diana's celebrity was a product of modern economics. She was a celebrity on a global scale because we live in an era of global media, which allows a kind of global gossip. Celebrities have risen in tandem with the communications technology that makes them possible: it started with telegraph and wireless, now it is satellites and the Internet. When Charles and Diana got married in 1981 there were 11.7 television sets per 100 people in the world; now there are 23 per 100 people and broadcasting has been transformed by a digital revolution which is spawning hundreds of channels. It took 38 years for radio to reach 50 million users in the US. It took 16 years before the same number of Americans used personal computers. The Internet reached 50 million Americans within four years of being available to ordinary consumers. Global communications allow instant distribution of news and images at little cost to tens of millions of people. Pictures travel better than words. Words have to be translated; Diana's face was universal. Lennon and Churchill came up with memorable phrases; Diana came up with memorable looks. Gestures and symbols are the currency of global communications. Diana became a celebrity in the era in which Coke, McDonald's, Nike and Calvin Klein all became truly global brands, with symbols that could be recognized instantly from rural Turkey to Tokyo. So did Diana's smile. Images cross geographic and social borders far more easily than words. Diana was a largely silent star in a cacophonous age. Her life was meant to be seen, not heard. When she opened her mouth she destroyed her classless appeal and we remembered that she was just another Sloane. Princess Diana was a creature of the modern communications revolution. The current Royal Family, like so many of our other outmoded institutions, is rooted to its Victorian origins. But visual images alone do not sell; brands need personality. We seem increasingly attached to celebrities, through whom we live vicariously. Although Diana was rich, jetted about for endless holidays and lived behind high railings, she managed to conjure a reputation for being popular and accessible. She broke through protocol and convention to talk in public about bulimia and adultery. Celebrities of old were meant to be flawless heroes who were held up as moral exemplars: intrepid explorers, ingenious discoverers, inspired performers, visionary leaders. Diana, on the contrary, was compelling because she was flawed and seemed to acknowledge it. We knew more about Diana than most of us know about our neighbours. Diana was an intimate celebrity. Intimate celebrities - the famous people that ordinary punters feel close to and can trust - are among the most valuable commodities in the modern economy. They sell global products. Consumer-goods companies increasingly use celebrities to promote their brands: they want that mixture of excellence, ubiquity and intimacy that celebrities offer. Nike is the prime example of a company which built its brand around its association with idolised sporting celebrities: Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods. There is a good economic reason for this. It's a response to competition. As markets become more crowded and competitive, it becomes ever more important for products to stand out by being distinctive. One way to achieve that is to associate the product with a celebrity the consumers admire, by investing his or her character in the product. Consumer-goods manufacturers have a vested interest in celebrities who can front their products to help them stand out from the crowd. It should be no surprise that after Diana's death the biggest controversies were about her after-life as a brand, in particular who should control the rights to use her name and image to promote products and make money. Our emotional response to Diana's death was fleeting. The anniversary of her death drew a muted response. Her commercial value will be more enduring. Fame is the basis for some of our most important industries: entertainment, music and sport. As Diana's career in the Royal Family was unfolding, so was this structural shift in the character of the British economy. Britain earns more from exports of rock music than it does from steel. She started her royal career as a blast from the past: a gawky adolescent, seemingly bred for a life of duty, wellies, gun dogs, children and forbearance.

Diana's reach exemplified another aspect of modern economics: the power of directness. Diana went direct to the people by using the media. She bypassed formal channels.

However, this internet job has taken over my life a little bit. It is one of those industries where you are paid from 9-5.30, but work for a lot longer. There is a fairly relaxed attitude to work here, providing it gets done. We are a very young company and a pretty liberal bunch so I socialise with them quite a lot. There is a good team environment, so in that way it is similar to being involved with Middlesex. The company are very keen on stress-management techniques - we've got table football, pool and other games. </p> <p>I've kept in touch with John Buchanan [Middlesex coach in 1998, now coach of Australia] and it is possible that I might go to Queensland for the winter next year, or the year after. He gave me a lot of ideas. He was one of the first people to introduce Statmaster software to county cricket. He brought a laptop over with him and documented where the ball pitched, what percentage of shots were going through backward point etc, and then you got a printout at the end of the day. I travelled with the first team and worked the computer for him for the four months that I was injured. He is doing really well in Australia - I'm very pleased for him. </p> <p>I've probably got another ten years in cricket if I stay fit but I'm very conscious of the fact that bowlers break down easily. I want to play for England and if the time comes when I think I won't be able to play for England, I'll get out. I'm not going to stay in the county system until I'm 34 or 35. </p> <p>I'm not one for setting goals, but Gatt has said he would like me to get 500 runs and 50 wickets this season. I believe that is realistic, though if he'd said the same thing to me last year I would have been a little bit apprehensive. I've spoken a lot to our fitness guy John Neal about how I can usually only believe that I can do something once I've done it. I want to turn that around so I believe it before I've done it. </p> <p>I don't train with the rest of the Middlesex boys because they train during the day, and I try and go two or three times a week to a gym in Richmond, where I live. </p> <p>I've got two brothers Adam, 20, who has had trials with Middlesex and Northants, and Ben, 15, who plays U-16 cricket for Oxfordshire. They will both be better than me. I don't see as much of them as I want. When I moved down to London I said I'd try and go back home to Oxford once a month, but that just hasn't worked out.

Last season he played ten Championship matches, before getting injured, and took 27 wickets at 35.33. \"Other cricketers keep asking me what I've been doing this winter. When I tell them, they go \"aaghh\". Basically, I work as a web author at bluewave.com, a web-design company that makes sites for people like BA and Glaxo Welcome. Designers hand the sites over to me and then I make them work. I joined bluewave (who wrote the Middlesex website) in September of last year. I've always wanted a back-up career (I've got coaching qualifications but wanted something else), which is why I've not gone out of my way to tour. I've done things the wrong way round, as usual. I left school at 16 and worked for a computer company for three-and-a-half years. That was when the internet was beginning to take off, so I started mucking around with html when I was there.

      "body": "<p>The rise to power of J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom party has injected a new element of fear into the day-to-day politics of the citizens of this EU member state.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry but, before we go any further, would you mind showing me your press card?\" asked the young man in the black anorak. \"Now, you never know.\" He was one of up to 2,000 people who joined a marathon, nine-hour demonstration through the streets of Vienna on Saturday night. He said he had come along because \"it is the only thing I can do so as to be able to say to myself: 'Whatever happens now, I have done something'.\"</p> <p>After seeing the press card, he said that he was a unmarried sound engineer with one son, but refused to give his name.</p> <p>Before the Freedom party took office as an equal partner in Austria's coalition government last Friday, Mr Haider warned that it would be watching its critics closely. As a high percentage of police are thought to be Freedom party sympathisers, it is clear that a lot of people are taking him at his word.</p> <p>One smartly dressed young woman fled into the main body of the march as soon as I began to ask her opinions.</p> <p>Blocked from entering the city centre by a ring of police, the demonstrators turned their protest into something of a pilgrimage. They marched out to the inner ring road, back to parliament, round the town hall and out to the inner ring road again, before finally being allowed into the centre. They then traced a circuitous route through its cobbled alleys to the headquarters of the Freedom party.</p> <p>There, shortly before 2am, they began a sit-in in front of police in full riot gear, backed by a water cannon. But, in contrast to previous nights, there was no violence.</p> <p>The only incident came when a young man was arrested after balloons filled with paint were hurled at a bank near the Hofburg palace.</p> <p>The protesters blew whistles, banged gongs and drums, and let off firecrackers. In a moment of high farce, they marched in a cacophony around an open-air ice rink where skaters had been gliding about to the strains of a Strauss waltz. Some of those who marched brought their dogs; others carried or wheeled young children.</p> <p>Miriam Mkzoch, who gave her name only after asking, \"Do you think that this could have any consequences for me?\", carried a placard with the words \"A peaceful no\". She said the idea of such a long march was \"so that lots of people see it\".</p> <p>Student Ronja Vogl said: \"I think that maybe now people will wake up. I think that now maybe awareness will grow.\"</p> <p>Maybe. Vienna has seldom seen anarchic scenes such as those of the past few nights, and that could help to shock Austrians into a change of tack.</p> <p>In the protest's waning moments, a passionate argument about Mr Haider erupted between a woman in an expensive-looking coat and one of the members of her party.</p> <p>But ultimately the most striking thing about this dogged protest were that it was almost entirely composed of the young and that, on an evening when most of Vienna's residents' commitments were purely social, no more than a brave couple of thousand could be found to openly voice their dissent against a party that only captured 27% of the vote.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The rise to power of J\u00f6rg Haider's Freedom party has injected a new element of fear into the day-to-day politics of the citizens of this EU member state. \"I'm sorry but, before we go any further, would you mind showing me your press card?\" asked the young man in the black anorak. \"Now, you never know.\" He was one of up to 2,000 people who joined a marathon, nine-hour demonstration through the streets of Vienna on Saturday night. He said he had come along because \"it is the only thing I can do so as to be able to say to myself: 'Whatever happens now, I have done something'.\" After seeing the press card, he said that he was a unmarried sound engineer with one son, but refused to give his name. Before the Freedom party took office as an equal partner in Austria's coalition government last Friday, Mr Haider warned that it would be watching its critics closely. As a high percentage of police are thought to be Freedom party sympathisers, it is clear that a lot of people are taking him at his word. One smartly dressed young woman fled into the main body of the march as soon as I began to ask her opinions. Blocked from entering the city centre by a ring of police, the demonstrators turned their protest into something of a pilgrimage. They marched out to the inner ring road, back to parliament, round the town hall and out to the inner ring road again, before finally being allowed into the centre. They then traced a circuitous route through its cobbled alleys to the headquarters of the Freedom party. There, shortly before 2am, they began a sit-in in front of police in full riot gear, backed by a water cannon. But, in contrast to previous nights, there was no violence. The only incident came when a young man was arrested after balloons filled with paint were hurled at a bank near the Hofburg palace. The protesters blew whistles, banged gongs and drums, and let off firecrackers. In a moment of high farce, they marched in a cacophony around an open-air ice rink where skaters had been gliding about to the strains of a Strauss waltz. Some of those who marched brought their dogs; others carried or wheeled young children. Miriam Mkzoch, who gave her name only after asking, \"Do you think that this could have any consequences for me?\", carried a placard with the words \"A peaceful no\". She said the idea of such a long march was \"so that lots of people see it\". Student Ronja Vogl said: \"I think that maybe now people will wake up. I think that now maybe awareness will grow.\" Maybe. Vienna has seldom seen anarchic scenes such as those of the past few nights, and that could help to shock Austrians into a change of tack. In the protest's waning moments, a passionate argument about Mr Haider erupted between a woman in an expensive-looking coat and one of the members of her party. But ultimately the most striking thing about this dogged protest were that it was almost entirely composed of the young and that, on an evening when most of Vienna's residents' commitments were purely social, no more than a brave couple of thousand could be found to openly voice their dissent against a party that only captured 27% of the vote.",

Richard Cohen, who played a key role in establishing the millionaire's writing career, is to tell detectives that Lord Archer asked him to give an inaccurate account of his movements on the night that the peer was alleged to have slept with a prostitute. The intervention by Mr Cohen follows Lord Archer's five-year expulsion from the Tory party after he admitted asking another friend to provide a false alibi for his libel action. William Hague underlined his anger with Lord Archer yesterday when he accused him of \"kicking\" the party by failing to admit his dishonesty. Lord Archer's latest setback will come when Mr Cohen tells Scotland Yard detectives, who are investigating the novelist's false alibi admission, that he was asked to push back the time he left a restaurant on the night that Lord Archer was alleged to have slept with the prostitute Monica Coghlan. Mr Cohen told the high court in 1987, during the libel case, that he had dined with his then wife, Caroline, Lord Archer and other friends at Le Caprice restaurant in Mayfair, central London. Mr Cohen said that he left the restaurant at 10.30pm. His refusal to change the time he left the restaurant - Lord Archer asked Mr Cohen to say he had left at 11pm - meant that the peer needed to concoct an alibi for later that evening.

Ms Page has long been linked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which will start interviewing for a new chief executive later this month. Why crowds have stayed away from the 'greatest show on earth' Problem: The dome has, not to put too fine a point on it, an image problem. Solution: A new name worked with Euro Disney, but few think that Pierre-Yves Gerbeau will repeat the same trick with the dome. The \"one amazing day\" slogan seems likely to go, however, as many feel it gives the impression the dome can be seen in just one day. Problem: Inflexible and some say high ticket prices. Solution: Although the dome claims its \u00a350 family tickets are better value than most theme parks, industry insiders say the \u00a320 adult charge is steep for such a derided day out. More flexible ticket prices, with big discounts mid-week when the dome is usually very empty, would boost numbers. Problem: Lack of foreign visitors. Solution: Despite claims that the dome is admired abroad, only 11% of visitors so far have been foreign tourists. With the home market so wary of the dome, experts argue advertising should be aimed at wooing visitors from the US, Europe and Japan. Problem: What is the dome for? Solution: This is the riddle which no one has been quite able to explain. Marketing analysts say the public will only warm to the dome when they know what it is.

      "body": "<p>Throughout the night, the rumble of Russian mortars echoed through the village; from time to time the entire sky flashed alight, and the clatter of machine-gun fire droned endlessly on.</p> <p>The Magomedova family slept peacefully as the windows rattled and the walls shook, apparently oblivious to the unsettling hum of planes flying low overhead.</p> <p>After four months of war, they no longer have the energy to drag themselves out of bed each night to shelter in their cellar. The women have developed a certain fatalism; whatever will be, will be, they say, and in the meantime they prefer to sleep as comfortably as possible.</p> <p>As daylight broke, the results of the night's work became visible. Every window in the village's only secondary school had been shattered when a rocket landed in the playground. Only four days earlier, locals had refitted the panes in preparation for the school's reopening. Russian bureaucrats provided the glass - as part of their campaign to restore life to normal in the areas of Chechnya they refer to as \"liberated\".</p> <p>The rest of the night's damage was restricted to the woods around the village, where the army believed a group of rebels was hiding. By morning, the intensity of the attack had faded, but the shelling continued.</p> <p>Across the vast western plains of Chechnya, Russian troops are searching for those Chechen fighters who withdrew en masse from the capital Grozny last week. Civilians unfortunate enough to live in the villages along the rebel's escape route have found themselves under fire again.</p> <p>The inhabitants of this village, some 15 miles west of Grozny, had hoped they would never have to endure more direct attacks. They had suffered three weeks of intensive bombardment in November, as the Russians sought to take it under control, and most of the buildings still bear the scars of that attack.</p> <p>During the war that raged through Chechnya from 1994 to 1996, this village came to symbolise the worst atrocities of Russia's campaign; even its name still evokes a sense of unease in every Chechen.</p> <p>The presence of fighters in the region has again made life extremely dangerous for these villagers.</p> <p>Most of the rebels who fled along this path left the village swiftly in the direction of the mountains. A few dozen remain, hiding with their families throughout the village, emerging only fleetingly or under the cover of darkness - their beards shaved off and their uniforms hidden. They know that if the Russian soldiers catch them, an attack of unrivalled ferocity will be unleashed on the village.</p> <p>Only amid great secrecy would Isa, 23, a fighter wounded badly in the ribs as he fled from the capital, agree to discuss the future of the rebel campaign. He had to be driven from his house in a nearby village to another building elsewhere before he felt secure enough to speak.</p> <p>His description of the state of the Chechen fighters was surprisingly bleak. The order to retreat from Grozny had been given, he said, because the fighters could no longer go on.</p> <p>\"We had suffered a lot of casualties. The Russian ring around the city grew tighter and tighter, and the smaller it became, the more difficult it was for us,\" he said. \"Every day there were air strikes and more casualties.</p> <p>He left the city on foot with hundreds of fellow rebels, received cursory medical help at the tiny hospital in Alkhan Kala, before walking through the night to his family in a village west of the city. There he buried his weapon, hid his uniform and retreated to a sick bed.</p> <p>\"In my sleep I'm always back in the city fighting again,\" he said. \"When I wake up, I'm surprised to be alive.\"</p> <p>Later that evening, three more fighters walked from an underground shelter in the forests outside the village, through the pitch-black streets to the house where we were staying, eager to discuss the progress of the war.</p> <p>Despite the long-standing Russian promise to restore electricity to the areas of Chechnya under their control, this village has been without power for five months. As such, the men huddled in the basement around a gas lamp to tell their tales of war, their long shadows thrown on the walls around the room.</p> <p>Ruslan, a front-line commander from Grozny, said: \"It was the right decision to withdraw from Grozny. We were tired and the ruins of the city no longer seemed very important to us. We showed the Russians what we were capable of, inflicted many casualties, and now we are resting.\"</p> <p>He said the fighters would retreat to bases in the mountains to the south of Chechnya and wait until spring, when their strength would be restored. There were more than 50 of them resting in a nearby shelter in the woods, he said.</p> <p>They are in transit, although he admitted that they would have to move on soon; the shelter had recently ceased to be much of a safe haven, as Russian troops suspected its presence. During the afternoon, fighter planes circled above the woods, and later a helicopter gunship dropped several bombs on the area.</p> <p>The rebels need money, he said, adding that it was quite possible that some commanders would organise kidnapping raids to finance the war.</p> <p>\"The war isn't over,\" Ruslan said. \"We will continue the fight until Chechnya wins independence - otherwise all these lives will have been lost in vain.\"</p>",

The Magomedova family slept peacefully as the windows rattled and the walls shook, apparently oblivious to the unsettling hum of planes flying low overhead. After four months of war, they no longer have the energy to drag themselves out of bed each night to shelter in their cellar. The women have developed a certain fatalism; whatever will be, will be, they say, and in the meantime they prefer to sleep as comfortably as possible. As daylight broke, the results of the night's work became visible. Every window in the village's only secondary school had been shattered when a rocket landed in the playground. Only four days earlier, locals had refitted the panes in preparation for the school's reopening. Russian bureaucrats provided the glass - as part of their campaign to restore life to normal in the areas of Chechnya they refer to as \"liberated\". The rest of the night's damage was restricted to the woods around the village, where the army believed a group of rebels was hiding. By morning, the intensity of the attack had faded, but the shelling continued. Across the vast western plains of Chechnya, Russian troops are searching for those Chechen fighters who withdrew en masse from the capital Grozny last week. Civilians unfortunate enough to live in the villages along the rebel's escape route have found themselves under fire again. The inhabitants of this village, some 15 miles west of Grozny, had hoped they would never have to endure more direct attacks. They had suffered three weeks of intensive bombardment in November, as the Russians sought to take it under control, and most of the buildings still bear the scars of that attack. During the war that raged through Chechnya from 1994 to 1996, this village came to symbolise the worst atrocities of Russia's campaign; even its name still evokes a sense of unease in every Chechen. The presence of fighters in the region has again made life extremely dangerous for these villagers. Most of the rebels who fled along this path left the village swiftly in the direction of the mountains. A few dozen remain, hiding with their families throughout the village, emerging only fleetingly or under the cover of darkness - their beards shaved off and their uniforms hidden. They know that if the Russian soldiers catch them, an attack of unrivalled ferocity will be unleashed on the village. Only amid great secrecy would Isa, 23, a fighter wounded badly in the ribs as he fled from the capital, agree to discuss the future of the rebel campaign. He had to be driven from his house in a nearby village to another building elsewhere before he felt secure enough to speak. His description of the state of the Chechen fighters was surprisingly bleak. The order to retreat from Grozny had been given, he said, because the fighters could no longer go on. \"We had suffered a lot of casualties. The Russian ring around the city grew tighter and tighter, and the smaller it became, the more difficult it was for us,\" he said. \"Every day there were air strikes and more casualties. He left the city on foot with hundreds of fellow rebels, received cursory medical help at the tiny hospital in Alkhan Kala, before walking through the night to his family in a village west of the city. There he buried his weapon, hid his uniform and retreated to a sick bed. \"In my sleep I'm always back in the city fighting again,\" he said. \"When I wake up, I'm surprised to be alive.\" Later that evening, three more fighters walked from an underground shelter in the forests outside the village, through the pitch-black streets to the house where we were staying, eager to discuss the progress of the war. Despite the long-standing Russian promise to restore electricity to the areas of Chechnya under their control, this village has been without power for five months. As such, the men huddled in the basement around a gas lamp to tell their tales of war, their long shadows thrown on the walls around the room. Ruslan, a front-line commander from Grozny, said: \"It was the right decision to withdraw from Grozny. We were tired and the ruins of the city no longer seemed very important to us. We showed the Russians what we were capable of, inflicted many casualties, and now we are resting.\" He said the fighters would retreat to bases in the mountains to the south of Chechnya and wait until spring, when their strength would be restored. There were more than 50 of them resting in a nearby shelter in the woods, he said. They are in transit, although he admitted that they would have to move on soon; the shelter had recently ceased to be much of a safe haven, as Russian troops suspected its presence. During the afternoon, fighter planes circled above the woods, and later a helicopter gunship dropped several bombs on the area. The rebels need money, he said, adding that it was quite possible that some commanders would organise kidnapping raids to finance the war. \"The war isn't over,\" Ruslan said. \"We will continue the fight until Chechnya wins independence - otherwise all these lives will have been lost in vain.\"",

      "body": "<p>Enshrined in every American's heart is the belief in the First Amendment, the right to free speech, as fundamental as the need to breathe. It was his commitment to this basic civil liberty that enabled Norman Siegel, a New York civil rights lawyer, to defend the Ku Klux Klan.</p> <p>Siegel, the Jewish kid from Brooklyn, executive director of New York Civil Liberties Union, veteran of the civil rights battles in the South, had always championed the underdog: gays, lesbians, African Americans, Latinos. But he had had his fair share of repugnant clients, too: the anti-Semitic black nationalist Khalid Abdul Muhammed, and the Black Israelites, an anti-white pseudo-religious group.</p> <p>His connection with the KKK was brought about by the actions of New York's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had turned down the Klan's application to hold a rally last October. Siegel was worried that the Klan would ask the NYCLU to represent it, believing that, if the union took the case, it might alienate the bulk of its clients, despite all the excellent anti-discrimination work it had done. He had good cause to worry.</p> <p>In 1978, the American Civil Liberties Union had represented a group of neo-Nazis who wanted to march through Skokie, Illinois. They lost an estimated 7,000 members as a result. For many reasons the Klan's case was one that 55-year-old Siegel felt he could do without. The KKK's right to demonstrate was not something he wanted to get involved with. He told his staff that with any luck the Klan would never call. But of course it did. The Grand Imperial Wizard, the Reverend Jeffery Berry, wanted Siegel to defend it, \"and I said I probably would. We set up the meeting and agreed to take the case.\"</p> <p>A child of the 60s, Siegel was a law student at New York University as the Southern civil rights movement took hold. The South was, he states, where he learned the importance of free speech. To Siegel \"silence is equated with approval\".</p> <p>And, he says, \"It's harder to defend someone when you don't believe in what they stand for. It's a different dynamic. And the Klan is repugnant, wrong-minded, bigoted.\" Which is exactly why he told them he didn't believe in anything they stood for, and that their beliefs were offensive.</p> <p>\"It was also important to me that they understood that I believed in the first amendment, and that was why I would defend them. I don't think it came as a big surprise. They didn't make a big deal about it. I want to advance the issues of equality and justice, to defend the accused, the powerless and the controversial. This is what I want to use my skills as a lawyer for. I learned that the first amendment expects me to defend the expression of bigots, not their conduct.\"</p> <p>He thinks America's love affair with the right to free speech has historic links to England, but notes that the US has a long history of Big Mouths. \"I don't agree with the Klan but I would defend to the death their right to free speech, to invoke Voltaire. I don't think of myself as a lawyer for the Klan but as a lawyer for the Constitution. Maybe that has a ring of Pollyanna about it. But it wasn't until I saw the headline in a local paper - 'Klan's Lawyer' - that it really hit me.\"</p> <p>The core issue is the inherent right of anyone to hold a peaceful rally. Giuliani, invoking a never used anti-mask law, had turned down the Klan's application because they wanted to wear hoods and masks.</p> <p>Siegel is adamant that the government cannot pick and choose who can have access to free speech. Government censorship scares him most. But he draws a firm line between speech and action. Speech is protected, conduct is not.</p> <p>\"It's easy to say you're for free speech when it's non controversial, but are you for free speech when the speaker is offensive? Some think our defence of the Klan was one of our finer moments. You don't allow government to coerce silence.\"</p> <p>At the same time as he was defending the Klan, he was also advising counter-demonstrators. Siegel acknowledges that the Klan could have complained about a conflict of interest and asked him to stop but they didn't. On the day the Klan held the rally, with no hoods and no masks, only about 17 members turned up. They had expected about 80. But 7,000 to 8,000 counter-demonstrators (some masked) took over the streets of Manhattan.</p> <p>Even the black leader Al Sharpton and New York's leading black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, supported the Klan's right to free speech. \"That helped enormously,\" said Siegel. \"Leaders in the black community thought: if Giuliani could turn the Klan down, who else could he turn down?\" In the six years of the Giuliani administration, the NYCLU has challenged the mayor 25 times in first amendment cases, prevailing wholly or partly in 19. Two are still pending.</p> <p>\"I was proud when I was walking in Harlem and I got a better reception than usual. People went out of their way to say that I had done the right thing.\" Riding the subway with the KKK on the way to court, Siegel thought that New Yorkers, known for their confrontational style, might create some uncomfortable moments. But nothing happened.</p> <p>For him the experience was emotionally wearing. He received harassing phone calls, and the militant Jewish Defense Organisation picketed the Manhattan apartment block where he lives with his partner. In the past, whenever Mordechai Levy, leader of the Jewish Defense Organisation, was barred from speaking or picketing, he would call Siegel, who would represent him. Now the tables were turned and he was outside Siegel's home.</p> <p>\"He was very angry that as a Jew I was representing the Klan. They distributed fliers in my neighbourhood saying that I was a traitor. That was not fun. I am proud to be Jewish, but I had to do what I had to do.\"</p> <p>He advised the Upper West Side building's management where to allow the protesters to gather, and asked them not to call the police, in order not to catapult the demonstrators into the limelight. Hate calls echoed in the middle of the night, some threatening to kill his family. \"That's very difficult to get through.

      "bodyText": "Enshrined in every American's heart is the belief in the First Amendment, the right to free speech, as fundamental as the need to breathe. It was his commitment to this basic civil liberty that enabled Norman Siegel, a New York civil rights lawyer, to defend the Ku Klux Klan. Siegel, the Jewish kid from Brooklyn, executive director of New York Civil Liberties Union, veteran of the civil rights battles in the South, had always championed the underdog: gays, lesbians, African Americans, Latinos. But he had had his fair share of repugnant clients, too: the anti-Semitic black nationalist Khalid Abdul Muhammed, and the Black Israelites, an anti-white pseudo-religious group. His connection with the KKK was brought about by the actions of New York's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had turned down the Klan's application to hold a rally last October. Siegel was worried that the Klan would ask the NYCLU to represent it, believing that, if the union took the case, it might alienate the bulk of its clients, despite all the excellent anti-discrimination work it had done. He had good cause to worry. In 1978, the American Civil Liberties Union had represented a group of neo-Nazis who wanted to march through Skokie, Illinois. They lost an estimated 7,000 members as a result. For many reasons the Klan's case was one that 55-year-old Siegel felt he could do without. The KKK's right to demonstrate was not something he wanted to get involved with. He told his staff that with any luck the Klan would never call. But of course it did. The Grand Imperial Wizard, the Reverend Jeffery Berry, wanted Siegel to defend it, \"and I said I probably would. We set up the meeting and agreed to take the case.\" A child of the 60s, Siegel was a law student at New York University as the Southern civil rights movement took hold. The South was, he states, where he learned the importance of free speech. To Siegel \"silence is equated with approval\". And, he says, \"It's harder to defend someone when you don't believe in what they stand for. It's a different dynamic. And the Klan is repugnant, wrong-minded, bigoted.\" Which is exactly why he told them he didn't believe in anything they stood for, and that their beliefs were offensive. \"It was also important to me that they understood that I believed in the first amendment, and that was why I would defend them. I don't think it came as a big surprise. They didn't make a big deal about it. I want to advance the issues of equality and justice, to defend the accused, the powerless and the controversial. This is what I want to use my skills as a lawyer for. I learned that the first amendment expects me to defend the expression of bigots, not their conduct.\" He thinks America's love affair with the right to free speech has historic links to England, but notes that the US has a long history of Big Mouths. \"I don't agree with the Klan but I would defend to the death their right to free speech, to invoke Voltaire. I don't think of myself as a lawyer for the Klan but as a lawyer for the Constitution. Maybe that has a ring of Pollyanna about it. But it wasn't until I saw the headline in a local paper - 'Klan's Lawyer' - that it really hit me.\" The core issue is the inherent right of anyone to hold a peaceful rally. Giuliani, invoking a never used anti-mask law, had turned down the Klan's application because they wanted to wear hoods and masks. Siegel is adamant that the government cannot pick and choose who can have access to free speech. Government censorship scares him most. But he draws a firm line between speech and action. Speech is protected, conduct is not. \"It's easy to say you're for free speech when it's non controversial, but are you for free speech when the speaker is offensive? Some think our defence of the Klan was one of our finer moments. You don't allow government to coerce silence.\" At the same time as he was defending the Klan, he was also advising counter-demonstrators. Siegel acknowledges that the Klan could have complained about a conflict of interest and asked him to stop but they didn't. On the day the Klan held the rally, with no hoods and no masks, only about 17 members turned up. They had expected about 80. But 7,000 to 8,000 counter-demonstrators (some masked) took over the streets of Manhattan. Even the black leader Al Sharpton and New York's leading black newspaper, the Amsterdam News, supported the Klan's right to free speech. \"That helped enormously,\" said Siegel. \"Leaders in the black community thought: if Giuliani could turn the Klan down, who else could he turn down?\" In the six years of the Giuliani administration, the NYCLU has challenged the mayor 25 times in first amendment cases, prevailing wholly or partly in 19. Two are still pending. \"I was proud when I was walking in Harlem and I got a better reception than usual. People went out of their way to say that I had done the right thing.\" Riding the subway with the KKK on the way to court, Siegel thought that New Yorkers, known for their confrontational style, might create some uncomfortable moments. But nothing happened. For him the experience was emotionally wearing. He received harassing phone calls, and the militant Jewish Defense Organisation picketed the Manhattan apartment block where he lives with his partner. In the past, whenever Mordechai Levy, leader of the Jewish Defense Organisation, was barred from speaking or picketing, he would call Siegel, who would represent him. Now the tables were turned and he was outside Siegel's home. \"He was very angry that as a Jew I was representing the Klan. They distributed fliers in my neighbourhood saying that I was a traitor. That was not fun. I am proud to be Jewish, but I had to do what I had to do.\" He advised the Upper West Side building's management where to allow the protesters to gather, and asked them not to call the police, in order not to catapult the demonstrators into the limelight. Hate calls echoed in the middle of the night, some threatening to kill his family. \"That's very difficult to get through. It's pretty scary.\" Sometimes he would try to talk to the callers; one even ended up calling him a \"mensch\", Yiddish for decent person. \"I like talking to people, and as I get older I'm better at listening to them. It helps defuse the anger.\" Soon he will be back in court for another round. He has filed papers so the Klan can gather in the spring, this time wearing their hoods and masks.",

However, unexploded cluster bombs - which distribute hundreds of bomblets - have maimed and killed civilians in Kosovo since the conflict ended last June. The HRW report says that about 500 civilians died in 90 separate incidents - three times the number of incidents involving civilian casualties the Pentagon has admitted. But it rejects claims by the Yugoslav government that 5,000 civilians were killed. The Pentagon is due to publish a report on the bombing campaign today. Cluster bombs had already killed up to 150 civilians before the attack on Nis on May 7 last year. HRW - which has called for cluster bombs to be banned - says the Pentagon secretly ordered a halt to the use of the munitions in mid-May, but alleges that \"British forces continued using cluster bombs even after US forces discontinued their use\". Officials at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at the Hague conducted an internal appraisal of the case against Nato in December, but the chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte issued a statement insisting that the alliance was not the subject of a formal inquiry. HRW's estimate of about 500 civilian casualties, though well above Nato estimates, is a fraction of that claimed by the the Yugoslav government. Today's report also alleges that the 76 ethnic Albanian prisoners Belgrade claimed were killed by Nato bombing of the Dubrava jail in Kosovo, were in fact executed by Serb forces after the raid. Both during and after the war, Nato spokesmen insisted that Yugoslav forces operated a \"human shield\" policy and the HRW report lends weight to those claims. However, it still constitutes an indictment of Nato air commanders, who the HRW claims could have done much more to reduce what was euphemistically referred to at the time as \"collateral damage\". Several of the worst incidents involving civilian casualties resulted from the bombing of refugee convoys or bridges mistakenly identified as military targets. The report says \"these civilian deaths raise the question whether the fact that pilots were flying at high altitudes may have contributed to these civilian deaths by precluding proper target identification.\" HRW concludes there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive judgment. \"Once it made a decision to attack Yugoslavia, Nato should have done more to protect civilians,\" Kenneth Roth, the director of Human Rights Watch, said. However, by HRW's count, more than half the civilian deaths caused by Nato raids occurred as a result of attacks on illegitimate or questionable targets or misdirected raids. The report singles out the attack on the Serb Radio and Television headquarters in Belgrade on April 23 in which 16 civilians were killed and 16 injured. It rejects a claim made at the time by British ministers that it was a \"legitimate military target\". Human Rights Watch calls on Nato governments to set up an independent commission to investigate the incidents, and draw up a new targeting and bombing doctrine. HRW's military consultant William Arkin, who led the assessment team, said: \"For a war with the reputation of being the smartest in history, there is an unfortunate pattern of Nato ignoring many important lessons from previous conflicts.\"",

The top tips newly issued by the party's Millbank headquarters to women would-be MPs make depressing reading, not to mention easy fodder for journalists happy to perpetuate the \"Blair's Babes\" phenomenon. Once again, the Labour machine - notoriously responsible for that photograph of Tony Blair surrounded by the 101 female MPs swept in at the last general election - has shown an unerring ability to be caught reducing women to a series of walking trouser suits delivering manifesto pledges on cue.</p> <p>Ironically, the guidance has come to light just as the party is groping towards a recognition of the need to take genuinely constructive steps (we're not talking earrings) towards ensuring that women win through in the still uphill battle for selection. A meeting today of the women's committee of Labour's ruling national executive is expected to set a target of securing half of all Labour's vacant Westminster seats (around 24 at present but set to rise) for women candidates at the next election. Last week, Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, sent a letter to all constituency secretaries, reminding them: \"The party is committed to increasing the number of women MPs and therefore women parliamentary candidates, and urges all constituency parties to bear this in mind when making your selection.\"</p> <p>But if the party is to inch nearer to its long-held and apparently often forgotten target of a 50:50 male-female ratio, the signs so far are not good. Before selection even starts, plans by four Labour women MPs to step down at the next election will bring the party's record total below the benchmark 100 figure.</p> <p>In Scotland and Wales, where a substantial clutch of Labour's safest seats are falling free as incumbents retire or quit to concentrate full-time on jobs in the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, senior women fear a virtual wipe-out by male candidates. Some privately warn that the very selection mechanisms that ensured a rough gender balance in Labour candidates for elections to the devolved institutions have led to a backlash under which favoured local sons sidelined by the system have been all but promised safe Westminster seats instead.</p> <p>The trade unions, meanwhile, are also mobilising to ensure that their candidates are in the front line for selections - and again the contenders are expected to be mainly men. Their argument, strengthened by the resignation of junior defence minister Peter Kilfoyle to speak up for traditional Labour voters, runs that the party must field people with real links to its working-class heartlands, rather than on-message, middle-class professionals, men or women, imposed by Millbank.</p> <p>Women's campaign group the Fawcett Society accepts that women must beware of being the instruments of Millbank control. But director Mary-Ann Stephenson argues: \"If constituencies are concerned about having female candidates imposed from the centre, then they are going to have to find them for themselves.\"</p> <p>Former social security secretary Harriet Harman, a leading voice among those pressing the Labour leadership to renew its focus on women's votes, believes slates put forward by trade unionists and Blairite modernisers alike are set to exclude women. \"I'm not arguing for separate women's slates,\" she says. \"I want to see women integrated into any list of potential candidates.\"</p> <p>If the prospects are not encouraging, there is little drastic action that Labour can take to guarantee women candidates at the next election. Last time, it famously used all-female shortlists to ensure women ran in safe seats, but the mechanism was successfully challenged at a tribunal and dropped by the party. Even though both Blair (who last week admitted to MPs he had privately thought the women-only lists a lousy idea) and McDonagh are now converts to the option of legislating to allow parties to run single-sex lists, that will not happen until after the next election.</p> <p>Nevertheless, even sceptical women MPs and campaigners acknowledge that attitudes are changing up in Millbank tower. \"It's amazing how an imminent election can focus men's minds wonderfully,\" comments one female MP. Party strategists have finally begun to take notice of the argument Harman, the Fawcett Society and others have been pushing strongly for at least a year: that Labour ignores women voters and spurns women candidates at its peril.</p> <p>The campaigners have done their homework. Recognising that the boys at Millbank may not be able to get their gelled heads around the feminist case for equal representation but at least have a grasp of cold statistics, MPs and pressure groups are offering the electoral case for selecting women. A study by Deborah Mattinson of Opinion Leader Research focuses on Worcester Woman's Unfinished Revolution, arguing that women voters see the increased numbers of female politicians as an important step, but equally will interpret any backsliding as a negative development.</p> <p>Winning Women, a Fawcett Society paper that analyses female voters' views after devolved elections in Scotland and Wales, also found women believed female representatives understood their concerns better than men. But it showed clearly that women, already more sceptical than men of Labour, will take any fall in the numbers of female MPs as an indication that efforts last time were merely an \"electoral con\" and will punish the party at the polls.</p> <p>This hard-headed demonstration of the dangers of ignoring female voters was the lever that secured Labour's election-winning targeting of women last time. The party managed to close the gender gap - the difference between men's and women's support - from a massive 12% at its peak in the 1970s to just 2% in 1997. At 11%, the swing to Labour among women was higher than among men (9%) - a trend the party is anxious to maintain.</p> <p>Today, Harriet Harman has been invited to the NEC to outline her proposal for Operation Women's Vote - a plan already spoken highly of by Paisley South MP Douglas Alexander, one of Labour's four leading strategists for the next election. The strategy proposes a three-pronged focus on policy, organisation and presentation in order to target both women in middle England (the famous Worcester Woman) and women in Labour's traditional heartlands. As well as pressure for women's selection, Harman advocates swifter progress on policy issues set as high priorities by women (including maternity pay reforms, help with work-life balance and support for carers) and \"a total halt to macho language - big guns and big hitters - and all-male platforms\".</p> <p>Her call for greater promotion of the progress made by the new intake women MPs coincides with the first, long-awaited signs of a fightback in their ranks, with the publication of an account of their contribution by Fiona Mactaggart, respected MP for Slough. Helen Jackson, MP for Sheffield Hillsborough and a member of the NEC women's committee, welcomes the prime minister's Damascene conversion to positive action for women and insists that the party must push for 50% of new candidates to be women.</p> <p>The question now is, will the new efforts work? Will women - with or without distracting earrings - win a way through the selection process and will Blair finally recognise that it is not a vote-loser to develop policies appealing to women? The answer should emerge over the next six months, as selections take place before an expected 2001 election, and it may well be that, as last time, women's voices are heard. Nevertheless, it is still deeply depressing that the democratic case for reflecting women's concerns and aspirations is never enough for the strategists of Millbank until the rattle of the ballot boxes can be clearly heard.</p>",

Before selection even starts, plans by four Labour women MPs to step down at the next election will bring the party's record total below the benchmark 100 figure. In Scotland and Wales, where a substantial clutch of Labour's safest seats are falling free as incumbents retire or quit to concentrate full-time on jobs in the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, senior women fear a virtual wipe-out by male candidates. Some privately warn that the very selection mechanisms that ensured a rough gender balance in Labour candidates for elections to the devolved institutions have led to a backlash under which favoured local sons sidelined by the system have been all but promised safe Westminster seats instead. The trade unions, meanwhile, are also mobilising to ensure that their candidates are in the front line for selections - and again the contenders are expected to be mainly men. Their argument, strengthened by the resignation of junior defence minister Peter Kilfoyle to speak up for traditional Labour voters, runs that the party must field people with real links to its working-class heartlands, rather than on-message, middle-class professionals, men or women, imposed by Millbank. Women's campaign group the Fawcett Society accepts that women must beware of being the instruments of Millbank control. But director Mary-Ann Stephenson argues: \"If constituencies are concerned about having female candidates imposed from the centre, then they are going to have to find them for themselves.\" Former social security secretary Harriet Harman, a leading voice among those pressing the Labour leadership to renew its focus on women's votes, believes slates put forward by trade unionists and Blairite modernisers alike are set to exclude women. \"I'm not arguing for separate women's slates,\" she says. \"I want to see women integrated into any list of potential candidates.\" If the prospects are not encouraging, there is little drastic action that Labour can take to guarantee women candidates at the next election. Last time, it famously used all-female shortlists to ensure women ran in safe seats, but the mechanism was successfully challenged at a tribunal and dropped by the party. Even though both Blair (who last week admitted to MPs he had privately thought the women-only lists a lousy idea) and McDonagh are now converts to the option of legislating to allow parties to run single-sex lists, that will not happen until after the next election. Nevertheless, even sceptical women MPs and campaigners acknowledge that attitudes are changing up in Millbank tower. \"It's amazing how an imminent election can focus men's minds wonderfully,\" comments one female MP. Party strategists have finally begun to take notice of the argument Harman, the Fawcett Society and others have been pushing strongly for at least a year: that Labour ignores women voters and spurns women candidates at its peril. The campaigners have done their homework. Recognising that the boys at Millbank may not be able to get their gelled heads around the feminist case for equal representation but at least have a grasp of cold statistics, MPs and pressure groups are offering the electoral case for selecting women. A study by Deborah Mattinson of Opinion Leader Research focuses on Worcester Woman's Unfinished Revolution, arguing that women voters see the increased numbers of female politicians as an important step, but equally will interpret any backsliding as a negative development. Winning Women, a Fawcett Society paper that analyses female voters' views after devolved elections in Scotland and Wales, also found women believed female representatives understood their concerns better than men. But it showed clearly that women, already more sceptical than men of Labour, will take any fall in the numbers of female MPs as an indication that efforts last time were merely an \"electoral con\" and will punish the party at the polls. This hard-headed demonstration of the dangers of ignoring female voters was the lever that secured Labour's election-winning targeting of women last time. The party managed to close the gender gap - the difference between men's and women's support - from a massive 12% at its peak in the 1970s to just 2% in 1997. At 11%, the swing to Labour among women was higher than among men (9%) - a trend the party is anxious to maintain. Today, Harriet Harman has been invited to the NEC to outline her proposal for Operation Women's Vote - a plan already spoken highly of by Paisley South MP Douglas Alexander, one of Labour's four leading strategists for the next election. The strategy proposes a three-pronged focus on policy, organisation and presentation in order to target both women in middle England (the famous Worcester Woman) and women in Labour's traditional heartlands. As well as pressure for women's selection, Harman advocates swifter progress on policy issues set as high priorities by women (including maternity pay reforms, help with work-life balance and support for carers) and \"a total halt to macho language - big guns and big hitters - and all-male platforms\". Her call for greater promotion of the progress made by the new intake women MPs coincides with the first, long-awaited signs of a fightback in their ranks, with the publication of an account of their contribution by Fiona Mactaggart, respected MP for Slough. Helen Jackson, MP for Sheffield Hillsborough and a member of the NEC women's committee, welcomes the prime minister's Damascene conversion to positive action for women and insists that the party must push for 50% of new candidates to be women. The question now is, will the new efforts work? Will women - with or without distracting earrings - win a way through the selection process and will Blair finally recognise that it is not a vote-loser to develop policies appealing to women? The answer should emerge over the next six months, as selections take place before an expected 2001 election, and it may well be that, as last time, women's voices are heard. Nevertheless, it is still deeply depressing that the democratic case for reflecting women's concerns and aspirations is never enough for the strategists of Millbank until the rattle of the ballot boxes can be clearly heard.",

Although their families believe them to be safely looked after, elderly hospital patients and care home residents are said to be subject all too frequently to beatings, neglect and theft, according to a report by the charity Action on Elder Abuse. AEA, which based the study on calls to its helpline, is now calling on the government to set a five-year deadline for training all workers in elderly care in a recognised qualification and to foot the \u00a3500m bill. Ginny Jenkins, chief executive of AEA, said: \"It is shocking to find that a quarter of calls to our helpline are about mistreatment, exploitation and neglect in places where we expect that people will be professionally cared for.\" The study analysed more than 1,400 calls between 1997 and 1999. Most were about abuse in an elderly person's own home, but what the charity describes as a \"startling\" 25% alleged maltreatment in residential settings. As only 5% of elderly people live in residential or nursing homes, the findings suggest that the incidence of abuse may be six times as high in such homes as in the community at large. There may even be substantial under-reporting of abuse in residential settings - while elderly people may be more likely to complain about maltreatment by paid carers than about abuse by family members, it will often be more difficult to do so without private access to a telephone. Almost a third of helpline calls about hospitals and care homes concerned physical abuse and more than a quarter alleged neglect or \"psychological abuse\". Four in 10 of such calls complained about male nurses and care workers, despite the great majority of such staff being women. Almost a fifth of all calls to the helpline came from workers themselves, some of whom had seen abuse by colleagues and were seeking advice on how to blow the whistle.

It comes at a time when the vice-president had appeared to be seeing off the challenge of Bill Bradley, the only other candidate for the Democratic Party nomination to run for president.</p> <p>Rumours about the alleged drug use of the young George W Bush, who is fighting for the Republican nomination, subsided late last year after the withdrawal of a book that included discredited claims.</p> <p>Previously, Mr Gore had said his cannabis consumption was \"infrequent and rare\".

      "bodyText": "The drugs issue that seemed to have fizzled out of the US presidential campaign almost before it started returns today with claims in a new biography of Al Gore that the vice-president was an enthusiastic cannabis user in the 1970s. \"We'd get stoned and talk about what we would do if we were president,\" John Warnecke, an old friend of Mr Gore, is quoted as saying in Inventing Al Gore: A Biography. An extract from the book by Bill Turque, Newsweek's Washington correspondent, appears in this week's issue of the magazine. It comes at a time when the vice-president had appeared to be seeing off the challenge of Bill Bradley, the only other candidate for the Democratic Party nomination to run for president. Rumours about the alleged drug use of the young George W Bush, who is fighting for the Republican nomination, subsided late last year after the withdrawal of a book that included discredited claims. Previously, Mr Gore had said his cannabis consumption was \"infrequent and rare\". But Mr Turque's book also quotes another Gore friend, Andy Schlesinger - like Mr Warnecke and the vice-president, a former reporter on the Nashville Tennessean - as saying he smoked with him \"at least a dozen times\". This was in the months after Mr Gore returned from the Vietnam war in 1971. \"These were low times,\" says Mr Schelsinger, who remains a friend. \"Al was upset and disgusted by Vietnam and what it was doing to America.\" Mr Turque writes: \"Warnecke and two other friends from Gore's Nashville days say Gore was an enthusiastic recreational user, smoking sometimes as often as three or four times a week; after hours at Warnecke's house, on weekends at the Gore farm or canoeing on the Caney Fork River.\" Mr Warnecke, who had drink and drug problems that wrecked his first marriage, says Mr Gore tried in 1987, while running for vice-president, to stop his friend from revealing the cannabis use. In November 1987, after Mr Gore had gone public about infrequent use, Mr Warnecke received a call from a reporter on his former newspaper. But he did not follow his old friend's request, says the book. \"Instead he told what he now says was a more authentic-sounding lie that he'd seen Gore smoke only once. Gore considered even this sanitised version of the past a betrayal and the two have not spoken since 1987.\"",

Direct rule is due to be imposed by Friday if the IRA refuses to make a gesture on disarmament.</p> <p>Guests escaped injury when they were evacuated from the hotel 15 minutes before the explosion, after telephone warnings from the Continuity IRA. The kitchen and several cars were damaged in a fire caused by the explosion. It is believed that the bomb was driven into the hotel carpark in a limousine used for local weddings.</p> <p>Warnings of another bomb at the Manor House hotel, in Killydeas, outside Enniskillen, forced its evacuation but police reported no explosion.</p> <p>Tommy Mahon, the owner of the bombed hotel, said: \"There has been quite a bit of damage. The bottom gable wall is half blown away and the ceilings in the kitchen and toilets have all been brought down.\"</p> <p>Peter Mandelson, Northern Ireland secretary, said: \"The people of Ireland, north and south, rejected violence once and for all when they overwhelmingly supported the Good Friday agreement. This attack is not just wrong, it is against the democratically expressed wishes of the people. What can it possibly achieve?\"</p> <p>His remarks were echoed by Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister. He said: \"We hoped the days of having to condemn bombings in Northern Ireland were over. Unfortunately, it appears there are still those who refuse to acknowledge the will of the overwhelming majority of people on this island.\"</p> <p>The attack will have been designed by the dissident republicans to cause maximum disruption to the peace process at a delicate moment. Mr Mandelson will launch a last-ditch attempt this week to persuade the IRA to make a gesture on disarmament to prevent David Trimble from resigning as the province's first minister.</p> <p>If the IRA fails to act, Mr Mandelson will reimpose direct rule, a move that has been condemned by Sinn Fein, which claims that the demand for immediate disarmament falls outside the Good Friday agreement.</p> <p>The first signs that the bomb might have destabilised the peace process came last night when Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist party's security spokesman, said it highlighted the need for disarmament.</p> <p>\"We are vindicated, I believe, by this activity tonight in saying we cannot allow to remain in existence any paramilitary organisation - republican or loyalist - which has illegal guns or illegal explosives.\"</p> <p>However, ministers will have been encouraged when Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness condemned the bombing and called on the Continuity IRA to disband immediately.</p> <p>Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said: \"I unequivocally condemn this attack. The people involved are not acting in the interests of Irish republicanism, they are not representative of any real section of the Irish people and they should disband.\"</p> <p>The bombing came hours after Tony Blair issued an emotional appeal to republicans \"from the depth of my heart\" to make a gesture on disarmament to prevent the peace process slipping away. But the prime minister, who was speaking at the Labour party's local government conference in Blackpool, indicated that the IRA would not have to meet unionist demands for an actual start to decommission ing this week.

      "bodyText": "Dissident republicans last night exploded a bomb outside a hotel in a predominantly Protestant town, raising fears of a renewed terrorist campaign in the wake of the government's threat to reimpose direct rule over Northern Ireland. The RUC said there were no reports of any injuries when the bomb, planted by the Continuity IRA, exploded under an oil tank at the back of Mahon's hotel in Irvinestown, Co Fermanagh at 7.19pm. The bombing will add to the pressure on the government, which is facing its most difficult week in the peace process. Direct rule is due to be imposed by Friday if the IRA refuses to make a gesture on disarmament. Guests escaped injury when they were evacuated from the hotel 15 minutes before the explosion, after telephone warnings from the Continuity IRA. The kitchen and several cars were damaged in a fire caused by the explosion. It is believed that the bomb was driven into the hotel carpark in a limousine used for local weddings. Warnings of another bomb at the Manor House hotel, in Killydeas, outside Enniskillen, forced its evacuation but police reported no explosion. Tommy Mahon, the owner of the bombed hotel, said: \"There has been quite a bit of damage. The bottom gable wall is half blown away and the ceilings in the kitchen and toilets have all been brought down.\" Peter Mandelson, Northern Ireland secretary, said: \"The people of Ireland, north and south, rejected violence once and for all when they overwhelmingly supported the Good Friday agreement. This attack is not just wrong, it is against the democratically expressed wishes of the people. What can it possibly achieve?\" His remarks were echoed by Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister. He said: \"We hoped the days of having to condemn bombings in Northern Ireland were over. Unfortunately, it appears there are still those who refuse to acknowledge the will of the overwhelming majority of people on this island.\" The attack will have been designed by the dissident republicans to cause maximum disruption to the peace process at a delicate moment. Mr Mandelson will launch a last-ditch attempt this week to persuade the IRA to make a gesture on disarmament to prevent David Trimble from resigning as the province's first minister. If the IRA fails to act, Mr Mandelson will reimpose direct rule, a move that has been condemned by Sinn Fein, which claims that the demand for immediate disarmament falls outside the Good Friday agreement. The first signs that the bomb might have destabilised the peace process came last night when Ken Maginnis, the Ulster Unionist party's security spokesman, said it highlighted the need for disarmament. \"We are vindicated, I believe, by this activity tonight in saying we cannot allow to remain in existence any paramilitary organisation - republican or loyalist - which has illegal guns or illegal explosives.\" However, ministers will have been encouraged when Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness condemned the bombing and called on the Continuity IRA to disband immediately. Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, said: \"I unequivocally condemn this attack. The people involved are not acting in the interests of Irish republicanism, they are not representative of any real section of the Irish people and they should disband.\" The bombing came hours after Tony Blair issued an emotional appeal to republicans \"from the depth of my heart\" to make a gesture on disarmament to prevent the peace process slipping away. But the prime minister, who was speaking at the Labour party's local government conference in Blackpool, indicated that the IRA would not have to meet unionist demands for an actual start to decommission ing this week. Confirming that the government was looking for words rather than actions, Mr Blair said: \"I am not standing here as a British prime minister making demands. I am only saying that now is when we need to know whether [decommissioning] is going to happen or not.\" He made clear that he had taken stock of IRA unease over the disarmament issue when he said he was not asking the IRA to break its word or betray its republican beliefs. There was deep disquiet when Mr Mandelson accused the IRA last week of betraying everyone in Northern Ireland, including republicans, by its refusal to decommission. Mr Blair's speech is likely to please the Irish government, whose officials have been holding intensive talks with the republican leadership to persuade the IRA to make a gesture on disarmament. But the prime minister will have fuelled unionist suspicions that the government is preparing the ground for a move on disarmament that will fall well short of the demands of Mr Trimble for \"product\" - his description of a physical start to the process. Unionists fear the government will hold back from suspending the power-sharing executive if the IRA agrees to a disarmament timetable. Sinn Fein issued a fresh warning yesterday that the government was gravely mistaken if it believed the threat of direct rule would influence the decommissioning dispute. Mitchel McLaughlin, the party's chairman, said: \"The British government are making a very, very serious mistake under the blackmail of a threat to withdraw by the unionists.\" The last bombing to hit Ulster was the attack on Omagh by the Real IRA on August 15 1998 in which 29 people died and more than 350 were injured. Only yesterday the RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, said the IRA offered no threat at present but the two dissident groups, the Real and Continuity IRA, did.",

      "bodyText": "The search for a British scuba diver who went missing off the coast of Sydney, Australia, during a disastrous dive which left three others seriously ill was called off last night as storms hampered the rescue mission. Hopes of finding Nicky Sheen, 24, from London, alive were described as extremely slim after she failed to resurface when the 10-strong group she was with got in to trouble off Bondi Beach on Saturday. Police were yesterday investigating why the team was forced to race to the surface, apparently with little or no oxygen left. The ascent left one diver with the bends and two with breathing problems. Ms Sheen did not resurface. Police said: \"During the dive one of the men in the party suffered the symptoms of the bends and indicated he was in trouble. He was helped to the shore and airlifted to hospital. \"Two other divers came to the surface suffering from hyperventilation and were also transferred to hospital. In the light of evidence we have got at this stage, hope is extremely slim. There's not much chance of finding her alive.\"",

In a powerful display of his anger with the former defence minister Peter Kilfoyle, who has accused the government of abandoning its traditional heartlands, the prime minister said Labour was transforming the lives of the less well-off. Responding directly to Mr Kilfoyle's claim that Labour was concentrating too many resources on middle England in the south, Mr Blair told the party's local government conference: \"The whole country is our core constituency.\" Mr Blair's strong defence of his record in healing national divisions indicates that Mr Kilfoyle's attacks on the government, since resigning as a defence minister last week, have struck a nerve in Downing Street. Senior ministers are said to be growing alarmed at Labour's inability to inspire its core voters who have failed to turn out in a series of recent byelections, most notably in Ceredigion last week where the party trailed in fourth place. Mr Blair made clear his dismay at such indifference when he told his audience yesterday that he had introduced a series of flagship policies, from the national minimum wage to the new deal for the unemployed, that were transforming people's lives. Such achievements were not being helped by internal critics, who had accused the government of ignoring heartland supporters and favouring the south over the north. \"I reject the politics of division - those who want to see England fight Scotland, those who want to see north fight south,\" Mr Blair said. \"I say the politics of division have damaged the country for far too long and are not the answer to the problems our country faces.\" The prime minister, who is still haunted by the memories of Labour's disastrous divisions of the early 1980s, issued a blunt warning to the likes of Mr Kilfoyle and Ken Livingstone.

Not just for us to be in power but to make the changes really take root in our country.\" Downing Street will have been pleased when the conference cheered Mr Blair as he reminded them that he understood the concerns of core voters as a north-east MP. Departing from his text, the prime minister spoke of his despair when he felt \"utterly powerless\" to influence any government until New Labour's grand coalition embraced both north and south in 1997.

Days after announcing u-turns on the minimum wage and Bank of England independence, the new shadow chancellor refused to support Mr Hague's guarantee to cut taxes if the Conservative party wins the next election. His intervention, hours after Mr Hague reiterated his support for the Tory \"tax guarantee\", fuelled speculation that Mr Portillo is using his new high-profile post to undermine the Tory leader, who is still failing to make any impact in opinion polls. Mr Portillo's challenge came during an interview on The World this Weekend on Radio 4, when he was asked whether he supported Mr Hague's tax guarantee.

Labour has rounded on the Tory tax guarantee, saying it would inevitably lead to cuts in public services in the event of a recession. If the economy were to slow down, tax receipts would fall, forcing the Tories to cut public services to fulfil their pledge, Labour said. The differences between the two most senior figures in the Tory party were underlined when Mr Hague insisted that he stood by his tax guarantee. Speaking on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost a few hours before Mr Portillo, the Tory leader said that he could increase spending on health while cutting taxes. \"Can we [increase health spending] at the same time as the tax guarantee?\" he asked. \"Yes we can because the areas of government spending that need reducing are welfare and the spending on government itself.\" Mr Portillo made clear that he was determined to plough his own furrow when he barely referred to Mr Hague.

      "body": "<p><strong> Muscle</strong> (BBC 1) is shown at 10 o'clock on Saturday night, so, as boozers and bouncers thump each other, we can think \"Good thing we stayed in and watched telly.\" Not a thought that would normally occur to anyone on Saturday. </p> <p>Martyn, Ronnie, Mike and who the one who looks as if he wishes he were somewhere else, Chris, work for Security Leisure in Bristol. They back up bouncers. \"We\", as Mike puts it, \"are the elite. We are the answer to the problem.\" </p> <p>Martyn is a cockney and, therefore, does all the chat. He talks with ease and a characteristic emphasis on certain words as in \"I was amazed when I was arrested.\" Ronnie is a dark, gipsyish, leathery-looking bloke. It is hard to tell where the leather jacket ends and Ronnie begins. As he is still working on the precious gift of human speech, Martyn gives him a warm testimonial. \"He has a very, very strong sense of decency, although it doesn't always come across in his persona.\" </p> <p>Chris (\"I'm not a violent man and, I'll be open and honest with you, I've had psychological problems in coping with it.\") used to be a cop. Mike (\"If somebody crossed me I could probably be quite evil.\") will astound us all next week by becoming a born-again Christian. </p> <p>They spent the bulk of this first programme battering away at punch bags or, in Ronnie's case, having heavy weights dropped on his stomach (\"Go on! Go on! Ooargh!\") The intention, in Martyn's beguiling phrase, was to shine with confidence. </p> <p>Shining with confidence, they arrived at a Bristol pub where the bar staff had called for help. It seemed a normal, if noisy, night. A group of friends were celebrating. Martyn, as ever, was the spokesman. \"The management want you out, folks. Finish your drinks. You've gotta leave.\" </p> <p>It seemed to go from first to fourth gear in seconds. At first only Ronnie and a customer were shouting in each others furious faces, then the whole place started to heave like the sea. One man was starfished on the pavement. Then, said Martyn, \"It was like a cork out of a bottle. Everybody just burst on the pavement. That's just what I wanted.\" It was not what Chris, with his police experience, wanted. \"When it got on the street, I realised this was bad news. The last time I was in anything like that I was wearing a riot helmet, body armour and carrying a shield and baton.\" </p> <p>The lurid orange lights of a city at night bounced off the parked cars. There were no bottles or knives. This was a real, old-fashioned, arm-swinging, testosterone-fuelled, rough house. Everyone seemed to have found, as in a dance, an enemy to thump and a friend to try and hold him back. The approaching police siren sounded as sweet as a lullaby. </p> <p>The police would subpoena and study this footage. There would be five convictions for affray and a severe ear-chewing for Security Leisure for gravely mishandling the situation. </p> <p>It is vivid and valuable viewing. You wonder what, apart from a seductive producer, inclined Security Leisure to cooperate with a TV crew for a year. Except, as a thuggee once said just before they executed him, \"Is any man ashamed of his profession?\" </p> <p> <strong> The Mrs Bradley Mysteries</strong> (BBC 1) look very chic and picturesque and, with Diana Rigg in the lead, they have a head start there. They are based on Gladys Mitchell's detective stories and her Mrs Bradley looks nothing like that.

      "bodyText": "Muscle (BBC 1) is shown at 10 o'clock on Saturday night, so, as boozers and bouncers thump each other, we can think \"Good thing we stayed in and watched telly.\" Not a thought that would normally occur to anyone on Saturday. Martyn, Ronnie, Mike and who the one who looks as if he wishes he were somewhere else, Chris, work for Security Leisure in Bristol. They back up bouncers. \"We\", as Mike puts it, \"are the elite. We are the answer to the problem.\" Martyn is a cockney and, therefore, does all the chat. He talks with ease and a characteristic emphasis on certain words as in \"I was amazed when I was arrested.\" Ronnie is a dark, gipsyish, leathery-looking bloke. It is hard to tell where the leather jacket ends and Ronnie begins. As he is still working on the precious gift of human speech, Martyn gives him a warm testimonial. \"He has a very, very strong sense of decency, although it doesn't always come across in his persona.\" Chris (\"I'm not a violent man and, I'll be open and honest with you, I've had psychological problems in coping with it.\") used to be a cop. Mike (\"If somebody crossed me I could probably be quite evil.\") will astound us all next week by becoming a born-again Christian. They spent the bulk of this first programme battering away at punch bags or, in Ronnie's case, having heavy weights dropped on his stomach (\"Go on! Go on! Ooargh!\") The intention, in Martyn's beguiling phrase, was to shine with confidence. Shining with confidence, they arrived at a Bristol pub where the bar staff had called for help. It seemed a normal, if noisy, night. A group of friends were celebrating. Martyn, as ever, was the spokesman. \"The management want you out, folks. Finish your drinks. You've gotta leave.\" It seemed to go from first to fourth gear in seconds. At first only Ronnie and a customer were shouting in each others furious faces, then the whole place started to heave like the sea. One man was starfished on the pavement. Then, said Martyn, \"It was like a cork out of a bottle. Everybody just burst on the pavement. That's just what I wanted.\" It was not what Chris, with his police experience, wanted. \"When it got on the street, I realised this was bad news. The last time I was in anything like that I was wearing a riot helmet, body armour and carrying a shield and baton.\" The lurid orange lights of a city at night bounced off the parked cars. There were no bottles or knives. This was a real, old-fashioned, arm-swinging, testosterone-fuelled, rough house. Everyone seemed to have found, as in a dance, an enemy to thump and a friend to try and hold him back. The approaching police siren sounded as sweet as a lullaby. The police would subpoena and study this footage. There would be five convictions for affray and a severe ear-chewing for Security Leisure for gravely mishandling the situation. It is vivid and valuable viewing. You wonder what, apart from a seductive producer, inclined Security Leisure to cooperate with a TV crew for a year. Except, as a thuggee once said just before they executed him, \"Is any man ashamed of his profession?\" The Mrs Bradley Mysteries (BBC 1) look very chic and picturesque and, with Diana Rigg in the lead, they have a head start there. They are based on Gladys Mitchell's detective stories and her Mrs Bradley looks nothing like that. She is a psychiatrist and latter-day witch because Gladys Mitchell, who sounds more interesting than her books, had two unusual interests for a pre-war schoolmistress: Freud and black magic. Gladys Mitchell describes her as a black-eyed, beaky-mouthed, yellow-skinned, reptilian old lady. She is apt to cackle evilly. Don't tell me there are no saurian old crones with Equity cards perfectly capable of giving us this Mrs Bradley and glad of the money. Of course, it wouldn't sell so well in America. In one of her books, Agatha Christie, appearing undercover as a detective-story writer called Ariadne Oliver, is quite acid about dramatists who take popular detectives and change then out of all recognition, make them younger, smarter, sexier. In The Mrs Bradley Mysteries, George, the chauffeur, is now in love with her. The real Mrs Bradley would cackle evilly.",

The compact topography of England means that it is hard to achieve a genuine sense of isolation, despite the impressive efforts of Virgin Rail in giving travellers an American sense of time, distance and the inaccessibility of major cities. The Isle Of Wight setting of Reach For The Moon, however, does offer on almost Iowan feeling of removal from the centre of affairs. There is a finality when people \"leave the island\".

Paul's problem is that he should have travelled more before committing. </p> <p>Even so, the second problematic area of the series, besides the symbolism, also gives an unwanted sense of quarantine from the real world.

But can there be a viewer in Britain who would need a Predictor kit to tell them what the hidden object is? </p> <p>In newspapers, memoranda occasionally circulate warning writers against certain words and phrases which have appeared too often on the pages.

      "body": "<p><strong> Mandy Patinkin</strong> in Ragtime (Milos Forman, 1981) </p> <p><strong> Who?</strong> Chicago-born star of stage, records, screen and TV. Actor and singer Mandy (yes, we know it's a girl's name) has a great range - check out those high notes! - and appeared on stage in Evita and Sunday In The Park With George. He's also released a number of albums, including the winningly titled Dress Casual, and Mamaloshen, which was entirely comprised of Yiddish folk songs. On the big screen, his work ranges from Yentl to The Princess Bride, and his next screen role is alongside a load of muppets (literally) in The Adventures Of Elmo In Grouchland. Despite the length of his CV, however, he's probably still best known as the eternally cranky Doctor Jeffrey Geiger in Chicago Hope. </p> <p><strong> The role: </strong> Tateh, a Jewish immigrant in 1930s New York, who rises from struggling artist and cuckolded husband to movie svengali. </p> <p><strong> Best Line:</strong> Unquestionably his direction to starlet Evelyn Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern): \"Play it with your eyes, play it with your face, show it with your tongue.

      "bodyText": "Mandy Patinkin in Ragtime (Milos Forman, 1981) Who? Chicago-born star of stage, records, screen and TV. Actor and singer Mandy (yes, we know it's a girl's name) has a great range - check out those high notes! - and appeared on stage in Evita and Sunday In The Park With George. He's also released a number of albums, including the winningly titled Dress Casual, and Mamaloshen, which was entirely comprised of Yiddish folk songs. On the big screen, his work ranges from Yentl to The Princess Bride, and his next screen role is alongside a load of muppets (literally) in The Adventures Of Elmo In Grouchland. Despite the length of his CV, however, he's probably still best known as the eternally cranky Doctor Jeffrey Geiger in Chicago Hope. The role: Tateh, a Jewish immigrant in 1930s New York, who rises from struggling artist and cuckolded husband to movie svengali. Best Line: Unquestionably his direction to starlet Evelyn Nesbit (Elizabeth McGovern): \"Play it with your eyes, play it with your face, show it with your tongue. Forget about the belly or the pishy-pishy with the feet. Forget it.\" Cringe factor: Low. Only a remarkably bushy (and stuck-on looking) beard to worry about. Other wannabes: Jeff Daniels as a useless cop, and the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson as \"Gang Member Number 2\". Also not starring in: A 1978 episode of Taxi as \"New Father\", \"Pool Man\" in The Big Fix in the same year, and as \"First Commuter\" in Last Embrace in 1979.

Here sex and love were inexorably entwined, with the added worry that once she succumbed to \"a moment's pleasure\", God knows what would happen \"when the night meets the morning sun\".</p> <p>Doris Kenner-Jackson, known publicly by her maiden name of Doris Coley, who has died of cancer at the age of 58, was one of the quartet who enjoyed a run of million-sellers in America between 1959 and 1965, and transformed popular music. With Addie \"Micki\" Harris, Beverly Lee and Shirley Owens, she formed the group that became the Shirelles for a high school talent show in 1957. There, as the Poquelles, they sang I Met Him On A Sunday - the song that was to be their first single.</p> <p>Coley was born in the southern state of North Carolina but, like many black families, her parents moved north and she was brought up in Passaic, New Jersey. A classmate, Mary Jane Greenberg, told her music-business mother about the group's school appearance and Flo rence Greenberg became their manager, signing them to Scepter/Wand, her record label.</p> <p>With their name now changed again, from the Honeytones, the Shirelles first million-seller was a bal lad, Tonight's The Night, but it was swiftly followed by the groundbreaking Will You Love Me. The Shirelles became a major influence on the young white British music scene of the early 1960s, where any musician clued in to mod culture was looking towards soul and r&amp;b, and listening to a clutch of black female vocal groups: the Shirelles, Crystals, Chiffons and Marvelettes. Nowhere was this influence more noticeable than on the white female singers of the day, particularly Dusty Springfield, whose early records are homage to these groups.</p> <p>Coley, Harris, Lee and Owens were leading exponents of \"uptown r&amp;b\", so named because it came out of New York, rather than the southern states. In the 1950s, the city saw a blossoming of independent, black-run labels and black venues, like Harlem's Apollo and the Brooklyn Fox. New York also boasted the Brill Building music factory, where young white songwriting teams - including Burt Bacharach and Hal David, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, and Gerry Goffin and Carole King - put out thoughtful teenage love songs which were snapped up by the black groups.</p> <p>Goffin and King provided the Shirelles with Will You Love Me, though it was transformed by Luther Dixon's production, overlaying an r&amp;b rhythm section with lush mellow string arrangements behind the slightly nasal voices of the group.</p> <p>With Greenberg and Dixon, the Shirelles had three more million-sellers: Baby It's You, Everybody Loves A Lover and Dedicated To The One I Love. The last, originally written by Lowman Pauling for his group the Five Royales, featured Doris Coley on lead, and also gave the white Californian group, the Mamas and Papas, a hit in 1967.</p> <p>The Shirelles toured America and Europe through the 1960s, with Coley billed as Doris Kenner after her first marriage. But, by mid-decade - like many of the original girl groups - they had been superseded by the more sophisticated Motown female sound epitomised by the Supremes and Martha and the Vandellas. In 1968, Coley left the group to concentrate on her family - she had re-married and was now Doris Jackson - but she returned in 1975 when the Shirelles were playing the oldies circuit.</p> <p>\u0095 Doris Kenner-Jackson (nee Coley), singer, born August 2 1941; died February 5 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Girls weren't supposed to sleep with their boyfriends in the teenage world of the late 1950s, so the release of the Shirelles's Will You Love Me Tomorrow in 1959 provided a double frisson for the record-buying public: four young black female soul voices moulded with the universal appeal of narrative lyrics. Here sex and love were inexorably entwined, with the added worry that once she succumbed to \"a moment's pleasure\", God knows what would happen \"when the night meets the morning sun\". Doris Kenner-Jackson, known publicly by her maiden name of Doris Coley, who has died of cancer at the age of 58, was one of the quartet who enjoyed a run of million-sellers in America between 1959 and 1965, and transformed popular music. With Addie \"Micki\" Harris, Beverly Lee and Shirley Owens, she formed the group that became the Shirelles for a high school talent show in 1957. There, as the Poquelles, they sang I Met Him On A Sunday - the song that was to be their first single. Coley was born in the southern state of North Carolina but, like many black families, her parents moved north and she was brought up in Passaic, New Jersey. A classmate, Mary Jane Greenberg, told her music-business mother about the group's school appearance and Flo rence Greenberg became their manager, signing them to Scepter/Wand, her record label. With their name now changed again, from the Honeytones, the Shirelles first million-seller was a bal lad, Tonight's The Night, but it was swiftly followed by the groundbreaking Will You Love Me. The Shirelles became a major influence on the young white British music scene of the early 1960s, where any musician clued in to mod culture was looking towards soul and r&amp;b, and listening to a clutch of black female vocal groups: the Shirelles, Crystals, Chiffons and Marvelettes. Nowhere was this influence more noticeable than on the white female singers of the day, particularly Dusty Springfield, whose early records are homage to these groups. Coley, Harris, Lee and Owens were leading exponents of \"uptown r&amp;b\", so named because it came out of New York, rather than the southern states. In the 1950s, the city saw a blossoming of independent, black-run labels and black venues, like Harlem's Apollo and the Brooklyn Fox. New York also boasted the Brill Building music factory, where young white songwriting teams - including Burt Bacharach and Hal David, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, and Gerry Goffin and Carole King - put out thoughtful teenage love songs which were snapped up by the black groups. Goffin and King provided the Shirelles with Will You Love Me, though it was transformed by Luther Dixon's production, overlaying an r&amp;b rhythm section with lush mellow string arrangements behind the slightly nasal voices of the group. With Greenberg and Dixon, the Shirelles had three more million-sellers: Baby It's You, Everybody Loves A Lover and Dedicated To The One I Love. The last, originally written by Lowman Pauling for his group the Five Royales, featured Doris Coley on lead, and also gave the white Californian group, the Mamas and Papas, a hit in 1967. The Shirelles toured America and Europe through the 1960s, with Coley billed as Doris Kenner after her first marriage. But, by mid-decade - like many of the original girl groups - they had been superseded by the more sophisticated Motown female sound epitomised by the Supremes and Martha and the Vandellas. In 1968, Coley left the group to concentrate on her family - she had re-married and was now Doris Jackson - but she returned in 1975 when the Shirelles were playing the oldies circuit. \u0095 Doris Kenner-Jackson (nee Coley), singer, born August 2 1941; died February 5 2000",

In the US about 180,000 women are diagnosed as having breast or cervical cancer each year. \"At a time when we know more about cancer than ever,\" said Mr Clinton, \"we must not leave women to face cancer alone.\"",

In his most enthusiastic backing yet for the project, William Cohen, the US defence secretary, yesterday made it clear at an international security conference in Munich that Washington would go ahead despite existing technical problems and opposition from Russia, China, Canada and most of its European allies, France and Germany in particular. North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya \"want long-range missiles to coerce and threaten us - the North American and European parts of Nato,\" he told the conference, which also exposed growing tensions between the allies on EU plans for closer security and defence cooperation. \"We project that in the next five to 10 years these rogue countries will be able to hold all of Nato at risk with their missile forces,\" Mr Cohen said. Geoffrey Hoon, the British defence secretary said the US had yet to ask Britain to up date the early warning radar station at Fylingdales, in north Yorkshire, for the project. He described that as \"a complex issue\" which would be \"enormously expensive\" - the US is committed to spending more than $2bn on testing the system alone. However, Mr Hoon added: \"We accept some countries of the world would not necessarily be intimidated by Britain's [present] ability to react\" to rogue states. General Leonid Ivashov, of the Russian army's central headquarters, suggested at the conference that the US project \"looks more to me to be directed at China\". This is even though China has far fewer missiles than Russia which could break through the proposed US missile shield. Wang Guangya, China's deputy foreign minister, yesterday accused Washington of violating its \"international legal obligations\".

Yesterday's response encouraged those pressing for a permanent Sunday ban. \"A success!\" said Edo Ronchi, the environment minister, as he strolled with his infant son through Piazza Venezia, eerily bereft of honking and screeching. For Scottish rugby fans digesting their defeat to Italy, it was the weekend's second shock. A government honeypot of \u00a3300m encouraged regional capitals and dozens of smaller towns to sign up to the voluntary ban. It was proposed two decades ago but delayed by politicians fearful of provoking a car-addicted electorate. Italy has 32m vehicles for 57.5m people, one of the world's highest ratios. Smog-related illnesses, including asthma and bronchitis attacks, kill more than 15,000 Italians and cost 16m working days each year, the World Health Organisation says. During a trial day without cars last September eight cities recorded an average 35% drop in carbon monoxide levels. Exemptions were made for taxis and those serving a useful social function, such as doctors. Rome's ban lapsed at 6pm. On cue, hundreds of mopeds and cars emerged from sidestreets onto the avenues. Within 15 minutes it was business as usual.",

Police said that the death toll could rise as rescue workers sifted through the wreckage of the train, which investigators said derailed after it broke the speed limit on a restricted section of the line. The German government has announced an inquiry. Eighteen hours after the accident in the early hours of Sunday, a handful of the most-severely injured were still fighting for their lives, while a further 22 people who were believed to be on the train were missing. They were listed as 16 German, four US and two Dutch citizens. \"We cannot rule out further deaths,\" a police spokesman, Winrich Granitzka, said in Br\u00fchl, scene of the accident 10 miles south of Cologne. He said workers using cranes and other heavy-duty machinery would continue searching for bodies. Rail officials said the train, travelling from Amsterdam to Basle, Switzerland, with 300 passengers on board, was travelling at 75mph as it negotiated points intended to divert it past building work on the track just outside Br\u00fchl station. The speed limit for the diversion section was 25mph. The crash was the worst in Germany since the Eschede disaster of 1998, the country's biggest post-war rail tragedy in which 101 people were killed. The federal transport minister, Reinhard Klimmt, announced a \"thorough and all-encompassing inquiry into the causes of this tragic accident\". Five carriages and the locomotive left the track just outside the station and two carriages then plummeted down an embankment into the house, landing in its living-room and front garden. The elderly couple living in the house were unharmed. \"We hit something hard and then the whole carriage flipped over,\" said a British passenger. Rail officials said the train was not one of the high-speed inter-city express trains like the one in the Eschede crash, which smashed into a bridge after it developed a faulty wheel. Police were waiting to question the 28-year-old German driver of the train, who survived the accident but was suffering from shock. The accident will raise further questions about safety on the German railways, the image of which had been hit by the Eschede tragedy. Recordings taken by the train's \"black box\" showed the driver initially slowed in the run-up to the switch, but then accelerated to 75mph, the usual speed limit for the stretch without the diversion, officials said.

Stephen Czerkas, a dinosaur enthusiast who ran a small private museum, was wandering around a fossil fair when he heard that a Chinese dealer had something extraordinary.</p> <p>When the dealer unwrapped a foot-long slab of rock, Czerkas experienced a paleontological epiphany. Embedded in the stone were the fossilised bones of an extraordinary prehistoric animal, with the complex limbs of a prototype bird and the distinctive tail of an earth-bound dromaeosaur, edged with the shadow of what seemed to be feathers. It looked like a dinosaur that could fly.</p> <p>\"It was stunning,\" Czerkas recalls. \"I could see right away that it didn't belong on sale. It belonged in a museum.\"</p> <p>He hastily contacted a patron who put up the $80,000 the dealer was asking for, and took his prize home in a state of high excitement, convinced he had discovered evidence of a pivotal moment in evolution.</p> <p>That was last February. In the year since then, the dramatic rise and fall of Czerkas's new bird-dinosaur has been one of the strangest episodes in modern paleontology, and a scandal from which the science is still recovering.</p> <p>After months of scrutiny involving x-rays and scans, Czerkas's bird dinosaur was proclaimed a new species, Archaeoraptor liaoningensis , by none other than the prestigious National Geographic journal. The magazine heralded the find as a crucial \"missing link\", representing conclusive proof that birds were the last living descendants of the dinosaurs.</p> <p>But weeks later, archaeoraptor was unveiled as a hoax, wedged together with bits and pieces from at least two animals by canny Chinese farmers with a feel for what palaeontologists were looking for. It now appears to have been the dinosaur version of Piltdown Man, the notorious fossil hoax put together in Sussex in 1911 to provide the missing link between man and ape predicted by Charles Darwin.</p> <p>Archaeoraptor's moment of truth came in December when a Chinese researcher, Xu Xing, visited Liaoning and found evidence that the creature's tail had been stolen from a land-bound dinosaur called a dromaeosaur.</p> <p>National Geographic, having given archaeoraptor its name, was forced into a retraction, the most humiliating reversal anyone working on the journal can remember. To add salt to its wounds, the magazine was accused of handling a fossil which had been smuggled out of China.</p> <p>Liaoning is a paleontologists' gold mine - a great expanse of powdery white siltstone deposited at the bottom of a lake 130m years ago. It is so dense it has preserved not only the bones of dinosaurs that died there but also some of their soft tissues.</p> <p>In 1996, a Chinese team from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) came across a fossil of a foot-long dinosaur the size of a hawk which they named sinornithosaurus (Chinese bird dinosaur). It had a wishbone and the tail of a theropod. But what caught their attention was a fossilised aura of downy hairs around the bones. The following year, another bird dinosaur was discovered, beipiaosaurus, an ungainly seven-foot theropod covered in two-inch-long feathers.</p> <p>The Chinese discoveries were published in the scientific journal Nature and in National Geographic, revolutionising the perception of theropod dinosaurs. If Jurassic Park was remade now, National Geographic argued, even the T-rexes would have to have feathers.</p> <p>Until that point, the most widespread theory was that birds evolved separately from and parallel to dinosaurs, from a common reptilian ancestor that roamed the earth over 250m years ago. These were small lizard-like animals that climbed trees and evolved feathers specifically for flight. A contradictory theory had emerged, according to which birds were direct descendants of larger, upright dinosaurs such as the velociraptors in the Spielberg film, but the Chinese fossils were the first real challenge to the orthodox view.</p> <p>Furthermore, the Liaoning discoveries suggested that theropods had developed feathers for purposes like display or insulation, and only later did they become used for flight. Archaeoraptor seemed to be a telling milestone along that evolutionary journey. It actually had wings and big enough feathers to take off.</p> <p>Archaeoraptor's downfall has energised a dwindling group of scientists who have stood by the traditional theory, that birds were more closely related to ancient gliding reptiles like pterodactyls, or even crocodiles.</p> <p>They argue that the apparent \"feathers\" found on the Liaoning dinosaurs may be internal fibrous material, and they insist that the bone structure of the theropod claw is fundamentally different from a bird's wing.</p> <p>Storrs Olson, an ornithological expert at Washington's Smithsonian Institution, has led the charge against the archaeoraptor. \"National Geographic glorified this illicit specimen with their article,\" he thundered. \"I told them they should close the exhibition and conduct their own investigation. They just stonewalled.</p> <p>\"They ignored all the contrary evidence and gave in to a campaign of propaganda. It is completely bogus. There is no such thing as a feathered dinosaur. It's like saying Elvis Presley is on the dark side of the moon.\"</p> <p>Scientists on the other side of the debate insist that evidence for the bird-dinosaur link remains overwhelming, but concede that the archaeoraptor episode has been awkward. Henry Gee, a senior editor at Nature identified by Olson as the high priest of the bird-dinosaur \"propaganda campaign\", said: \"The outfall has been extremely unfortunate. Of course, Piltdown man rears its ugly head. And it provides ammunition to a small and very vocal group of people who who are now starting to talk about collusion and conspiracy.\"</p> <p>\"That is absurd,\" Gee added. \"But I do agree with Storson about one thing: that National Geographic has got itself badly burnt.\"</p> <p>How National Geographic got itself into this mess is something its own staff are still trying to untangle. It seems to have got itself caught in the crack between its dual roles as a scientific journal and a popular magazine.</p> <p>\"It's a big disappointment, which hasn't happened since I've been here,\" Christopher Sloan, the senior assistant editor who wrote the ill-fated article, admitted. \"We take a lot of pride in our work, and we go to great lengths to research every word and every picture.\"</p> <p>Sloan went to see Czerkas and his bird-dinosaur last May and was sufficiently impressed for National Geographic to fund a study - led by Czerkas - of the find. The original idea was to publish the results in tandem with an academic journal like Nature or its competitor, Science, so that National Geographic would have academic cover.</p> <p>A manuscript was sent to Henry Gee in London in September, but he was unimpressed. \"This one looked like a real rush job,\" he said. \"It seemed to be extremely amateurishly written. It didn't have any details of where it came from, or how old it was, which you would normally expect.\"</p> <p>\"Then something else occurred to me that was more disturbing. I thought it might have come out of China illegally, and the Chinese take a very dim view of that.\"</p> <p>Gee sent the manuscript back, arguing that even if Nature were to appraise the specimen, there was no way it could do so in the timeframe National Geographic was suggesting. Science also turned down the manuscript after a peer review.</p> <p>Meanwhile, rumours began to circulate that archaeoraptor was a fake. The tail was not joined to the rest of the body and the surrounding rock was cracked. Charlie Magovern, a fossil dealer and restorer, saw x-rays of archaeoraptor soon after it surfaced in Tucson and recalls: \"I had a bad feeling about it. A lot of Chinese fossils are composited [from more than one specimen]. It's common practice in Liaoning, and they've become real craftsmen at putting these things together.\"</p> <p>But the National Geographic study team, driven on by Czerkas's enthusiasm, were convinced. Xu Xing was sent out from Beijing by China's IVPP to see what was going on, but only arrived in time for National Geographic's triumphant press conference in October. By then, National Geographic had decided to go ahead with publication, even though the archaeoraptor had not been accepted by an academic journal. \"The train had left the station and it was moving faster and faster,\" Sloan said ruefully.</p> <p>The journal's editorial board grew concerned after Xu Xing, on returning to China, discovered that the tail had originally been found two yards from the body. \"But nothing else had been found on that layer. It was still the most plausible theory that this was one animal. We had a meeting at National Geographic and felt reasonably confortable that would be end of it,\" Sloan said.</p> <p>The fatal blow came on December 20, when an email from Xu Xing arrived. \"After observing a new feathered dromaeosaur specimen in a private collection and comparing it with archaeoraptor, we concluded that archaeoraptor is a composite,\" Xu wrote. \"Though I do not want to believe it, archaeoraptor appears to be composed of a dromaeosaur tail and a bird body.\"</p> <p>The journal quickly published a statement to say that it was reevaluating archaeoraptor, but the damage had been done. As Sloan puts it: \"Nine million kids already know about archaeoraptor.\"</p> <p>Back in Utah, Czerkas remains confident that he might still be vindicated by a scientific comparison between the archaeoraptor and Xu Xing's dinosaur. \"It's still possible that the tail is part of the archaeoraptor,\" he said. \"And even if it does turn out it is a composite, it puts feathers on the tail of a dromaeosaur, so it still confirms that dinosaurs and birds are very closely related.\"</p> <p>In an email from Beijing, however, Xu Xing said he was \"100 per cent sure\" that the tail belongs to a dinosaur, and not to Czerkas's bird, and complained that continued smuggling of Chinese fossils was wreaking irreparable damage on China's prehistoric legacy.</p> <p>But one year on, at this year's Gem and Mineral Show in Tucson, there are just as many Chinese dealers roaming the corridors of the Ramada Inn Hotel with Liaoning fossils as there were when Stephen Czerkas first encountered archaeoraptor.</p> <p>\"I just saw a small bird with teeth in its skull and a tail. This one definitely has a tail,\" Charlie Magovern said on his cellphone. \"I called to tell Chris Sloan about it, but he hasn't called back.\"</p>",

One of America's great strengths has been its willingness to open its frontiers to migrants and asylum seekers. According to Javier Ortega in the latest Economic Journal, immigration both reduces unemployment and increases wages. </p> <p>What happens, Mr Ortega says, is that when immigrants arrive, firms create new jobs because hiring a worker becomes cheaper. As a result natives obtain jobs more easily since more are available. At the same time they can obtain higher wages from firms since during wage negotiations the higher availability of jobs makes competition for workers that much tougher. Europe has a specific problem of a declining population of working age trying to finance a generous welfare system. It desperately needs the workers developing countries can provide. </p> <p>But immigration is only the most obvious example of the lowly status afforded to labour in the global economy, at least until recently. The Asian crisis, the tightening of labour markets in Anglo-Saxon countries - and, most important, what happened in Seattle - have all helped to change the debate. </p> <p>Mr Stiglitz, for example, says that workers' rights should be a central focus of a development institutions such as the World Bank. He argues that the traditional IMF-Washington approach to development has been through the improvement of resource allocation, privatisation, trade liberalisation and macro-economic policies designed to ensure stability. </p> <p>What should happen is that development should be seen as a way of transforming society, rather than asset portfolios. If, according to Mr Stiglitz, that is to happen, workers need to be at the heart of the development transformation and workers' organisations should be crucial in the process. Seeing labour as part of the solution rather than part of the problem requires a big change in thinking, but there are signs that just such a rethink is taking place. </p> <p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, reflecting the drift to the left, is revising its guidelines for multinationals, many of which are already showing a willingess to submit themselves to social audits. </p> <p>More farsighted corporations have already worked out that acting unethically can hit them where it hurts - at the bottom line. </p> <p>John Evans, head of the trade union advisory committee at the OECD, says that it is already a different world from that of the mid-1990s. Consumers are showing an increased willingness to boycott products from companies exploiting workforces or trashing the environment; trade unions are exploring ways of using their muscle on pension funds to ensure that funds accumulated by workers are invested in ethical funds. What unions would like more than anything else is a recognition that there should be a set of agreed global labour standards ultimately backed by threat of sanctions. </p> <p><strong> Arousing hostility</strong><br> </p> <p>The problem with this is that any mention of labour rights arouses the hostility of developing countries, who sense back door protectionism, an attempt to impose a world minimum wage that would erode the competitive advantage of developing nations. </p> <p>This threatens to become a sterlile debate but there are ways to make progress. Writing in American Prospect recently, the economist Dani Rodrik made two interesting points. The first is that trade is a means and not an end in itself, it is a way of achieving the things that make life worth living - freedom, stability, prosperity, eradication of poverty, a cleaner environment. </p> <p>Mr Rodrik's second point is that non-democratic countries cannot count on the same trade privileges as democratic ones. In the case of trade and labour standards, poor countries argue they cannot afford to have the same standards as in democratic countries, and that if they were forced to abide by the same conditions it would result in fewer jobs and greater poverty. This is undoubtedly true, and a country like India can rightly claim its labour standards and environmental regime reflect the wishes of the world's biggest democracy. </p> <p>But, says Mr Rodrik, non-democratic countries such as China \"do not pass the same prima facie test, and exports of non-democratic countries deserve greater international scrutiny, particularly when they entail costly dislocations in other countries\". </p> <p>This goes to the heart of the new trade agenda, which is as much to do with workers' rights and human rights as with schedules of preferences. Is it right that US textiles workers should lose their jobs because Bangladeshi workers can make shirts more cheaply? The answer is probably yes. Is it right the same workers should lose their jobs because of imports from countries where there are no unions and the trappings of a police state? The answer should be a resounding no. </p> <p><a href=\"\" \"larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">Larry.Elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Sources in Germany said the talks were understood to have been taking place for several days. Analysts believe Bertelsmann's stake in the five-year-old joint venture could be worth up to $7bn (\u00a34.4bn). </p> <p><strong> Vodafone AirTouch </strong> is close to following its historic merger with German group <strong> Mannesmann </strong> with a majority holding in <strong> Airtel </strong> of Spain - a vital piece in its pan-European jigsaw.

The revamp will pave the way for the partial flotation of its high-growth divisions. </p> <p>The <strong> Bank of England</strong> is set to increase base interest rates by a quarter point from 5.75% to 6% this week amid evidence that consumer demand and the housing market remain strong. </p> <p><strong> DaimlerChrysler</strong>'s courtship of <strong> Fiat </strong> could be interrupted by the arrival of a former suitor of the Italian industrial group. <strong> Ford</strong>, which held extensive talks with Fiat more than a decade ago, is believed to be tracking the progress of the Fiat-Daimler talks and could intervene to head off a deal. Italian experts believe Daimler is negotiating to take a majority stake in Fiat Auto, the group's car making arm. </p> <p> <strong> S</strong></p> <p><strong>elegraph </strong></p> <p><strong> British Energy</strong>, the nuclear electricity group, has approached <strong> United Utilities</strong> with a view to buying all or parts of the multi-utility group. United has become the focus of takeover speculation in recent months as the City anticipates the next round of industry rationalisation. United is capitalised at about \u00a33bn. </p> <p>The <strong> Bank of Scotland</strong> is to launch a mobile telephone banking service for its 3m customers with <strong> BT Cellnet</strong>, Britain's second largest mobile phone network operator. BoS is about to enter the final stages of its hostile bid for <strong> National Westminster Bank</strong>. </p> <p><strong> Bradford &amp; Bingley</strong>, the building society, is understood to be lining up a big acquisition in an attempt to head off a delay in its plans to float on the London stock exchange this autumn. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Business </strong></p> <p><strong> NTT DoCoMo</strong>, the Japanese telecommunications company is considering a $35bn (\u00a322bn) bid for <strong> Orange</strong>, the British-based mobile phone operator which is to be demerged from <strong> Mannesmann</strong> following the takeover of the German company by <strong> Vodafone AirTouch</strong> last week. Orange's chief executive Hans Snook said recently that the firm was \"looking forward\" to returning to the market as an independent company. </p> <p>Car company <strong> Ford </strong> is planning to sell new cars 5% cheaper than advertised prices over the internet across its entire model range in Britain in time for the <strong> British Motor Show</strong> in October. Britain is to be the first region of Europe to adopt the scheme which will enable consumers to make a typical saving of about \u00a31,000 from the list price of a Mondeo. </p> <p> <strong> Mail on Sunday</strong> </p> <p> The <strong> European Union</strong> has launched an investigation into the world's two most powerful art auction houses, <strong> Christie's</strong> and <strong> Sotheby's</strong> over alleged commission fixing. The companies are already under investigation by the US justice department.

      "bodyText": "Observer America Online, the American internet company, is negotiating to buy German media combine Bertelsmann 's 50% stake in AOL Europe, the internet service provider which has 2.8m customers in nine countries. Sources in Germany said the talks were understood to have been taking place for several days. Analysts believe Bertelsmann's stake in the five-year-old joint venture could be worth up to $7bn (\u00a34.4bn). Vodafone AirTouch is close to following its historic merger with German group Mannesmann with a majority holding in Airtel of Spain - a vital piece in its pan-European jigsaw. That would be another setback for British Telecommunications , which wants to increase its stake in Spain's second largest mobile phone operator. British Energy and Npower lead the \u00a3370m race to buy north western electricity supply business Norweb from United Utilities. Sunday Times British Telecommunications is planning the most radical restructuring since privatisation. The revamp will pave the way for the partial flotation of its high-growth divisions. The Bank of England is set to increase base interest rates by a quarter point from 5.75% to 6% this week amid evidence that consumer demand and the housing market remain strong. DaimlerChrysler's courtship of Fiat could be interrupted by the arrival of a former suitor of the Italian industrial group. Ford, which held extensive talks with Fiat more than a decade ago, is believed to be tracking the progress of the Fiat-Daimler talks and could intervene to head off a deal. Italian experts believe Daimler is negotiating to take a majority stake in Fiat Auto, the group's car making arm. S elegraph British Energy, the nuclear electricity group, has approached United Utilities with a view to buying all or parts of the multi-utility group. United has become the focus of takeover speculation in recent months as the City anticipates the next round of industry rationalisation. United is capitalised at about \u00a33bn. The Bank of Scotland is to launch a mobile telephone banking service for its 3m customers with BT Cellnet, Britain's second largest mobile phone network operator. BoS is about to enter the final stages of its hostile bid for National Westminster Bank. Bradford &amp; Bingley, the building society, is understood to be lining up a big acquisition in an attempt to head off a delay in its plans to float on the London stock exchange this autumn. Business NTT DoCoMo, the Japanese telecommunications company is considering a $35bn (\u00a322bn) bid for Orange, the British-based mobile phone operator which is to be demerged from Mannesmann following the takeover of the German company by Vodafone AirTouch last week. Orange's chief executive Hans Snook said recently that the firm was \"looking forward\" to returning to the market as an independent company. Car company Ford is planning to sell new cars 5% cheaper than advertised prices over the internet across its entire model range in Britain in time for the British Motor Show in October. Britain is to be the first region of Europe to adopt the scheme which will enable consumers to make a typical saving of about \u00a31,000 from the list price of a Mondeo. Mail on Sunday The European Union has launched an investigation into the world's two most powerful art auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's over alleged commission fixing. The companies are already under investigation by the US justice department. And in London the office of fair trading has also begun a preliminary inquiry. The City's last independently quoted merchant bank, Close Brothers, may spin off its share and government bond wholesaler, Winterflood Securitiesfor u 163;1bn. IoS Warburg Dillon Read has been ditched by several German corporate clients because of the key role it played in Vodafone's acquisition of Mannesmann. The paper reported that a well placed source had said a number of large German companies had told the investment bank they would not be doing business with it \"in the foreseeable future\".

It was a controversial affair that confounded expectations and changed for ever the life of Dmitri Hvorostovsky, a 26-year-old baritone from Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, whose sexy voice, flawless technique and subtlety took everyone by surprise.</p> <p> Many assumed the prize would go to Bryn Terfel. In the BBC commentary box, an element of chaos broke out: Hvorostovsky looks as good as he sounds, and the announcers were soon engaged in an uncommon display of ecstatic bawdry. \"He's a nice package,\" said one. \"Oh, definitely,\" sighed another. The \"nice package\" subsequently became one of the world's finest and most popular singers. </p> <p>Fame came as a shock. He visited London after his victory, and recalls how \"people kept coming up to me in the street\". His voice is still tremulous with amazement more than 10 years after the event. \"Everyone knew who I was. Suddenly I had a fan club. They used to send me presents, food and clothing, thinking I was poor, which wasn't far from the truth.\" </p> <p> A media frenzy greeted him on his return to the Soviet Union. \"They took the title of the competition literally. I was billed as The Greatest Singer in the World. They gave me an enormous apartment in Moscow. I could do anything - sing anything I wanted, anywhere. </p> <p>\"Two weeks ago,\" he continues, suddenly changing tack, \"I went back to Siberia to see my mother and father and my grandma. I go back whenever I have a gap in my schedule - I need to from time to time. Over there, they still play the Cardiff tape. When I see it, I no longer recognise myself.\" </p> <p>A certain ambivalence characterises Hvorostovsky's attitude to both his stardom and his glamour. We meet at the Savoy, where he makes one of his head-turning entrances, looking impeccably Byronic with his famous silver hair flowing over the collar of his black leather jacket, conscious of the scrutiny that his appearance inevitably causes. In the quiet of the reading room, however, he perceptibly relaxes, flings himself onto a sofa with an air of laddish raffishness, took a packet of Marlboro Lights from his pocket and lights up. I express astonishment that he smokes. \"Many singers do,\" he remarks, shrugging his shoulders. \"Most hide it. I don't bother.\" </p> <p>Restlessly itinerant (\"I've been everywhere except Africa\"), Hvorostovsky is back in the UK for a concert at the Barbican. He's a tremendous recitalist, larger than life, sometimes overpowering, yet with an uncanny ability to communicate the shocking emotional intimacy of music to each listener individually. His performances inspire the curious sensation that the audience has been blotted out and you're alone with this hunk who's pouring out his private thoughts. His London audience could be in for a roller-coaster ride, for his programme - \"a killer\" he calls it - includes Mahler's harrowing Kindertotenlieder and Shostakovich's Suite on Verses of Michelangelo. The latter, incredibly taxing, are new to his repertoire. He shakes his head when I ask him whether he thinks that the songs constituted a covert protest on Shostakovich's part against the Soviet regime. \"I don't see that,\" he says. \"Shostakovich was a pure musician, a pure genius. The songs are about Italy, about the world of Michelangelo and Dante. They're very lyrical, restrained, very ascetic\". </p> <p>\"Ascetic\" is not a word one would expect from a man who has a reputation as a sex symbol, and who, shortly after his Cardiff triumph, caused an almighty controversy by releasing an erotic video to a track from his album of Russian songs. Squeezed into skin-tight leather pants, he soulfully intoned Tchaikovsky while camisole-clad Lolitas struck suggestive poses and couples twined in soft focus around him. \"It was very sensual,\" he says. At the time, he also had a reputation for stand-offishness; now 37, he admits he has changed. \"I was young and stupid,\" he says, \"very stubborn. I'd always been assured I was the best, but when I listened to other singers I began to doubt myself. As I get older, I doubt myself more and more, but it's doubt that makes you change, makes you strive, makes you do things differently.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Hvorostovsky's career is that it nearly didn't happen at all. As a child, he had everything. His parents, of whom he speaks with tremendous affection, were anxiously supportive. The Soviet system fostered his talent (he began his musical training as a pianist). Yet there was one problem. \"I was painfully shy,\" he admits, \"then I had a breakdown.\" His choice of word is a tad unfortunate: what actually happened was that Hvorostovsky, in a moment of flaming teenage rebellion, junked classical music for rock. </p> <p>\"My father was horrified,\" he says. \"I did keyboard and vocals in a band. It was hard rock, very Deep Purple. I liked Queen too: I used to do Freddie Mercury numbers.\" He and a friend started work on a rock opera based on Poe's Ligeia, a tale about a supernatural sexual being. \"We never finished it,\" he says, \"but we used to do numbers from it in discos.\" </p> <p>After two years he'd had enough of headbanging, but he was stronger for the experience: his shyness was replaced by self-assurance; and he knew that he had a glorious voice. I ask him if he's ever contemplated \"crossover\". \"I've been asked to,\" he says, \"but what really interests me is film. Perhaps that's one way forward.\" </p> <p>He's just finished his first movie, Leporello, directed by Barbara Willis Sweete. It's a take on Mozart's Don Giovanni: Leporello - who always envies the Don's philandering - is reincarnated as a Hollywood producer, and casts himself as his master in his own movie of Giovanni's life. Hvorostovsky, tellingly perhaps, plays both roles - the sexual icon and the man who creates and recreates him. \"I haven't seen the finished film,\" he says, \"but the rushes look good. I don't know what people will make of it, but Mozart's unique. He's like Shakespeare. Each era has to recast him in its own image.\" </p> <p>Later, I realise I haven't asked what drew him to Ligeia. I read the story again and wallow in the atmosphere of decadence and transgression that could open vistas of new experience to a teenager. Yet what is also striking is Poe's vision of his central character as a free spirit who communicates \"the eager vehemence of a desire for life\" in \"the thrilling and enthralling eloquence\" of music rather than speech. Whether those words marked Hvorostovsky all those years ago in Siberia is something we shall never know - yet they remain an apt summary of this remarkable man and his achievement. </p> <p> Dmitri Hvorostovsky's recital is at the Barbican, London EC2 (0171-638 8891), on Thursday.</p>",

Electricity consumers who have the choice must start comparing the risks of all technologies, one with another. Politicians should initiate debate, assist poorer countries whose reactors are unsafe and ensure a level playing field in the energy market. But the nuclear industry has to become responsible for itself, more transparent, independent - and able to show through its long-term calculations of economic and safety performance that it can survive in the marketplace.</p> <p>\u0095 Gerald Doucet is secretary general of the World Energy Council</p>",

It has the long-term potential to compete as a cost effective energy source. If the burden of high initial investment can be reduced, its advantageous lower running costs would show through - as they have done lately in the US, even against natural gas. There is a lot to be done in developing reactors and fuel cycles but production costs of 2.5 to 3 cents per kilowatt hour, including all storage and future building costs, are reachable. By cutting building times to four years and increasing output, new reactors can become competitive in the new, liberalised energy market. Existing reactors have been overwhelmingly accepted by the populations around them. That is not enough. Public assent depends on progress, on how waste is to be stored, even when from a technical point of view there are no pressing problems. The industry needs patiently and persistently to show its safety, reliability and credibility. Here government can play an active role, enlightening society about nuclear waste but also about fossil waste, CO2 and other emissions. Electricity consumers who have the choice must start comparing the risks of all technologies, one with another. Politicians should initiate debate, assist poorer countries whose reactors are unsafe and ensure a level playing field in the energy market. But the nuclear industry has to become responsible for itself, more transparent, independent - and able to show through its long-term calculations of economic and safety performance that it can survive in the marketplace. \u0095 Gerald Doucet is secretary general of the World Energy Council",

      "body": "<p>Britain is swarming with City wannabes. The work-hard play-hard lifestyle, the unrivalled bonuses and the mammoth levels of responsibility and pressure are perceived by a certain type of character as, quite simply, the perfect package. Chances are you know one or two of them. </p> <p>Suppose for a moment, then, that one of these characters tells you he or she has decided to apply for a secretarial post as a way in. The suggestion that one might progress from taking memos to trading in securities might have met with sniggers a couple of years ago. But a fast increasing number of graduates - even those with degrees in non-financial subjects - are aiming to do just that. What's more, they're succeeding. </p> <p>\"A few years ago, a City secretary remained a City secretary,\" says Susan McFarlane, marketing executive at financial recruitment consultants Crone Corkill. \"But today, many are able to use their positions as the first rung in the ladder towards becoming a broker or alternatively towards getting a high-flying City role in marketing, accounting or human resources.\" Given that many of these positions have traditionally been filled by headhunting, argues McFarlane, we are witnessing a radical change. </p> <p>The past few years have seen a marked trend towards graduates taking up secretarial roles in a wide variety of sectors. They meet that final essay deadline and are about to switch off their South Park screen- savers when they suddenly realise an immediate job is required if they are ever to pay off their monumental student debts. It occurs to them that they've built up a pretty good typing speed, not to mention a sound knowledge of the latest computer software.

      "bodyText": "Britain is swarming with City wannabes. The work-hard play-hard lifestyle, the unrivalled bonuses and the mammoth levels of responsibility and pressure are perceived by a certain type of character as, quite simply, the perfect package. Chances are you know one or two of them. Suppose for a moment, then, that one of these characters tells you he or she has decided to apply for a secretarial post as a way in. The suggestion that one might progress from taking memos to trading in securities might have met with sniggers a couple of years ago. But a fast increasing number of graduates - even those with degrees in non-financial subjects - are aiming to do just that. What's more, they're succeeding. \"A few years ago, a City secretary remained a City secretary,\" says Susan McFarlane, marketing executive at financial recruitment consultants Crone Corkill. \"But today, many are able to use their positions as the first rung in the ladder towards becoming a broker or alternatively towards getting a high-flying City role in marketing, accounting or human resources.\" Given that many of these positions have traditionally been filled by headhunting, argues McFarlane, we are witnessing a radical change. The past few years have seen a marked trend towards graduates taking up secretarial roles in a wide variety of sectors. They meet that final essay deadline and are about to switch off their South Park screen- savers when they suddenly realise an immediate job is required if they are ever to pay off their monumental student debts. It occurs to them that they've built up a pretty good typing speed, not to mention a sound knowledge of the latest computer software. They're not bad at presentation and organisational skills and they can demonstrate that they are blessed with the odd brain cell or two. They might even have picked up a language en route. In addition, secretarial qualifications and traditional secretarial skills such as shorthand - which new graduates aren't usually blessed with - are no longer a prerequisite for many administrative and support roles.

The main benefit will be the speed with which you learn to do previously laborious tasks.\" </p> <p>Once you've identified the skills you want to acquire, think about what your company's requirements are likely to be in the future. If you want to tailor your training to meet those requirements that's fine but, according to trainer Judi James, it's important to put your own needs first. \"The changing nature of business means setting personal as well as corporate goals, but people need to realise they have to think of themselves as individuals as well as team players. It's OK to be selfish and put your training needs first, but you may be surprised how guilty you feel about doing this.\" </p> <p>When you've decided what training you need, set goals. Decide what you want or need to learn, how it can be achieved and how long it will take. Break this information down into learning goals and objectives. For example, you may decide you want to obtain a management qualification. Your first goal will be to do some research. Your objectives could include discussing the situation with your boss, looking at what is available in-house and sending for distance-learning brochures. </p> <p>Try to think beyond acquiring more secretarial skills. \"It's vital for people to create their own roles in the company,\" says James. \"You may need to say: 'I'm a secretary, but I'd also like to be responsible for x, y, z, otherwise I may get left behind.' If you think you've reached the glass ceiling, create a job for yourself that goes beyond your job description - such as mentor or trainer.\" Before you rush to book a place on an in-house training course, consider which training methods might best suit you. \"Don't be too inflexible,\" advises James. \"Many larger companies are now boosting their internal training by using consultants to come in and train the whole team, while some also have computerised training where you can log on to your PC and access a training programme without having to go through your line manager or HR department. </p> <p>\"If your boss is reluctant to allow you to pursue training, you need to be a salesperson,\" says James. \"Put together a strong proposal as to why it's important, and if you get no joy, go to the next in line.

If it's the culture of the job that is anti-training, get out of the job. If you've had no training, it looks very bad when you apply for jobs with other companies.\" Right on course \u0095 When talking to your boss, don't be negative about the skills you lack. Accentuate the positive aspects of new skills that can be learned quickly. \u0095 Look for courses that offer satisfaction guarantees and free refresher courses, especially if your company is reluctant to fund your training. \u0095 Don't worry about work mounting up while you're away from the office. You'll make up the time by working more effectively on your return. \u0095 Remember to arrange a debriefing session with your boss after every piece of training, so he or she knows what you have achieved and what extra responsibilities you can take on.",
