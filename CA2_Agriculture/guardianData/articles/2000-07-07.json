      "body": "<p>A full-scale home loans price war is set to break out after banking giant HSBC upstaged new-fangled rivals by slashing its standard variable mortgage rate by almost one percentage point - a move that will cut monthly bills for thousands of borrowers by an average of \u00a3600 a year. </p> <p>HSBC (formerly known as Midland) this week cut its mortgage rate from 7.74% to 6.75%, and has introduced a guarantee that, from now on, its rate will never be more than one percentage point higher than the Bank of England base rate. </p> <p>Its decision is likely to put pressure on other lenders to reduce their mortgage rates too, and shows just how rattled the banking old guard are in the face of ever-increasing competition from new entrants. </p> <p>It came on the same day as the Halifax's new internet and telephone bank Intelligent Finance turned up the heat even further by announcing highly competitive rates on mortgages and savings. It also coincided with the latest Moneyfacts survey of the mortgage interest charged by the UK's 35 largest lenders which - surprise, surprise - showed that building societies and the new entrants beat the high street banking giants hands down when it comes to lower home loan rates. </p> <p>HSBC's announcement means its standard mortgage rate is now way below the UK's 10 largest lenders, which charge between 7.29% and 7.75%. In fact, only a small handful of lenders can boast lower standard rates. They include Egg (6.69%) and Hinckley &amp; Rugby building society's telephone banking arm (6.64%). </p> <p>The move is particularly good news for HSBC's 300,000 existing borrowers because they will automatically be transferred to the new lower rate. The 100,000 or so borrowers on the standard variable rate will be switched over on September 24, while the others, who are predominantly on fixed and discounted rate deals, will go on to the new rate when their current fixed/discounted period comes to an end. HSBC says the average standard variable rate borrower with a \u00a370,000 loan will save about \u00a350 a month - \u00a3600 a year - at current rates. </p> <p>The move is also designed to help HSBC attract new mortgage customers. By guaranteeing you will never pay more than 1% above the bank base rate, it has effectively created a tracker mortgage which is one of only a few to meet the government's CAT standards on charges, access and terms. There are no lock-in early redemption penalties, you're not required to buy their insurance, early repayments can be made at any time, and interest is calculated on a daily basis. </p> <p>So what are the downsides? There are some. Those borrowing more than 90% of the property's value have to fork out an extra 0.15% over the standard rate for the first three years, which lifts what they pay to 6.9%. Another is that the deal technically isn't a fully-fledged CAT mortgage yet because it won't be available to existing customers until September. </p> <p>Also, while it's a very good low standard rate, there are no special discounts on offer to tempt people to take it out - if you're looking for a good upfront deal you could do a lot better, says Phillip Cartwright at brokers London &amp; Country Mortgages. </p> <p>For example, Britannia building society is offering a 2.1% discount off its base rate for two years, giving a current payment rate of 5.54%. When the two years are up you go on to the society's standard rate - currently 7.64% - but as there are no redemption penalties at any time, there is nothing to stop you from walking away. </p> <p>However, HSBC says that what it is offering is \"a long-term highly competitive rate to give people the security of knowing they are not going to have to chase rates forever and a day\". In other words, if you're the sort of person who cannot be bothered to keep changing your mortgage every couple of years to take advantage of the very best rates, it is well worth a look. </p> <p>This week's survey from financial data specialists Moneyfacts shows the total interest paid on a \u00a350,000 standard variable rate mortgage between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2000, and also shows how much someone has coughed up over the past three years. </p> <p>It reveals that the difference between the cheapest and the most expensive lender over 12 months is a whopping \u00a3691. Standard Life Bank comes out cheapest, with a total interest bill over 12 months of \u00a33,225. Two societies, the Cheshire and the Coventry, came second and third with \u00a33,276 and \u00a33,319 respectively, though these figures are based on borrowers who have been members for at least five years and therefore qualify for a lower rate. </p> <p>The table provided further proof that mutual organisations tend to offer consistently lower mortgage rates - of the top 10 lenders, all but one is a building society or owned by a mutual. Again, the big high street banks and converted building societies have performed dismally. </p> <p>Halifax, Abbey National, Barclays, NatWest, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Woolwich are all near the bottom of the table, with total annual interest repayments of between \u00a33,647 and \u00a33,652.

Forget old-fashioned door-to-door collections and jumble sales; charities have stepped up into far more sophisticated operations, with targeted advertising, mailshots and corporate sponsors.</p> <p> An increasingly popular way for charities to raise funds is to have their own credit cards, with a donation being made for every transaction. These have a definite feel-good appeal, letting us believe we're giving to a good cause even when we're being utterly self-indulgent. We might be treating ourselves but we're also doing something for charity.</p> <p> It might be convenient and the only way that we'd ever have time to give anything, but is it a good deal and an efficient way of donating? At the risk of sounding uncharitable about charities, the honest answer is: not really.</p> <p> Interest rates charged by charity credit cards are generally higher than for conventional cards. If you have an Amnesty International card there is an 19.8APR, while Oxfam and the NSPCC have cards charging 19.9APR, 9% above the best rates available.</p> <p> Now this won't matter if you pay off your credit card bills within the interest-free period, but most of us end up carrying forward a balance (the average credit card balance is \u00a3675), which means paying extra interest charges. This wouldn't matter so much if the extra interest went to the good cause, but it goes to the credit card company. The donation to the charity is a percentage of how much money you spend on the card, typically 0.25%.</p> <p> It has to be said that this isn't hugely generous - \u00a31 for every \u00a3400 spent. The calculation you need to make is whether the donation is larger than the amount you're paying extra in interest because if it isn't, you'd be better off getting a cheaper credit card and setting up a standing order for the charity. Otherwise, your main donation will be to the credit card company.</p> <p> If you use a Help the Aged card, there is a donation of 0.25% of purchases and an interest rate of 19.8APR. This means that if you had a balance of \u00a31,000, the monthly interest charge would be \u00a315.20, while the donation to charity would be \u00a34.</p> <p> But if you had an Egg credit card, currently charging 10.9APR, there would be a monthly interest charge of \u00a38.69 - more than \u00a36 cheaper than the charity card. And if you don't pay off the balance, you could be paying the \u00a36 extra every month, while the \u00a34 donation will only be paid once.</p> <p> Another form of donation is a flat payment for each transaction. The National Trust's card offers 5p per purchase, which would mean you'd need to make 200 purchases before the Trust received \u00a310.</p> <p> The majority of cards also make an initial payment to the charity when you sign up for a card. These range from \u00a32.50 for the British Dental Health Foundation up to \u00a310 for the Cancer Research Campaign (which also has the best interest rate for a donation card of 16.7APR).</p> <p> There's no doubt that the expansion in the charity card market reflects its success in fundraising. For the recipients it's a regular and uncomplicated income and for the donors it's a hassle-free way of supporting a cause.</p> <p> And if we follow the example of the United States, where the affinity card concept has already reached much further, we can expect almost every organisation, cause and profession to have its own credit card.</p> <p> But we should also expect the rates on offer to improve, because wanting to be generous shouldn't be interpreted as wanting to pay over the odds.</p> <p> Although at present, it's interesting to note that among the most expensive cards available are those supporting the Battersea Dogs Home, Elvisly Yours and Mensa.

The donation to the charity is a percentage of how much money you spend on the card, typically 0.25%. It has to be said that this isn't hugely generous - \u00a31 for every \u00a3400 spent. The calculation you need to make is whether the donation is larger than the amount you're paying extra in interest because if it isn't, you'd be better off getting a cheaper credit card and setting up a standing order for the charity. Otherwise, your main donation will be to the credit card company. If you use a Help the Aged card, there is a donation of 0.25% of purchases and an interest rate of 19.8APR. This means that if you had a balance of \u00a31,000, the monthly interest charge would be \u00a315.20, while the donation to charity would be \u00a34. But if you had an Egg credit card, currently charging 10.9APR, there would be a monthly interest charge of \u00a38.69 - more than \u00a36 cheaper than the charity card. And if you don't pay off the balance, you could be paying the \u00a36 extra every month, while the \u00a34 donation will only be paid once. Another form of donation is a flat payment for each transaction. The National Trust's card offers 5p per purchase, which would mean you'd need to make 200 purchases before the Trust received \u00a310. The majority of cards also make an initial payment to the charity when you sign up for a card. These range from \u00a32.50 for the British Dental Health Foundation up to \u00a310 for the Cancer Research Campaign (which also has the best interest rate for a donation card of 16.7APR). There's no doubt that the expansion in the charity card market reflects its success in fundraising. For the recipients it's a regular and uncomplicated income and for the donors it's a hassle-free way of supporting a cause. And if we follow the example of the United States, where the affinity card concept has already reached much further, we can expect almost every organisation, cause and profession to have its own credit card. But we should also expect the rates on offer to improve, because wanting to be generous shouldn't be interpreted as wanting to pay over the odds. Although at present, it's interesting to note that among the most expensive cards available are those supporting the Battersea Dogs Home, Elvisly Yours and Mensa. No comment.

In Devizes, Wiltshire, a three-bed semi that would have sold for \u00a390,000 a year ago is now likely to sell for around \u00a3110,000. Other figures: Dunfermline now, \u00a365,000; 12 months ago, \u00a360,000. Harrow, north-west London now, \u00a3200,000; 12 months ago, \u00a3145,000. Huddersfield now, \u00a358,000; 12 months ago, \u00a355,000. Southport, Lancashire, now, \u00a375,000; 12 months ago, \u00a368,000. Wolverhampton now, \u00a372,000; 12 months ago, \u00a365,000.",

      "byline": "David Hopps  in Bristol",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>More than 20 years after Kerry Packer's rebel TV circuit became the pioneering force behind floodlit cricket, the first one-day international under lights in England was belatedly staged last night when Zimbabwe and West Indies launched a ground-breaking NatWest triangular series.</p> <p>There was even a note-worthy outcome. Zimbabwe's six-wicket victory, fashioned with five overs to spare by Neil Johnson's skilfully paced unbeaten 95, was their first against West Indies at international level after eight limited-overs and two Test defeats stretching back to 1983.</p> <p>There are sound reasons to suggest that England's little bit of floodlit history came many years too late, at the wrong time of year, between the wrong teams, and on the wrong ground, but after so many years of vacillation all that really mattered was that it had happened at all. English cricket will one day become grateful for that.</p> <p>Floodlit one-day cricket is now so firmly established worldwide that to talk of innovation would be parochial. The first snatch of music to blare out during a floodlit game in England might well have been Abracadabra, by the Steve Miller Band, but nobody could claim that it had happened as if by magic.</p> <p>Had the England and Wales Cricket Board been invited to resuscitate the ailing motor industry, it would have agonised so long about modern trends that the Morris Minor would be scheduled to roll off the production line in about 2020.</p> <p>The courageous way to introduce the floodlit game to England would have been to pit England against West Indies at the Oval in mid-August (forget all this exaggerated talk of dew-affected pitches), when the nights would be darker and the atmosphere more boisterous.</p> <p>To begin yesterday at Nevil Road, before a neighbourly gathering of 7,000, was an exercise in gradualism, as if it was politic to make history without too many people noticing. England's entrance is delayed until this weekend, with back-to-back matches in London against Zimbabwe and a chastened West Indies side.</p> <p>Adrian Griffith, the West Indian opener and the first batsman dismissed, departed to the strains of Blinded By The Light, which encouraged two thoughts: first, how on earth could Manfred Mann appear in something that is designed to be vaguely contemporary? Second, the most blinding light was the sun as the weather showed a nice line in English irony by delivering one of the clearest days of the summer. Until the clouds thickened up around seven o'clock the lights were on only for show.</p> <p>It all went agreeably.

      "bodyText": "More than 20 years after Kerry Packer's rebel TV circuit became the pioneering force behind floodlit cricket, the first one-day international under lights in England was belatedly staged last night when Zimbabwe and West Indies launched a ground-breaking NatWest triangular series. There was even a note-worthy outcome. Zimbabwe's six-wicket victory, fashioned with five overs to spare by Neil Johnson's skilfully paced unbeaten 95, was their first against West Indies at international level after eight limited-overs and two Test defeats stretching back to 1983. There are sound reasons to suggest that England's little bit of floodlit history came many years too late, at the wrong time of year, between the wrong teams, and on the wrong ground, but after so many years of vacillation all that really mattered was that it had happened at all. English cricket will one day become grateful for that. Floodlit one-day cricket is now so firmly established worldwide that to talk of innovation would be parochial. The first snatch of music to blare out during a floodlit game in England might well have been Abracadabra, by the Steve Miller Band, but nobody could claim that it had happened as if by magic. Had the England and Wales Cricket Board been invited to resuscitate the ailing motor industry, it would have agonised so long about modern trends that the Morris Minor would be scheduled to roll off the production line in about 2020. The courageous way to introduce the floodlit game to England would have been to pit England against West Indies at the Oval in mid-August (forget all this exaggerated talk of dew-affected pitches), when the nights would be darker and the atmosphere more boisterous. To begin yesterday at Nevil Road, before a neighbourly gathering of 7,000, was an exercise in gradualism, as if it was politic to make history without too many people noticing. England's entrance is delayed until this weekend, with back-to-back matches in London against Zimbabwe and a chastened West Indies side. Adrian Griffith, the West Indian opener and the first batsman dismissed, departed to the strains of Blinded By The Light, which encouraged two thoughts: first, how on earth could Manfred Mann appear in something that is designed to be vaguely contemporary? Second, the most blinding light was the sun as the weather showed a nice line in English irony by delivering one of the clearest days of the summer. Until the clouds thickened up around seven o'clock the lights were on only for show. It all went agreeably. The crowd were treated to some uplifting strokeplay, especially in the later stages of West Indies' 232 for seven. Wavell Hinds struck a robust half-century, Ricardo Powell biffed 36 from 21 balls when acceleration was urgently required, and Brian Lara, with 60 from 63 balls, exhibited a freedom that England will fear might persist when the Test series resumes next month. Grant Flower, with wickets, catches and run-outs, was involved in just about everything. Lara's 14 off one over from Gary Brent was climaxed by a six towards the Grace Rooms. What would WG have thought of it all? He would probably have quite liked all the flamboyance and the fuss, especially if he could have had a share of the profits and fiddled the television replays in his favour. Floodlit cricket has also been introduced piecemeal into the county game, but with no compulsion for the fearful. Sussex are the only county to have installed permanent floodlights, although Warwickshire will follow if they quash protests from the sort of people who buy houses next to sports grounds and then complain about the noise.",

He had been criticised by Silvio Berlusconi, the Milan owner and leader of the opposition in the Italian parliament, who described Italy's 2-1 defeat by France as \"dishonourable\". Trapattoni, at 61 three years Zoff's senior, was most recently in charge of Fiorentina but resigned in May after a disappointing season. With Juventus he also won two European Cups, including the 1985 meeting with Liverpool at Heysel stadium, and four years later he landed an unprecedented seventh scudetto with Internazionale. In 1997 he won the German title as Bayern Munich coach. As a defender with Milan Trapattoni won two European Cup winners' medals and scored once in 17 internationals. He has signed a two-year contract to take him up to the next World Cup. The 28-year-old striker Hakan Sukur completed his move from Galatasaray to Internazionale yesterday. The \"Bull of the Bosphorus\", who has scored 28 goals in 55 games for Turkey, had a brief and unhappy spell with Torino in 1995. He is believed to have cost about \u00a32m. The Barcelona captain Luis Figo, under contract until 2003, may make a remarkable move to Real Madrid. Florentino Perez, a candidate for the Real presidency, is reportedly ready to meet the \u00a336m buy-out clause in Figo's contract and has an agreement with the Portuguese player, but the deal would depend on Perez defeating Lorenzo Sanz in the election on Sunday week. According to reports in Yugoslavia Dragan Stojkovic will replace Vujadin Boskov as national team manager.",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Peter Bradshaw:</strong> A pretty good ride, but so flashy, so empty, so utterly devoid of real risk, real sweat or real danger that in the end it's just Mission: Improbable or Mission: Untenable</p>",
      "byline": "Peter Bradshaw",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The sequel to Mission: Impossible has streamlined itself into a nifty little techno-key abbreviation: M:i-2, a cool metallic contraction that enacts this picture's elision and omission of all ordinary human motivation, characterisation and, indeed, the banal requirements of physics and gravity. </p> <p>Once again, Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, the impossibly daring agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or, ahem, IMF - to whom we must go cap-in-hand if we want them to save the world. We see him first on holiday - holiday! - doing some ridiculously dangerous free climbing on the edge of a gigantic rock face. Which would be breathtaking were it not for the fact you suspect Tom is actually dangling off the edge of his sofa somewhere and his pert form has been cut and pasted into the relevant locale. The producers insist that this is the real thing, albeit with a concealed safety harness. I can only say that the production's insurance brokers must have been very understanding. </p> <p>At once it is clear that director John Woo is making very different demands on his leading man than Stanley Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. This is pure action, action quite devoid of the conventional solvents of thought or conversation, and mostly devised on the computer keyboard. </p> <p>Like the first Mission, the traditional opening is used, one of the very few things from Bruce Geller's original show still in the film. (But one of the disappointments, incidentally, is how little M:i-2 uses Lalo Schifrin's fantastic theme tune.) A 'copter shows up with the details of Ethan's mission and various audio-visual features microchipped into a cute little Ray-Ban-style gizmo.</p> <p>The mission proposal, or should that be mission statement, bears the familiar rider \"If you decide to accept it\" - as baffling now as when Peter Graves's Jim Phelps heard it in the mid-60s. (What's the form if the answer is no? Does he throw the now smouldering buff envelope with the spool of tape and the eight-by-six photos in a bucket of water and just wait for something more congenial? Is he on a retainer?) </p> <p>Ethan has to combat the global villainy of a desperate man with access to a devastating biological weapon. He is played by Dougray Scott; he is a cool dry Scot, and his name is Sean, and short of actually giving him the surname \"Connery\" it could not be clearer whose dark, brooding machismo John Woo wishes to clone into the movie's bad-guy role. Sean is the ex-lover of Miss Nyah Hall, played by the heart-stoppingly beautiful Thandie Newton, who is, of all the wonderfully old-fashioned things, a jewel thief.</p> <p>Part of Ethan's job is to get Nyah to insinuate herself back into Sean's affections and infiltrate his dastardly set-up. It hardly needs to be said that Tom himself has formed a tendresse for Nyah and so has no relish for this. But as the controller (Anthony Hopkins) drily informs him, in one of the few droll moments in Robert Towne's screenplay: \"It's not Mission: Difficult, is it?\" And so another hi-tech, plotless romp kicks off, so stroboscopically flashy it could trigger epilepsy. </p> <p>Some of the locations are in Spain, but most of the filming was done in Australia, a continent chosen by co-producer Cruise perhaps because of low production costs, perhaps in a uxorious and gallant tribute to the motherland of Nicole Kidman. Either way, it allows Sydney to play host to the glitzy urban sequences - the invasion of hi-tech skyscrapers and the like - while the scrubby bush serves for the big set-piece, a motorbike chase sequence followed by a full-on martial arts punch-up with Tom getting a cut to those exquisite chops, the thin red line of blood presumably intended to give him an edge of Bruce Lee madness. </p> <p>A device incessantly used in the film is the business of wearing a latex mask of someone else's face. People are always peeling off these things, a supply of which Cruise and his enemy presumably keep stuffed in their knapsacks. It is a very eccentric \"disguise\" convention, coming straight from the original TV show. In its old-fashioned reliance on impersonation, it could almost be a stage comedy from another century altogether, were it not for the fact that it does not serve to advance or complicate the plot in any normal sense - merely enforce little stand-alone moments of astonishment. </p> <p>There aren't many actual gadgets here, and even the lap-top computer, a staple of the first film and of techno thrillers throughout the 90s, isn't flashed about that much.

      "bodyText": "The sequel to Mission: Impossible has streamlined itself into a nifty little techno-key abbreviation: M:i-2, a cool metallic contraction that enacts this picture's elision and omission of all ordinary human motivation, characterisation and, indeed, the banal requirements of physics and gravity. Once again, Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, the impossibly daring agent of the Impossible Missions Force, or, ahem, IMF - to whom we must go cap-in-hand if we want them to save the world. We see him first on holiday - holiday! - doing some ridiculously dangerous free climbing on the edge of a gigantic rock face. Which would be breathtaking were it not for the fact you suspect Tom is actually dangling off the edge of his sofa somewhere and his pert form has been cut and pasted into the relevant locale. The producers insist that this is the real thing, albeit with a concealed safety harness. I can only say that the production's insurance brokers must have been very understanding. At once it is clear that director John Woo is making very different demands on his leading man than Stanley Kubrick or Paul Thomas Anderson. This is pure action, action quite devoid of the conventional solvents of thought or conversation, and mostly devised on the computer keyboard. Like the first Mission, the traditional opening is used, one of the very few things from Bruce Geller's original show still in the film. (But one of the disappointments, incidentally, is how little M:i-2 uses Lalo Schifrin's fantastic theme tune.) A 'copter shows up with the details of Ethan's mission and various audio-visual features microchipped into a cute little Ray-Ban-style gizmo. The mission proposal, or should that be mission statement, bears the familiar rider \"If you decide to accept it\" - as baffling now as when Peter Graves's Jim Phelps heard it in the mid-60s. (What's the form if the answer is no? Does he throw the now smouldering buff envelope with the spool of tape and the eight-by-six photos in a bucket of water and just wait for something more congenial? Is he on a retainer?) Ethan has to combat the global villainy of a desperate man with access to a devastating biological weapon. He is played by Dougray Scott; he is a cool dry Scot, and his name is Sean, and short of actually giving him the surname \"Connery\" it could not be clearer whose dark, brooding machismo John Woo wishes to clone into the movie's bad-guy role. Sean is the ex-lover of Miss Nyah Hall, played by the heart-stoppingly beautiful Thandie Newton, who is, of all the wonderfully old-fashioned things, a jewel thief. Part of Ethan's job is to get Nyah to insinuate herself back into Sean's affections and infiltrate his dastardly set-up. It hardly needs to be said that Tom himself has formed a tendresse for Nyah and so has no relish for this. But as the controller (Anthony Hopkins) drily informs him, in one of the few droll moments in Robert Towne's screenplay: \"It's not Mission: Difficult, is it?\" And so another hi-tech, plotless romp kicks off, so stroboscopically flashy it could trigger epilepsy. Some of the locations are in Spain, but most of the filming was done in Australia, a continent chosen by co-producer Cruise perhaps because of low production costs, perhaps in a uxorious and gallant tribute to the motherland of Nicole Kidman. Either way, it allows Sydney to play host to the glitzy urban sequences - the invasion of hi-tech skyscrapers and the like - while the scrubby bush serves for the big set-piece, a motorbike chase sequence followed by a full-on martial arts punch-up with Tom getting a cut to those exquisite chops, the thin red line of blood presumably intended to give him an edge of Bruce Lee madness. A device incessantly used in the film is the business of wearing a latex mask of someone else's face. People are always peeling off these things, a supply of which Cruise and his enemy presumably keep stuffed in their knapsacks. It is a very eccentric \"disguise\" convention, coming straight from the original TV show. In its old-fashioned reliance on impersonation, it could almost be a stage comedy from another century altogether, were it not for the fact that it does not serve to advance or complicate the plot in any normal sense - merely enforce little stand-alone moments of astonishment. There aren't many actual gadgets here, and even the lap-top computer, a staple of the first film and of techno thrillers throughout the 90s, isn't flashed about that much. It is as if Cruise is conceding that there isn't anywhere obvious for hi-tech innovation to go now, unless the top of Tom's Rolex is to flip up and he is to tap something out on a qwertyuiop keyboard the size of a matchbox. The main gadget is Tom Cruise himself: swervy, bendy, agile - his longish hair sometimes prettily disarrayed. Throughout it all, Tom maintains his taut, genial self-possession. At one stage, Sean tells him: \"That's the hardest part of playing you - grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes!\" A perfectly fair assessment of Tom Cruise's performance, and that grin becomes more disconcerting once you see that his upper row of teeth is not quite square on his face, and the gap between his two front teeth clearly to the right of his nose. Is it some sort of genetic thing? M:i-2 is a pretty good ride, but so flashy, so empty, so utterly devoid of real risk, real sweat or real danger that in the end it's just Mission: Improbable or Mission: Untenable.",

      "bodyText": "Allowing universities to charge different rates for degree courses amid a huge expansion of scholarships and loans would solve the long-term problems in higher education brought out by the Laura Spence affair, says a long-awaited report out today. The report, commissioned by the Russell Group of 18 elite universities, says differential fees for institutions and courses would provide the injection of money needed to solve the funding crisis in British universities, which it says the public will not allow to be paid for by tax increases. The report has already received a cool welcome from ministers and a mixture of cageyness and criticism from vice-chancellors. The Spence case, where a Tyneside sixth former was denied a place at Oxford and took up a place at Harvard, illustrates the \"stark contrast\" between the US and UK systems.

Even modest differential fees \"have the capacity to make a real difference\" - up to \u00a31.02bn for universities a year even if fees were capped at \u00a34,000. Baroness Blackstone, the higher education minister, last night reiterated the government's opposition to top-up fees, and government sources ruled out Labour including any top-up fees plan in its manifesto. Number 10's education adviser, Andrew Adonis, has told vice-chancellors the government would only countenance extra fees if they could show they were improving intakes of students from poor backgrounds. Colin Lucas, the vice-chancellor of Oxford, joined with other university heads in welcoming the report as a contribution to the debate, but like most refused to commit him self to its findings. \"We believe that the only acceptable system would guarantee access to higher education for all students who could benefit from the opportunity.\" Cambridge said it would not lobby for the recommendations. Ivor Crewe, vice-chancellor of the University of Essex and convenor of the 1994 group representing 16 small research-intensive universities, adopted a wait-and-see policy. Geoffrey Copeland, vice-chancellor of the University of Westminster, said the proposals \"would probably lead to a higher education system inaccessible and at the very least daunting for the students from the lower socio-economic groups which the government is so keen to attract\". Owain James, president of the National Union of Students, said: \"The hypocrisy of the Russell report is incredible, the vice-chancellors behind this report have used the case of an individual student to dress up differential fees as a solution to elitism.\"",

      "body": "<p>Why should those who do not benefit from higher education pay for the degrees of those who do? This argument is at the heart of the much anticipated Greenaway-Haynes report on the future funding of universities. The current funding arrangements in the UK, according to Professor David Blanchflower, a British economist now based at Dartmouth College in the US who advised on the report, are \"outrageous\" - equivalent to a state subsidy paid for by the general taxpayer and allocated to the middle classes. The views of the principal authors of the report, Professor David Greenaway and Michelle Haynes from Nottingham University, may not be as forthright, but their proposals are nothing short of radical. </p> <p>Commissioned by the 19 Russell group elite research universities, the report presents compelling evidence of the current problems facing UK universities. Average spending per student in the UK was 60% of the average for OECD countries in 1995, and below the average for countries in the EU. Just to bring spending on academic staff back up to the OECD average would require an extra \u00a3900m a year. And to return to the student funding levels in the UK a decade ago an extra \u00a35.9bn in annual grants is needed - roughly an extra 3p in the pound in income tax for all taxpayers.</p> <p>The academic record on social inclusion is more depressing. Despite a massive expansion in student numbers over the last 15 years, universities remain an enclave for the middle and upper classes. Four out of five 18 year olds from senior managerial and professional backgrounds go to university; barely one in ten make it from unskilled and partly unskilled backgrounds. This, argues the report, must be seen as a major failing of the UK university system. It is also means that \u00a33bn of government funds each year is redistributed from low income taxpayers to high income taxpayers \"an outcome difficult to justify in terms of social justice\".</p> <p>What is needed then is more money and greater access. The economists consider four possible solutions: more government grants, a graduate tax, student vouchers, and differential fees. The first of these they conclude is unrealistic; the second too long winded; the third ineffective. </p> <p>They opt instead for the free market solution to a social problem: allowing universities to break away from current state controls and set their own fees, and expanding the scholarships and loans available to students.</p> <p>But here the details become vague. Will fees be \u00a350,000, \u00a340,000 or \u00a320,000 for a degree? In the free market world no one knows what the forces of supply and demand will conjure up. Some of the economists argue that the elite UK universities will eventually charge the rates seen in the US - often \u00a317,000 a year. Others say that fees could follow the levels already set for overseas students, varying from to \u00a35,000 a year to \u00a320,000 a year. Others claim that fees would remain much smaller in most cases, perhaps \u00a32,000 a year. </p> <p>The problem with this though is that Greenaway and Haynes can give no detailed figures on what money would be made available under such a system for scholarships and loans. How would we ensure that more not less students from poorer backgrounds were not alienated from higher education? By its own criteria the report fails to convince. </p> <p>This is not to say that radical solutions are not required. The report is spot on with its diagnosis. The middle classes continue to dominate the student populations of the elite universities. Head of the Sutton Trust, Peter Lampl, calls it a scandal. But it is also a scandal that it has taken a private charity and an ill-founded remark by the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, to raise the access issue higher up the universities' agenda. </p> <p>Still the majority of Oxbridge educated vice-chancellors chose to remain tight-lipped over their real views concerning fees. Access is still seen as a threat to standards, rather than an opportunity to tap into currently wasted talent. It is also treated as someone else's problem - schools, or society at large. Much of the problem is cultural. And to change such attitudes, initiatives should have been in place 20 years ago - before Laura Spence was even born. </p> <p><strong>The Greenaway-Haynes report is available for download in pdf format from the <a href=\"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/economics/funding/\">School of Economics at the University of Nottingham</a>. </strong></p>",

The views of the principal authors of the report, Professor David Greenaway and Michelle Haynes from Nottingham University, may not be as forthright, but their proposals are nothing short of radical. Commissioned by the 19 Russell group elite research universities, the report presents compelling evidence of the current problems facing UK universities. Average spending per student in the UK was 60% of the average for OECD countries in 1995, and below the average for countries in the EU. Just to bring spending on academic staff back up to the OECD average would require an extra \u00a3900m a year. And to return to the student funding levels in the UK a decade ago an extra \u00a35.9bn in annual grants is needed - roughly an extra 3p in the pound in income tax for all taxpayers. The academic record on social inclusion is more depressing. Despite a massive expansion in student numbers over the last 15 years, universities remain an enclave for the middle and upper classes. Four out of five 18 year olds from senior managerial and professional backgrounds go to university; barely one in ten make it from unskilled and partly unskilled backgrounds. This, argues the report, must be seen as a major failing of the UK university system. It is also means that \u00a33bn of government funds each year is redistributed from low income taxpayers to high income taxpayers \"an outcome difficult to justify in terms of social justice\". What is needed then is more money and greater access. The economists consider four possible solutions: more government grants, a graduate tax, student vouchers, and differential fees. The first of these they conclude is unrealistic; the second too long winded; the third ineffective. They opt instead for the free market solution to a social problem: allowing universities to break away from current state controls and set their own fees, and expanding the scholarships and loans available to students. But here the details become vague. Will fees be \u00a350,000, \u00a340,000 or \u00a320,000 for a degree? In the free market world no one knows what the forces of supply and demand will conjure up. Some of the economists argue that the elite UK universities will eventually charge the rates seen in the US - often \u00a317,000 a year. Others say that fees could follow the levels already set for overseas students, varying from to \u00a35,000 a year to \u00a320,000 a year. Others claim that fees would remain much smaller in most cases, perhaps \u00a32,000 a year. The problem with this though is that Greenaway and Haynes can give no detailed figures on what money would be made available under such a system for scholarships and loans. How would we ensure that more not less students from poorer backgrounds were not alienated from higher education? By its own criteria the report fails to convince. This is not to say that radical solutions are not required. The report is spot on with its diagnosis. The middle classes continue to dominate the student populations of the elite universities. Head of the Sutton Trust, Peter Lampl, calls it a scandal. But it is also a scandal that it has taken a private charity and an ill-founded remark by the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, to raise the access issue higher up the universities' agenda. Still the majority of Oxbridge educated vice-chancellors chose to remain tight-lipped over their real views concerning fees. Access is still seen as a threat to standards, rather than an opportunity to tap into currently wasted talent. It is also treated as someone else's problem - schools, or society at large. Much of the problem is cultural. And to change such attitudes, initiatives should have been in place 20 years ago - before Laura Spence was even born. The Greenaway-Haynes report is available for download in pdf format from the School of Economics at the University of Nottingham.",

After a year of hype and a glitzy opening ceremony, the gloss was soon tarnished by its disappointing content, poor visitor figures and disastrous financial performance. Now, it seems, a white knight has been found.</p> <p>The BBC and the Tussaud's Group, both among the most successful and imaginative organisers of visitor attractions, have teamed up with an offer that, if the government has the guts to take it seriously, could turn the Dome from an electoral liability into a vote winner. Under the Tussaud's Group's proposals, 70% of the Dome would be taken up by BBC@Dome - showing life-size exhibits from popular BBC productions such as EastEnders and Walking With Dinosaurs. The rest of the site would be turned into an urban entertainment centre called DomeTown Greenwich, featuring bars, restaurants and shops. The corporation would not put any money into the Dome, but it would be offered a share in the profits in return for lending its programme ideas.</p> <p>Cheekily, the consortium has asked the government to hand over the Dome (cost: \u00a3758m) for nothing, in return for up to \u00a350m of the profits and a promise that \u00a3150m would be invested in the site.</p> <p>The problem is that the formal bidding process is almost complete, with two plans on the final shortlist. Dome Europe, backed by the Japanese finance group Nomura, says it will to invest more than \u00a3100m in the site, developing the present attractions and installing new ones. It believes it can attract 15m visitors over four years. The second group, Legacy, wants to transform the Dome into a community of new businesses. It plans to invest \u00a3150m converting the Dome into a new living and working place. The Dome would become a \"24-hour city\" with shops, cafeterias, restaurants and bars.</p> <p>But if either plan fails, there would be nothing to stop the site's new owner from bulldozing the Dome and turning the land into a giant office park. The challenge for the government is to hand the site to the project with the most chance of success.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, has the power to reject the current two bidders and bring the BBC/Tussaud's plan into play. Tussaud's - which runs Madame Tussaud's and Alton Towers among other attractions - has a good track record, and the BBC Experience in London is one of Britain's fastest-growing visitor attractions. However, the word this afternoon from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport is that the project has little chance of being accepted. So the question has to be asked: why did the BBC leave it so late?</p>",

The BBC and the Tussaud's Group, both among the most successful and imaginative organisers of visitor attractions, have teamed up with an offer that, if the government has the guts to take it seriously, could turn the Dome from an electoral liability into a vote winner. Under the Tussaud's Group's proposals, 70% of the Dome would be taken up by BBC@Dome - showing life-size exhibits from popular BBC productions such as EastEnders and Walking With Dinosaurs. The rest of the site would be turned into an urban entertainment centre called DomeTown Greenwich, featuring bars, restaurants and shops. The corporation would not put any money into the Dome, but it would be offered a share in the profits in return for lending its programme ideas. Cheekily, the consortium has asked the government to hand over the Dome (cost: \u00a3758m) for nothing, in return for up to \u00a350m of the profits and a promise that \u00a3150m would be invested in the site. The problem is that the formal bidding process is almost complete, with two plans on the final shortlist. Dome Europe, backed by the Japanese finance group Nomura, says it will to invest more than \u00a3100m in the site, developing the present attractions and installing new ones. It believes it can attract 15m visitors over four years. The second group, Legacy, wants to transform the Dome into a community of new businesses. It plans to invest \u00a3150m converting the Dome into a new living and working place. The Dome would become a \"24-hour city\" with shops, cafeterias, restaurants and bars. But if either plan fails, there would be nothing to stop the site's new owner from bulldozing the Dome and turning the land into a giant office park. The challenge for the government is to hand the site to the project with the most chance of success. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, has the power to reject the current two bidders and bring the BBC/Tussaud's plan into play. Tussaud's - which runs Madame Tussaud's and Alton Towers among other attractions - has a good track record, and the BBC Experience in London is one of Britain's fastest-growing visitor attractions. However, the word this afternoon from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport is that the project has little chance of being accepted. So the question has to be asked: why did the BBC leave it so late?",

      "body": "<p>Why is it that, with the best intentions in the world, taxi drivers, while trying to show a welcoming interest, always manage to wind you up? \"I've never understood why people would want to pay so much money for clothes with a designer label. Let's face it, you're only paying for the name, aren't you? Although that Hugo Boss does know how to make a decent suit.\" If I had a penny for every time I have kept the meter ticking over while arguing the toss on that one, during two weeks of continental city-hopping for the menswear catwalk collections in Milan and Paris, I would be a wealthy man by now. Twenty minutes into my ride home yesterday morning and we are on to the same old chestnut. The only difference being, this time I didn't have the enthusiasm, or the armoury, to disagree with my driver's questioning - in fact, I think he has a point. </p> <p>Two years ago, I would have argued fervently that it isn't just the name you are paying for - it is the extension of a creative personality. In the same way you would eat at your favourite restaurant because you liked that particular chef's cooking, you would buy a designer label because you sympathise with that particular designer's aesthetic. Sadly, however, times are changing. As fashion empires grow stronger, snapping up less affluent designers in the way you and I might buy a round of drinks, the personality behind those designer names is being drained away. </p> <p>Ironically (considering this is the one label every taxi driver thinks is worthy) and to illustrate my point, Hugo Boss isn't a he. Hugo Boss, the man, doesn't exist, nor has he ever. Instead Hugo Boss is a faceless fashion empire without a single front man, designed by a studio of anonymous designers who all have an input. The outcome is compromise, not conviction, and sadly this situation is becoming the norm. </p> <p>Jil Sander, which has always been considered at the edge of forward-thinking fashion, is now without Jil Sander. The first collection to be shown without the label's founder at the helm, following a creative disagreement with the Prada group which purchased the company last year, had all the edge of a blunt razor. The subtle detailing that set the label apart from the competition had gone and in its place, a palatable but nondescript collection of tailoring and Ivy League basics was presented as the way forward. Patrizio Bertelli, who heads up the Prada group, commented after the show that he was not actively looking for a strong personality to guide the label into the future; instead, he thinks it can run smoothly without a \"name\" heading it up. </p> <p>How wrong can you be. The spring 2001 collection looked as if it had been put together following a blueprint laid down by its founder. Byblos, which over the previous four seasons improved greatly under the guidance of American designer John Bartlett, presented its first collection without Bartlett as creative director, following what has been described as an \"acrimonious split\". The collection lacked any foresight: surely a road to nowhere. </p> <p>In contrast, those labels that did cut the mustard all have a strong personality or personalities leading the way. Dolce &amp; Gabbana, in both their mainline show and with their diffusion line D&amp;G, gave their all, presenting sharp and sophisticated tailoring mixed with Mexican- inspired embroidery and beading, patchworked leather and suede for the more expensive line and a beer blast of Balearic-inspired customised jeans and sportswear for the funkier D&amp;G label. </p> <p>Gianni Versace (soon to be renamed simply Versace) was the best collection of the season. Big hair, Portofino dressing, Wall Street-inspired angular pinstripe tailoring and pool party knitted trunks were worn with Medusa medallions, instant tan, mirrored aviator shades and white loafers. This was a vintage collection which will inspire and radically shape things to come: it's all about metallic leather catsuits unzipped to below the navel and Florida Keys pastel baroque prints, and nobody does it better than Donatella. </p> <p> Luxury goods house Fendi followed suit. Wide lapelled suits, jacquard tailoring that featured cinched waist jackets and pants that kicked out over python boots were pure gigolo dressing. </p> <p>Both Jean Paul Gaultier and Milan-based design duo D-Squared opted for club class holiday dressing. Gaultier began in a nautical mood, using soft and muted layers of rayon in naval shapes, before venturing into washed-out, delicate scarf prints for kaftans, beachwear and blouson suits. D-Squared took to the isle of Mykonos, showing in a nightclub on the outskirts of Milan dripping with marble, black lacquer and intentionally tasteless gilt. The designer twins Dean and Dan Caton dipped the hems of flared white jeans into wet sand, delivered Adonis-style metallic sportswear and, to the gravelly tones of Barry White, declared that the time was again right to show out. Roberto Cavalli was also in holiday mood, with bathrobes in deckchair-striped mink, washed silk shirts, jeans that featured drizzles of sunshine-coloured paint and Capri-style accessorising to the max. </p> <p>Nicole Farhi and Giorgio Armani both presented strong classic collections, Farhi mixing rose-coloured iridescent tailoring with steel grey suits, Armani using ultraviolet shades to update his covetable and wearable clothes. Romeo Gigli and Missoni introduced some of the strongest prints for the season, Gigli opting for retro jacquards, Missoni matching shorts and shirts and sleeveless safari suits, in a return to 70s styling. </p> <p>Both Prada and Gucci were a little disappointing. Ford used kimono silks and karate trousers for his \"Howard Jones\" 80s pop star look, supposedly inspired by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, while Prada was very American bourgeois with blazer tailoring and small-scale silk prints. Louis Vuitton, like Gucci, looked to the 80s for inspiration, though Marc Jacobs' vision was far too literal, with peach sportswear, pleated trousers and fluorescent leather accessories. Comme des Gar\u00e7ons played with colourful blocks of print in oversized polka dots and checkerboard patterns, Paul Smith was fresh and looked stronger than ever with tutti-frutti suits, tangerine and mint gingham, and his own brand of Hawaiian shirts in oversized bi-coloured prints worn with humbug-striped casual trousers. </p> <p>Herm\u00e8s showed a particularly smooth collection, with wet sand shades of linen and leather for upmarket resort dressing, while Dries van Noten went sporty with old school washed-out rugby stripes, suede trainers and striped knitted ties - a masterclass in colour co-ordination. Rykiel, more in tune with what was shown in Milan than Paris, used testcard rainbows of brights splashed across knits decorated with diamant\u00e9. </p> <p>The touch of edgy and directional fashion needed to drag menswear into the new century was provided by Kostas Murkudis, Warren Kade and Daniel Margolin. Murkudis mixed military tailoring with handpainted oriental silk prints, Warren Kade (showing for the first time in Paris) delved into the culture of Thailand for inspired prints and slick sportswear, while Margolin, drawing on Paganini, used sober tones of beige and black with delicate cream and lavender for some exciting and masterfully detailed tailoring. </p> <p>\u0095 Adrian Clark is fashion director of Loaded</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why is it that, with the best intentions in the world, taxi drivers, while trying to show a welcoming interest, always manage to wind you up? \"I've never understood why people would want to pay so much money for clothes with a designer label. Let's face it, you're only paying for the name, aren't you? Although that Hugo Boss does know how to make a decent suit.\" If I had a penny for every time I have kept the meter ticking over while arguing the toss on that one, during two weeks of continental city-hopping for the menswear catwalk collections in Milan and Paris, I would be a wealthy man by now. Twenty minutes into my ride home yesterday morning and we are on to the same old chestnut. The only difference being, this time I didn't have the enthusiasm, or the armoury, to disagree with my driver's questioning - in fact, I think he has a point. Two years ago, I would have argued fervently that it isn't just the name you are paying for - it is the extension of a creative personality. In the same way you would eat at your favourite restaurant because you liked that particular chef's cooking, you would buy a designer label because you sympathise with that particular designer's aesthetic. Sadly, however, times are changing. As fashion empires grow stronger, snapping up less affluent designers in the way you and I might buy a round of drinks, the personality behind those designer names is being drained away. Ironically (considering this is the one label every taxi driver thinks is worthy) and to illustrate my point, Hugo Boss isn't a he. Hugo Boss, the man, doesn't exist, nor has he ever. Instead Hugo Boss is a faceless fashion empire without a single front man, designed by a studio of anonymous designers who all have an input. The outcome is compromise, not conviction, and sadly this situation is becoming the norm. Jil Sander, which has always been considered at the edge of forward-thinking fashion, is now without Jil Sander. The first collection to be shown without the label's founder at the helm, following a creative disagreement with the Prada group which purchased the company last year, had all the edge of a blunt razor. The subtle detailing that set the label apart from the competition had gone and in its place, a palatable but nondescript collection of tailoring and Ivy League basics was presented as the way forward. Patrizio Bertelli, who heads up the Prada group, commented after the show that he was not actively looking for a strong personality to guide the label into the future; instead, he thinks it can run smoothly without a \"name\" heading it up. How wrong can you be. The spring 2001 collection looked as if it had been put together following a blueprint laid down by its founder.

      "bodyText": "No, not playing football in bars, that would be silly. We're talking the table football game with players on sliding poles. Also known as \"fussball\" or \"babyfoot\", it is popping up in more cool locations than customised jeans. Britain's premier field-based schmoozefest, Glastonbury, had bar football backstage to amuse the VIPs, PR poseurs and random liggers - and there were queues for it all weekend. There was more backstage action at this year's Brit awards, while those without VIP passes have been honing their skills on the tables in Top Shop and Nike Town, and even Auntie Beeb's got in on the act, using table football for its graphics during Euro 2000. Not to be confused with fiddly Subbuteo, bar footie is sturdier, a lot more lairy and, played properly, leaves your arms aching worse than a pinball marathon. Despite its retro-laddish connations, it requires little soccer skill, meaning it is suitable for the sportingly challenged. And you can play singles, doubles or even triples, so it's sociable. Bar footie is singlehandedly making pub sports acceptable again. When was the last time you saw someone in cringe-free clothes playing darts, snooker or dominoes? Like, never. So next time you see a table, put your prejudice aside and give it a go. You'll be using phrases like \"reverse rollover\" and \"front pin dinks\" in no time. Just remember: no spinning. That's the sign of a drunk or a doofus.",

      "body": "<p>As heaving bars prepared to turf out groups of tipsy teens and twentysomethings, the police officer patrolling Leicester Square came across a familiar scene. </p> <p>A teenage boy lay sprawled on paving stones near a plaque honouring the actor Richard E Grant. He had been vomiting, was barely conscious, and was apparently alone. The concerned officer radioed for an ambulance, which arrived within minutes, around 11pm. When paramedics asked him what he had been doing, the boy mumbled that he had been out drinking with friends, who had apparently left him to take the tube home. The teenagers, it later emerged, had been out on a post-GCSE bender. </p> <p>Eyewitness Ritchie Parrott, 31, said: \"There wasn't anybody with him. I saw a group of about seven or eight boys standing nearby all huddled together. </p> <p>\"I couldn't work out whether they were his friends or not, but they looked quite anxious and kept looking towards him. </p> <p>\"He was just still. Being Leicester Square you see that all the time. There's always somebody being sick.\" </p> <p>Another witness, Julie MacDonald, 23, saw him lying prone near the railings, on the east side of the square, which fence off the grassy central enclosure. </p> <p>\"He was just lying there, totally motionless. He was stretched out on his front with his head turned to one side. There was no one else with him.\" </p> <p>The paramedics checked his breathing and asked him to repeat a sentence, a standard test of drunkenness. It was clear from this that he was completely inebriated. Still unaware they were dealing with the prime minister's eldest son, police officers who had gathered at the scene advised him that he was being arrested. </p> <p>The teenager was taken to Charing Cross police station, where after waiting in line with petty criminals and other drunks he saw the custody sergeant, who asked him for his age, name and address and warned him again that he was being formally arrested. </p> <p>Euan gave his first names - Euan John - and an old address. Officers then searched his pockets and found some ID - thought to be a cashpoint card - which was initialled E Blair. The custody sergeant asked him if his name was Euan Blair, and then it clicked: \"Hold on a minute. Aren't you Tony Blair's son?\" </p> <p>The custody sergeant rang special branch while Euan sat waiting in a cell near the custody suite. Scotland Yard notified Downing Street, and a special branch car took him back to the Blairs' No 11 flat at around 1am, where the prime minister was waiting alone for him. </p> <p>Cherie Blair was in Portugal with baby Leo and her mother, and Mr Blair had been working late on his speech for yesterday's Faith in the Future conference. He had been beginning to worry about his son's whereabouts when police called. </p> <p>Meanwhile, news of the arrest had already leaked to the Sun newspaper. Following a tip from a police officer a Sun reporter rang Scotland Yard at 1.15am asking for confirmation of the arrest. </p> <p>Within a quarter of an hour, the head of corporate affairs at the Yard, Dick Fedorcio, was briefing the commissioner, Sir John Stevens. Scotland Yard officials then liaised with Downing Street to \"sort out a few well chosen words\". </p> <p>At 2am Scotland Yard confirmed that a 16-year-old had been arrested in Leicester Square, but the story did not appear in the late editions of the Sun, or the Times, which had also been tipped off. </p> <p>Video footage from local businesses' security cameras around Leicester Square was seized yesterday by plain clothes police officers from Scotland Yard. A waiter at Haagen Daz said: \"They just came in and took the film. There was no explanation but everybody guessed why they wanted it - to stop embarrassing pictures of the prime minister's son getting into the papers.\" </p> <p>Bars, pubs and nightclubs line the square and, as expected, every venue that serves alcohol yesterday denied knowledge of having served 16-year-old Euan. </p> <p><strong> Flouted</strong><br> </p> <p> As every establishment denied it served under-18s, or in some cases anyone under 21, regular visitors to the square spoke of how the law was regularly flouted. </p> <p>Busker Tom Cogswell, 20, said: \"Sometimes the bouncers ask for ID, but some people who get in are obviously under age. If it's a group of young girls who look hot, they'll get in.\" </p> <p>Downing Street's press strategy yesterday was to issue an apology and a plea for understanding on Euan's behalf, while shoring up the Blairs' concern to shield their children from intrusive publicity. </p> <p>While it was made clear that his parents viewed the matter seriously, the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, also noted: \"Euan will not be the only teenager out last night celebrating his exams, he won't be the only one who got worse for wear but he will be the only one splashed all over the papers and the television.\" </p> <p>The Blairs have gone to great lengths to protect their children from the media spotlight, knowing that at least the two older boys would go through the difficult adolescent years in Downing Street. </p> <p>Last December Tony Blair took the Daily Sport to the Press Complaints Commission after it published a picture of Euan, then 15, kissing a girl at the Ministry of Sound nightclub. </p> <p>The Blairs believed it was a breach of the Press Complaints Commission's code that says journalists must not interview or photograph children under the age of 16 \"in the absence or without the consent of a parent\" and papers should not use material about a child simply because his or her parents are famous. </p> <p><strong> Privacy</strong><br> </p> <p> The complaint was upheld. But yesterday the PCC's chairman, Lord Wakeham, drew a distinction with the latest episode, saying that as Euan was over 16 and was not at school at the time there was no restriction on reporting. However, he urged journalists to bear in mind the Blairs' commitment to their family's privacy. </p> <p>Commentators yesterday viewed Euan's adolescent escapade as just that. The psychologist and writer Dorothy Rowe said: \"It is very normal. If he has just sat his GCSEs there is an enormous release of pressure, and the pressure is doubled because his parents expect so much of him. This is what kids do.\" </p> <p>Despite concern about under-age drinking, particularly since the advent of sweet-tasting but intoxicating \"alcopops\", government figures show a slight decrease. </p> <p>In 1998 21% of children aged 11-15 said they had drunk alcohol in the past seven days - compared with 27% in 1996. </p> <p>Euan attends the London Oratory school in Fulham, where school rules exhort pupils to \"behave in an orderly, civilised and well-mannered way at all times, both in and out of school\". But the headmaster, John McIntosh, said yesterday the boy would not face the music on his return in September. </p> <p>Euan will, however, have to return to Charing Cross police station, to deal with having given police a false name and address. He will be accompanied by his parents, and can expect to undergo this trip in the glare of the nation's media. </p> <p><strong>Problems with the younger generation</strong></p> <p><strong> David Lloyd George's </strong> children dissented from both the family and the prime minister's Liberal party line. Son Gwilym sat in a Conservative cabinet, and daughter Megan won a seat as a Liberal only to switch to Labour. </p> <p><strong> Stanley Baldwin's </strong> son, Oliver, disowned his family and converted to socialism in 1923. He became a Labour MP in 1929 and relished attacking his father, three times Conservative prime minister, across the house. </p> <p><strong> Sir Winston Churchill</strong> had five children, two of them notorious drunks. Randolph, who became an MP in 1940, was described by his assistant, Sir John Colville, as \"one of the most objectionable people I had ever met\". </p> <p><strong> Jim Callaghan's </strong> daughter, Margaret, was married to Britain's ambassador in Washington, Peter Jay, at the time he was Labour prime minister. In 1978 she had an affair with the Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein. </p> <p><strong> Margaret Thatcher</strong> tolerated son Mark's antics, though they were a constant embarrassment to the Conservative party. \"Mum's a bit worried about me,\" he once said. In 1982 he got lost for six days in the Sahara. He also shamelessly exploited his mother's contacts in his business ventures. </p> <p><strong> John Major's</strong> son, James, was named in the divorce of a woman 10 years his senior in 1995. He went on to marry a former gameshow assistant, Emma Noble. </p> <p><strong> Sir David Steel's </strong> son, Graeme, was jailed in 1995 for growing \u00a330,000 of cannabis. The former Lib Dem leader confessed: \"I was the classic absentee father.\" </p> <p><strong> Jack Straw's </strong> son, William, then 17, in 1998 caused the tough-on-crime home secretary, embarrassment after he agreed to supply a tabloid reporter with cannabis. He was given a police caution.<br> Simon Bowers</p>",

Flouted As every establishment denied it served under-18s, or in some cases anyone under 21, regular visitors to the square spoke of how the law was regularly flouted. Busker Tom Cogswell, 20, said: \"Sometimes the bouncers ask for ID, but some people who get in are obviously under age. If it's a group of young girls who look hot, they'll get in.\" Downing Street's press strategy yesterday was to issue an apology and a plea for understanding on Euan's behalf, while shoring up the Blairs' concern to shield their children from intrusive publicity. While it was made clear that his parents viewed the matter seriously, the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, also noted: \"Euan will not be the only teenager out last night celebrating his exams, he won't be the only one who got worse for wear but he will be the only one splashed all over the papers and the television.\" The Blairs have gone to great lengths to protect their children from the media spotlight, knowing that at least the two older boys would go through the difficult adolescent years in Downing Street. Last December Tony Blair took the Daily Sport to the Press Complaints Commission after it published a picture of Euan, then 15, kissing a girl at the Ministry of Sound nightclub. The Blairs believed it was a breach of the Press Complaints Commission's code that says journalists must not interview or photograph children under the age of 16 \"in the absence or without the consent of a parent\" and papers should not use material about a child simply because his or her parents are famous. Privacy The complaint was upheld. But yesterday the PCC's chairman, Lord Wakeham, drew a distinction with the latest episode, saying that as Euan was over 16 and was not at school at the time there was no restriction on reporting. However, he urged journalists to bear in mind the Blairs' commitment to their family's privacy. Commentators yesterday viewed Euan's adolescent escapade as just that. The psychologist and writer Dorothy Rowe said: \"It is very normal. If he has just sat his GCSEs there is an enormous release of pressure, and the pressure is doubled because his parents expect so much of him. This is what kids do.\" Despite concern about under-age drinking, particularly since the advent of sweet-tasting but intoxicating \"alcopops\", government figures show a slight decrease. In 1998 21% of children aged 11-15 said they had drunk alcohol in the past seven days - compared with 27% in 1996. Euan attends the London Oratory school in Fulham, where school rules exhort pupils to \"behave in an orderly, civilised and well-mannered way at all times, both in and out of school\". But the headmaster, John McIntosh, said yesterday the boy would not face the music on his return in September. Euan will, however, have to return to Charing Cross police station, to deal with having given police a false name and address. He will be accompanied by his parents, and can expect to undergo this trip in the glare of the nation's media. Problems with the younger generation David Lloyd George's children dissented from both the family and the prime minister's Liberal party line. Son Gwilym sat in a Conservative cabinet, and daughter Megan won a seat as a Liberal only to switch to Labour. Stanley Baldwin's son, Oliver, disowned his family and converted to socialism in 1923. He became a Labour MP in 1929 and relished attacking his father, three times Conservative prime minister, across the house. Sir Winston Churchill had five children, two of them notorious drunks. Randolph, who became an MP in 1940, was described by his assistant, Sir John Colville, as \"one of the most objectionable people I had ever met\". Jim Callaghan's daughter, Margaret, was married to Britain's ambassador in Washington, Peter Jay, at the time he was Labour prime minister. In 1978 she had an affair with the Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein. Margaret Thatcher tolerated son Mark's antics, though they were a constant embarrassment to the Conservative party. \"Mum's a bit worried about me,\" he once said. In 1982 he got lost for six days in the Sahara. He also shamelessly exploited his mother's contacts in his business ventures. John Major's son, James, was named in the divorce of a woman 10 years his senior in 1995. He went on to marry a former gameshow assistant, Emma Noble. Sir David Steel's son, Graeme, was jailed in 1995 for growing \u00a330,000 of cannabis. The former Lib Dem leader confessed: \"I was the classic absentee father.\" Jack Straw's son, William, then 17, in 1998 caused the tough-on-crime home secretary, embarrassment after he agreed to supply a tabloid reporter with cannabis. He was given a police caution. Simon Bowers",

      "bodyText": "A national adoption register is to be set up, matching children with potential parents in a bid to speed up the adoption process, prime minister Tony Blair announced today. The register, covering England and Wales, will coordinate current systems, which critics say have left too many children languishing in care rather than being placed with adoptive parents. New national standards will also be laid down, setting deadlines for making decisions about children and criteria for assessing potential adopters. Mr Blair announced the plans after a report into adoption, published by the government's performance and innovation unit, called on the government to do more to increase the numbers of children adopted from local authority care and to ensure some of the country's most vulnerable youngsters are protected. There has been criticism of the way different local authorities assess potential adoptive parents and of the time it takes for children to leave care homes. Mr Blair said: \"For some of the most vulnerable children, who, for whatever reason, cannot live with their birth parents, adoption provides the chance for a fresh start and the opportunity to enjoy the kind of loving family life that most of us take for granted. \"The PIU report presents a range of options for promoting greater use of adoption and for speeding up the whole process. \"We will be consulting widely on these options before publishing a white paper before the end of the year outlining our new approach, including proposals for new legislation to be introduced next year.\" But \"forward action\" would be taken to introduce the national register and standards for adoption, he added. An adoption and permanency taskforce will be set up to try to clear the huge backlog of children waiting to be adopted. The taskforce will conduct a \"rapid scrutiny\" of cases in a bid to match youngsters with adoptive parents. It will also try to spread \"best practice\" among local authorities. Health minister John Hutton said: \"The government is committed to modernising adoption. \"We need to ensure that children's needs come first. And we need to better meet the aspirations of the many prospective parents who want to adopt. \"This report represents the first step in a long-overdue task of reform.\" The issue has been given a high profile by the government after Mr Blair announced in February that he would take personal charge of a review of adoption policy. At present, it can take nearly three years for a child to be adopted because of long assessment and processing procedures. A survey by the Cabinet Office found that more than 2,000 youngsters were waiting to be adopted and 1,200 families were waiting to adopt. Campaigns are to be launched to recruit more potential adoptive families and to speed up the whole process. Around two-thirds of children who were eventually adopted had to wait more than a year between going into care and being placed with their adoptive family. And a third of adopted children stay in care for more than three years before they are given a permanent home. On average, children adopted in 1998 were 14 months old when they went into care and two-and-half years old before they were placed with their adoptive families. More than 55,000 children were in the care of local authorities, mostly with foster parents, with around 2,200 adopted each year.

Kevin Cobb, 38, from Yateley, Hanpshire, abused his position to trust to prey on vulnerable women who went to the casualty department of St Peter's Hospital, Chertsey, Surrey, for help. Cobb was convicted on May 17 of seven offences following a four-week trial. He was remanded for reports after the jury found him guilty of the manslaughter of 31-year-old Miss Annis; guilty of four charges of drugging women with intent to rape; and guilty of two offences of rape at the hospital's casualty department. Judge Martin Stephens at the Old Bailey said Cobb drugged his victims with a anaesthetic and assaulted them in the knowledge that they would not remember what had happened to them. \"It would be difficult to envisage a greater breach of trust,\" said the judge. He told Cobb that the attacks on women took place after he had inadvertently killed Susan Annis who was drugged so the male nurse could rape her. The judge said this showed he was a danger to women as well as someone who had brought the much-loved nursing profession into disrepute. The prosecution told the court that Miss Annis, from Crawley Hospital, West Sussex, died at a nurses' home at the Royal Brompton Hospital, west London, in November, 1996, when her drink was spiked by Cobb. Cobb was arrested in January 1999 after patient Miss Janine Cuddington complained she blacked out on a hospital trolley and came round to find herself being raped by a smirking nurse.

The bookshop beat conventional rivals to win a national prize for its speciality on environmental issues, became a meeting place for Shrewsbury's literati, and kept the book-buying habit alive in the town until independent bookshops and Waterstone's opened there. Three of the volunteers later opened their own bookshops - typical examples of Joan's enabling and liberating powers. \u0095 Joan Tate, translator, writer and publisher's reader, born September 23 1922; died June 6 2000",

The body is like an over-heated machine, working at increased speed on less fuel, and the wasted arms and legs come to resemble torn driving-belts. There is no limit to the physical effects of hunger beyond which tottering human dignity might still keep its uncertain but independent balance.

After the German invasion of Poland on September 1 1939, he and his friends founded one of the first underground anti-Nazi organisations in Warsaw. Then, on September 17, the Soviet Union attacked Poland and the country was divided between two totalitarian powers.</p> <p>In 1940 Herling fled to the Soviet-occupied part of Poland but there, in March, he was arrested by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD. He was thrown into prison and accused of being a German spy; the surreal pretext was that \"Herling\", when transcribed into Russian, sounded similar to the name of Hitler's deputy, Herman Goering. Interrogated under torture, Herling was sentenced to five years hard labour in a forced-labour camp at Kargopol, near Archangel on the White Sea.</p> <p>Then, in June 1941, came the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union. Stalin agreed to an amnesty for Polish prisoners yet Herling was still not released - until he went on hunger strike. Before leaving the camp he dared to steal his own prisoner photograph as Labour Inmate Number 1872 from his dossier.</p> <p>In 1942 he enlisted in the Polish army and went through Kazakhstan, Iran, and Palestine to Libya. He eventually arrived in Italy, where, as a soldier of the Second Polish Corps, he took part in the battle of Monte Cassino and was awarded Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military honour.</p> <p>After the war Herling lived in Rome, London and Munich, where he briefly worked for Radio Free Europe. After his first wife died in 1952 he settled in Naples where, in 1955, he married Lidia Croce, daughter of Italian historian and philosopher, Benedetto Croce.</p> <p>In 1946 in Rome, Jerzy Giedroyc and Herling had founded the emigr\u00e9 journal Kultura. It was to become one of the most important Polish intellectual forums of the postwar period, and played an invaluable role in preserving an authentic Polish culture of free speech and in educating the generation which founded Solidarity in 1981.</p> <p>Herling's contribution to Kultura included critical essays and excerpts from his Diary Written at Night, which he composed over the past 30 years. He also wrote The Living and the Dead (1945), Phantoms of the Revolution (1969), The Second Coming (1963), and The Island: Three Tales (1967), as well as critical essays on literature and art.</p> <p>He received many awards, including the Italian Permio Viareggio, the Prix Gutenberg and an award from the French Pen-Club.

The prisoner had to choose between his own life and the lives of four other men. He decided to save himself and wanted to hear from Herling, a man who went through the same world of the camps, only two words - \"I understand\" - which would somehow justify that one can fight evil with evil, that personal physical survival matters more than retaining one's humanity.</p> <p>Herling writes: \"No, I could not say it.\" To do so would have meant an acceptance of the morality of the totalitarian world which he never accepted, even in the gulag.</p> <p>\u0095 Gustaw Herling-Grudzinski, writer, born May 20 1919; died July 4 2000</p> <p>\u0095 The following is an extract from Gustaw Herling's memoir A World Apart.

Only later, I discovered that the bzeprizornye constitute a most dangerous semi-legal mafia, organised on the pattern of masonic lodges, and surpassed only by the more powerful organisations of urkas, or criminal prisoners. If in Russia anything like a black market exists, it is only thanks to the efforts of these urchins, always weaving in and out of crowds, besieging the spectorgs (special shops supplying exclusively the elite of the Soviet bureaucracy), creeping at dusk towards stores of corn and coal. The Soviet authorities wink at all this activity; they regard the bzeprizornye as the only true proletariat free of the original sin of counter- revolution, as a plastic mass of raw material which can be moulded into any shape they choose.

It gives us strength and that's important. Last night I read a poem by a poet called Longfellow. It says: 'For Thine own purpose Thou hast sent strife and discouragement.' We need the strength when the strife and the discouragement is there.\"</p> <p>The raw emotion in his voice, as he spoke about his faith at home, contrasted with the earlier part of Mr Blair's speech when he almost made light of Euan's arrest in his first reference to his son.</p> <p>As he praised the church's commitment to \"tolerance, faith and the family and trying to bring up children properly\", Mr Blair grinned and said: \"That part was written a short time ago.\"</p> <p>His mood turned sombre, however, as he spoke of the strains of combining fatherhood with running the country. \"Being a prime minister can be a tough job,\" he said. \"But I think that being a parent is probably tougher. Sometimes you do not always succeed. But the family to me is more important than anything else.\"</p> <p>As members of the audience clapped and shouted hallelujah, the prime minister was momentarily distracted when a baby cried out from the back of the audience. \"Is that a little baby back there,\" he asked. \"It makes me feel at home.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair makes no secret of his faith, which is High Anglican, although he rarely wears his Christianity on his sleeve.</p> <p>The emotion of yesterday's speech indicated, however, the intense soul searching in the Blair household over the past 24 hours.</p> <p>Sounding at times more like a preacher than a prime minister, Mr Blair told of how faith helped him to prepare his four children for the challenges of the new century. \"Faith, in the end, is the best expression of humility, the best expression that there is something bigger than us as individuals,\" he told a sympathetic audience from Britain's Black Majority Churches.</p> <p>\"There are challenges my parents and grandparents never dreamed of.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair came close to tears yesterday as he opened up his heart to talk about the central role played by Christianity in his family life. Visibly upset by the behaviour of his eldest son, the prime minister abandoned his text at a conference of black church leaders to declare that he had turned to his faith on the night of Euan's arrest. Mr Blair made no direct reference to his son, but he spoke of how he read Henry Longfellow's poem, The Village Church, on Wednesday night. His voice almost breaking with emotion, Mr Blair asked his audience at the Faith in the Future Conference in Brighton: \"What does faith give us? It gives us strength and that's important. Last night I read a poem by a poet called Longfellow. It says: 'For Thine own purpose Thou hast sent strife and discouragement.' We need the strength when the strife and the discouragement is there.\" The raw emotion in his voice, as he spoke about his faith at home, contrasted with the earlier part of Mr Blair's speech when he almost made light of Euan's arrest in his first reference to his son. As he praised the church's commitment to \"tolerance, faith and the family and trying to bring up children properly\", Mr Blair grinned and said: \"That part was written a short time ago.\" His mood turned sombre, however, as he spoke of the strains of combining fatherhood with running the country. \"Being a prime minister can be a tough job,\" he said. \"But I think that being a parent is probably tougher. Sometimes you do not always succeed. But the family to me is more important than anything else.\" As members of the audience clapped and shouted hallelujah, the prime minister was momentarily distracted when a baby cried out from the back of the audience. \"Is that a little baby back there,\" he asked. \"It makes me feel at home.\" Mr Blair makes no secret of his faith, which is High Anglican, although he rarely wears his Christianity on his sleeve. The emotion of yesterday's speech indicated, however, the intense soul searching in the Blair household over the past 24 hours. Sounding at times more like a preacher than a prime minister, Mr Blair told of how faith helped him to prepare his four children for the challenges of the new century. \"Faith, in the end, is the best expression of humility, the best expression that there is something bigger than us as individuals,\" he told a sympathetic audience from Britain's Black Majority Churches. \"There are challenges my parents and grandparents never dreamed of. If I look at the world my kids are growing up in, there's so much for them in material goods. \"But there are also big problems and challenges there - it is tougher. There are not the same links with family and community which kept people together.\" Giving his faith a clear political dimension, he said he believed that faith bound society together to demonstrate that human beings are not \"stranded in isolation\". He added: \"Faith is not some old-fashioned virtue whose time has gone. So let us emerge unafraid of the future, saying 'bring us those challenges, we are ready for them' and in place of the fear we can often have, the hope we know in our hearts we should have.\" The prime minister was clapped and treated to numerous standing ovations throughout his speech as his audience lapped up his message. At the end of his speech, Mark Sturge, the head of the African and Caribbean Evangelical Alliance, joked: \"Who needs a good speech writer when you have a good sermon?\" The audience, whose warm welcome contrasted with the humiliation meted out to Mr Blair at the Women's Institute conference, was encouraged when he spoke of his determination to sweep aside racial discrimination. Announcing that Gordon Brown is to tackle unemployment among the ethnic minorities, Mr Blair was cheered when he said that Britain would one day have a black prime minister. \"I say to young black people: you perhaps more than anyone can gain from going into politics,\" he said. \"Politics needs people from the ethnic minorities. They used to say Britain would never have a woman prime minister. It happened. One day there will be a black prime minister, too. But it means today's young blacks thinking that politics matters, it is for them, they want to get involved and make a real difference.\" However, Mr Blair admitted that black people faced formidable obstacles in pursuing successful careers in, for example, the police. \"I appeal to young black children,\" he said. \"I know the sad, difficult history of police relations. But don't rule out a career in the police, because it's important that the police force becomes representative of your community.\" As a first step Mr Blair said that the chancellor would commit the government - in his spending review this month - to narrow the gap between unemployment rates among members of ethnic minorities and others. \"We need to tackle discrimination at the gateway into work,\" he said. \"Unemployment among ethnic minorities is 12.2%, compared to 5.8% nationally.\" Mr Blair was cheered and given a final standing ovation as he left the stage. Gilda Rose, from the Bethel United Church in Birmingham, said she was impressed by Mr Blair's commitment to stamping out discrimination, although she doubted a there would be a black prime minister in Downing Street in the near future. \"It was a very positive speech,\" she said.\"I do not believe there will be a black prime minister, but I was pleased to hear him talk about ending inequality.

      "body": "<p>In late-night newsrooms, bored reporters on the dog-watch play at fantasy news. What if...Princess Diana found alive, Pope elopes, Baroness Young in lesbian love triangle. And then suddenly it happens - Euan Blair drunk and incapable, vomiting in Leicester Square, arrested and taken to a police cell. On cue, to deadline, it's the very day his father has been battered in the Commons for that speech promising to give police \"powers to deal with drunken anti-social behaviour which causes offence and misery in too many towns and cities\". Did young Euan also oblige by \"throwing traffic cones around the street or hurling abuse into the night sky\", loutish behaviour his father threatened with spot fines at the cashpoint? We know little. All we know is that here is a story to make heathen newshounds believe there is a God after all. (And may cause Tony Blair doubts on the same score.)</p> <p>Any chortles from enemies of left or right are strictly private. (Yes, private jokes abound referring to the government's largely unused child curfew orders. Might the Blairs be ordered on to a course for failing parents on one of the new parenting orders?) But in public the amalgamated union of professional politicians wisely closed ranks: there but for the grace of God go any of the children of Westminster's denizens. Is there a sane parent anywhere who does not sympathise? Is there a teenager anywhere who doesn't view with horror what adolescence must be like inside Number 10? The best hope is that this was just a case of a kid getting drunk after exams as most others do - an almost obligatory rite of passage that, with luck, leaves most of them so horribly sick they are determined never to get that out of control again. As Alastair Campbell said acidly at his daily press briefing, \"Euan won't be the only one who got the worse for wear but he will be the only one splashed all over the papers and the television\". End of story.</p> <p>But other things loom and lurk behind all this, a multitude of uneasy unpleasantness. To start with, can the god of perfect news stories really have gone completely unaided by human agency? Was this just a divine coincidence? Or is the boy from Number 10 too vulnerable? Consider the monstrous way Jack Straw's son was set up by an agent provocateur from the Mirror, flattering and urging him on to buy some cannabis for her. How much should the boy from Number 10 trust \"friends\" when the chance to make spectacular fun of the prime minister is right there, begging for it? It probably doesn't take Rohypnol or any other artificial means to encourage a boy over the edge on an end-of-exam spree. But why, according to one eye witness, was he found vomiting alone in Leicester Square? Where were these friends? And who tipped off the press? Whoever it was behaved disgracefully, whether it was a friend or - far more likely - the police, who are never sacked for taking backhanders for stories about celebs' minor infringements that would never otherwise see the light of day.</p> <p>And then there is our old friend the press code of practice, fine words honoured in the breach every day of the week. Out Lord Wakeham duly popped yesterday, Fleet Street's noble figleaf, quick to assure the hacks that of course it was perfectly OK to pillory the boy in print - he was 16, out of school, underage and drunk. So much for the protection of minors, or for allowing a judge to decide whether naming a boy isn't too grave a punishment for such a minor crime. It is probably irrelevant. Some stories are just too stupendous to be held back by any code and Downing Street very wisely didn't even try. But that doesn't make it right or fair on someone who is still a child.</p> <p>Then comes the awful spectre of what life must be like in Number 10 for any normal London boy, dragged off to the stately boredom of Chequers at the weekend. Alastair Campbell revealed yesterday that the prime minister had been up late working on his boxes, already worried that his son wasn't home by 1am. Cherie was away with the baby in Portugal. Campbell added the chilling reassurance that the Blairs are \"strict disciplinarians\" and you just hope against hope it's not true. But it makes you wonder if the boy is bursting with anger at restrictions unjustly imposed upon him by his parents' public careers. He was allowed no alcohol for his 16th birthday party - presumably because if anyone got drunk it would have hit the front pages instantly. Was getting drunk this week a resentful son's dream revenge on his father - the father of the nation? (Pyrrhic victory - it's even worse for Euan.) Any half-way successful parent knows the onus that success puts on their children: there is no protection. Add to that a new baby: what adolescent wants to be reminded that their parents still have a busy sex life (yuk), when they are just starting to get their own together?</p> <p>As for parenthood, no prime minister (or any other big banana) could ever be much good at it. Yesterday's prime ministerial diary meant unveiling a police memorial and making a key speech to 6,000 black religious leaders in Brighton, hastily rewritten to include remarks about the travails of fatherhood (remarks whose diffident charm probably went down better with the religious than with his hungover son). Then he was off to do a whole gruelling television Question Time on his own with David Dimbleby, again talking loudly about fatherhood while not actually having time to do much of it. It is not his fault, no overwhelmingly important job is ever family-friendly. The super-famous give their children hell, however good they are, however hard they try. Forget privilege: son of so-and-so is the worst possible start in life, this side of a slum. Just consider the Hollywood \"my mama/papa from hell\" tales. Is it too unkind to raise the ghosts of Randolph Churchill or Mark Thatcher? Maybe the mega-ambitious shouldn't have children at all. Whatever the truth of this case, who would not feel sorry today for the young boy with a sore head inside Number 10?</p> <p>For his father, woes tread upon each other's heels. Early-shift PA reporters were just pushing out a rather different story on the wires, before Blair booze-boy broke. Its breezy tone was a political scene-setter for the coming day: \"Tony Blair was today hoping two high-profile public appearances will help him to seize the political initiative from the Conservatives and shrug off a turbulent month for the government. Aides hope today's appearances will see Mr Blair finally emerge...\" It was not to be. Instead, in the dark watches of the night, he admitted in yesterday's speech to reaching for his copy of lugubrious old Longfellow, quoting: \"For thine own purpose, thou hast sent, The strife and the discouragement!\" Oh dear, the PM's chosen poem is a wail of wallowing despair. So out of kindness today at least we might resist the temptation to join the chorus of voices offering political lessons to be learned from all this. Poor man. Things can only get better.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/0,2759,339240,00.html\">Policing crime: special report</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0706blair.ra\">Audio: Blair's emotional reaction</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/today/article/0,6729,340399,00.html\">Comment by Michael White</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,340364,00.html\">Downing Street's full statement</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,339316,00.html\">Policing 'yob culture'</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "In late-night newsrooms, bored reporters on the dog-watch play at fantasy news. What if...Princess Diana found alive, Pope elopes, Baroness Young in lesbian love triangle. And then suddenly it happens - Euan Blair drunk and incapable, vomiting in Leicester Square, arrested and taken to a police cell. On cue, to deadline, it's the very day his father has been battered in the Commons for that speech promising to give police \"powers to deal with drunken anti-social behaviour which causes offence and misery in too many towns and cities\". Did young Euan also oblige by \"throwing traffic cones around the street or hurling abuse into the night sky\", loutish behaviour his father threatened with spot fines at the cashpoint? We know little. All we know is that here is a story to make heathen newshounds believe there is a God after all. (And may cause Tony Blair doubts on the same score.) Any chortles from enemies of left or right are strictly private. (Yes, private jokes abound referring to the government's largely unused child curfew orders. Might the Blairs be ordered on to a course for failing parents on one of the new parenting orders?) But in public the amalgamated union of professional politicians wisely closed ranks: there but for the grace of God go any of the children of Westminster's denizens. Is there a sane parent anywhere who does not sympathise? Is there a teenager anywhere who doesn't view with horror what adolescence must be like inside Number 10? The best hope is that this was just a case of a kid getting drunk after exams as most others do - an almost obligatory rite of passage that, with luck, leaves most of them so horribly sick they are determined never to get that out of control again. As Alastair Campbell said acidly at his daily press briefing, \"Euan won't be the only one who got the worse for wear but he will be the only one splashed all over the papers and the television\". End of story. But other things loom and lurk behind all this, a multitude of uneasy unpleasantness. To start with, can the god of perfect news stories really have gone completely unaided by human agency? Was this just a divine coincidence? Or is the boy from Number 10 too vulnerable? Consider the monstrous way Jack Straw's son was set up by an agent provocateur from the Mirror, flattering and urging him on to buy some cannabis for her. How much should the boy from Number 10 trust \"friends\" when the chance to make spectacular fun of the prime minister is right there, begging for it? It probably doesn't take Rohypnol or any other artificial means to encourage a boy over the edge on an end-of-exam spree. But why, according to one eye witness, was he found vomiting alone in Leicester Square? Where were these friends? And who tipped off the press? Whoever it was behaved disgracefully, whether it was a friend or - far more likely - the police, who are never sacked for taking backhanders for stories about celebs' minor infringements that would never otherwise see the light of day. And then there is our old friend the press code of practice, fine words honoured in the breach every day of the week. Out Lord Wakeham duly popped yesterday, Fleet Street's noble figleaf, quick to assure the hacks that of course it was perfectly OK to pillory the boy in print - he was 16, out of school, underage and drunk. So much for the protection of minors, or for allowing a judge to decide whether naming a boy isn't too grave a punishment for such a minor crime. It is probably irrelevant. Some stories are just too stupendous to be held back by any code and Downing Street very wisely didn't even try. But that doesn't make it right or fair on someone who is still a child. Then comes the awful spectre of what life must be like in Number 10 for any normal London boy, dragged off to the stately boredom of Chequers at the weekend. Alastair Campbell revealed yesterday that the prime minister had been up late working on his boxes, already worried that his son wasn't home by 1am. Cherie was away with the baby in Portugal. Campbell added the chilling reassurance that the Blairs are \"strict disciplinarians\" and you just hope against hope it's not true. But it makes you wonder if the boy is bursting with anger at restrictions unjustly imposed upon him by his parents' public careers. He was allowed no alcohol for his 16th birthday party - presumably because if anyone got drunk it would have hit the front pages instantly. Was getting drunk this week a resentful son's dream revenge on his father - the father of the nation? (Pyrrhic victory - it's even worse for Euan.) Any half-way successful parent knows the onus that success puts on their children: there is no protection. Add to that a new baby: what adolescent wants to be reminded that their parents still have a busy sex life (yuk), when they are just starting to get their own together? As for parenthood, no prime minister (or any other big banana) could ever be much good at it. Yesterday's prime ministerial diary meant unveiling a police memorial and making a key speech to 6,000 black religious leaders in Brighton, hastily rewritten to include remarks about the travails of fatherhood (remarks whose diffident charm probably went down better with the religious than with his hungover son). Then he was off to do a whole gruelling television Question Time on his own with David Dimbleby, again talking loudly about fatherhood while not actually having time to do much of it. It is not his fault, no overwhelmingly important job is ever family-friendly. The super-famous give their children hell, however good they are, however hard they try. Forget privilege: son of so-and-so is the worst possible start in life, this side of a slum. Just consider the Hollywood \"my mama/papa from hell\" tales. Is it too unkind to raise the ghosts of Randolph Churchill or Mark Thatcher? Maybe the mega-ambitious shouldn't have children at all. Whatever the truth of this case, who would not feel sorry today for the young boy with a sore head inside Number 10? For his father, woes tread upon each other's heels. Early-shift PA reporters were just pushing out a rather different story on the wires, before Blair booze-boy broke. Its breezy tone was a political scene-setter for the coming day: \"Tony Blair was today hoping two high-profile public appearances will help him to seize the political initiative from the Conservatives and shrug off a turbulent month for the government. Aides hope today's appearances will see Mr Blair finally emerge...\" It was not to be. Instead, in the dark watches of the night, he admitted in yesterday's speech to reaching for his copy of lugubrious old Longfellow, quoting: \"For thine own purpose, thou hast sent, The strife and the discouragement!\" Oh dear, the PM's chosen poem is a wail of wallowing despair. So out of kindness today at least we might resist the temptation to join the chorus of voices offering political lessons to be learned from all this. Poor man. Things can only get better. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com Useful links Policing crime: special report Audio: Blair's emotional reaction Comment by Michael White Downing Street's full statement Policing 'yob culture'",

Having established the success of this approach, he is clearly subjecting all his initiatives to the same, rigorous, process of verification. London \u0095Since the prime minister's son has been found \"drunk and incapable\" in public will he hand Euan's piggy bank over to Jack Straw? Paul Dixon Sheffield \u0095Euan Blair should have been frog marched to the cashpoint by a police officer and made to withdraw \u00a3100. He then should have been dealt with severely by the criminal justice system. Of course not, but it is further proof that pandering to the vile common sense of middle england will always backfire.

Kenneth Little London \u0095So I'm 14 years old and my sister is getting married. I down more beer at that reception than anyone else. My mum notices and directs my brother to take me home, where I promptly throw up. Well, that's modern youth isn't it? Trouble is, we are talking about 1949. The next morning my old man says as I open my painful eyes, \"I'll bet you don't do that again\". He was wrong - I did, but at 65 this month I've survived. Euan, your old man will no doubt give you a much harder time than mine did, but in 50 years' time, you will have dined out on the story many times. Joe Phillips Bingham, Notts \u0095If ever there was an argument for paternity leave it is the perfomance of the prime minister since his son Leo was born.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street today attempted to quell the latest political storm to break over the government's euro policy, insisting that it was not a foregone conclusion that Britain would join. The intervention by the prime minister's spokesman was seen as a direct rebuke to the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, after he had suggested British membership was \"inevitable\". Mr Cook's unscripted remarks to trade unionists on Thursday night threatened to reopen divisions among cabinet ministers as to how quickly Britain should be moving towards joining the single currency. The foreign secretary's observation appeared to gain credence after comments by the European Central Bank president, Wim Duisenberg, who said that Britain had now met most of the conditions for joining the euro and was \"suffering greatly\" by staying outside. \"The United Kingdom satisfies all the conditions for entry, except that of the exchange rate,\" he said in an interview with the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. \"The performance of the British economy is admirable, but it is suffering greatly because it is not participating in the euro. That said, the decision is for the British people.\" Mr Cook, together with Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson and trade secretary Stephen Byers, has been pressing to start campaigning for the euro before the general election - a move strongly resisted by Chancellor Gordon Brown. Downing Street however insisted that while it was still the government's aim to take Britain into the euro, the economic conditions had to be right before it would recommend membership in a referendum. \"It's our objective to join a successful single currency, providing the economic conditions are met. It is not inevitable, but it's our objective,\" the spokesman said. Mr Cook's comments came in a question-and-answer session after a speech in which he had stuck rigidly to the official line that the government's five economic tests had to be met before it would recommend signing up. However, in response to questions, he pointed out that opinion polls showed that the majority of people in the country believed it was \"inevitable\" Britain would join, adding: \"I think they are right.\" His remarks coincided with some of the most pro-euro comments to date from Tony Blair during his appearance on BBC Question Time. The prime minister said that, if the economy continued on its present track, the government would be able to recommend joining in a referendum early in the next parliament. He warned that if the impression was given that Britain was not prepared to sign up to the single currency, inward investment would start declining \"virtually overnight\". Mr Brown, meanwhile, was determinedly standing aside from the latest row, flatly refusing to answer journalists' questions about Mr Cook's remarks at a press briefing today on third-world debt relief. \"I am not here to do a press conference on the euro,\" he said. Earlier this week, however, he insisted that the economic tests would be assessed \"rigorously\" before the government would consider putting the question of British membership to the public in a referendum. Shadow chancellor Michael Portillo said the government was in a \"state of disarray\" over the single currency. \"Downing Street spin doctors have launched a panic rearguard action to try to cover up Robin Cook's remarks when he confirmed that the Labour government want to scrap the pound,\" he said. \"Ministers are not only committed to the euro in principle, but believe membership is inevitable. Their outlook for Britain is defeatist. They ignore the evidence that Britain can survive and thrive outside the euro.\"",

This is another humiliation for Gordon Brown. It is open season on the chancellor.\" </p> <p>\u0095Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, yesterday said he favoured an elected president of Europe with the power to choose his or her cabinet.

I think they are right.\" He pointed to the recent OECD survey suggesting Britain's economy was on course to converge with European economies, but added he did not think conditions were right yet. Mr Blair was more optimistic than ever about the strides Britain was making. He said: \"It would be wrong if I tried to bend the economic conditions in Britain to suit joining the euro, but what can I say if we carry on running the economic policy which we are at the moment - clearing up the deficit, the public finances in a healthy state, we've got the lowest inflation in Europe, if we carry on in this way then I believe we will be able to make a recommendation early in the next parliament.\" He promised that if he thought the economic conditions were right: \"I will lead that referendum fight and recommend British people joining. And even though it is unpopular with certain people, sometimes it is up to a prime minister to tell people what they don't want to hear as well as what they want to hear.\" He refused to say he will resign if he loses the referendum, but \"obviously if you were to recommend such a thing in a referendum and to lose it would be a pretty serious thing for you\". Mr Blair also intervened in the debate about overseas investment into Britain fuelled by the leak of memos suggesting British manufacturing could hit meltdown if Britain indicated it might not join the euro. Mr Blair said: \"In my view they are coming here in large part because we are part of the EU and part of the single market.\" He went on, to applause from the audience: \"If we rule out the euro, and turn our back on the European Union, we are turning our back on the future of this country.\" The shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, said Mr Cook was talking nonsense and that the euro was no more inevitable than Bolshevism was. \"It is a disgrace that Britain's own government is talking down our currency,\" he said. \"Robin Cook and Tony Blair have reignited Labour's internal battles over how to scrap the pound. This is another humiliation for Gordon Brown. It is open season on the chancellor.\" \u0095Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, yesterday said he favoured an elected president of Europe with the power to choose his or her cabinet. He implicitly rejected a European government formed from national administrations, and suggested the president could be chosen by means of electoral colleges of the sort that existed in the US.",

The decision will be formally announced to the Commons early next week. The south London prison, which opened in 1821, will be offered to a prison company after the discovery of a punishment scandal in which mainly young black inmates were locked in their cells for hours on end as part of an unauthorised regime without the knowledge of the governor. Mr Boateng warned the prison's last governor, Bob Chapman, last November that his jail was officially regarded as a \"failing institution\" and told him that if it did not improve within 12 months it could face market testing. Yesterday's decision was taken after the discovery of the punishment scandal and a snap inspection last week by Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons. He found such appalling conditions in the jail's healthcare centre that he immediately rang Mr Narey and asked him to visit the prison. Mr Boateng, launching the annual report of the prisons ombudsman, said he was determined to ensure that there were changes in race relations inside prisons: \"You should be under no illusions about that.

Margaret Thatcher stood on her own for five minutes. It must be nervewracking to approach someone whose handbag is being auctioned on the net now for \u00a3101,000 - literally worth more than its weight in petrol. As she took her place in the crowd, I could see a familiar figure trying to force himself next to her. It was my dear old friend Michael Fabricant, but just as he got there, disaster struck. Lord Carrington intervened between them. Barbara Castle was there, glowering at Lady Thatcher and Mr Blair, neither of whom she cares for. It must be like \"Mad Dog\" Adair being made to choose between Gerry Adams and the Pope. Bob Carr, the premier of New South Wales, popped over to remind her that he had sent her a case of finest Hunter Valley red to thank her for insisting on Australian rather than French wine at some dinner. \"She told me she hadn't finished it yet,\" he said. \"Bad as that, is it?\" I asked. \"No, it's a fine wine to savour at length,\" he insisted. Mr Blair worked the crowd, chatting to John Major, Lady T, and Bob Hawke. There is a soothing balm in talking to other prime ministers: they have all been there and done that. He looked much cheerier after a few minutes. Then he and the lord chancellor made graceful speeches saying what a great place Australia was. The Aussie prime minister, John Howard, also made a graceful speech saying what a great place Australia was. Moments later he was in the crowd, and to my surprise and delight, stopped for a long chat with my old friend. \"Fabricant.\" \"Yeah, I can see what yer hair's made of. Back in God's own country, we call that a 'platypus rug'.\" \"No, prime minister, my name, it's Fabricant.\"",

Other bidders were more cautious with newcomer Versatel offering \u20ac200,000 for another of the licences while the top bids for the remaining three were all at the \u20ac100,000 level. Bidding is expected to quicken over the coming days but analysts believe the final tally could fall well short of the 20bn guilders (\u00a35.7bn) which some had expected. The two companies to pull out yesterday were Hutchison 3G Netherlands and Nogenta Swedish Acquisitions, which is owned by NTL. NTL said its decision reflected consolidation within the industry. France Telecom owns 25% of NTL and 80% of Dutchtone, another bidder. The Hutchison move is seen as confirmation that it, Holland's KPN Telecom and Japan's NTTDoCoMo plan to bid jointly for third generation licences across Europe. \"The withdrawals support our view that UMTS costs are unlikely to be as high as ther market had been anticipating. This is very positive for the sector,\" said Bear Stearns analyst Fanos Hira.",

Shares in Geo tumbled 117.5p yesterday to \u00a310.675, having peaked in March at just over \u00a334. </p> <p>Eli Reifman, executive director of Geo Interactive, said that the directors - who own a total of 55% of the Israel-based company - would not sell any further shares in the next year to \"provide a comfort level\" to the market. \"We don't believe there should be any other selling now as we don't believe the share price is where it should be,\" he added. </p> <p>The strategic partnership is expected to focus on Geo's mobile division which is developing video streaming technology for handsets. </p> <p>Video streaming compresses video signals - for example coverage of an event such as Wimbledon - and transmits them at high speed to PCs or mobile phone handsets. Geo is widely considered to be a leader in two-way video streaming. </p> <p>So far, however, Real Networks has dominated the market in video streaming to PCs. This week the American company announced that it had signed a deal with Nokia to target mobile phones - news which hit Geo's share price.Mr Reifman said that Geo was happy with current trading in all its divisions - mobile, broadcasting, messaging and web radio. First-half revenues had exceeded expectations and the cash burn was in line with the business plan. </p> <p>Analysts have forecast a cash burn of between $1.4m and $1.6m in the first half and twice that for the full year. Geo is expected to make its first pre-tax profit in 2000 of $3.9m, on revenues of $25m. </p> <p>Darren Lauber, an analyst with WestLB Panmure recommends Geo as a \"buy\" with a target price of \u00a323. He said the company's ability to focus its strategy and the strength of management had seen revenues leap from $950,000 in 1998 to $7.5m in 1999.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.emblaze.com\">Geo Interactive Media</a></p>",

Shares in Geo tumbled 117.5p yesterday to \u00a310.675, having peaked in March at just over \u00a334. Eli Reifman, executive director of Geo Interactive, said that the directors - who own a total of 55% of the Israel-based company - would not sell any further shares in the next year to \"provide a comfort level\" to the market. \"We don't believe there should be any other selling now as we don't believe the share price is where it should be,\" he added. The strategic partnership is expected to focus on Geo's mobile division which is developing video streaming technology for handsets. Video streaming compresses video signals - for example coverage of an event such as Wimbledon - and transmits them at high speed to PCs or mobile phone handsets. Geo is widely considered to be a leader in two-way video streaming. So far, however, Real Networks has dominated the market in video streaming to PCs. This week the American company announced that it had signed a deal with Nokia to target mobile phones - news which hit Geo's share price.Mr Reifman said that Geo was happy with current trading in all its divisions - mobile, broadcasting, messaging and web radio. First-half revenues had exceeded expectations and the cash burn was in line with the business plan. Analysts have forecast a cash burn of between $1.4m and $1.6m in the first half and twice that for the full year. Geo is expected to make its first pre-tax profit in 2000 of $3.9m, on revenues of $25m. Darren Lauber, an analyst with WestLB Panmure recommends Geo as a \"buy\" with a target price of \u00a323. He said the company's ability to focus its strategy and the strength of management had seen revenues leap from $950,000 in 1998 to $7.5m in 1999. Useful links Geo Interactive Media",

Mr Fischer said he favoured an elected president of Europe with the power to choose his or her cabinet. He implicitly rejected a European government formed from national administrations. \"What one does not want is a weak president...a figurehead,\" he told the constitutional affairs committee of the European parliament in Strasbourg. He suggested that the president of Europe could be chosen by means of electoral colleges of the sort that existed in the US and with the broad support of the majority of member states. As for the single currency, Mr Fischer called it the \"first step to a federation\". His remarks created a new headache for Tony Blair who last week sent out a stream of positive signals on Europe and announced a keynote speech in the autumn to define Britain's position. From now on, any move by the prime minister towards closer ties with the European Union risks being portrayed by his opponents as a step towards putting Britain at the mercy of a single, mighty European overlord. In his earlier speech, on May 12, Mr Fischer appeared to build a bridge to those such as President Jacques Chirac in France and Mr Blair in Britain who are either ideologically unwilling or politically unable to consider a federal Europe. He said he shared the view that \"nation states are realities that cannot simply be erased\". \"The existing concept of a federal European state replacing the old nation states and their democracies as the new sovereign power...ignores the established realities in Europe,\" he said.

The ministers in his proposed cabinet, though chosen by the president of Europe, would need to win the confidence of a new, two-chamber European parliament which would have strong links to the member states. Mr Fischer said there was no conflict between his ideas and the EU's short-term objective of agreeing a new treaty in Nice, where EU leaders are due to meet in December. Mr Schr\u00f6der's officials have called for a further round of inter-governmental talks in the EU to discuss \"big issues\" of the sort raised by the foreign minister.

      "bodyText": "An Amsterdam-based human trafficking network, which is said to have spirited hundreds of illegal immigrants to Britain from Iran, has been broken up and 60 people arrested, Dutch police revealed yesterday. The move comes barely two weeks after the bodies of 58 Chinese people trying to get to Britain from Rotterdam were found in the back of a lorry at Dover and underscores the Netherlands' role as a key staging post for immigrants. After a secret 10-month operation which targeted the organisation's Dutch-based leaders and fixers, police arrested 54 Iranians, three Iraqis, two Algerians and one Romanian. A spokeswoman for the Dutch justice ministry yesterday said that at least eight people had already been sentenced, while 11 more were waiting to appear in court. \"The investigation is still ongoing so we can't say much about it. The people who have been sentenced so far have been convicted for drugs offences and faking passports.\" Nobody has so far been charged with human trafficking itself.

There is no suggestion so far that any reached Britain. Officials in Brussels said yesterday they were delighted with the role played by Olaf, the European commission's new anti-fraud office, in ending one of the biggest scams of its kind. Scores of arrests have been made in France and Italy after investigators discovered that more than 16,000 tonnes of supposedly pure butter was sold for more than \u20ac45m (\u00a328.4m); EU subsidies were obtained as if the butter was real, and Olaf is still trying to determine the precise loss. Olaf helped coordinate investigations by authorities in France, Italy and Belgium under its mandate to protect the \u00a355bn community budget from fraud and organised crime. Officials were bribed in 1997-99 to turn a blind eye to the bogus butter, which was made mainly from chemical additives, beef tallow and oil intended for cosmetics and other non-food uses. Much went into food production but large quantities were seized. \"In one case, a product seized in a Belgian factory which had originated in Italy contained no trace of milk or milk products,\" Olaf said. Butter is subsidised in the form of export refunds, when the product is exported outside the union, or with aid towards the processing of butter used in baking and sold in the home market. The investigation began in 1999 when the anti-Mafia branch of the Naples prosecutor's office discovered that a gang of the Camorra, the Naples Mafia, had set up a \"holding group\" that had become a major producer of butter for industrial use in Italy. Some 70 searches have been carried out at businesses and homes in Italy, France and Belgium in the past few weeks and there have been numerous arrests in Italy and France. Created last year to replace a previous anti-fraud body, Olaf operates independently of the the commission under a German prosecutor chosen by Neil Kinnock, the commissioner in charge of administrative reform. Earlier this year Olaf stepped up cooperation with Italy's elite anti-Mafia unit to clamp down on scams involving tobacco, olive oil and alcohol, where large slices of generous EU subsidies are creamed off by organised gangs.",

      "body": "<p>It is Mrs Yusof who comes to the door, in the hours after her daughter Sufiah is found safe and unhurt, two weeks after disappearing from Oxford. She is holding back tears, inclining her head to convey her relief and letting her shoulders droop, just a little, under the effort of hanging on. </p> <p>In the background of the family's Coventry home, her husband Farooq can be seen smiling broadly and steering a concerned relative towards the door. When he joins his wife on the porch he seems very upright by her side, still smiling, expertly convivial. She rests her headscarfed brow against his shoulder. \"We are very relieved,\" he says. \"Very, very relieved. I just want to put my arms around her.\" </p> <p>But Farooq Yusof will not be embracing his daughter just yet. After she was found yesterday afternoon, Thames Valley police took the unusual step of revealing that Sufiah had requested that her whereabouts should remain secret - even from her parents. This detail seemed a damning coda to a vituperative email she had sent her family earlier in the week. Her father had responded to it by suggesting Sufiah had gone off the rails, had suffered a breakdown. Others suggested she had never sounded more sane. </p> <p>\"I've finally had enough of 15 years of physical and emotional abuse,\" wrote Sufiah. She vowed never to return to the \"living hell\" of home. \"I see you've taken the liberty of running to the national newspapers with the story of how your 'innocent and naive daughter' has run off from a 'happy home' with some nasty socialists and boyfriends . . . anyway, this is a practical email. I want, first thing tomorrow, to read about how I'm safe with relatives or family friends in Scotland or London. Otherwise I'll go to the press with my side of the story first thing tomorrow afternoon, I mean it.\" </p> <p>But Sufiah didn't need to go to the press. In the same email she told her side of the story, accusing her father of ruining his five children's lives by hothousing them, of exploiting her older brother's tennis skills for money, of labelling her \"Crybaby Soo-Fi\" as part of his motivation technique. Worst of all, she said that when she was 11, two years before she started her maths degree at Oxford University and when everything was apparently fine, she had twice tried to kill herself. \"Maybe the public will have a different view of you as devoted parents . . . I'm not Crybaby Soo-Fi any more.\" </p> <p>Sufiah disappeared just after finishing her exams for a masters on June 22. She failed to board a train from Oxford to the family home in Coventry, where she was expected to return for the holidays. Her email came in response to a disquieting interview her father had given to the Times on Tuesday. \"It's highly improbable that we will ever see her again,\" said the 43-year-old researcher, a former prodigy himself. \"The police investigations won't come to anything.\" He talked of third parties and conspiracies. \"They have disengaged her from her strength, which is her family and specifically myself. They have got into her mind. Brainwashing is I think the correct term . . . Even if we get her back it won't be the same Sufiah.\" </p> <p>Brainwashing - a word that has often been applied to the Yusof children, all of whom have been taught at home by Farooq and their mother Halimahton, all of whom have shown precocious ability at maths and tennis. As his wife sat in silence and wept for her missing daughter, and two of the children sat in submissive silence, Yusof explained how the mysterious third party was not simply damaging Sufiah, but was also set on ruining his grand project. \"The goals were to prove that you can accelerate children's learning process. This century is about knowledge-based information and we have shown that one can nurture and accelerate learning programmes.\" He said that whatever happened to Sufiah, the Yusof family would not be beaten. \"We are going to defeat their agenda and redouble our efforts to defeat them by producing more Sufiahs. We will work even harder to attain the goals we were aiming for.\" </p> <p> The Yusof family first made the headlines in 1997. \"A 12-year-old girl is a step away from becoming one of Britain's youngest university students,\" ran the story. There were already comparisons with the child prodigy, Ruth Lawrence. Sufiah needed a top grade in further mathematics to win a place at Oxford. \"Barring disaster, she should get a grade A,\" declared Yusof at the time. By September of that year, there she was at the women-only St Hilda's college, 13 years old and looking forward to life as an undergraduate. She had managed to beat Ruth Lawrence to a mortar board by a few months. </p> <p>Farooq, who was born in Pakistan, spoke of his hopes for the rest of the family. As usual, Halimahton remained silent in the background. He said that Iskander, who was then 10, and Aisha, 14, would soon join Sufiah at Oxford. </p> <p>Both Farooq and Halimahton Yusof gave up their jobs as researchers to devote themselves to teaching their children. He talked about the paralysis of the education system that resulted in most British children sleepwalking through their early years because they hadn't been taught to think. He complained that other children didn't exercise their critical faculties. The world, according to Yusof, was materialistic, vain and shallow. \"We felt that the children were growing up in an environment giving them the wrong messages . . . the public is programmed for disposability, novelty and continual change.\" Programming was a word that came up again and again with Yusof. He said he detested programming. </p> <p>He never claimed his children were geniuses, not even gifted. It was just that they had been taught properly - primarily by him. He claimed he could teach virtually any child in the same way, and that he would write a book about his methods. There were strict rules - the house had to be cold to improve concentration, Islamic prayers had to be said first thing in the morning, followed by stretching and breathing exercises. Fresh air was essential for a fresh mind. Television and pop music were banned. </p> <p>For someone so bright, interviews with Sufiah were surprisingly bland. She didn't talk to the press, she gave statements. \"I am looking forward to starting my time here . . . I want to join the university tennis team and Oxford has wonderful facilities for this.\" Her father revealed that at 12 Sufiah had been among the country's top eight junior players. </p> <p>She was asked how her friends felt about her going off to university. \"Of course, I have different friends, so they have different opinions,\" she reasoned. \"But most of them are quite pleased for me and I think on the whole they have expressed very positive reactions.\" </p> <p>Laura Paskell-Brown, who spearheaded the tuition fee protest at Oxford 18 months ago, remembers Sufiah as an inhibited little girl. \"I always saw her alone. I never saw her with anyone else. I met her because she was part of the anti-tuition fees movement. She was always quite quiet. Depressed isn't the word I'd use. But at that age you can't really have a normal university life and go out socialising like everyone else.\" </p> <p>By now the family had so many stories to tell that they asked the Northamptonshire News Agency to mediate for them. Every one of Yusof's children seemed to come complete with their very own record, their own headline. \"The youngest member of Britain's brainiest family has mastered the mysteries of A-level maths - at the age of five,\" ran one typical story. </p> <p>But there were hiccups along the way. Yusof had told the world that his children would study at Oxford. Not all of them did. Iskander was burdened by failure when he only achieved a grade B in further maths at the age of 11. He and his sister, Aisha, who was a late developer at 15, were relegated to Warwick University. But even here there were records to be claimed - they became the youngest brother and sister to study together at the same university. </p> <p>The family faced practical problems, though. They had to divide themselves between Warwick and Oxford. They rented a house opposite the university in Coventry, and Sufiah would go home for holidays. </p> <p> The Farooqs live in a detached house obscured from a busy road by six fir trees and overgrown foliage, directly opposite the main entrance to Warwick university. \"Tarl-Lea\" reads the name plate fixed between the green garage door and the frosted glass of the porch through which can be glimpsed the twee furnishings of a comfortable family home: a tasselled lamp, an over-stuffed sofa and a slightly garish carpet. </p> <p>A neighbour whose children have played with the Yusofs says: \"My child is four and Sufiah is 15. But my child is the more sociable. They have never allowed the children to develop socially. When they come and play they want to run around and make a noise, but Halima is very strict with them.\" </p> <p>But socialising has never been a priority for the Yusofs. When the two children went to Warwick, Yusof continued to expand on his philosophy of learning. \"We offer an opportunity which gives opportunities for self-fulfilment and Aisha cannot have a boyfriend. That would not be considered as being to her optimal benefit.\" He insisted that there was more to the ethos than achievement. \"It's all about love and understanding - praising what they do, giving value to it and taking a pride in it.\" He added: \"Most people's lives are shoddy, shifting and unstable.\" </p> <p>The family became role models for accelerated learners. Edward Chitham of the National Association for Gifted Children says, \"No family on our books has got anywhere near this sort of record.\" </p> <p>Warwick University says it took more than a year to negotiate the arrival of Aisha and Iskander. Peter Dunn, university press officer, says Warwick laid down the law to the Yusofs. \"Our edict was that after they started here there would be no media attention until they finished, and the parents agreed to this. We also insisted that the family take up residence near the campus. We didn't think it was appropriate for them to live on campus as normal students.\" </p> <p>Dunn believes that university has been good for the two children. After all the publicity of their early years, it has allowed them to recover their anonymity. He says Sufiah's brother and sister are both keeping up with their fellow students but have not raced ahead. </p> <p>David Robertson, who was dean of the Oxford college from which Ruth Lawrence graduated, thinks, with the benefit of hindsight, that university is the wrong place for prodigies. He says they \"can only get through universities by effectively not being there. They do not experience undergraduate life: having been cheated of the joys as well as the tribulations of the later school years, they go on to skip another formative experience.\" </p> <p>There have been many problems with the adolescence of Sufiah Yusof, trapped between two worlds, neither an adult nor a child. She seems to have embraced some of the adult experiences - becoming a member of various societies and attending meetings of the Socialist Workers' Party. This, says Yusof, is where things began to go wrong, when she became contaminated by outside influences. </p> <p>Yesterday, soon after it was announced that she was safe, her mother told reporters outside her home: \"We are gathering our thoughts and saying our prayers. At least we know she is alive.\" It was one of the first times we have heard her speak. </p> <p>Yusof said he was relieved she was safe, would wait for her to come home in her own time, and repeated that he believed there was a third party involved. \"It's in the hands of the relevant authorities... obviously she's scared.\" Was there any truth in Sufiah's allegation that he had abused her? \"There is no validity in any of this,\" he said. </p> <p>Has all of this trouble made him rethink his teaching methods? \" Our teaching methods,\" his wife answered abruptly. Halimahton said Yusof has been \"out of his mind with worry. He's been wandering up and down the streets looking for her. The other children have hardly known he is here.\" He held up his hand to stop her going any further. She mumbled to a stop. \"...Why should we have to justify ourselves as parents?\" </p> <p>Yusof took over and beamed his big smile. \"We are a fun-loving family enjoying life,\" he said. \"What else is there?\"</p> <p>\u0095 Additional reporting: Merope Mills</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is Mrs Yusof who comes to the door, in the hours after her daughter Sufiah is found safe and unhurt, two weeks after disappearing from Oxford. She is holding back tears, inclining her head to convey her relief and letting her shoulders droop, just a little, under the effort of hanging on. In the background of the family's Coventry home, her husband Farooq can be seen smiling broadly and steering a concerned relative towards the door. When he joins his wife on the porch he seems very upright by her side, still smiling, expertly convivial. She rests her headscarfed brow against his shoulder. \"We are very relieved,\" he says. \"Very, very relieved. I just want to put my arms around her.\" But Farooq Yusof will not be embracing his daughter just yet. After she was found yesterday afternoon, Thames Valley police took the unusual step of revealing that Sufiah had requested that her whereabouts should remain secret - even from her parents. This detail seemed a damning coda to a vituperative email she had sent her family earlier in the week. Her father had responded to it by suggesting Sufiah had gone off the rails, had suffered a breakdown. Others suggested she had never sounded more sane. \"I've finally had enough of 15 years of physical and emotional abuse,\" wrote Sufiah. She vowed never to return to the \"living hell\" of home. \"I see you've taken the liberty of running to the national newspapers with the story of how your 'innocent and naive daughter' has run off from a 'happy home' with some nasty socialists and boyfriends . . . anyway, this is a practical email. I want, first thing tomorrow, to read about how I'm safe with relatives or family friends in Scotland or London. Otherwise I'll go to the press with my side of the story first thing tomorrow afternoon, I mean it.\" But Sufiah didn't need to go to the press. In the same email she told her side of the story, accusing her father of ruining his five children's lives by hothousing them, of exploiting her older brother's tennis skills for money, of labelling her \"Crybaby Soo-Fi\" as part of his motivation technique. Worst of all, she said that when she was 11, two years before she started her maths degree at Oxford University and when everything was apparently fine, she had twice tried to kill herself. \"Maybe the public will have a different view of you as devoted parents . . . I'm not Crybaby Soo-Fi any more.\" Sufiah disappeared just after finishing her exams for a masters on June 22. She failed to board a train from Oxford to the family home in Coventry, where she was expected to return for the holidays. Her email came in response to a disquieting interview her father had given to the Times on Tuesday. \"It's highly improbable that we will ever see her again,\" said the 43-year-old researcher, a former prodigy himself. \"The police investigations won't come to anything.\" He talked of third parties and conspiracies. \"They have disengaged her from her strength, which is her family and specifically myself. They have got into her mind. Brainwashing is I think the correct term . . . Even if we get her back it won't be the same Sufiah.\" Brainwashing - a word that has often been applied to the Yusof children, all of whom have been taught at home by Farooq and their mother Halimahton, all of whom have shown precocious ability at maths and tennis.

There were strict rules - the house had to be cold to improve concentration, Islamic prayers had to be said first thing in the morning, followed by stretching and breathing exercises.

She didn't talk to the press, she gave statements. \"I am looking forward to starting my time here . . .

      "byline": "John Carvel, social affairs editor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>An outright ban on NHS consultants increasing their income through private work was proposed yesterday by the Commons health select committee as the long-term answer to unfairness in the health service. </p> <p>The report, pushed through by Labour MPs against opposition from the Conservatives, raised suspicions that some consultants \"are driven by perverse incentives into maintaining long NHS waiting lists in order to stimulate lucrative private practice\". The MPs said they could not prove this charge, but concluded: \"What is indisputable is that NHS patients wait longer than private patients, and that private earnings are highest in those specialties where NHS waiting times are longest.\" </p> <p>The tone of the report was a lot more hostile to the private sector than ministers had been over recent weeks. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, has said he wants to use private hospitals to reduce NHS waiting lists. He also suggested it was not possible to force consultants to abandon private practice, although merit bonuses might in future be directed to those who worked only for the NHS. </p> <p>In contrast, the MPs said it was indefensible the system allowed patients of equal clinical need to go ahead of others because of their ability to pay. </p> <p>\"Therefore we believe the government should make it a long-term objective that consultants in the NHS do not undertake private practice...The NHS was founded on the principle of equity: it should put that principle into practice.\" </p> <p>The MPs noted an argument from the British Medical Association that a ban on private work might make some consultants leave the NHS. But other consultants might decide it was in their best interests to work solely in the NHS. The government should research the consequences and work out incentives to keep the best consultants in the NHS, the MPs said.

      "bodyText": "An outright ban on NHS consultants increasing their income through private work was proposed yesterday by the Commons health select committee as the long-term answer to unfairness in the health service. The report, pushed through by Labour MPs against opposition from the Conservatives, raised suspicions that some consultants \"are driven by perverse incentives into maintaining long NHS waiting lists in order to stimulate lucrative private practice\". The MPs said they could not prove this charge, but concluded: \"What is indisputable is that NHS patients wait longer than private patients, and that private earnings are highest in those specialties where NHS waiting times are longest.\" The tone of the report was a lot more hostile to the private sector than ministers had been over recent weeks. Alan Milburn, the health secretary, has said he wants to use private hospitals to reduce NHS waiting lists. He also suggested it was not possible to force consultants to abandon private practice, although merit bonuses might in future be directed to those who worked only for the NHS. In contrast, the MPs said it was indefensible the system allowed patients of equal clinical need to go ahead of others because of their ability to pay. \"Therefore we believe the government should make it a long-term objective that consultants in the NHS do not undertake private practice...The NHS was founded on the principle of equity: it should put that principle into practice.\" The MPs noted an argument from the British Medical Association that a ban on private work might make some consultants leave the NHS. But other consultants might decide it was in their best interests to work solely in the NHS. The government should research the consequences and work out incentives to keep the best consultants in the NHS, the MPs said. Their report was published after a three-week inquiry into the contracts of the 25,000 NHS consultants. It found that their average NHS salary was \u00a368,000, but about two-thirds also undertook private practice. Last year their average private earnings were \u00a310,790, but there was a huge variation in the income potential of specialities, ranging from \u00a375,413 for plastic surgeons to \u00a35,000 for pathologists. Since the NHS began in 1948, full-time consultants have been entitled to increase their earnings by up to 10% by taking on private practice. Those on \"maximum part-time\" contracts gave up one eleventh of their salaries in return for the freedom to earn as much as they like privately, as long as they fulfilled their NHS commitments. About 70% work on whole-time contracts, the remainder as maximum part timers. The report said hospital trusts did not enforce the 10% rule for whole-timers and did not collect enough information to keep track of the hours worked within the NHS by maximum part-timers. David Hinchliffe, the committee's Labour chairman, said: \"There would be problems in stopping consultants from working in the NHS and in private sectors, but I think there are generational differences. Medical students and junior doctors I have talked to agree that it is an unfair situation. I think the government has to take a long-term view.

But the writing was on the wall long before the first glass was hurled in Belgium. </p> <p>The last rites to England's dream were administered in Zurich yesterday, but it was always going to be an uphill struggle - raising questions as to why England continued to pursue 2006 over the last three years knowing that it did not have backing from the two main organisations in world football: Uefa, the sport's European governing body, and Fifa, which is responsible for world football. </p> <p>It was a bit like a political candidate standing for election without the support of their national or constituency party. </p> <p>From the outset, England entered the race on weak moral ground. Soon after Euro 96, the Football Association said it intended to bid for the World Cup, winning support from Labour and the Tories. </p> <p>The Germans, who had also announced their intention to bid, cried foul: a gentleman's agreement had been drawn up with England - in return for German support for Euro 96, England had agreed to back Germany for the World Cup in 2006. </p> <p>The deal had been agreed between Sir Bert Millichip, former FA chairman, and Lennart Johansson, president of Uefa. But English 2006 officials, led by the campaign director Alec McGivan, said there was no written proof of any such agreement and that it had all been a misunderstanding. </p> <p>Privately, football and government officials agree that there was such a deal. England's decision to back out was to have disastrous consequences for the campaign. </p> <p>Johansson, who is also a member of Fifa's executive committee which voted in Zurich yesterday, was annoyed at the attitude of the English. He insisted that Uefa, which has eight votes on the committee, should back Germany. </p> <p>Only David Will, the Scottish representative on Uefa, was persuaded to back England in yesterday's vote but that still meant seven crucial votes were ruled out. A source said: \"There was a fundamental weakness from the start of England's campaign. We all knew about the gentleman's agreement and Johansson was part of it. He was in the room when the deal was done and he was virtually being accused by the English of being a liar. It's not a very good idea to alienate someone so powerful within world football. </p> <p>\"It also meant that England were seen as bad sports who could not honour their word. That did not go down too well with Fifa officials.\" </p> <p>The sports minister, Kate Hoey, is also said to be annoyed at the backtracking on the gentleman's agreement, one of the main reasons she has not wholeheartedly given her support to the 2006 campaign. </p> <p>\"It's against everything she stands for. It showed that the English campaign lacked moral fibre,\" said a government source. </p> <p>In addition to missing out on the crucial support of Uefa, England suffered another blow when Sepp Blatter, Fifa's president, said it was time for a country from Africa to host the World Cup for the first time. </p> <p>Without backing from football's established organisations, England's 2006 officials pushed on relentlessly, basing their campaign around trying to draw support from Fifa delegates outside Europe. </p> <p>Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst, two 1966 World Cup heroes, were brought in as the public face of the campaign and spent three years travelling the globe visiting dozens of countries. </p> <p>The former sports minister Tony Banks became the prime minister's special envoy on the campaign and it soon became apparent that nothing would stand in the way of the quest to land the tournament. Lavish dinners were held in London, one in the company of Prince Charles, while expensive parties were thrown at Fifa meetings and other football events. </p> <p>During the 1998 World Cup in France, England 2006 officials hired a luxurious villa.

Fifa delegates also attended matches and enjoyed hospitality in England. </p> <p>The English bid also focused, at great cost, on developing football in countries where votes could be won. Training ses sions were held in countries such as Trinidad and the former Aston Villa striker Peter Withe was appointed manager of Thailand's national team in an attempt to win favour with their Fifa delegate. </p> <p>In one of the most cynical chapters of the campaign, Manchester United were allowed to withdraw from the FA Cup to compete in the world club championship in Brazil this year. It was an attempt to win three south American Fifa votes but proved a public relations disaster. </p> <p>Among all four competing countries and Fifa officials, it soon became apparent that the English hosted the best parties and offered the best hospitality and would do anything to curry favour with delegates. But that counted for little when it came down to football politics. </p> <p>Former 2006 employees claim huge amounts of money were wasted on ensuring that English officials stayed at the best hotels and travelled in luxury. One said: \"There was no doubt that all those who represented the campaign wanted the best. They were not real political animals and could never quite get their heads around the lobbying that such a contest needs but they all had a great time. </p> <p>\"We were concerned at how much money was being spent on hotels, weekends away and during tournaments. I remember during France 98 most of the campaign team stayed in the villa. There was no need for all of them to be there.\" </p> <p>The bid cost just over \u00a310m, almost double that spent by any other country. Most of that came from the Football Association and the Premier League but just over \u00a33m came from the national lottery. </p> <p>A source said: \"You have to ask why football, which is the richest sport in the country, was given lottery money.

That was a real turning point.\" Soon after, Jack Warner of the Concacaf federation, which represents north and central America and the Caribbean and was considered one of England's main supporters, advised England to withdraw. It was good advice but an early withdrawal would have been too embarrassing. </p> <p>In the end, the violence proved a convenient get-out clause. Few within international football actually expected England to win the 2006 contest but it give English organisers a chance to use the hooliganism as the perfect excuse for the demise of their bid.

      "body": "<p>In Britain, supposedly the European model for flexible working, they would be aghast: highly skilled German engineers are working six-hour shifts with just a 2-minute \"comfort break\" to produce ultra-sophisticated components for the central fuselage of the new Eurofighter combat aircraft. </p> <p>Germany along with France are reviled among many British politicians as the epitome of a rigid labour market, and this work pattern seems the ultimate in bureaucratic organisation. But at the DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (Dasa) plant here, once home to the Messerschmitt fighters that took on the RAF in 1940, the 1,900 staff are palpably happy. They enjoy a 32-hour week and long holidays - and the management rejoices in productivity and efficiency gains. </p> <p>The obvious relaxation among the employees, many of them in shorts and baseball caps, and degree of precision engineering emanating from glass-enclosed, robot-controlled machine tools bear out the conclusions of a recent Trades Union Congress survey on the \"flexibility myth\". </p> <p>This found that, despite the conservative analysis that Europe's inflexible labour markets, made worse by costly social protection and high employment taxes, are the root cause of continental joblessness, the euro-zone economy \"is not the basket case its critics allege\". The case is buttressed by the looming dispute at Peugeot's main British plant at Ryton, Coventry, over weekend shift-working. </p> <p>Workplace productivity in France and Germany is 20% higher than in Britain, while the French have 40% more capital behind them per hour worked. In Germany, where the shock of reunification in the past decade has seen jobs lost outweighed by jobs gained, productivity growth is higher than in Britain, even though collective bargaining covers 92% of workplaces compared with just 47% in Britain. </p> <p>The German federal labour office said yesterday that moderate wage inreases and modernisation of production processes helped cut the jobless rate to 9.1% in June. </p> <p>Lutz Bertling, the Augsburg plant's director, has turned the traditional German virtues of hard work and discipline and the new flexibility to his advantage. He has introduced a pattern of four six-hour shifts in order to keep computerised machinery working 24 hours a day six days a week and raise productive \"uptime\" from last year's 55% to 80% next year. </p> <p>Apart from that comfort break, his engineers stay on the line for the full six hours. It means working one Saturday in four but, says Mr Bertling, the result is a \"win-win situation\" for employees and company. </p> <p>\"It enables the staff to plan their day so their partner can go out to work too, and they're home in time to pick up the kids,\" he says. \"They work 32 hours but get paid for 35 hours and we can increase both production and efficiency.\" </p> <p>Under his model an engineer can \"bank\" up to 200 extra hours of work a year and can take at least 120 hours of that in the form of extra holidays and if he or she cannot take all of that they get 15 \"free\" hours credited to their account. The only snag is that they can't take any of their \"time account\" in extra cash - unless they quit Dasa. </p> <p>The effect is to reduce overtime, the traditional source of extra income in Britain, to 2.5% of working time and to enable the plant to notch up a 30% increase in machine operating hours or 6,500 hours per year. So far, however, costs have been cut by just 6%, but Mr Bertling is keen to extend his model throughout the plant and win bigger gains. </p> <p>\"The works council, which is wholly IG Metall (Germany's biggest union), is dead against; but the employees are completely in favour and so are we,\" he says, pointing to a board showing a production unit's monthly scores against targets for output, waste, accidents and breakdowns. </p> <p>The new work scheme has been negotiated, not imposed. One effect has been to increase employment at the plant, where the workforce reached 2,250 at the peak of Tornado production before falling back to 1,500. The extra staff are required to keep the plant running 24 hours a day and, as Eurofighter output increases towards its peak of 55 planes a year, even more labour will be hired. </p> <p>Dasa's experience in Augsburg bears out the growing trend in Germany to negotiate in-house, away from the central bargaining process and the spotlight of publicity, a series of working patterns that offers flexibility and productivity gains. And this within an overall system that offers a relatively high minimum wage, employment rights and organised consultation, all anathema to many corporate executives and politicians in Britain. </p> <p>The TUC says its own analysis \"shows that deregulation has little to offer the European economies and that the further modest advances in employee rights currently being advanced in Europe cannot automatically be dismissed as burdens on business that threaten competitiveness.\" </p> <p>At its conference last year even the CBI noted that \"there is not a simple UK versus the continent distinction but instead different strengths and weaknesses in each country ... One policy cannot fit all.\" </p> <p>Labour MP Denis MacShane and Chris Brewster, professor of management at Cranfield university, said in a recent Fabian Society pamphlet: \"The UK is not the leading nation in Europe in any of the flexible working practices - except for the family-destroying practice of excessive overtime.\" </p> <p>Britons work on average 12% longer hours than French people. </p> <p>It is an argument that, as the French take on the EU presidency and Britain begins to debate more fully the merits and demerits of the euro, we will be hearing more of in the months to come.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Britain, supposedly the European model for flexible working, they would be aghast: highly skilled German engineers are working six-hour shifts with just a 2-minute \"comfort break\" to produce ultra-sophisticated components for the central fuselage of the new Eurofighter combat aircraft. Germany along with France are reviled among many British politicians as the epitome of a rigid labour market, and this work pattern seems the ultimate in bureaucratic organisation. But at the DaimlerChrysler Aerospace (Dasa) plant here, once home to the Messerschmitt fighters that took on the RAF in 1940, the 1,900 staff are palpably happy. They enjoy a 32-hour week and long holidays - and the management rejoices in productivity and efficiency gains. The obvious relaxation among the employees, many of them in shorts and baseball caps, and degree of precision engineering emanating from glass-enclosed, robot-controlled machine tools bear out the conclusions of a recent Trades Union Congress survey on the \"flexibility myth\". This found that, despite the conservative analysis that Europe's inflexible labour markets, made worse by costly social protection and high employment taxes, are the root cause of continental joblessness, the euro-zone economy \"is not the basket case its critics allege\". The case is buttressed by the looming dispute at Peugeot's main British plant at Ryton, Coventry, over weekend shift-working. Workplace productivity in France and Germany is 20% higher than in Britain, while the French have 40% more capital behind them per hour worked. In Germany, where the shock of reunification in the past decade has seen jobs lost outweighed by jobs gained, productivity growth is higher than in Britain, even though collective bargaining covers 92% of workplaces compared with just 47% in Britain. The German federal labour office said yesterday that moderate wage inreases and modernisation of production processes helped cut the jobless rate to 9.1% in June. Lutz Bertling, the Augsburg plant's director, has turned the traditional German virtues of hard work and discipline and the new flexibility to his advantage. He has introduced a pattern of four six-hour shifts in order to keep computerised machinery working 24 hours a day six days a week and raise productive \"uptime\" from last year's 55% to 80% next year. Apart from that comfort break, his engineers stay on the line for the full six hours. It means working one Saturday in four but, says Mr Bertling, the result is a \"win-win situation\" for employees and company. \"It enables the staff to plan their day so their partner can go out to work too, and they're home in time to pick up the kids,\" he says. \"They work 32 hours but get paid for 35 hours and we can increase both production and efficiency.\" Under his model an engineer can \"bank\" up to 200 extra hours of work a year and can take at least 120 hours of that in the form of extra holidays and if he or she cannot take all of that they get 15 \"free\" hours credited to their account. The only snag is that they can't take any of their \"time account\" in extra cash - unless they quit Dasa. The effect is to reduce overtime, the traditional source of extra income in Britain, to 2.5% of working time and to enable the plant to notch up a 30% increase in machine operating hours or 6,500 hours per year. So far, however, costs have been cut by just 6%, but Mr Bertling is keen to extend his model throughout the plant and win bigger gains. \"The works council, which is wholly IG Metall (Germany's biggest union), is dead against; but the employees are completely in favour and so are we,\" he says, pointing to a board showing a production unit's monthly scores against targets for output, waste, accidents and breakdowns. The new work scheme has been negotiated, not imposed. One effect has been to increase employment at the plant, where the workforce reached 2,250 at the peak of Tornado production before falling back to 1,500. The extra staff are required to keep the plant running 24 hours a day and, as Eurofighter output increases towards its peak of 55 planes a year, even more labour will be hired. Dasa's experience in Augsburg bears out the growing trend in Germany to negotiate in-house, away from the central bargaining process and the spotlight of publicity, a series of working patterns that offers flexibility and productivity gains. And this within an overall system that offers a relatively high minimum wage, employment rights and organised consultation, all anathema to many corporate executives and politicians in Britain. The TUC says its own analysis \"shows that deregulation has little to offer the European economies and that the further modest advances in employee rights currently being advanced in Europe cannot automatically be dismissed as burdens on business that threaten competitiveness.\" At its conference last year even the CBI noted that \"there is not a simple UK versus the continent distinction but instead different strengths and weaknesses in each country ... One policy cannot fit all.\" Labour MP Denis MacShane and Chris Brewster, professor of management at Cranfield university, said in a recent Fabian Society pamphlet: \"The UK is not the leading nation in Europe in any of the flexible working practices - except for the family-destroying practice of excessive overtime.\" Britons work on average 12% longer hours than French people. It is an argument that, as the French take on the EU presidency and Britain begins to debate more fully the merits and demerits of the euro, we will be hearing more of in the months to come.",

Franz is the prototype of a winner.\" A debate in the lower house of parliament was interrupted for an announcement of Germany's victory. Beckenbauer said the outcome \"should be seen as greater than that of [Germany's] World Cup victories in 1974 and 1990. \"Germany will be a magnificent host.\" The tournament will be staged at a psychologically important moment for a country which is once again starting to assert its strength. The final is expected to be played in the new capital of Berlin and by 2006 work on transforming the city will have been largely finished. J\u00fcrgen R\u00f6ber, the coach of the city's premier side, Hertha BSC, said: \"Berlin above all will profit from this decision.\" Beckenbauer had argued that the fact that West Germany had hosted the 1974 World Cup was irrelevant because of its subsequent reunification with the former East Germany. \"People in the eastern bloc were not able to come then. This time everybody will be welcome,\" said the former sweeper. The main task now is for Germany to build a side that can get into the final stages of the competition. It put on a woeful performance at Euro 2000 and was eliminated at the group stage. Germany's new coach-designate, Christoph Daum, who is renowned for down-to-earth, Brian Clough-like comments, said the watchword should be: \"Celebrate for a day, then roll up our sleeves.\"",

Yesterday the Bank of England's monetary policy committee left interest rates on hold, for the fifth month in a row. The decision barely raised a flicker in the financial markets. </p> <p>Little wonder. Yesterday's outcome can have surprised no one. The most recent data from retailing, the housing market and on earnings have all been on the soft side. The pound has steadied on the foreign exchanges after slipping from its May peaks.

Indeed, one of the few talking points from the minutes of this month's meeting is likely to be whether the decision was unanimous or if not just how many were opposed. </p> <p>It may however be too early to start looking for a rate cut. There are still some in the City who believe the MPC has one more interest rate rise left in the locker. Points of potential concern are the rate at which the economy grew in the second quarter and whether sterling might start wobbling again. There remains a cloud, too, in the shape of the US economy. Will the Federal Reserve be able to engineer a soft landing or will 10 years of growth end with a bump? </p> <p>But the balance of the debate now appears to lie with those who believe that, although the next move in interest rates is likely to be downward, policy looks likely to remain on hold for some time. The pound may be too high for British manufacturers exporting to the euro zone but the authorities are unlikely to be persuaded there is anything to be gained from an exchange rate target. On the other side of the equation the outlook for interest rates and inflation should be sufficiently stable to suit most corporate economists. A competitive exchange rate against the euro may be beyond the MPC's touch for the time being - though stronger euroland growth and the European Central Bank may help out on that front over the coming months. But two out of three is not bad. </p> <p><strong> Dutch auction </strong><br> </p> <p> The outcome of the Netherlands' auction of third generation mobile phone licences which got under way yesterday will be eagerly anticipated. The debate about the best way to allocate such licences has been a topic of furious debate within the industry ever since the British process realised considerably more than the seller, the government, or the buyers anticipated. </p> <p>The outcome of that process provoked fears that the industry was having to pay too much. That in turn led to concerns the telecoms companies would either slow down the pace of investment in the new networks or seek to pass on the costs to consumers through higher prices. </p> <p>Not every one has gone the auction route. The French, for example, have opted for a beauty contest approach. Bidders' plans will be studied. The government will decide which companies will get the four licences on offer then each company will have to stump up 4.95bn euro (\u00a33bn). Again, unlike Britain which opted for a lump sum approach to payment (thus making management of the debt market trickier this year than it would have been), France has decided that the successful companies will have to pay half the fee within two years and the balance can be spread over the remaining 13 years of the licence. </p> <p>Although Holland has gone for the auction approach, it is doing so with rather fewer contenders than entered the British bidding process. In fact, there are just six bidders for five licences after two potential contenders pulled out at the last moment. Some observers believe the bidding - initially expected to last four to six weeks - could be over more quickly than had been anticipated. The thinking is that the five contenders who already have mobile phone businesses in Holland will be able to outbid the only newcomer in the field because their existing operations will mean they will need to put in less investment. </p> <p>Estimates of the amount of money the Netherlands auction will raise vary widely but if the process ends quickly and the proceeds fall significantly short of the top end of expectations - which is in the region of 20bn guilders (\u00a35.7bn) - it could have a profound influence on other auctions to come, particularly the one with (potentially) the biggest prizes: Germany. </p> <p>Although the bidding there will be keen because of the size of the market, the German finance ministry will start to feel a tad nervous if it becomes apparent that only a relatively small number of players believe that they have a chance of winning one of the licences on offer and that even those are getting harder-headed about just how much they are prepared to pay. </p> <p>A few months ago the question was whether companies could afford to stay out of the auctions.

But in Volkswagen's case the court yesterday upheld the commission's original findings - which painted a picture of a highly organised campaign to stop motorists buying its cars outside their own country.</p> <p>In a series of raids on VW offices around Europe, the commission uncovered evidence that about 50 Italian dealers were told that their contracts would be terminated if they sold to foreign customers.</p> <p>Some 12 dealers who refused to toe the line were closed down - and any dealer who dared to defy VW had its profit margins and bonuses progressively reduced in retaliation.</p> <p>The commission said that Italian dealers were instructed deliberately to mislead foreign customers - by falsely claiming that different specifications and warranty complications made a cross-border sale impossible.</p> <p>Mario Monti, the European commissioner in charge of policing competition policy, yesterday hailed the court's judgment as a victory for the consumer.</p> <p>\"Car makers have some latitude in the way they choose to organise their distribution networks,\" Mr Monti said, \"but the rules also give consumers the unalterable right to buy - either directly or through an authorised intermediary - a car in the member state of their choice.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year Mr Monti put the European car industry on notice to expect radical reform in the way cars are sold when the current regulations expire next year, partly because of what he views as a lack of competition.</p> <p>Brussels is investigating the activities of other car makers - including DaimlerChrysler, General Motors and Peugeot - and is expected to make its findings public this year.</p> <p>Volkswagen said yesterday that it was considering a further appeal against the court's decision.</p>",

It is the largest fine ever imposed on a European company for flouting fair competition laws. The European court of justice, based in Luxembourg, told Volkswagen its behaviour was a particularly serious offence because of its status as Europe's largest car maker. Industry analysts believe that yesterday's verdict could trigger a series of similar cases against other car makers across Europe. The ruling is a serious blow to VW which has spent two years lobbying ferociously to clear its name and avoid the fine, which was originally imposed by the European commission in 1998. It is also a reminder that consumers in countries such as Britain - where cars are perceived to be more expensive than in continental Europe - are within their rights to buy in other member states. Although the court agreed to lower the original fine by \u00a37.5m, it essentially upheld the commission's case, delivering a damning verdict which is certain to tarnish VW's reputation. The court found that German and Austrian motorists who wanted to take advantage of the lire's weakness between 1993 and 1996 and make big savings by buying their new cars in Italy were repeatedly thwarted by VW, together with its Audi subsidiary and its Italian distributor. \"Volkswagen committed an infringement which was particularly serious, the seriousness being magnified by the size of the Volkswagen group,\" the court ruled, noting that VW is Europe's biggest car maker. It is against European law for manufacturers to stop bargain hunters from shopping around the 15 member states to find the best buy. But in Volkswagen's case the court yesterday upheld the commission's original findings - which painted a picture of a highly organised campaign to stop motorists buying its cars outside their own country. In a series of raids on VW offices around Europe, the commission uncovered evidence that about 50 Italian dealers were told that their contracts would be terminated if they sold to foreign customers. Some 12 dealers who refused to toe the line were closed down - and any dealer who dared to defy VW had its profit margins and bonuses progressively reduced in retaliation. The commission said that Italian dealers were instructed deliberately to mislead foreign customers - by falsely claiming that different specifications and warranty complications made a cross-border sale impossible. Mario Monti, the European commissioner in charge of policing competition policy, yesterday hailed the court's judgment as a victory for the consumer. \"Car makers have some latitude in the way they choose to organise their distribution networks,\" Mr Monti said, \"but the rules also give consumers the unalterable right to buy - either directly or through an authorised intermediary - a car in the member state of their choice.\" Earlier this year Mr Monti put the European car industry on notice to expect radical reform in the way cars are sold when the current regulations expire next year, partly because of what he views as a lack of competition. Brussels is investigating the activities of other car makers - including DaimlerChrysler, General Motors and Peugeot - and is expected to make its findings public this year. Volkswagen said yesterday that it was considering a further appeal against the court's decision.",

We are baffled, but prepared to open up.</p> <p>\"I promise her that if she is not well or has a problem I will be there in the forefront to help her out.\"</p> <p>Sufiah began studying for a masters degree at Oxford at the age of 13, entering St Hilda's as its youngest ever student, but remaining under the supervision of her parents.</p> <p>Referring to reports that Sufiah might be staying away because her Malaysian-born father was too demanding, Mrs Yusof said: \"As a family we are close. When it comes to their work, [the children] are independent. We have always said that if it is too much for you, please tell us. We told Sufiah any time she feels she wants to take a break, to please do.\"</p> <p>She said Farooq, 43, a mathematician, had spent three days combing the streets in search of his daughter.</p> <p>Mrs Yusof said she was naturally concerned for her daughter's welfare and was eager for \"professionals\" to make sure she was physically and mentally healthy.</p> <p>She added: \"If she does not want to see us, that is fine. She is the one now that needs to be thought of. If she wants to settle down in a safe house and go through social services, so be it.\"</p> <p>Thames Valley police said social services had been informed and would be looking after the teenager for the next few days.</p> <p>The principal of St Hilda's College, Elizabeth Llewellyn-Smith, said everyone was very pleased to hear the teenager was safe and well.</p> <p>She declined to comment on the apparent rift between Sufiah and her family saying: \"The college cannot intervene or comment on any dispute between Sufiah and her family which is a matter for other authorities so long as she is a minor.\"</p> <p>But she added that the college would co-operate with police and social service inquiries. Ms Llewellyn-Smith said the college hoped to get in touch with the young student, who passed her end-of-year exams with flying colours, to discuss the fourth year of her course, which is due to begin in October.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The mother of maths prodigy Sufiah Yusof has sent a heartfelt message to her runaway daughter, who yesterday refused to go home after being tracked down by police. The 15-year-old Oxford student, who disappeared two weeks ago from St Hilda's college after sitting her final exam of the year, asked detectives to keep her whereabouts a secret when she was found somewhere \"in England\". Speaking from the family home in Coventry, her mother, Halimaheon, expressed relief that her daughter was safe and well, but added that she was baffled by Sufiah's behaviour. The teenager had called her college dean, Laura Newby, the day after she went missing to say she \"needed space\" and was also understood to have sent her parents an email telling them she did not wish to come home for family reasons. Sobbing, Mrs Yusof, a 44-year-old chemist, said: \"The child I know is a good child and a happy child. We are baffled, but prepared to open up. \"I promise her that if she is not well or has a problem I will be there in the forefront to help her out.\" Sufiah began studying for a masters degree at Oxford at the age of 13, entering St Hilda's as its youngest ever student, but remaining under the supervision of her parents. Referring to reports that Sufiah might be staying away because her Malaysian-born father was too demanding, Mrs Yusof said: \"As a family we are close. When it comes to their work, [the children] are independent. We have always said that if it is too much for you, please tell us. We told Sufiah any time she feels she wants to take a break, to please do.\" She said Farooq, 43, a mathematician, had spent three days combing the streets in search of his daughter. Mrs Yusof said she was naturally concerned for her daughter's welfare and was eager for \"professionals\" to make sure she was physically and mentally healthy. She added: \"If she does not want to see us, that is fine. She is the one now that needs to be thought of. If she wants to settle down in a safe house and go through social services, so be it.\" Thames Valley police said social services had been informed and would be looking after the teenager for the next few days. The principal of St Hilda's College, Elizabeth Llewellyn-Smith, said everyone was very pleased to hear the teenager was safe and well. She declined to comment on the apparent rift between Sufiah and her family saying: \"The college cannot intervene or comment on any dispute between Sufiah and her family which is a matter for other authorities so long as she is a minor.\" But she added that the college would co-operate with police and social service inquiries. Ms Llewellyn-Smith said the college hoped to get in touch with the young student, who passed her end-of-year exams with flying colours, to discuss the fourth year of her course, which is due to begin in October.",

      "body": "<p>Somewhere between sole Colbert and steak Diane, some time between the plenty of pre-1930 and the grossery of the 1960s, came Spam. Spam rescued the nation from wartime austerity and the dreariness of rationing - from Woolton pie, corned beef rissoles, savoury tripe, from casserole and smothered sausages. Spam, pink and porky and glorious in its trim, sensible tin, was the definition of American culinary technology.</p> <p>As Marguerite Patten, whose recipes helped Britons through the war and years of postwar rationing (food was rationed until 1954), writes in the introduction to Spam, the Cookbook: \"You can imagine the enthusiasm that greeted extra meat in the form of canned Spam. It was a really meaty luncheon meat. Each can contained a high percentage of pork and so it was a highly nutritious source of protein.\" In fact, Spam was - is - a quality product: 90% ham and pork, which is rather more than virtually all British sausages.</p> <p>Whatever its pedigree, sadly, Spam today is the acme of all that is uncool about food. \"It's a long, long time since I looked Spam in the face,\" says Rowley Leigh, the chef of Kensington Place. Lindsay Bareham of the Evening Standard claims to be ravaged by memories of \"pink slices like dog's tongues served up with pickled beetroot, by nuns\". \"Worth eating,\" admits Shaun Hill, chef/proprietor of the Michelin-starred Merchant House in Ludlow, \"but not worth buying.\" Food and Drink Programme favourite Antony Worrall Thompson confesses to being a Spam fan and to having a case of the stuff in his kitchen. He stoutly defends the qualities of Spam fritters, but even he is forced to admit that Spam is a bit of a cult, which means that it doesn't exactly have a mass following.</p> <p>Spam may have its own website and its tins may be collectors' items. It may also have its place in social history and be part of the gastro-tribal memory, but the truth is that it is now seen as irredeemably low-rent, best fitted as bait for barbel and carp. \"Spam, Spam, Spam, lovely Spam,\" sang the Monty Python crew in a paean of satirical irony, \"wonderful, lovely Spam... superlative Spam, surgical Spam, splendiferous Spam.\"</p> <p>But during and after the war, Spam was popular. It was a luxury. Spam, it has to be said, was the balsamic vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil of its day; the dernier cri , if not of fine dining, then certainly of everyday staples. Spam was the symbol of everything we couldn't produce or get hold of. \"It was,\" says my mother, who remembers the high days of Spam with affection, \"a godsend. The only other tinned meat of any quality was Argentinian corned beef, and we went off that when a number of people were poisoned by it. Of course, it was only any good when it was made in the USA. The quality deteriorated when they started making it here.\"</p> <p>\"Innovate - don't imitate\" was the motto of George A Hormel, founder of the company that makes Spam to this day. It was a motto that his son, Jay, took seriously when developing Spam in the 30s. It was the time of the depression, of bread queues and dust bowls, Bonnie and Clyde and the New Deal. The high-quality luncheon meat envisaged by Jay Hormel was part of a kind of culinary New Deal. He wanted to harness cutting-edge canning technology to produce a practical staple for domestic kitchens.</p> <p>By late 1936 Hormel had the product and the production line, but he didn't have a name. Chopped ham lacked magic. Pork luncheon meat didn't trip off the tongue. So he organised a new year's party in 1937 to help find a name. Each guest would be entitled to one drink for each name they suggested, with a prize of $100 for the winner. The lucky guest was Kenneth Daigneau, middle-ranking actor and brother of a Hormel vice-president. Spam was short, sharp, easy on the tongue, and it accurately described the contents of the tin. In retrospect, Daigneau may have felt that he undersold his brainwave.</p> <p>So, in May 1937, cans of Spam began rolling off the production line in Spam City, better known as Austin, Minnesota, and into history. In some ways Spam was the beneficiary of burgeoning commercial television: Hormel exploited the potential of TV advertisements to promote his \"baby\".

Sales of Spam doubled between 1939 and 1942. By 1944, 90% of all Hormel products were exported. Spam was the staple that Uncle Sam used to feed his own armies (to the extent that American soldiers began to complain about being over-Spammed) and was also sent to keep his European allies in fighting shape. \"Without Spam we wouldn't have been able to feed the army,\" said Nikita Khrushchev.</p> <p>But it was in Britain that Spam became the biggest hit. Meat was rationed by price to one or two shillings' worth per week. The bacon ration fluctuated between 4oz and 8oz per week, the ration for fats, including butter, marge and lard and cheese between 1oz and 8oz a week, with 8oz to 1lb of sugar and 2oz to 4oz of tea.

      "bodyText": "Somewhere between sole Colbert and steak Diane, some time between the plenty of pre-1930 and the grossery of the 1960s, came Spam. Spam rescued the nation from wartime austerity and the dreariness of rationing - from Woolton pie, corned beef rissoles, savoury tripe, from casserole and smothered sausages. Spam, pink and porky and glorious in its trim, sensible tin, was the definition of American culinary technology. As Marguerite Patten, whose recipes helped Britons through the war and years of postwar rationing (food was rationed until 1954), writes in the introduction to Spam, the Cookbook: \"You can imagine the enthusiasm that greeted extra meat in the form of canned Spam. It was a really meaty luncheon meat. Each can contained a high percentage of pork and so it was a highly nutritious source of protein.\" In fact, Spam was - is - a quality product: 90% ham and pork, which is rather more than virtually all British sausages. Whatever its pedigree, sadly, Spam today is the acme of all that is uncool about food. \"It's a long, long time since I looked Spam in the face,\" says Rowley Leigh, the chef of Kensington Place. Lindsay Bareham of the Evening Standard claims to be ravaged by memories of \"pink slices like dog's tongues served up with pickled beetroot, by nuns\". \"Worth eating,\" admits Shaun Hill, chef/proprietor of the Michelin-starred Merchant House in Ludlow, \"but not worth buying.\" Food and Drink Programme favourite Antony Worrall Thompson confesses to being a Spam fan and to having a case of the stuff in his kitchen. He stoutly defends the qualities of Spam fritters, but even he is forced to admit that Spam is a bit of a cult, which means that it doesn't exactly have a mass following. Spam may have its own website and its tins may be collectors' items. It may also have its place in social history and be part of the gastro-tribal memory, but the truth is that it is now seen as irredeemably low-rent, best fitted as bait for barbel and carp. \"Spam, Spam, Spam, lovely Spam,\" sang the Monty Python crew in a paean of satirical irony, \"wonderful, lovely Spam... superlative Spam, surgical Spam, splendiferous Spam.\" But during and after the war, Spam was popular. It was a luxury. Spam, it has to be said, was the balsamic vinegar and extra-virgin olive oil of its day; the dernier cri , if not of fine dining, then certainly of everyday staples. Spam was the symbol of everything we couldn't produce or get hold of. \"It was,\" says my mother, who remembers the high days of Spam with affection, \"a godsend. The only other tinned meat of any quality was Argentinian corned beef, and we went off that when a number of people were poisoned by it. Of course, it was only any good when it was made in the USA.

      "bodyText": "When the cabinet minister came calling at this isolated Jewish outpost, settler Dvir Gr\u00fcnzweig did not bother to conceal his disgust, venting anger liberally on the virtual captive plonked on the sofa of his spanking new semi-detached home. \"I told him that he was a puppet, that he had blood on his hands, and that I could not believe a word he said,\" Mr Gr\u00fcnzweig said yesterday. Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, communications minister and a close ally of the prime minister, Ehud Barak, slunk home, having failed miserably in his mission to convince Jewish settlers on the West Bank that the government had their interests at heart in negotiations with the Palestinians. Yesterday, the 231 families of Psagot, a hilltop settlement only yards from the urban sprawl of El-Bireh-Ramallah, the twin cities that are the centre of Palestinian life on the West Bank, could see only disaster ahead as Mr Barak prepares for next week's summit at Camp David. The settlers are livid at Mr Barak's broad hints last month that some 20% of the 200,000 Jewish settlers on the West Bank and Gaza - especially those living in small, isolated outposts like Psagot - will be evacuated to Israel proper or forced to live under Palestinian sovereignty in an agreement with Yasser Arafat. Subsequent government leaks have spoken of a return of more than 90% of the West Bank, and although the people of Psagot have yet to see maps of the proposed borders, they know they are vulnerable. Many of the settlers, who arrived in lands occupied after the 1967 war, did so with government encouragement, and hefty subsidies. Psagot, founded 20 years ago by religious nationalists, has a temporary feel. None of the settlers dare set foot in El-Bireh, which lies just beyond their electronic gates, and an army camp sits uneasily with the paddling pools, children's bicycles and other totems of the Israeli suburban dream. The majority of Israelis see the settlers as land-grabbing opportunists, and a constant irritant to the Palestinians whose lands they occupy. \"They really believe that there is some kind of Utopian peace before us, and I think they are like ostriches burying their heads in the sand,\" said Devorah Dudovitz, a social worker who is employed in Jerusalem, about half an hour's drive away. As Mr Barak heads off to Camp David, the settlers are gearing up for a campaign to persuade Israelis that the settlements are vital to the Zionist mission, and that abandoning them would polarise the country. There are hectoring banners all around Psagot, reading: \"Barak, you don't abandon your brothers\" and \"Barak is losing the state\", and people have clambered on to buses to join protest rallies in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Ms Dudovitz believes the Palestinians will never be satisfied with the forced evacuation of some settlements and is plotting for the annihilation of the entire state of Israel. \"This is the frontline for the rest of the country. If Psagot and the rest of the settlements go, it opens the whole country up to a dangerous situation. I do not think there can be peace here even if we give up everything.\"",

Even so, much depends on the answer to an awful question - if there is to be loss of life as the protests inevitably intensify, who will be the first martyr? The poison that flows out of this crisis could play a major role in destabilising the agreement in the autumn. That is why Peter Mandelson looks on so nervously.

In the old days, authoritarian states censored the press, padlocked telex machines, tapped phones, jammed broadcasts, and even went to such grotesque lengths as to register every typewriter. With the internet, and with allied changes in broadcasting and print publishing, this kind of crude control was going to go out of the window.</p> <p>Sadly, while it is true that the new technology can be an aid to the critical journalism societies need if they are to become, or to remain, democratic, it is also true that the hardware matters much less than the software - in this case that softest and most vulnerable of stuffs, the individual human being. States have not ceased to try to control the hardware, as Russian and Chinese efforts to restrict the internet show. But the new strategies of information control target people even more than in the past, aiming to intimidate them into a self-censorship that can be frighteningly effective. Worse, such intimidation can also be effective in choking off those international efforts to bypass domestic information control which new technology was supposed to enhance. Those efforts depend on the readiness of journalists and others to transmit information out of their countries so that it can become internationally known, and, crucially, so that it can then be transmitted back to the country concerned. Here it is certainly the case that the net, as well as international broadcasting, cannot be as easily shut down as other information conduits in the past. But if you can frighten the information gatherers into silence, all the technical wizardry in the world will be to no avail. There is no electronic substitute for the human act of witness.</p> <p>Last night in London Miroslav Filipovic was named European internet journalist of the year in the NetMedia awards at City University. The award was collected by his son and daughter, because their father is in jail in Nis on espionage charges. Filipovic worked for the Serbian paper Danas, for Agence France Presse, and for the London based Institute for War and Peace Reporting. The IWPR is a charitable organisation whose purpose is to support independent media in the Balkans, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and some other areas. The main form this support has taken has been the regular publication, in the early years on paper but now electronically, of critical reporting from these regions by local correspondents. Much of this work is of the kind that could not be published, or not published in such a complete way, in the countries of which the correspondents are citizens. It is intended for an international audience but also for \"home\" audiences. It has often been one of the few sources of reliable information when the local media have been stifled - information not only about their own societies but about neighbouring societies with which they have hostile or difficult relations. It may initially reach only a small, educated and computer literate group, but there are ways in which it then sometimes diffuses quite widely. This is the bypass technique referred to above. To use another metaphor, the idea is to provide a kind of iron lung, enabling a suppressed or enfeebled journalism to breathe - and to survive until better times.</p> <p>Miroslav Filipovic's main crime in the eyes of the Serbian authorities was probably to file a story based on a Yugoslav army investigation into military behaviour in Kosovo. The story quoted testimony from officers who had been horrified by atrocities they saw committed, usually by reservists or irregulars. Other Filipovic stories may also have angered the regime. In any event, he was arrested, interrogated, released, and then rearrested. The charges he faces could lead to a sentence of up to 15 years. Needless to say, the law is so broadly drawn that there is no requirement to prove he was in contact with a foreign intelligence organisation. Using other catch-all statutes, the Milosevic government has in the past few months battered down the relatively free media which had somehow survived in Serbia. Independent radio and television stations have had their equipment destroyed or confiscated. Independent newspapers have been systematically fined, and some have been bankrupted. More than 20 journalists have been killed, 60 have been arrested, at least six have gone to prison. An even more sweeping law, supposedly aimed at combating \"terrorism\", has just been postponed for some reason, but waits in the wings in case more powers are needed.</p> <p>In the context of this campaign, the fate of Filipovic suggests that the regime believes it has achieved its aim of inducing a fearful self-censorship by the remaining independent organs, and is now moving to close off the last remaining channels of information, those that work through foreign connections. The independent broadcaster Veran Matic has argued that Serbia is creating a model for \"some new breed of east European democratic dictatorship\". Certainly similar tendencies, if not always so far advanced, can be seen in a number of other countries. In Russia, the arrest of Vladimir Gusinsky, the media magnate whose programmes have criticised and mocked Vladimir Putin, and the detention of Andrei Babitsky after his reporting in Chechnya, suggest that the government intends to \"manage\" the media more ruthlessly. The corruption of much of the Russian media, which one critic has defined as 60% devoted to disinformation and slander, might make that task easier. In Belarus the independent media are under siege. In Central Asia, the media are expected to utter no word against the autocratic presidential rule that is standard in all five republics, with the partial exception of Kirgizstan. In Kazakhstan, one of the last independent papers, the wonderfully named Let's Survive till Monday, has unhappily not survived a legal assault which ended in the confiscation not only of the paper's assets but of the personal wealth of the editors. Some other former Soviet countries could be added to this list.</p> <p>The efforts made by a number of media support organisations and by western governments have helped stave off the worst. But the interest of western governments, at least, may be waning, in the case of Serbia because they can see no easy means to influence the regime, and in the case of the Soviet successor states because of the desperate desire to \"do business\" with their governments, and particularly with Putin. Yet devising outside ways to keep independent media alive, and to help men like Miroslav Filipovic or Andrei Babitsky, is more critical today, when the shades are lengthening, than it was in the happy years of the early 90s when everyone wanted to do something for east European journalism.</p> <p>Martin Woollacott is a board member of IWPR. <a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p> <p>For information on the Filipovic case and on the defence and family support fund consult <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.iwpr.net</a></p>",

It has generated anger in Russia and China, unease in Europe, and alarm among many US scientists.</p> <p>Fifty US Nobel laureates signed an open letter to President Clinton yesterday urging him to scrap the scheme.</p> <p>\"The system would offer little protection and would do grave harm to this nation's core security interests,\" the laureates wrote. The first to sign was Hans Bethe, a physicist who was one of the main architects of the atom bomb.</p> <p>White House officials privately agree with many of the misgivings, and say that a failure tomorrow would be welcome, as it would make it easier for Mr Clinton to delay a decision committing the country to the scheme.</p> <p>European governments, including the British, are desperately hoping that Mr Clinton will put off the decision on whether the test is deemed a success. Whitehall officials say that opposition within Europe to the project is increasing rather than diminishing, despite Washington's claims to the contrary.</p> <p>Faced with the prospect of having to allow the US to build a radar system at Fylingdales in North Yorkshire, British ministers have refused to comment publicly on the project in an attempt to stifle debate.</p> <p>Both the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, repeat the mantra that they will \"consider\" proposals to build new US radar systems in Britain when they receive a formal request from the US.</p> <p>But privately, Mr Cook and military chiefs are hostile to the NMD project. They believe that it will threaten existing arms control agreements, as well as being unnecessary and not technologically feasible.</p> <p>In common with other European allies - notably Germany and France - Britain does not share the assessment by some elements in the US intelligence and military community of the threat posed by such countries as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq.</p> <p>Mr Hoon came close to distancing himself from US calculations when he told the Commons this week that according to British assessments there was no significant threat to the UK from weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>A decision by Mr Clinton to leave a decision on NMD to his successor will give Europeans much-needed breathing space, said one Whitehall official. He conceded that a British decision to allow the US to upgrade Fylingdales would be \"very difficult\".</p> <p>The US is already upgrading its eavesdropping base at Menwith Hill, near Harrogate in North Yorkshire, to install a space-based infrared radar system for the NMD project. But that base is already substantial. Building a large new radar system at Fylingdales will invite more protests, officials says.</p> <p>British MPs are becoming increasingly unhappy about the government's continuing refusal to engage in a public debate on such a controversial development.</p> <p>\"NMD is a mad idea; it is unlikely to work technically and it will have a destabilising effect on world security\", Phyllis Starkey, a Labour member of the Commons foreign relations committee, said yesterday. \"America's 'rogue state' hypothesis just not credible.\"</p> <p>The committee is expected to deliver a strong critique of NMD in a report due to be published next month.</p> <p>America's European allies believe that the NMD project would provoke Russia into taking countermeasures. The latest issue of the authoritative US publication, Defence News, says that Moscow is seriously considering abrogating the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty which led to the scrapping of many US and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in the 1980s.</p> <p>The Europeans believe NMD would prompt China into building more long-range missiles which would provoke an arms race in south Asia.</p> <p>They privately welcome the proposal from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for a system - to cover the whole of Europe - designed to attack incoming missiles soon after they have been fired.</p> <p>Though this would be even more difficult technologically than Washington's NMD project, it would prolong the debate, and put off difficult decisions, Europeans hope.</p> <p>NMD reflects an \"erosion of the belief in deterrence\", Dan Plesch, director of the British American Security Information Council, said yesterday. \"The choice is between a new arms race or disarmament.\"</p> <p>Europeans fear that the US has already taken the route leading to the former.</p> <p><b>Assessing the threat</b><br> by Richard Norton-Taylor and Ewen MacAskill</p> <p>The US justification for developing the new anti-ballistic missile system is a perceived threat from countries such as North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya. Throughout the 90s, these countries were labelled by the US as \"rogue states\", a term recently downgraded to \"countries of concern\". But how realistic is the threat?</p> <p><b> Iraq: </b> As a result of disarmament and international sanctions after the Gulf war, Saddam Hussein's arsenal has been severely depleted. Although it has short-range missiles, it does not possess long-range ones, nor does it have a nuclear capability. The only threat that could be posed to the US by Iraq is from chemical or biological weapons, which are unlikely to be delivered by missiles.</p> <p><b> Iran: </b> Claims not to be developing nuclear weapons. A senior Pentagon official acknowledged this week that Iran's ballistic missile programme had problems and was \"certainly not clicking along really fast\". Some US intelligence officials say Iran could threaten the US \"before 2010\".</p> <p><b> North Korea: </b> Even US experts are divided about the danger this nation presents. Some, like Europeans, point to its suspension of missile tests last year and recent talks with South Korea as positive signs.</p> <p><b> Libya: </b> It is fast losing its pariah image, with Britain taking a lead in moving towards normalisation of relations. Now seen as the least likely of the four to mount an attack on the US.</p>",

That plan envisaged an anti-missile shield based only in one place - in Grand Forks, North Dakota - where it would theoretically be allowed by the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty, one of the main pillars of global nuclear arms control. But when it was discovered that that shield would not cover remote islands in Alaska, the Alaskan Republican senator, Ted Stevens, led a campaign for a bigger, far more expensive plan, with key installations in Alaska's Aleutian islands. The NMD project in its current form would violate the ABM treaty. It has generated anger in Russia and China, unease in Europe, and alarm among many US scientists. Fifty US Nobel laureates signed an open letter to President Clinton yesterday urging him to scrap the scheme. \"The system would offer little protection and would do grave harm to this nation's core security interests,\" the laureates wrote. The first to sign was Hans Bethe, a physicist who was one of the main architects of the atom bomb. White House officials privately agree with many of the misgivings, and say that a failure tomorrow would be welcome, as it would make it easier for Mr Clinton to delay a decision committing the country to the scheme. European governments, including the British, are desperately hoping that Mr Clinton will put off the decision on whether the test is deemed a success. Whitehall officials say that opposition within Europe to the project is increasing rather than diminishing, despite Washington's claims to the contrary. Faced with the prospect of having to allow the US to build a radar system at Fylingdales in North Yorkshire, British ministers have refused to comment publicly on the project in an attempt to stifle debate. Both the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, repeat the mantra that they will \"consider\" proposals to build new US radar systems in Britain when they receive a formal request from the US. But privately, Mr Cook and military chiefs are hostile to the NMD project. They believe that it will threaten existing arms control agreements, as well as being unnecessary and not technologically feasible. In common with other European allies - notably Germany and France - Britain does not share the assessment by some elements in the US intelligence and military community of the threat posed by such countries as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. Mr Hoon came close to distancing himself from US calculations when he told the Commons this week that according to British assessments there was no significant threat to the UK from weapons of mass destruction. A decision by Mr Clinton to leave a decision on NMD to his successor will give Europeans much-needed breathing space, said one Whitehall official. He conceded that a British decision to allow the US to upgrade Fylingdales would be \"very difficult\". The US is already upgrading its eavesdropping base at Menwith Hill, near Harrogate in North Yorkshire, to install a space-based infrared radar system for the NMD project. But that base is already substantial. Building a large new radar system at Fylingdales will invite more protests, officials says. British MPs are becoming increasingly unhappy about the government's continuing refusal to engage in a public debate on such a controversial development. \"NMD is a mad idea; it is unlikely to work technically and it will have a destabilising effect on world security\", Phyllis Starkey, a Labour member of the Commons foreign relations committee, said yesterday. \"America's 'rogue state' hypothesis just not credible.\" The committee is expected to deliver a strong critique of NMD in a report due to be published next month. America's European allies believe that the NMD project would provoke Russia into taking countermeasures. The latest issue of the authoritative US publication, Defence News, says that Moscow is seriously considering abrogating the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty which led to the scrapping of many US and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in the 1980s. The Europeans believe NMD would prompt China into building more long-range missiles which would provoke an arms race in south Asia. They privately welcome the proposal from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for a system - to cover the whole of Europe - designed to attack incoming missiles soon after they have been fired. Though this would be even more difficult technologically than Washington's NMD project, it would prolong the debate, and put off difficult decisions, Europeans hope. NMD reflects an \"erosion of the belief in deterrence\", Dan Plesch, director of the British American Security Information Council, said yesterday. \"The choice is between a new arms race or disarmament.\" Europeans fear that the US has already taken the route leading to the former. Assessing the threat by Richard Norton-Taylor and Ewen MacAskill The US justification for developing the new anti-ballistic missile system is a perceived threat from countries such as North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya. Throughout the 90s, these countries were labelled by the US as \"rogue states\", a term recently downgraded to \"countries of concern\". But how realistic is the threat? Iraq: As a result of disarmament and international sanctions after the Gulf war, Saddam Hussein's arsenal has been severely depleted. Although it has short-range missiles, it does not possess long-range ones, nor does it have a nuclear capability. The only threat that could be posed to the US by Iraq is from chemical or biological weapons, which are unlikely to be delivered by missiles. Iran: Claims not to be developing nuclear weapons. A senior Pentagon official acknowledged this week that Iran's ballistic missile programme had problems and was \"certainly not clicking along really fast\". Some US intelligence officials say Iran could threaten the US \"before 2010\". North Korea: Even US experts are divided about the danger this nation presents. Some, like Europeans, point to its suspension of missile tests last year and recent talks with South Korea as positive signs. Libya: It is fast losing its pariah image, with Britain taking a lead in moving towards normalisation of relations. Now seen as the least likely of the four to mount an attack on the US.",

      "bodyText": "The Labour leadership is to pledge to link the minimum wage with average earnings in a bid to fend off union hostility at this weekend's Labour national policy forum. The party hierarchy will make the promise as well as committing itself to making the low pay commission a permanent body. At present, the minimum wage can only be increased if ministers refer it to the commission and the body has historically been required to take account of inflation, rather than earnings. With average earnings far outstripping inflation unions feel that more has to be done for the lower paid and ministers were well aware a concession on this issue could prevent a showdown with the unions in other key policy areas. The three-day policy forum starting today in Exeter and addressed by a galaxy of ministers will see rows over issues kept off the agenda, including welfare and hunting. There is also likely to be a strong push to change the franchise for ballots to scrap grammar schools. Party activists believe ballots, such as at Ripon in North Yorkshire, have been loaded in favour of retention of selective education. In a bid to dampen anger over asylum seekers, ministers have agreed to evaluate the current voucher system against principles of integrating asylum seekers into the community and the need to eradicate child poverty. The leadership has also promised to coordinate centrally the dispersal system for asylum seekers. The proposal to link the minimum wage with earnings, rather than just inflation, has the support of the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers. Both ministers think the link should be with earnings, rather than inflation, since it is not a welfare benefit, but income linked to the workplace. Earnings are rising at over 5%, but inflation is closer to 2%. Cabinet sources said the low pay commission under its terms of reference would still be entitled to vary the regular rise to take account of the possible impact on jobs, or pressure on particular sectors. Ministers insist there will still be no automatic annual rise. The low pay proposal is one of a small number of concessions which party officials believe will prevent a showdown with the unions in other key policy areas. The GMB general workers union is expected to pull back from trying to force Labour to drop its pledge to hold a referendum on electoral reform if elected to a second term. John Edmonds, the GMB general secretary, has received assurances that any such referendum will not be held until after the planned referendum on a single currency. Mr Edmonds thinks there is no realistic lilklihood of such a second referendum being held since the party rank and file would not tolerate it. Some policy forum delegates argued yesterday that any move to drop the referendum pledge would be a breach of faith with the electorate. Party officials have ruled out of order all amendments from constituencies on welfare and benefits, including pensions, on the grounds that these issues were discussed in a separate policy document last year. Ministers hope the weekend forum with 170 delegates will in effect agree the outline of Labour's manifesto. In the process, the leadership hope to lower the tensions with the rank and file. The cabinet office minster, Ian McCartney, a key architect of the forum, said the message was: \"It is important to take part, you can make a difference and you can influence policy.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After 25 years of an outwardly contented marriage, I find myself in love with an unattached woman and she with me. She was one of my wife's best friends. My wife, very successful in her job (with attendant single-mindedness and fatigue), closed the bedroom door many years ago, before our much loved but mechanically conceived children (now 15, 13 and 10) were born. We are friends, with sex being the one area my wife will not discuss.</p> <p>I had hoped that \"things would get better\". I have willingly been the practical housemaker with my job taking second place. I now feel newly awake and see my future away from my wife, who has been told of the new relationship. Unamused, she tolerates it within limits while regarding her former friend as a home destroyer. A difficult atmosphere prevails. All three parties are concerned about the effects of a break-up on the children. I'm from a single-parent home.</p> <p>With great restraint shown, the new relationship is not yet physical, although my wife does not believe this. Should I take cold showers and pull back, for the sake of the children, from something that promises me so much?</p> <p>Name and address withheld</p> <p><b> Time to get a life</b><br></p> <p>To read this makes me sad. Children should be the bi-product of a loving physical relationship not mechanically produced to fit the \"outwardly contented\" package of successfully life/job/marriage. You were not truly happy before your children came along and should have addressed this issue then, but no, you were willing to sacrifice so much (16+ years of no intimacy) in order not to repeat the mistakes of your parents.</p> <p>The end of the physical side of a relationship is the beginning of the end, however long it takes to play it out. This may be reading between the lines, but you seem to rank third in your wife's list of priorities. She is \"unamused\" and \"tolerates\" her ex-friend, regarding her as a \"home destroyer\". This is strange as you don't even seem to be credited with any free will or responsibility in the matter. You only have one life, and we are all responsible for our happiness: maybe it's time for you to do what you want.</p> <p><b> Don't do it</b><br></p> <p>My advice is: don't do it. So many men who leave their wives admit within a few years that it was the worst mistake they'd made. Commitment and faithfulness are rare and important qualities to demonstrate to children, who are bombarded with the seductions of instant gratification from all sides. Any relationship takes some effort, so any energy available for starting a new relationship would be better expended in redeveloping the old one.</p> <p>The day after our 23rd wedding anniversary, my husband told me he wanted to devote his effort to developing an, as yet platonic, relationship with another woman. I was not particularly surprised as, although we had both been entirely faithful, we had failed to be entirely loving to each other. In fact, like your wife, I had asked him to refrain from touching me about four years previously as I felt he simply used me for sex in much the same way as a cat uses a scratching post.</p> <p>I was aware that I was somewhat uptight, convinced that sex was the greatest con of all, with nobody daring to admit it wasn't actually much good. We lost our marriage, and the clear memories of our past and the future we had been working towards for 23 years. I still find it hard not to hate him for removing any hope there may have been of making the marriage better.</p> <p>Feeling released from obligations of faithfulness, I allowed a man who I had fallen for to seduce me and was introduced to the amazing, ecstatic, wonderful, exhilarating joyfulness of sex. I now have some inkling or understanding of people's preoccupations with sex. The difference between my lover's approach to sex and my husband's was simply that my lover focused on arousing my desires and giving me pleasure.</p> <p>From this experience, I would suggest that you devote yourself to learning what your wife enjoys. I believe that if you could do this (even with the help of books or a therapist) you would together discover the wonder of sex and renewed contentment in each other's company without destroying anything except your fantasy that a fresh start would be better.</p> <p><b> Try a new partner</b><br></p> <p>As an oldie (60), I remember a saying common from my youth: \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\" So get off yours. You are an example of a responsible adult reared in a single-parent family. What you did not have was the example of parents well-matched emotionally and physically to guide you in your choice of mate. With a new partner, you now have the chance to demonstrate such a relationship to your children as they mature. Maybe your wife, when free of your current set up, will also find a more fulfilling relationship, but if not, it is up to you to show your children.</p> <p>Just one thing - a man's satisfaction does not mean a woman is satisfied or aroused. My new partner (70) has learned much for the first time over the past two years and we are happy. Good luck.</p> <p><b> No going back</b><br></p> <p>You have fallen in love but you appear to have a limited understanding of the nature of romantic love. Of course, love is vitally important to you. You want a happy relationship which includes physical gratification, and you romantically feel that your new relationship could offer you this. Adulterous love is often judged harshly but it can provide a \"satisfactory\" solution to some unhappily married people.</p> <p>I found that falling in love in mid-life allowed me to undo many of the disappointments of my early life. It released me from the emotional and sexual repression of my past, helped me face the demands of middle age, and gave me a new kind of serenity. However, it was a complex and difficult journey and caused a lot of pain to the man I had lived with for 13 years.</p> <p>You already know that there is no going back. You may feel that getting into a sexual relationship is a significant step for you, but in reality your marriage has already ended. The real issue is whether you will be able to handle the intimacy and to open up emotionally with another woman.</p> <p><b> Talk frankly about sex</b><br></p> <p>After 25 years of marriage all or most long-term relationships become mechanical - it's nothing new. What is remarkable is that you are good friends whereas many people merely tolerate one another.</p> <p>Have a long and frank talk with your wife about your sex life. If she refuses to discuss this issue then suggest bringing in a third party, such as a marriage guidance counsellor. I speak with much experience, having spent 15 years on the singles scene. Falling in love is just the beginning of a relationship and is very different to real friendship. A passionate love life is all very well but it will not last. I could write a book on the misery marriage break-ups bring to the child.</p> <p>Stop thinking of yourself and get your marriage sorted out. Better that you buy your wife a dozen red roses and tell her what a good friend she is to you. Remember that the grass is always greener on the other side until you get there.</p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p>\u0095 My partner and I do not live together (by choice) and so do not share any household expenses. Our financial circumstances are also very different: neither of us is in full-time paid work, but whereas her income is relatively meagre (comprising a small pension and disability benefits), I am able to live on income from capital supplemented by occasional part-time earnings. I pay my partner an allowance of \u00a3200 monthly, I also sometimes pay additional costs when we go out together, and I have paid air fare and other costs towards a special holiday.</p> <p>Neither of us is happy with the financial imbalance, but cannot think of how to improve it. We will both reach official retirement age in approximately five years, and at this point neither of us is able to earn substantially more, nor do we expect to in future. I am not happy to share all my income and/or capital, and she is unhappy about being \"dependent\". Both of us feel guilty!</p> <p>How have others coped with a situation of unequal earnings or other resources? Is there an answer?</p> <p>\u0095 Private Lives appears every Friday.

If the three-man craft is a success, the team will collect a $10m prize from an American foundation. He said he was confident that the team could win the prize. \"You have to put three people 100 kilo metres up and bring them back - you don't have to put them into orbit. It will be a 15-minute journey,\" he said. The team has already started work on the new craft.",

As ever, it's linked - at considerable length - by the ever-likeable Antoine De Caunes (minus the late Lolo Ferrari), and enlivened with appealingly garish graphics and sarcastic voice-overs. </p> <p>But there's a problem. Eurotrash simply doesn't outrage any more, and not just because it has reached season 13.

Channel 4 parades Caribbean Uncovered, Something For The Weekend, and Naked Elvis. The whole of Channel Five feels like nothing but a single nightmarish, drawn-out edition of Eurotrash, complete with unconvincing voices (Sunset Beach), harrowing male nudity (Keith Chegwin's Naked Jungle) and profoundly dispiriting \"erotica\" (courtesy of about a zillion assorted pornographic schedule-pluggers with titles like Nude Saxophone Cops and When Checkout Girls Bend Over). Digital and cable viewers, meanwhile, can wallow in the nightly shock-o-rama of Bravo or the joyless Granada Men And Motors (demographic: underachieving loners interested in motoring, glamour photography and self-abuse). </p> <p>These days, watching television is like sitting in Travis Bickle's taxicab, staring through the window at a world of relentless, churning shod. Some day a real rain's going to come and wash the scum off the screens. Until then, sit back and gawp in slack-jawed indifference as television slowly disappears up a lapdancer's bottom. In close-up. To the echoing strains of Roll With It. </p> <p>The upshot is we've become hopelessly desensitised - but it's not just the box that's to blame. Consider the impact of technology. The past five years have seen a dramatic increase in the number of people with internet connections in the workplace, enabling office-bound tragi-bores to access and distribute stomach-churning muck with tiresome ease and gusto. Once you've got accustomed to having your attention regularly drawn to the kind of extreme imagery previously reserved for the racier shop windows of Amsterdam, all pornography rapidly becomes a crashing bore, no matter how bizarre.

Broadcast the entire show in 3D, pumping each and every image directly into the viewer's cerebellum via a length of magic spacewire connected to the internet. </p> <p>Sorry Rapido, but that's it.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As Frank Austen, Jane's brother, called to a shipmate swimming over the side, \"Mr Pakenham! You are in danger of a shark - a shark of the blue species!\" Acute observation clearly ran in the family. In <strong> Deadly Sharks Down Under</strong> (ITV) we saw a shark of the blue species and it did not encourage us to rate Mr Pakenham's chances as rosy. It was not only blue, it was ballistic. </p> <p>Steve Irwin called it \"a beautiful, torpedo-shaped animal\". Steve, who has a heart like butter in the sun, never met an animal he didn't like. He is always the first to see the bad guy's point of view. Despite its title, Deadly Sharks Down Under was dedicated to the proposition that most sharks are bonzer if not riled. </p> <p>Take the wobbegong. </p> <p>The wobbegong looks like something which has been run over in the road. This implausible shark spends a lot of time lying on the sea-floor, hence its other name, carpet shark.

      "bodyText": "As Frank Austen, Jane's brother, called to a shipmate swimming over the side, \"Mr Pakenham! You are in danger of a shark - a shark of the blue species!\" Acute observation clearly ran in the family. In Deadly Sharks Down Under (ITV) we saw a shark of the blue species and it did not encourage us to rate Mr Pakenham's chances as rosy. It was not only blue, it was ballistic. Steve Irwin called it \"a beautiful, torpedo-shaped animal\". Steve, who has a heart like butter in the sun, never met an animal he didn't like. He is always the first to see the bad guy's point of view. Despite its title, Deadly Sharks Down Under was dedicated to the proposition that most sharks are bonzer if not riled. Take the wobbegong. The wobbegong looks like something which has been run over in the road. This implausible shark spends a lot of time lying on the sea-floor, hence its other name, carpet shark. It does seem to be woven in a jacquard pattern with tassels round its mouth like well-worn, though not necessarily well-loved, rug. With the bearded ghoul, the fangtooth and the Turkish toilet sponge, the wobbegong would be eliminated in the early heats of Miss Fish 2000. Unlike Mr Pakenham's swimming companion, it is loath to take any exercise and prefers to lie about in the same place for years getting fat.

      "body": "<p>Facing continuing threats of violence and land seizures, Zimbabwe's beleaguered white farmers yesterday offered 600 farms for sale to President Robert Mugabe's government for redistribution to poor blacks.</p> <p>The government is expected to confiscate hundreds of white-owned farms in the next few weeks to fulfil promises made to rural blacks in the general election two weeks ago. Despite the pledges of land and widespread state-sponsored violence which took 32 lives, Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party won only 62 of the 120 elected seats.</p> <p>In a desperate bid to avert the impending seizure of 804 farms, the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) said yesterday that it had identified 600 farms that were either derelict or the property of people who owned several farms. The CFU said if the government \"does things properly\" it could purchase the 600 farms and then resettle them with land-hungry black peasants.</p> <p>\"We must get the politics out of the land issue and deal with it as an economic issue,\" said Jerry Grant, the CFU's deputy director. \"We must be worried about production, exports and foreign currency generation. We do not want to obstruct the government's resettlement programme, but productive farms should be left to those fully utilising them.\"</p> <p>However, there is little chance that the Mugabe government will take up the farmers' offer or take land in a way the farmers consider \"proper\".</p> <p>Officials at the ministry of lands and agriculture refused to comment on the last-minute proposal.

      "bodyText": "Facing continuing threats of violence and land seizures, Zimbabwe's beleaguered white farmers yesterday offered 600 farms for sale to President Robert Mugabe's government for redistribution to poor blacks. The government is expected to confiscate hundreds of white-owned farms in the next few weeks to fulfil promises made to rural blacks in the general election two weeks ago. Despite the pledges of land and widespread state-sponsored violence which took 32 lives, Mr Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party won only 62 of the 120 elected seats. In a desperate bid to avert the impending seizure of 804 farms, the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) said yesterday that it had identified 600 farms that were either derelict or the property of people who owned several farms. The CFU said if the government \"does things properly\" it could purchase the 600 farms and then resettle them with land-hungry black peasants. \"We must get the politics out of the land issue and deal with it as an economic issue,\" said Jerry Grant, the CFU's deputy director. \"We must be worried about production, exports and foreign currency generation. We do not want to obstruct the government's resettlement programme, but productive farms should be left to those fully utilising them.\" However, there is little chance that the Mugabe government will take up the farmers' offer or take land in a way the farmers consider \"proper\". Officials at the ministry of lands and agriculture refused to comment on the last-minute proposal. Instead they were busy looking at the 804 farms already listed for confiscation. More than 500 of those farms have lodged legal appeals against the seizures, while nearly 300 farmers are not contesting them. Under Mr Mugabe's newly-installed land acquisition act the government can immediately take possession of those farms that have not appealed. Mr Mugabe is expected to take farms quickly and move thousands of his supporters on to the land. \"There is a great expectation amongst the people around the land issue and land will soon come to the people in a big way,\" Mr Mugabe said after the elections. During the violent campaign, Mr Mugabe pledged to seize white-owned farms \"without paying a penny for the land that was stolen from the African people by British colonialists\". His supporters illegally invaded 1,400 farms and five white farmers were killed. The land issue did not appeal to Zimbabwe's city dwellers, who were more concerned with the country's economic decline and who voted solidly for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Mr Mugabe's party squeaked in with support from the rural areas, but many analysts say that vote was influenced more by Zanu-PF's widespread use of violence and threats than by enthusiasm for the land issue. Before dissolving parliament in April for the elections, Mr Mugabe pushed through a constitutional amendment which states that Britain is obliged to pay compensation for land taken from Africans during the colonial period. If the British government does not pay, states the amendment, the Zimbabwe government does not have to pay any compensation for the land. Mr Mugabe said peasants would be settled on the newly-acquired land without special training or the development of new roads and services necessary to convert the properties for small-scale agriculture. \"Such a rushed settlement of rural people without proper training and no infrastructure will condemn them to continue as peasant farmers,\" said Tendai Biti, a newly-elected MP for the MDC.",

A quarter of holidaymakers stuff unwanted currency into drawers and other hiding places after trips abroad, amassing \u00a331.9m in wasted cash between them, according to the NOP survey for the Cancer Research Campaign. The survey found 28% of travelling Britons dump an average of \u00a33.90 worth of coins when they return home, while a further 1% throw away the equivalent of \u00a31m in foreign exchange every year. According to the campaign, the hidden millions amount to half of its entire cancer research budget for a year. Launching a drive to mobilise the potential of this leftover cash, Gordon McVie, director general of the campaign, said: \"Every penny donated to the Cancer Research Campaign counts. \"There is a huge treasure trove waiting to be tapped.\" The Foreign Coin Appeal 2000, a joint initiative between the campaign and Boots the Chemist, urges travellers to take their foreign coins to collection points in campaign shops and Boots stores around the country. Last year, the campaign exchanged \u00a3100,000 of foreign coins for cash which went directly to fund research. Professor McVie said: \"We hope the penny has dropped with the holidaying public that their foreign coins could play a massive part in funding the fight against cancer.\" His message was echoed by Victoria Rae of Unicef, who urged passengers travelling on British Airways to take part in the Change for Good scheme. Passengers are encouraged to make their pockets a little lighter by putting leftover currency of any denomination in Change for Good envelopes. The campaign has raised almost \u00a310m since it was launched in April 1994, with donations amounting on average to \u00a3180,000 a month. Ms Rae said: \"The success of Change for Good is that it is dead money that can be put to help children's lives in a practical way.\" Money has been allocated to children's projects in more than 40 countries, including health care in Tanzania and work with homeless children in Mexico and Brazil.",

He devised a new method of joining radioactive isotopes to tumour-seeking drugs - thus ensuring tumours effectively destroy themselves.</p> <p>It was in 1983 that Tom, a medical physicist and radiation biologist, moved from Hammersmith hospital's medical research council cyclotron unit to head Glasgow University's radio biology unit, then based at Belvidere hospital.</p> <p>Tom began at the unit with two technicians. Under his leadership it moved to the Cancer Research Campaign Beatson Laboratories in Bearsden and - with Tom by now head of Glasgow Institute's radiation biology department - it expanded to employ 12 research workers.</p> <p>Tom wrote two books and more than 150 papers. He also demonstrated that the p53 gene (one of those associated with some cancers, including that of the breast) is in that group particularly sensitive to radiotherapy. But this apparent good news was paradoxically counterbalanced by his significant finding that the p53 gene resulted in the lack of the normal ability of a cell regularly to destroy itself ( apoptosis ).</p> <p>Tom was born in Glasgow, and educated at the local secondary school in Shettlestone. To save enough money to support himself at university he joined the metallurgy laboratory at Clydebridge steelworks, and in his spare time took a Higher National Certificate in metallurgy.</p> <p>He started at Strathclyde University, reading engineering, but then discovered the delights of physics and mathematics. He graduated in these subjects in 1968. At Strathclyde he met his lifelong companion and support, Liz McLafferty.</p> <p>After graduating, Tom joined Glasgow's Institute of Radiotherapeutics and Oncology as a medical physicist in the department of medical physics and bio-engineering.</p> <p>The specialist treating cancer needs the help of a team. This includes radiographers to operate X-ray units and physicists, supervising the operation of complex machines, advising, and calculating on the treatment-planning computers which had been pioneered in Glasgow. Tom excelled in all these fields.</p> <p>In 1968 he took his PhD, married Liz and moved to London and Hammersmith's cyclotron unit, At Hammersmith the cyclotron - an \"atom smasher - is used for experimental treatment of cancer and for production of radioactive compounds used in scanning to show up brain function. The unit there is also renowned for its work on radiation biology and it was this that interested Tom. Then came Glasgow.</p> <p>In 1999 Tom was diagnosed as suffering from a cancer of the colon that had already spread to the liver. It was incurable by surgery. He suggested that his own method of treatment should be tried, but it was insufficiently effective. During this final period, he continued to write papers and lecture and was awarded a personal chair by Glasgow University.</p> <p>He received many honours, including the Institute of Physical Sciences in Medicine's Founders prize and the Douglas Lea lectureship, and the British Institute of Radiology's Roentgen prize. He was awarded honorary membership of the Royal College of Radiologists.</p> <p>Tom was a fine teacher - his jokes made difficult points simple - and his work was always his main interest. He was also a keen walker in the Scottish hills.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife.</p> <p>\u0095 Thomas Edward Wheldon, scientist, born May 12 1944; died June 4 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Professor Tom Wheldon, who has himself died of cancer aged 56, was credited with a major contribution to cancer treatment. He devised a new method of joining radioactive isotopes to tumour-seeking drugs - thus ensuring tumours effectively destroy themselves. It was in 1983 that Tom, a medical physicist and radiation biologist, moved from Hammersmith hospital's medical research council cyclotron unit to head Glasgow University's radio biology unit, then based at Belvidere hospital. Tom began at the unit with two technicians. Under his leadership it moved to the Cancer Research Campaign Beatson Laboratories in Bearsden and - with Tom by now head of Glasgow Institute's radiation biology department - it expanded to employ 12 research workers. Tom wrote two books and more than 150 papers. He also demonstrated that the p53 gene (one of those associated with some cancers, including that of the breast) is in that group particularly sensitive to radiotherapy. But this apparent good news was paradoxically counterbalanced by his significant finding that the p53 gene resulted in the lack of the normal ability of a cell regularly to destroy itself ( apoptosis ). Tom was born in Glasgow, and educated at the local secondary school in Shettlestone. To save enough money to support himself at university he joined the metallurgy laboratory at Clydebridge steelworks, and in his spare time took a Higher National Certificate in metallurgy. He started at Strathclyde University, reading engineering, but then discovered the delights of physics and mathematics. He graduated in these subjects in 1968. At Strathclyde he met his lifelong companion and support, Liz McLafferty. After graduating, Tom joined Glasgow's Institute of Radiotherapeutics and Oncology as a medical physicist in the department of medical physics and bio-engineering. The specialist treating cancer needs the help of a team. This includes radiographers to operate X-ray units and physicists, supervising the operation of complex machines, advising, and calculating on the treatment-planning computers which had been pioneered in Glasgow. Tom excelled in all these fields. In 1968 he took his PhD, married Liz and moved to London and Hammersmith's cyclotron unit, At Hammersmith the cyclotron - an \"atom smasher - is used for experimental treatment of cancer and for production of radioactive compounds used in scanning to show up brain function. The unit there is also renowned for its work on radiation biology and it was this that interested Tom. Then came Glasgow. In 1999 Tom was diagnosed as suffering from a cancer of the colon that had already spread to the liver. It was incurable by surgery. He suggested that his own method of treatment should be tried, but it was insufficiently effective. During this final period, he continued to write papers and lecture and was awarded a personal chair by Glasgow University. He received many honours, including the Institute of Physical Sciences in Medicine's Founders prize and the Douglas Lea lectureship, and the British Institute of Radiology's Roentgen prize. He was awarded honorary membership of the Royal College of Radiologists. Tom was a fine teacher - his jokes made difficult points simple - and his work was always his main interest. He was also a keen walker in the Scottish hills. He is survived by his wife. \u0095 Thomas Edward Wheldon, scientist, born May 12 1944; died June 4 2000",

      "bodyText": "A Slovakian Roma appealing for asylum in Britain following attacks by skinheads in Slovakia yesterday lost a crucial House of Lords test case. Five Law Lords unanimously dismissed Milan Horvath's appeal in a judgment which will have implications for hundreds of other Roma or Gypsy asylum seekers in Britain who are waiting to hear the outcome of their cases. It is likely to lead to their removal from Britain. The ruling also has implications for many other asylum cases, as it clearly draws the line that people suffering persecution from groups other than their own state authorities are unlikely to get asylum if it can be shown that the authorities have tried to provide protection. The Law Lords heard that Horvath, who comes from the village of Palin, in Michalovce, Slovakia, came to Britain in October 1997 with his wife and child and claimed asylum on the grounds that they were being persecuted by skinheads. But they upheld a decision by the home secretary, Jack Straw, to refuse him asylum on the grounds that there was evidence that the Slovak police had intervened to provide protection in some cases when they had been asked to do so and stiff sentences had been imposed for racially motivated attacks. The judges accepted that Slovak Roma are the victims of racial violence by skinheads and that the police did not conduct proper investigations into every case. But they argued that this did not demonstrate that the Slovak authorities were unwilling or unable to provide protection against such attacks. \"There are parts of London or New York where one may indeed have a well found fear of being attacked in the street. But that does not mean there is not an efficient police force and an impartial judiciary,\" said Lord Lloyd of Berwick. He said it may well be that Horvath had a well founded fear of persecution should he take his family back to Slovakia, but added that \"the authorities in Slovakia are willing and able to provide protection to the required standard, and Gypsies as a class are not exempt from that protection\".

      "bodyText": "A mature student yesterday won a high court ruling on sex discrimination in education, after claiming she was unlawfully excluded from the final year of a university degree course because of pregnancy-related illness. A judge described how Valerie Coggeran, who wished to qualify as a radiographer, was absent from her studies at South Bank University, London, and missed a number of examinations because of her illness. The university's examination board terminated her studies in July last year and an appeal board upheld its decision a month later. Quashing both those decisions, Mr Justice Munby yesterday ruled that the examination board had \"wholly misunderstood\" the basis of her case, and must reconsider whether or not Ms Coggeran, 32, should now have a chance to resume her Bachelor of Science (Hons) degree course in diagnostic imaging (radiography). Of wider importance was the judge's additional ruling that Ms Coggeran had a right to bring an action against the university authorities under the 1975 Sex Discrimination Act. Domestic law protected not only women employees from dismissal but also women students from \"exclusion from an educational establishment\" if they suffered pregnancy-related illness, said the judge. Asking for permission to appeal, John Lofthouse, appearing for the university, said: \"Your lordship's judgment could scarcely be more important for educational institutions - indeed for educational institutions of almost any sort. \"There are several points on sex discrimination where your lordship has given landmark rulings which are going to be applied and looked to for guidance.\" But the judge refused permission, and said he was concerned that Ms Coggeran's case should be reconsidered as a matter of urgency by the university authorities so that, if she were successful, she could be re-admitted to her course in September. The university can apply directly to the court of appeal to hear the case. Later, Ms Coggeran's solicitor, Richard Scrase, described yesterday's ruling as \"a useful stepping stone\" to the action for damages for unlawful sex discrimination she intended to bring against the university's governing body at Lambeth county court. Mr Scrase said: \"Ms Coggeran is of the view that she was poorly treated by South Bank University and that she is looking towards being properly treated so that she may resume her studies and in time qualify and practise as a radiographer.\" Ms Coggeran, of Tottenham, north London, who gave birth to a son in November last year, had satisfactorily completed the first two years of her three-year vocational course at the City University. She then enrolled in September 1998 at the South Bank to take the third year. She was initially absent for a period in November-December 1998 undergoing surgery for endometriosis, a condition of the womb. In January 1999, she failed part of her course work assessment but was allowed to take the unit again provided she did so by the following July. In February she was surprised to learn she was pregnant after being earlier advised that her health problems meant it was unlikely that she would be able to conceive. On March 3 last year she became sick with pregnancy-related illness. During a recent high court hearing, Mr Lofthouse had argued on behalf of the university that the leading cases under the Sex Discrimination Act arose in the field of employment and the anti-discrimination legislation could not be applied to the university student. He submitted the law was inapplicable under the European equal treatment directive, or the pregnancy directive, and because the law had been decided in the leading cases which had gone before the European court of justice. Yesterday Mr Justice Munby disagreed. He ruled there was nothing in European law to stop Britain going further than the two directives. \"The fact is our domestic law protects women against sex discrimination, not merely in the employment context but also, subject to the limits spelt out (in the 1975 Act), in the educational context,\" he said.",

The marine accident investigation report, released yesterday, said the cause of the collision with the Merkur, a German vessel, was twofold: there was no effective watch on the Silvery Sea and the Merkur did not take evasive action early enough.</p> <p>The report also concluded that the Silvery Sea, which had been heading for Esbjerg with five crew, all from Mallaig, and 530 tonnes of fish aboard, was overloaded. However, it would probably not have sunk if one of the starboard doors had been properly secured and if its collision bulkheads had been extended. The branch has recommended the extension of such bulkheads in fishing vessels.</p> <p>The Merkur had been travelling in fine weather at 15 knots when the trawler appeared on its radar screen. The container vessel did not change course because it was the Silvery Sea's responsibility to keep out of the way under international regulations. When it became clear that the trawler had not spotted them, the Merkur sounded a warning bell, but there was no response.</p> <p>The report said the Merkur's chief officer had wrongly assumed the Silvery Sea was keeping a proper lookout; as a result evasive action was left too late.</p> <p>The branch said there was no way to ascertain why the Silvery Sea did not have an effective watch. \"It can only be assumed that the watchkeeper on Silvery Sea had become incapacitated, or left the wheelhouse and allowed the vessel to continue on automatic helm.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A trawler which collided with a container vessel and sank with all hands had no proper lookout and was apparently overloaded with fish, according to an official accident report. The Silvery Sea, registered at Mallaig on the west coast of Scotland, went down off Denmark in June 1998. The marine accident investigation report, released yesterday, said the cause of the collision with the Merkur, a German vessel, was twofold: there was no effective watch on the Silvery Sea and the Merkur did not take evasive action early enough. The report also concluded that the Silvery Sea, which had been heading for Esbjerg with five crew, all from Mallaig, and 530 tonnes of fish aboard, was overloaded. However, it would probably not have sunk if one of the starboard doors had been properly secured and if its collision bulkheads had been extended. The branch has recommended the extension of such bulkheads in fishing vessels. The Merkur had been travelling in fine weather at 15 knots when the trawler appeared on its radar screen. The container vessel did not change course because it was the Silvery Sea's responsibility to keep out of the way under international regulations. When it became clear that the trawler had not spotted them, the Merkur sounded a warning bell, but there was no response. The report said the Merkur's chief officer had wrongly assumed the Silvery Sea was keeping a proper lookout; as a result evasive action was left too late. The branch said there was no way to ascertain why the Silvery Sea did not have an effective watch. \"It can only be assumed that the watchkeeper on Silvery Sea had become incapacitated, or left the wheelhouse and allowed the vessel to continue on automatic helm.\"",

In the name of both justice and accountability, reparations are owed to Rwanda by actors in the international community for their roles before, during, and since the genocide,\" the report finds.</p> <p>Besides the 800,000 people murdered, the report says that, \"hundreds of thousands more suffered unimaginable suffering and suffer still\".</p> <p>To bring survivors a measure of peace, the report says that all leaders of the genocide should be brought to justice, extradited from the countries - 11 of which are OAU members, plus France and Belgium - which are thought to be harbouring them.</p> <p>The report also calls for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, to be transferred to Rwanda - a long-standing demand of the Rwandan government.</p> <p>The OAU urges the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, to establish a commission to work out a formula for reparations, and says the money should go to urgently needed infrastructure and social services. In addition, the government's survivors' fund, which takes 5% of the annual budget, should receive generous contributions from the international community, the report says. And the special needs of women should take priority.</p> <p>It also urges the immediate cancellation of all Rwanda's debt, saying much of it was accumulated by the governments that planned and executed the genocide.</p> <p>The Rwanda report is sure to be the highlight of next week's summit in the Togolese capital, Lome. The summit's main focus will be on the dramatic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo which has split the continent; the continued fighting in the country involves a dozen countries, but has at its heart the aftermath of Rwanda's genocide.</p>",

A special report released today for the July 10-12 opening of this year's annual OAU summit parallels the requested reparations with the $13bn Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe after the second world war; at today's value that would be more than \u00a360bn. The uncompromising report names the United States and France in particular, along with the UN security council as a whole, as guilty parties who allowed \"this terrible conspiracy to go ahead\". It is written by a team headed by two former African heads of state, three former UN officials and a high court judge, and makes searing criticism of \"the international betrayal of Rwanda\". \"The United States had the influence within the security council to ensure the authorisation of a military mission that could have prevented the genocide...but the US made sure that no such force would ever reach Rwanda, even after it was known beyond question that one of the 20th century's greatest tragedies was unfolding,\" the report says. \"The French had unrivalled influence at the very highest levels of the Rwandan government and Rwandan military...[but] they chose never to exert that influence,\" it said. This is the first time that the OAU has committed itself to such a high-profile political intervention on behalf of one of its members. \"This is a real landmark for the OAU, of unprecedented boldness,\" said one African official. After two years of research, the report's authors go much further than was expected in their demand for reparations. The document will carry considerable weight well beyond Africa because of the influence of its signatories; Sir Quett Masire was president of Botswana from 1980 to 1997, General Ahmadou Tour\u00e9 was the president of Mali for 15 months from March 1991, Justice P N Bhagwati is a former chief justice of the Indian supreme court, while Stephen Lewis of Canada, Lisbet Palme of Sweden, senator Hocine Djoudi of Algeria, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia have all had distinguished careers in UN circles. \"Apologies alone are not adequate. In the name of both justice and accountability, reparations are owed to Rwanda by actors in the international community for their roles before, during, and since the genocide,\" the report finds. Besides the 800,000 people murdered, the report says that, \"hundreds of thousands more suffered unimaginable suffering and suffer still\". To bring survivors a measure of peace, the report says that all leaders of the genocide should be brought to justice, extradited from the countries - 11 of which are OAU members, plus France and Belgium - which are thought to be harbouring them. The report also calls for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, to be transferred to Rwanda - a long-standing demand of the Rwandan government. The OAU urges the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, to establish a commission to work out a formula for reparations, and says the money should go to urgently needed infrastructure and social services. In addition, the government's survivors' fund, which takes 5% of the annual budget, should receive generous contributions from the international community, the report says. And the special needs of women should take priority. It also urges the immediate cancellation of all Rwanda's debt, saying much of it was accumulated by the governments that planned and executed the genocide. The Rwanda report is sure to be the highlight of next week's summit in the Togolese capital, Lome. The summit's main focus will be on the dramatic situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo which has split the continent; the continued fighting in the country involves a dozen countries, but has at its heart the aftermath of Rwanda's genocide.",

If this sounds too gloomy to contemplate, fear not. There's a rumbustious gallows humour underpinning the drama as surely as Van Morrison's TB Sheets, which runs through it like a Greek chorus.</p> <p>This is Martin Scorsese's first collaboration with writer Paul Schrader since Taxi Driver and the parallels are obvious but what hits you is how fresh a film this is: there's never a hint of the tired re-tread that was Casino and the acting from Cage and his partners - John Goodman, Tom Sizemore and especially an exuberant Ving Rhames - feels like a joyous release from multiplex fodder into the real, and surreal, world. Cage is saving lives, but can he save his own? He gets the full Scorsese range of guilt, redemption and demons from the past (Scorsese and Schrader's past includes narcotic near-death experiences - they've been there, now it's our turn.) A seamless plot includes a doomed affair for Cage and Arquette (life? art? who knows?) and Cage's Catch-22-style attempts to get himself fired.</p> <p><strong> The Muse</strong><br>Retail and DVD (\u00a319.99) <br>Entertainment in Video Cert PG <br> **</p> <p>How to make a muse amusing? Albert Brooks, in one of his occasional actor-co-writer-director roles, has a go in a sketchy little film that's more a Hollywood in-joke than a full-blown comedy. It starts as our hero, a screenwriter, wins a humanitarian award. \"What exactly is a humanitarian?\" his daughter asks. \"It's someone who's never won the Oscar,\" she is told. That sets the tone for humour based entirely on Hollywood's rampant paranoia and insecurity.</p> <p>Despite the award, Brooks finds everyone suddenly feels that he's \"lost his edge\". Panicking, he goes to see successful old friend Jeff Bridges, who lets him in on the secret, a muse played by Sharon Stone as an impossibly demanding, fan-fluttering diva and daughter of Zeus (or Zoose, as they call it). Brooks's idea doesn't go much further than that as the plot trundles towards a rather lame twist, but there are incidental pleasures as she is visited by James Cameron and a wonderfully parodic Martin Scorsese as they anguish over a sequel to Titanic or a remake of Raging Bull. Amiable stuff, then, but for a film about screenwriters and muses, it's begging for a little divine inspiration.</p> <p><strong> Man with a Movie Camera </strong><br> DVD (\u00a319.99) <br>BFI Cert E <br> ****</p> <p>Dziga Vertov is a name from the distant documentary past that film students like to drop. This 1929 film about a Russian city shows why the name survives. It is a stunning display of one man trying out a new toy and celebrating the modern; and, 80 years later, it is weirdly postmodern. Vertov put himself (or his cameraman) in the film lugging his tripod through the streets or filming from a car driving alongside the action.</p> <p>His pyrotechnic montages and frantic splicing of images must have come as a shock to contemporary audiences. Film editing has rarely been as skilful or as frenetic and some tricks, like making a building collapse by folding the screen in the middle, seem more like 1999. His speeding up citizens in motion to look like ants might have been a first too.</p> <p>The film loves motion. Trams, trains and cars, big machines and factory production lines chug endlessly, sometimes contrasted with ancient-looking peasant faces. The film lends itself to musical accompaniment and has a choice of alternative scores, one from In the Nursery, who toured with the film last year. It builds to a raving climax, as if he saw modern life spinning out of control (the commentary tells us that Dziga Vertov is a made-up name translating roughly as Spinning Top.)</p>",

If this sounds too gloomy to contemplate, fear not. There's a rumbustious gallows humour underpinning the drama as surely as Van Morrison's TB Sheets, which runs through it like a Greek chorus. This is Martin Scorsese's first collaboration with writer Paul Schrader since Taxi Driver and the parallels are obvious but what hits you is how fresh a film this is: there's never a hint of the tired re-tread that was Casino and the acting from Cage and his partners - John Goodman, Tom Sizemore and especially an exuberant Ving Rhames - feels like a joyous release from multiplex fodder into the real, and surreal, world. Cage is saving lives, but can he save his own? He gets the full Scorsese range of guilt, redemption and demons from the past (Scorsese and Schrader's past includes narcotic near-death experiences - they've been there, now it's our turn.) A seamless plot includes a doomed affair for Cage and Arquette (life? art? who knows?) and Cage's Catch-22-style attempts to get himself fired. The Muse Retail and DVD (\u00a319.99) Entertainment in Video Cert PG ** How to make a muse amusing? Albert Brooks, in one of his occasional actor-co-writer-director roles, has a go in a sketchy little film that's more a Hollywood in-joke than a full-blown comedy. It starts as our hero, a screenwriter, wins a humanitarian award. \"What exactly is a humanitarian?\" his daughter asks. \"It's someone who's never won the Oscar,\" she is told. That sets the tone for humour based entirely on Hollywood's rampant paranoia and insecurity. Despite the award, Brooks finds everyone suddenly feels that he's \"lost his edge\". Panicking, he goes to see successful old friend Jeff Bridges, who lets him in on the secret, a muse played by Sharon Stone as an impossibly demanding, fan-fluttering diva and daughter of Zeus (or Zoose, as they call it). Brooks's idea doesn't go much further than that as the plot trundles towards a rather lame twist, but there are incidental pleasures as she is visited by James Cameron and a wonderfully parodic Martin Scorsese as they anguish over a sequel to Titanic or a remake of Raging Bull. Amiable stuff, then, but for a film about screenwriters and muses, it's begging for a little divine inspiration. Man with a Movie Camera DVD (\u00a319.99) BFI Cert E **** Dziga Vertov is a name from the distant documentary past that film students like to drop. This 1929 film about a Russian city shows why the name survives. It is a stunning display of one man trying out a new toy and celebrating the modern; and, 80 years later, it is weirdly postmodern. Vertov put himself (or his cameraman) in the film lugging his tripod through the streets or filming from a car driving alongside the action. His pyrotechnic montages and frantic splicing of images must have come as a shock to contemporary audiences. Film editing has rarely been as skilful or as frenetic and some tricks, like making a building collapse by folding the screen in the middle, seem more like 1999. His speeding up citizens in motion to look like ants might have been a first too. The film loves motion. Trams, trains and cars, big machines and factory production lines chug endlessly, sometimes contrasted with ancient-looking peasant faces. The film lends itself to musical accompaniment and has a choice of alternative scores, one from In the Nursery, who toured with the film last year. It builds to a raving climax, as if he saw modern life spinning out of control (the commentary tells us that Dziga Vertov is a made-up name translating roughly as Spinning Top.)",

He had 1,000 other expressions, but once he pointed to something that resembled the thing he was after and went through a few pantomimic gestures, the experienced man in the prop shop would put two and two together and finally supply him with the necessary article.\" </p> <p>Any gift Jack might have had for acting was hampered by the fact that he couldn't see without his glasses, which didn't stop Francis from calling on him for stunt work. \"Yeah, a sissy like you might get hurt,\" Francis would say to a worried actor. \"I'll have my little brother do it for you.\" At whatever he did, he was \"a hell of a smart cookie\", as propman Lefty Hough remembered. But his essentially covert personality was already firmly in place. \"[He was] a mysterious sort of guy,\" said Hough. \"Nobody ever got close to him.\" </p> <p>Jack was young and engaged in a great adventure: the romance of the movies, the birth of an art form. \"Those were great days,\" Ford wrote in 1946. \"We rode out in the morning in blue uniforms and army forage caps, while tied to our saddles would be grey blouses and black plumed slough hats. We would charge as Union soldiers, pull up and change into the grey blouses and charge back as Confederate soldiers... We used very few close-ups in those days. Nearly everything was played on horseback. It was all very fast moving. Motion, action, was the keynote of the times.\"</p> <p>Jack doubled for his brother and other actors in serials like Lucille Love. \"I had to drive over bridges, jump over ravines on horseback and things like that. I had just finished school and was fairly sprightly. I did everything.\" Once, he was doubling for his brother in a civil war picture, when a little bit too much gunpowder was used in a battle scene. The explosion, recalled Hough, \"put him in the hospital for six weeks. He never got over that. He blamed it on me, and I didn't do it, I had nothing to do with it, but he claimed that I was the instigator. [Actually] his brother Francis did it.\" </p> <p>Jack woke in the hospital with a broken arm. \"That was a close thing,\" Francis blithely said to his bruised younger brother. \"Another second and audiences would have realised I was using a double.\" </p> <p>John Ford was a man who remembered - no, who nurtured - a grievance. Nearly 20 years later, during the production of Judge Priest, he had Francis play a scene in a wheelbarrow in front of a general store. When Francis was distracted, Ford had an assistant tie a rope from the wheelbarrow to the axle of a prop carriage. As the heroine rode off in the carriage, Frank had his perch yanked out from under him and took a hard fall, swallowing his tobacco. \"That was for the grenade,\" Ford said shaking his finger under his brother's nose, as if Francis had pulled his stunt the previous week. </p> <p>At this point in his life, Jack appears to have been fairly social and very responsible; in September 1916, he joined the Knights of Columbus, and a month later he took out another insurance policy, paying $18 for $3,000 worth of coverage, again payable to his mother. Under \"Occupation\" he wrote: \"assistant motion picture director, not acrobat or gymnast\". </p> <p>His relationship to Francis didn't insulate him from the vicissitudes of studio life; there were frequent lay-offs at Universal, so he had to look elsewhere for work. He preserved a dismissal letter from LKO, a lowly comedy studio, dated February 3, 1917. Things couldn't have been too grim, for that same month he was purchasing two custom shirts for $10 apiece. </p> <p>To a great extent, the Jack Ford of this period was the John Ford who would be a world-famous film director in 1940. Even as a young man, he was very obviously Irish, and he had a crusty aura that signalled that he wasn't to be trifled with. \"There wasn't any 'Please step over this way',\" remembered [director] Allan Dwan. \"It was, 'Come on you bastards, get in line and shut up.' He was only 20 years old, but there was no doubt about who the boss was...\" </p> <p>Hollywood was full of Irish directors in the silent days - Rex Ingram, Herbert Brenon, William Desmond Taylor, Marshall Neilan, Allan Dwan, Joseph Henabery, William Wellman, Raoul Walsh - but Ford would be the only one to consistently play the professional Irishman, as if he was in the Foreign Legion without a countryman in sight. There was an element of performance in this, but Ford's assertiveness would also be a form of compensation for his insecurity. </p> <p>There are several variant versions of how Ford made the jump to the ranks of director. Ford's own version, repeated both to Peter Bogdanovich and others, was that he was pressed into service as a prop director, using a camera without film, to impress [the producer] Carl Laemmle, who had suddenly appeared from New York. \"I was just the prop boy...

Crush was distinctive for its mood of sexual foreboding, and for the way Maclean filmed the touristic backwaters of New Zealand, especially the ominously gurgling mud geysers of Rotorua. </p> <p>So what happened after Crush? It's a long story, so long that Maclean looks fatigued and relieved to have made it through. Born in Ottawa, she moved to New Zealand in her teens, and was already living in Sydney when she wrote Crush. That film was well received just about everywhere except New Zealand, where it was \"savaged\". She got a deal with Disney subsidiary Touchstone Pictures, and went to New York to look into filming Joan Didion's newsroom drama Up Close and Personal. It never happened, and the tear-jerking Michelle Pfeiffer vehicle it became shows Maclean was well out of it. </p> <p>Next Maclean devoted herself to projects that nearly came off. One was Bedlam, a remake of Val Lewton's 1946 Hogarthian chiller, a project intended by Martin Scorsese as a vehicle for his then partner Illeana Douglas. Then there was an offer from Wayne Wang and Tom Luddy (Francis Coppola's partner at Zoetrope) to contribute to a series of low-budget Asian pictures.</p> <p>\"I had a script for a Thai action film, not that I've ever seen a Thai action film,\" Maclean admits. She went to Bangkok to write it, but says: \"I shot myself in the foot and wrote it a little too expensive.\" Was she getting restless? \"That's an understatement. It's been nearly seven years. I've spent that time writing three feature scripts, going up the wall trying to get them financed.\"</p> <p>Ironically, it was someone else's script that got her started again. Jesus' Son is an unlikely adaptation, coming not from a novel but a short story collection. The connecting thread is narrator Fuckhead, a young junkie who drifts in and out of his own and other people's lives in early-70s midwest. Maclean read the book when it was published in 1992, and contacted its author Denis Johnson. But the project really kicked off three years later, when she got a call \"out of left field\" from the film's co-writers Elizabeth Cuthrell and David Urrutia. </p> <p>The film is remarkably true to the book's flavour and structure - a string of anecdotes which fade in and out, lose their drift, then abruptly find it again, moving in and out of sync with Fuckhead's addled brain. Author Johnson helped compile its soundtrack of ancient soul and bubblegum pop, and took a cameo as a man with a hunting knife jammed in his eye.</p> <p>Johnson's vision, trailerpark realism with hallucinatory metaphysical underpinnings, comes across intact. \"He actually thinks of himself as a Christian writer,\" Maclean says, \"but in a way that would compare to Flannery O'Connor, in that there's nothing pious about his writing. There's a lot of cruelty and extremes, yet it's concerned with questions of faith. He has his own mythology which comes out again and again, these angel and devil figures.\" </p> <p>Jesus' Son catches that other-worldly drift with its imagistic slips: a drive-in cinema becoming a haunted graveyard, a tattooed, snakeskinned Jesus (or Satan?) manifesting himself in a laundromat. Maclean's film stands out as one of the most convincing and non-sensationalist drug films, alongside Drugstore Cowboy. </p> <p>Following a spell in the glossy realms of TV drama, Jesus' Son takes Maclean back to the rough side. After a shaky start, she managed to establish herself as an American director with episodes of Homicide and Sex and the City: \"Homicide was a blast. You come into this well-oiled machine and there's a tremendous looseness about how they film it. You're for hire, you come in and do your best, then they want you out fast. You're not welcome any more. It's liberating not to be so personally invested in the content.\" </p> <p>Directing the first two episodes of Sex and the City, Maclean and illustrious cinematographer Maryse Alberti had a little more leeway to help invent the series' style: \"We worked out a look. They presumably hired us because they wanted something more cinematic. I felt that the producers got cold feet halfway through. They pretty much said, 'Look, just shoot them in close-up, all we care about is the humour and the lines.' But I think we were spoiled doing the first two. We had extra time and resources.\" </p> <p>As a writer-director, it must have been frustrating working on other people's material for so long - although on Jesus' Son, Maclean found it had its advantages. \"It's a relief because it's less intense. It's exciting to enter into someone else's sensibility and try to interpret things you're personally incapable of writing. In another way, it's a little harder. When you're working from your own material, you just know it on such a deep level.\"</p> <p>There's also the fact that on Jesus' Son the writers also controlled the pursestrings: two of them were also the producers. \"That's why it was more of a collaboration than anything I'd experienced. We had arguments, but amicable ones.\" Now, Maclean says: \"I'm dying to do my own material again. That's my highest priority.\" She hopes her next film will be Iris, a thriller about false memory that she is dusting down for another draft. Maybe we shouldn't hold our breath - but a year, or two, or seven from now, Maclean could surprise us again.</p> <p>\u0095 On general release.</p>",

They pretty much said, 'Look, just shoot them in close-up, all we care about is the humour and the lines.' But I think we were spoiled doing the first two. We had extra time and resources.\" As a writer-director, it must have been frustrating working on other people's material for so long - although on Jesus' Son, Maclean found it had its advantages. \"It's a relief because it's less intense. It's exciting to enter into someone else's sensibility and try to interpret things you're personally incapable of writing. In another way, it's a little harder. When you're working from your own material, you just know it on such a deep level.\" There's also the fact that on Jesus' Son the writers also controlled the pursestrings: two of them were also the producers. \"That's why it was more of a collaboration than anything I'd experienced. We had arguments, but amicable ones.\" Now, Maclean says: \"I'm dying to do my own material again. That's my highest priority.\" She hopes her next film will be Iris, a thriller about false memory that she is dusting down for another draft. Maybe we shouldn't hold our breath - but a year, or two, or seven from now, Maclean could surprise us again. \u0095 On general release.",

      "body": "<p>At one point during an hour of conversation, Alan Rudolph seems happy. Not what you might call ecstatic; just quietly, unaffectedly happy. It doesn't happen much more than once. But it happens. This is what it sounds like. </p> <p>\"You know, I've never been so proud of any of my films as I am of this. I mean, we did it in six weeks, with a dream cast, none of whom were really making any money and, well... making it was a magic carpet ride. A real magic carpet ride.\" He's talking about Breakfast of Champions, his impressively demented adaptation of the equally outlandish novel by Kurt Vonnegut concerning - in essence - a depressed used-car salesman, a dyspeptic sci-fi writer, and the meaning of life.</p> <p>It stars Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte and Albert Finney and, as a purely cinematic experience, it's about as wildly baroque as it gets. As a contender at US box offices, however, it sank faster than lead. Which, when he gets around to mentioning it, is roughly the moment where he stops sounding happy at all. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, of course, the magic carpet then crashed horribly to the ground when the film actually came out.\" And, in the space of a sentence, that's really the whole Alan Rudolph story. For almost 30 years, the California-bred son of a TV director has been ploughing his singular - and singularly unregarded - furrow on the Hollywood margins, first assisting his long-time mentor Robert Altman, then heading off to hone his own laidback, vaguely literary technique.</p> <p>Sure, many of the results have been critically well-received: his whimsical 1976 debut Welcome to LA, the quintessential mid-80s art-flick Trouble in Mind, 1997's mordant drama Afterglow. Now and then, he's even had the faintest of brushes with commercial success (or at least non-disaster). Mortal Thoughts, the 1991 thriller starring Bruce Willis and Demi Moore? Nearly made it. Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle, his deft, empathetic portrait of the eponymous Dorothy? Almost got there. </p> <p>But only nearly. Because, while Rudolph's films have grown better and more interesting as the years have passed, his elegant signature style has never quite registered beyond the art cinema. He remains the last great(ish) American director no one's ever heard of - or, as he puts it, \"someone who can't even blow his own trumpet, because he's always playing out of tune\". </p> <p>The thing is, he was kind of hoping Breakfast would buck the trend. Shortly after declaring - entirely sincerely - that \"I've never connected the commercial performance of a film with my own opinion of it,\" he lets slip as much with a sigh. \"Ah,\" he says, \"I did actually sort of think Breakfast could've done something at the box office. Certainly while I was editing, a lot of people around me thought this might be the one. Because, despite the supposed difficulties of the material, I had Nick and Albert and most of all Bruce. And that's a pretty formidable line-up.\" </p> <p>So what happened? \"Well, what sums it up was that I was at one of the festivals, and some guy stood up and said really very angrily: 'How could you get Bruce Willis, Nick Nolte and Albert Finney together and then make this?' And to me, he represented the entire industry. People just took against it.\" You can't help feeling that, while glumly accustomed to mass indifference, the combination of his zeal for the material - he first drafted the script in 1975 - and Willis's pulling power coming to nought got to him in a way he hadn't been got to in decades. </p> <p>Slowly, he exhales. \"I mean, to me, Breakfast had really become a way of looking at life. And people say the movie is dated, but I think if they didn't know the book was written in the 70s, that wouldn't even enter their minds. I mean, maybe it's because it's about a used-car salesman - people say it's been done before, but so has New York cop and no one raises an eyebrow at that. And to me a used-car salesman is still the single greatest symbol of, you know... good old American bullshit.\" </p> <p>There are two targets in his sights: the mainstream US critics \"who still have the power to destroy a little movie, and who used that power to blast the hell out of Breakfast\", and Disney, the film's American distributors. A snarl - small, but definite - enters his voice at their name: \"It was actually very ingenious and duplicitous the way Disney suppressed it because they suppressed it by releasing it. I mean, they released it in such a derisory fashion that no one knew it existed. In my opinion, they only wanted it so they could keep it quiet.\" </p> <p>No matter how circuitous the route, he keeps returning to the same bitter territory. I tell him the defiantly unhinged Breakfast reminded me of Terry Gilliam's similarly maligned take on another seminal counter-cultural bible, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And back we come. </p> <p>\"Well, I deliberately avoided seeing that because I knew there would be comparisons. Having said that, once again I could tell it was a good picture, just because of the way the establishment press slammed it.\" There's the briefest of pauses. \"I mean, what I will say is that we got great reactions from directors and actors. [Steven] Soderbergh saw it at the only screening we were ever given, and he's been trying to get Confederacy of Dunces made for years, and he told me, 'Now I know how to make it.' But critics\" - he gives a verbal shudder - \"really are a lazy, shallow, myopic and unenlightened band of people these days.\" He's got a point. Because, while it's hardly the most sophisticated film you're ever likely to see, neither is Breakfast the dumb, lysergic mess it could easily have dissolved into. </p> <p>And, with his evident fondness for his actors (he routinely describes them as \"the only artists in the process\") Rudolph teases out perhaps Willis's best performance since his flirtation with credibility in Gilliam's Twelve Monkeys. The director's affection for his leading man, whose clout ensured the film actually got made, sweetens the bile.</p> <p>\"I mean, here's Bruce,\" he declares, \"playing this character who's an icon in his community, who everyone thinks they know, and who's going through absolute turmoil. And for Bruce to select that role, and to play it so self-effacingly, and to make a connection between that character and his own life - that to me is amazing. One guy asked him why he wanted the part, and he said, 'Oh, because obviously I wouldn't know what it's like to have the whole world staring at you, and be screaming inside.' And for this cultural icon, whose fame has come from films which are basically mindless escapism, to have gone public and say to the world that he's trapped in a cage, then for the distributors and the critics not to allow people to hear him... well, that's criminal.\"</p> <p>Like I said, he's not happy. It's only when the talk turns to his place, or rather lack of one, in the film-business food chain that his tone softens, the anger replaced by a wry shrug. Operating without the cosy sanction of the indie pacesetters - \"I guess I'm just not very hip that way\" - he's also fully aware he's never likely to find himself fighting off ardent executives. The thought genuinely doesn't seem to bother him. </p> <p>\"No, I think I'm probably, as they would say, just completely off their radar. I mean, Altman always says that he makes hats and Hollywood makes shoes, but for me it's like Hollywood makes shoes and I grow asparagus. You know? I'm not even in the same simile. I mean, it's funny, because I'll have a script and I won't even think of taking it to a studio. They really haven't been part of my thought process for over 20 years. So I just try and get the financing and make these movies on my own.\" </p> <p>Even in the face of duplicitous distributors and shallow, unenlightened critics? He sniggers at his own adjectives. \"Oh, I don't think there's any great conspiracy,\" he says. \"I wouldn't flatter myself by thinking anyone's paying that much attention. You know, executives are afraid, and critics are afraid, so they play safe. I mean, merchandising is the biggest part of the movie industry, and the movie industry is one of America's biggest exports, and America leads the world in exports, so you see how important merchandising is and how much people's jobs depend on it. I mean, someone like me is always going to be hanging on my fingerprints - how could I ever compete with Mickey Mouse?\" I let him answer his own question. \"So...

      "body": "<p>For every indie auteur waiting for their credit-card-financed first movie to provoke a bidding war at Sundance, there's a Super 8-nurtured soul out there for whom the language of Hollywood is as indecipherable as ancient Greek. Mark Borchardt, a long-haired, goatee-bearded Milwaukee dude, is one such soul, and his crusade to make a horror movie - and use his family and friends as cast and crew - is spotlighted in American Movie, a documentary by Chris Smith and Sarah Price. </p> <p>American Movie is the story of Borchardt fighting, against the odds, to complete a movie called Coven, about an Alcoholics Anonymous group who are secret devil-worshippers. Over the two years that director Smith and producer Price spend with Borchardt, he deals with paternity suits, too much boozing, his uncle (and main financial backer) showing scepticism at his abilities, leading men being jailed, and his mum showing more interest in shopping than in being one of the coven's victims. </p> <p>Then, in the background, there's Borchardt's magnum opus, Northwestern, a portrait of his life yet to be made. He shares his problems with Mike Schank, an amiable, guitar-playing, heavy metal fan whose prodigious drug and alcohol intake a few years back has left him fried, but still capable of a well-timed pithy comment. </p> <p>In the wrong hands, this story could have been a voyeuristic look at the eccentricities of the mid-western working class, but Smith is smart enough to recognise Borchardt's intelligence and dignity. \"I met Mark in 1995 in Milwaukee, when he was abandoning Coven to make Northwestern,\" Smith explains. \"In his own esoteric way, he gave me a description of what the film would be. I thought if he could do half of what he's planning, it would be really interesting - he was so sincere about what he was trying to do. So I wanted to document that process, and capture his energy.\" </p> <p>Smith's original plan was to follow Borchardt as he travelled with his mum and dad to the Toronto film festival to raise money for Northwestern. One thing led to another, Northwestern never got made, and American Movie evolved into a portrait of Borchardt's life.</p> <p>\"Mark quit Northwestern to make Coven,\" explains Price. \"He said, 'I'm just going to finish off this other film, it'll only take a couple of weeks.' A couple of weeks turned into two years. My first impression was that he had an urgency about his life. He feels that he's already wasted a lot of time and that now he has to get on with it. When he was younger, he ran with a group of kids who all dropped out of school and spent their time drinking and getting into trouble, and he was just coming out of that world when we met him, and he was highly philosophical and articulate about it.\" </p> <p>But despite diverting influences, Borchardt knew his destiny from a young age. \"I could never relate to other people. I thought, 'Wow, this is a trip being alive,' and other people were just talking about what they saw on TV last night. Then one day when I was 14, I was walking to school and this dude had a Super 8 and he was filming all this stuff and I said, 'Wait a second. I can record all these ideas about the world on that film camera right there.' So I whipped out two 20s, man, and from that day on it was over, man, this is what I was going to do all my life.\" </p> <p>Borchardt's distinctive charm shines throughout the film. \"When I first met him, I had a stereotyped image of how someone who looked like that would be,\" says Smith. \"But there was a lot that surprised me, like the way he includes his mom in everything, and of how he places value on shovelling the snow from the sidewalk or mowing the lawn because he feels that's the right thing to do. He was constantly surprising and impressing us.\" </p> <p>For Borchardt and his friend Schank, the experience of being filmed for two years was, apparently, no big deal. \"It was totally cool,\" says Borchardt of the experience. \"That's me up there, man.\" Schank adds: \"Not only does Sarah look really good but they're really great, nice people and it's good to have their company.\"</p> <p>What Borchardt is most pleased about is that American Movie has helped him move closer to achieving his goal for Coven: selling 3,000 copies of the film on video. \"I've sold 2,500 of the 3,000 and they're going like nuts, so it did the trick, man. But let me explain something. People can not only earn money but maintain it and make more of it, or they can have goals in life, you know, to be bodybuilders and stuff like that, but you can go out at any time in life, so what I'd like to do is make the most out of each day, to eat good, to have some water and coffee and beer, to read, to write and all that stuff. So that's what I'm trying to learn, man. Making films has just got to be a part of my life. That's why I can never get into the film industry because that's just like having a factory job. I don't wanna work for somebody. Because believe it or not, this is the only one shot you get, dude.\" </p> <p>You can't help but wonder if the success of American Movie has changed Borchardt and Schank, but they seem to be taking it all in their stride. \"I've got an old girlfriend emailing me, and I've got a phone in my room which people can call, area code 414 466 M-I-K-E, and it's really fun talking to people all over the country and the world,\" says Mike Schank in monotone.</p> <p>\"The only reason I'd be in another movie is if, a) Mark was doing it and Mark is my friend and I think I'd have a good time, or b) it's like these people in Los Angeles are offering me $749 a day... well, what am I supposed to do? Am I meant to stay home and work for the neighbour for $30 a day busting my ass, or do something easy for $750 a day? I don't really care about their movies, I don't know what their goal is. But if they want me to be in their movie, whatever, you know. They're even offering to fly Mark out there and pay him $110 to hang out with me.\" </p> <p>For Borchardt, the goalposts haven't moved. Although he is pleased that the success of American Movie has helped him meet his hero, Dawn of the Dead director George Romero. \"I'm really, really not into Hollywood films because they're entertainment, and I'm not interested in entertaining people. I've seen two films this year and they were both critically acclaimed and I just thought, 'Oh man. I can't handle this crap any more.'</p> <p>\"There are beautiful films out there by Fellini, Godard - Alphaville blows me away, man - or the beauty of Rosemary's Baby. That Cassavetes is just in it to make money for his own films, and then you see his films and they're so cool... just two hours of this couple just arguing, man, it's amazing. I'd only do a film for someone else for a nice sum of money, man. People send me scripts and want me to star in stuff and it's all bullshit, it's all garbage, man. It's like Mike says, 'I'll take the money but I won't take their goal.' \" </p> <p>One of the best aspects of American Movie is its portrayal of the duo's friendship. Borchardt describes Schank as the nicest person he has ever met, and seems prepared to do anything to help out his friend. The two bonded over their love of drinking litres of vodka together, at a time when Schank was taking prodigious amounts of acid and smoking pot. He's been clean for five years, having given up drink and drugs just before filming began.</p> <p>\"A lot of people can really relate to the drug aspect of myself,\" says Borchardt of the film. \"I had one dude who called me and he did five hits of acid and watched American Movie and now I'm his god. All I do now is nicotine, caffeine and what the doctor gives me. I used to think things look better when you're on acid, but actually things look better when you're straight. Although a lot of people say they got burnt out after they smoked a lot of weed and acid, I never did. I never had any bad effects from partying.\" </p> <p>\"You never had any bad effects from partying? Dude, you almost died! What are you talking about?\" </p> <p>Smith and Price have stayed friends with Borchardt and Schank.

      "bodyText": "For every indie auteur waiting for their credit-card-financed first movie to provoke a bidding war at Sundance, there's a Super 8-nurtured soul out there for whom the language of Hollywood is as indecipherable as ancient Greek. Mark Borchardt, a long-haired, goatee-bearded Milwaukee dude, is one such soul, and his crusade to make a horror movie - and use his family and friends as cast and crew - is spotlighted in American Movie, a documentary by Chris Smith and Sarah Price. American Movie is the story of Borchardt fighting, against the odds, to complete a movie called Coven, about an Alcoholics Anonymous group who are secret devil-worshippers. Over the two years that director Smith and producer Price spend with Borchardt, he deals with paternity suits, too much boozing, his uncle (and main financial backer) showing scepticism at his abilities, leading men being jailed, and his mum showing more interest in shopping than in being one of the coven's victims. Then, in the background, there's Borchardt's magnum opus, Northwestern, a portrait of his life yet to be made. He shares his problems with Mike Schank, an amiable, guitar-playing, heavy metal fan whose prodigious drug and alcohol intake a few years back has left him fried, but still capable of a well-timed pithy comment. In the wrong hands, this story could have been a voyeuristic look at the eccentricities of the mid-western working class, but Smith is smart enough to recognise Borchardt's intelligence and dignity. \"I met Mark in 1995 in Milwaukee, when he was abandoning Coven to make Northwestern,\" Smith explains. \"In his own esoteric way, he gave me a description of what the film would be. I thought if he could do half of what he's planning, it would be really interesting - he was so sincere about what he was trying to do. So I wanted to document that process, and capture his energy.\" Smith's original plan was to follow Borchardt as he travelled with his mum and dad to the Toronto film festival to raise money for Northwestern. One thing led to another, Northwestern never got made, and American Movie evolved into a portrait of Borchardt's life. \"Mark quit Northwestern to make Coven,\" explains Price. \"He said, 'I'm just going to finish off this other film, it'll only take a couple of weeks.' A couple of weeks turned into two years. My first impression was that he had an urgency about his life. He feels that he's already wasted a lot of time and that now he has to get on with it.

      "body": "<p><strong> Saturday, July 1, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire </strong></p> <p> To kill two birds with one stone, I decided to read the opening chapter of Sty! to William as a bedtime story. The political and philosophical sub-text will be beyond him, but I hoped that the narrative would grip him. After a few paragraphs, he bleated that he wanted a Noddy And Big Ears story, but I persevered. </p> <p> Peter Pig lifted his porcine head from the trough and looked up at the mercilessly grey East-Midlands sky. A cloud, which looked like a Boots cotton-wool ball, scudded across the aforementioned sky like a Eurostar train leaving Waterloo station. </p> <p> Peter sighed and walked around the sty. The filth and mud oozed between his trotters. It was disgusting, the condition he had to live in, he thought. Why should farmer Hogg and his wife, Pamela, enjoy the comfort of carpets and vinyl tiles under foot while he and his fellow pigs be condemned to wading through their own excrement. </p> <p> Peter looked over the sty, towards the patio where farmer Hogg and Pamela were holding a barbecue for their friends.</p> <p> The foul stench caused by pork fat dripping on Do It All charcoal briquettes drifted over to him, causing his eyes to run. </p> <p> He listened to the conversations of the humans as they gorged on their buffet, which Pamela had been preparing since the Archers finished on the radio. </p> <p> Peter watched the guests quaffing Bucks Fizz and longed to feel the liquid in his own mouth. He looked across the sty to where his fellow pigs, Antonia and Miles, were having a heated discussion about the nature of existence. Peter sighed, he was sick of philosophical debate. It was just his luck to be trapped in a sty with two intellectuals. How he craved for small talk! He twitched his ears towards the patio. He strained to hear the conversation. </p> <p> 'Well, I'm sick of it,' said a grey-haired man called Ken, 'after all Mo's been through.' </p> <p> A well-presented woman called Barbara hissed: 'Not here, Ken, there's a chap called Derek from the Ashby Gazette standing by the gherkin jar.' </p> <p> 'I won't be silenced,' Ken thundered. 'It's unmanly of Tony to stab her in the back.' </p> <p> From the sty, Peter watched as Derek turned from the pickle jar, took out his reporter's notebook and edged towards Ken and Barbara . </p> <p> It was at this point that William started whining about wanting a Noddy story. However, I continued with Sty! for a few more lines. </p> <p> Another group of people provided the small talk that Peter thirsted for. From a woman in white jeans, he heard: 'We do support the comprehensive system, but our children are terribly sensitive, so.' And a man wearing wire Raybans opined:</p> <p> 'House prices have got to come down soon. We bought ours for...' </p> <p> Peter was in heaven. Later that night, the barbecue long extinguished, Peter looked up at the stars and ruminated on the nature of small talk. To help him sleep, he practised the art. He selected one of his favourite topics: 'Call this a summer? I can't remember the last time the sun shone.' </p> <p> Within minutes, William was asleep. </p> <p><strong> Sunday, July 2 </strong></p> <p> I loathe Noddy, but I had promised William, so I made up the following story. </p> <p> It was Big Ears' birthday, so, to celebrate, Noddy drove his car to Toytown. The pals went from pub to pub, drinking pints of beer. Big Ears' face got very red and the bell on Noddy's hat rang like mad. When they came out of the last pub, a gang of Skittles accused Big Ears of being a pervert, and started a fight. Mr Plod was called and saw Noddy head-butting the largest Skittle. </p> <p> 'Hi ham takin' you to the nearest cash point,' said Mr Plod. 'Tell me your PIN number Noddy.' But, sadly, Noddy was too drunk to remember, so Mr Plod hit him hard on the head with his truncheon instead. </p> <p> Good night.</p>",

Peter looked over the sty, towards the patio where farmer Hogg and Pamela were holding a barbecue for their friends. The foul stench caused by pork fat dripping on Do It All charcoal briquettes drifted over to him, causing his eyes to run. He listened to the conversations of the humans as they gorged on their buffet, which Pamela had been preparing since the Archers finished on the radio. Peter watched the guests quaffing Bucks Fizz and longed to feel the liquid in his own mouth. He looked across the sty to where his fellow pigs, Antonia and Miles, were having a heated discussion about the nature of existence. Peter sighed, he was sick of philosophical debate. It was just his luck to be trapped in a sty with two intellectuals. How he craved for small talk! He twitched his ears towards the patio. He strained to hear the conversation. 'Well, I'm sick of it,' said a grey-haired man called Ken, 'after all Mo's been through.' A well-presented woman called Barbara hissed: 'Not here, Ken, there's a chap called Derek from the Ashby Gazette standing by the gherkin jar.' 'I won't be silenced,' Ken thundered. 'It's unmanly of Tony to stab her in the back.' From the sty, Peter watched as Derek turned from the pickle jar, took out his reporter's notebook and edged towards Ken and Barbara . It was at this point that William started whining about wanting a Noddy story. However, I continued with Sty! for a few more lines. Another group of people provided the small talk that Peter thirsted for. From a woman in white jeans, he heard: 'We do support the comprehensive system, but our children are terribly sensitive, so.' And a man wearing wire Raybans opined: 'House prices have got to come down soon. We bought ours for...' Peter was in heaven. Later that night, the barbecue long extinguished, Peter looked up at the stars and ruminated on the nature of small talk. To help him sleep, he practised the art. He selected one of his favourite topics: 'Call this a summer? I can't remember the last time the sun shone.' Within minutes, William was asleep. Sunday, July 2 I loathe Noddy, but I had promised William, so I made up the following story. It was Big Ears' birthday, so, to celebrate, Noddy drove his car to Toytown. The pals went from pub to pub, drinking pints of beer. Big Ears' face got very red and the bell on Noddy's hat rang like mad. When they came out of the last pub, a gang of Skittles accused Big Ears of being a pervert, and started a fight. Mr Plod was called and saw Noddy head-butting the largest Skittle. 'Hi ham takin' you to the nearest cash point,' said Mr Plod. 'Tell me your PIN number Noddy.' But, sadly, Noddy was too drunk to remember, so Mr Plod hit him hard on the head with his truncheon instead. Good night.",
