      "body": "<p>High street banks would never make their customers queue for six days in one of their branches, yet according to new research this is precisely what many financial firms expect of customers trying to bank over the internet. </p> <p>At a time when many banks are closing branches and trying to lure customers into cyberspace instead, the research shows that 61% of companies may be failing to meet customer expectations. </p> <p>The research was commissioned by Microsoft and Onyx, an e-business software house. </p> <p>Samia Rauf, marketing director at Onyx, said that \"mystery shopping\" of 126 financial firms also showed that many responses consisted of standard information rather than personal replies. </p> <p>\"These results do not speak of an industry preparing itself for revolution. </p> <p>\"Nor do they speak of an industry that knows how to sell to its customers,\" says the report's author, Paul Gant, from management consultancy Market Elan. </p> <p>The researchers tried to contact 126 financial firms, including the major high street banks, investment banks and building societies, between January and March over the internet. They found that 31% did not have a website or had one which did not allow them to submit an electronic request for information. </p> <p>Of those to which a request could be made, 26% failed to respond at all, while a further 17% took six days or longer to reply. </p> <p>Of the companies which did reply to the request for information, 80% of them did not bother to follow up the \"mystery shopper\" - by telephoning, for instance. </p> <p>Ms Rauf said she was surprised by the research. \"If you go into a bank branch you are not going to stand there for six days waiting for someone to deal with you,\" she said. </p> <p>She said the internet, through which customers could fire off requests for information about products from hundreds of firms, was all about speed. \"It's a race for which of the firms responds first,\" she said. </p> <p>Ms Rauf suggested that one of the reasons the firms appeared so badly equipped might be a breakdown in communication within their organisation: for instance the marketing department may have set up the website but not consulted with the IT department properly about how to best use it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "High street banks would never make their customers queue for six days in one of their branches, yet according to new research this is precisely what many financial firms expect of customers trying to bank over the internet. At a time when many banks are closing branches and trying to lure customers into cyberspace instead, the research shows that 61% of companies may be failing to meet customer expectations. The research was commissioned by Microsoft and Onyx, an e-business software house. Samia Rauf, marketing director at Onyx, said that \"mystery shopping\" of 126 financial firms also showed that many responses consisted of standard information rather than personal replies. \"These results do not speak of an industry preparing itself for revolution. \"Nor do they speak of an industry that knows how to sell to its customers,\" says the report's author, Paul Gant, from management consultancy Market Elan. The researchers tried to contact 126 financial firms, including the major high street banks, investment banks and building societies, between January and March over the internet. They found that 31% did not have a website or had one which did not allow them to submit an electronic request for information. Of those to which a request could be made, 26% failed to respond at all, while a further 17% took six days or longer to reply. Of the companies which did reply to the request for information, 80% of them did not bother to follow up the \"mystery shopper\" - by telephoning, for instance. Ms Rauf said she was surprised by the research. \"If you go into a bank branch you are not going to stand there for six days waiting for someone to deal with you,\" she said. She said the internet, through which customers could fire off requests for information about products from hundreds of firms, was all about speed. \"It's a race for which of the firms responds first,\" she said. Ms Rauf suggested that one of the reasons the firms appeared so badly equipped might be a breakdown in communication within their organisation: for instance the marketing department may have set up the website but not consulted with the IT department properly about how to best use it.",

Book time to talk Bosses are busy and so are you. But neither of you will bond while you're second-guessing his/her needs or style of working. Book an appointment to talk. Be assertive and avoid nervous waffle or serious attempts at brown-nosing. Be specific with your questions and ask him/ her how they like to operate. If they're good they will even divulge any foibles and quirks, which is always supremely helpful. Work from this list when you are dealing with him/her, rather than the 'urban legend' variety that will have been passed down to you from colleagues. Speak for yourself Hopefully, the relationship will be two-way. Use the session to tell your boss how you like to work as well. This should be seen as a flexible negotiation, although you need to be clear about what is and isn't negotiable, if asked. If you can't work late or you won't do certain kinds of jobs, like making tea and personal chores, then this is the best time to bring it up. Quick tips: \u0095 Never harp on about how your last boss did it better \u0095 Keep an open mind. Never judge before you have met \u0095 and then reserve judgment for a while. People need a long 'breaking in' period before the real relationship starts to form \u0095 Lower your expectations. Don't expect a friend, mentor, advisor and mother/father figure who has the wisdom of Solomon and personality of a saint. Bosses are human. Your objective is to work well together, even if you dislike one another \u0095 Make it your job to keep the communication lines open \u0095 Be honest and assertive \u0095 You're not clairvoyant and neither is your boss. If you don't know something - ask.",

David O'Leary refers to them as his \"babies\" and, rather like infants who have spent too long learning at the knee of their elders, they are now tired, open to distraction and a little bit grumpy. For O'Leary the aim has always been to gain a place in next season's Champions League but the dream is now fast fading. Yesterday they squandered a two-goal advantage and, even when the chance of redemption presented itself midway through the second half, it was spurned, Ian Harte driving his penalty wide after Harry Kewell had been upended by Nikos Dabizas. \"No matter how well you play you cannot, as a manager, legislate for defensive mistakes and for missed chances,\" said O'Leary. \"I have told them in the dressing room that this was definitely two points lost rather than one point gained.

Up on Tyneside they still gather early to discuss the merits of team selection to the strains of Jimi Hendrix, the Small Faces and, of course, the Animals. It is quaint and all rather reassuring. The local purists argue that, while the current Newcastle team still embody traditional Geordie values, the need to succeed has, at long last, eclipsed the self-defeating desire to entertain even during dangerous moments. Winning is all in modern football and, even if Bobby Robson were to slip into retirement this morning, his enormous legacy would be the sense of organisation and discipline that he has brought to a team which collectively now acknowledges that mavericks usually come, at best, second. Not that Newcastle were particularly well organised throughout yesterday's opening half; Leeds cut them to ribbons with the sort of sublime movement which carried them to the threshold of famous triumph before the fates conspired dramatically to reduce their effectiveness. For the first time for some weeks Leeds actually played well and, with no one in a black-and-white shirt prepared to drop deep to try to nullify the threat of Harry Kewell, every attack was laden with rich promise. Although Kieron Dyer struck the foot of a post inside the opening minute, Leeds should have been over the hill, far away and grinning broadly long before Alan Shearer sparked Newcastle's recovery with a fine headed goal from Didier Domi's cross on 24 minutes. Puncturing the Newcastle defence was so simple that Leeds almost seemed to tire of the process. They were to score twice in five minutes during this spell of total dominance, Michael Bridges striking first with a fabulous, rising drive from 16-yards after Dabizas had failed to intercept a Jason Wilcox cross. Wilcox was to score himself shortly afterwards, a curious goal for, while Bridges jumped to meet his curling free-kick, there was apparently no contact and the ball drifted on just inside the far post. Three minutes into a second half which was too bullish to hold genuine appeal the England captain turned smartly to score from close range after Leeds had failed to clear Aaron Hughes' shot from the edge of the penalty area.

      "body": "<p>As Kevin Phillips added his personal contribution to Sheffield Wednesday's obituary it was as though the grim reality had finally sunk in at Hillsborough. </p> <p>At the final whistle Gilles de Bilde, the man who goes by the name of Animal in his native Belgium, had been reduced to the role of pussycat. It was a numbing sight, De Bilde down and out in the centre circle, rubbing his reddened eyes and attempting to conceal his crumpled features. </p> <p>As the Wednesday team departed the scene almost two hours later, his bottom lip was quivering again and those within his vicinity had cause to fear another bout of waterworks. \"I cannot remember feeling so low. I'm very emotional,\" he sighed. </p> <p>\"The manager has told us to get this out of our system, but how?

At the final whistle Gilles de Bilde, the man who goes by the name of Animal in his native Belgium, had been reduced to the role of pussycat. It was a numbing sight, De Bilde down and out in the centre circle, rubbing his reddened eyes and attempting to conceal his crumpled features. As the Wednesday team departed the scene almost two hours later, his bottom lip was quivering again and those within his vicinity had cause to fear another bout of waterworks. \"I cannot remember feeling so low. I'm very emotional,\" he sighed. \"The manager has told us to get this out of our system, but how?

There again, fewer still would have foreseen Chelsea struggling to find any route of re-entry into Europe. But the unthinkable must have crossed the minds of many on Saturday. </p> <p>On this evidence Gianluca Vialli's team will surely fail in the primary objective - one of the top three places offering Champions League qualification. And given their forbidding fixtures against the leading trio, Chelsea will struggle to oust even a frazzled Leeds from the fourth spot guaranteeing Uefa Cup football. That leaves the FA Cup and, suddenly, Stamford Bridge is not making cosy assumptions about the Wembley outcome. </p> <p>As insurance Chelsea have applied for the InterToto Cup, the last-chance saloon of European football. A far cry, indeed, from the original path to glory envisaged by some only a few months ago when Chelsea were being tipped to exploit Manchester United's Brazilian distraction. Little wonder that Ken Bates's club seem in no hurry to set up new contract talks with Vialli, who has another year left on his current deal. </p> <p>On the day United cantered to their latest title, hard on a \u00a319m deal for Ruud van Nistelrooy - priced out of Chelsea's reach - it was even more dispiriting that Vialli seemed to see the \"gap\" between United and the others as a gulf. </p> <p>In England, said Vialli, United are \"at the moment out of everybody's league\". One of the reasons is that \"they have a very strong base of young, talented English players\". And, foreign or British, \"they can afford to buy the best\". How can Chelsea compete? \"We've got to be even smarter.\" </p> <p>Smarter at least than Chelsea's manager was here, would say the fans who greeted the final whistle with booing after howling derision at the substitution of Gianfranco Zola rather than the ineffectual Chris Sutton just past the hour. </p> <p>Didier Deschamps was anonymous, Bernard Lambourde inadequate and Chelsea were again vulnerable at set pieces. Hamilton Ricard will seldom score an easier goal than his equaliser, volleyed in from two yards after Gianluca Festa, unchallenged, headed back Christian Ziege's corner. </p> <p>Until then Chelsea had dominated. Gustavo Poyet headed home from a corner, Zola curled a shot just wide and Dennis Wise showed up Paul Ince's claims to be a better midfield choice for England. </p> <p>Ince responded with a forceful second half in which he drove against a post, matching Gabriele Ambrosetti's shot against the woodwork. Tit-for-tat continued as Mark Schwarzer saved superbly from Poyet and Ed de Goey turned over Ricard's point-blank effort. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Few would have thought last summer that Chelsea would go within seven minutes of reaching the Champions League semi-finals. There again, fewer still would have foreseen Chelsea struggling to find any route of re-entry into Europe. But the unthinkable must have crossed the minds of many on Saturday. On this evidence Gianluca Vialli's team will surely fail in the primary objective - one of the top three places offering Champions League qualification. And given their forbidding fixtures against the leading trio, Chelsea will struggle to oust even a frazzled Leeds from the fourth spot guaranteeing Uefa Cup football. That leaves the FA Cup and, suddenly, Stamford Bridge is not making cosy assumptions about the Wembley outcome. As insurance Chelsea have applied for the InterToto Cup, the last-chance saloon of European football. A far cry, indeed, from the original path to glory envisaged by some only a few months ago when Chelsea were being tipped to exploit Manchester United's Brazilian distraction. Little wonder that Ken Bates's club seem in no hurry to set up new contract talks with Vialli, who has another year left on his current deal. On the day United cantered to their latest title, hard on a \u00a319m deal for Ruud van Nistelrooy - priced out of Chelsea's reach - it was even more dispiriting that Vialli seemed to see the \"gap\" between United and the others as a gulf. In England, said Vialli, United are \"at the moment out of everybody's league\". One of the reasons is that \"they have a very strong base of young, talented English players\". And, foreign or British, \"they can afford to buy the best\". How can Chelsea compete? \"We've got to be even smarter.\" Smarter at least than Chelsea's manager was here, would say the fans who greeted the final whistle with booing after howling derision at the substitution of Gianfranco Zola rather than the ineffectual Chris Sutton just past the hour. Didier Deschamps was anonymous, Bernard Lambourde inadequate and Chelsea were again vulnerable at set pieces. Hamilton Ricard will seldom score an easier goal than his equaliser, volleyed in from two yards after Gianluca Festa, unchallenged, headed back Christian Ziege's corner. Until then Chelsea had dominated. Gustavo Poyet headed home from a corner, Zola curled a shot just wide and Dennis Wise showed up Paul Ince's claims to be a better midfield choice for England. Ince responded with a forceful second half in which he drove against a post, matching Gabriele Ambrosetti's shot against the woodwork. Tit-for-tat continued as Mark Schwarzer saved superbly from Poyet and Ed de Goey turned over Ricard's point-blank effort.",

But I'm 31 and, if I'm not picked now, then I will never be.\" Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, the French striker on loan from Lyon whom Redknapp is eager to sign permanently, completed West Ham's rout with a header at the far post after Coventry's goalkeeper Magnus Hedman had flapped unsuccessfully at Di Canio's corner. The Italian also set up the Hammers' first, a 25-yarder from Michael Carrick, and the second, a glancing header from Javier Margas. For both players they were first goals for the club. It was that kind of day. Di Canio added numbers three and four, the first having picked the ball up on the halfway line, driven past David Burrows and fired home from the edge of the area. His second followed a neat interchange with Scott Minto, Di Canio calmly slotting home after deceiving two defenders. Coventry's misery was compounded by the loss of Colin Hendry with a fractured eye socket. Their manager Gordon Strachan, who has not seen his side win away for more than a year, called Coventry's display \"embarrassing\". Burrows gave credit to Di Canio. \"I've got sore ankles and a sore groin from chasing him,\" the full-back said. \"West Ham have now got a big star here.\"",

      "body": "<p>Ten days ago, along with most of British television, I was at the giant Mip TV market in Cannes. Here in an ugly concrete bunker the world's distributors and producers meet to sell their television wares. </p> <p>Mip reduces television to the level of a huge car-boot sale, a street market on Chablis. Beneath the elegant dinners and parties on the beach there is little or no difference between Mip and Petticoat Lane. </p> <p>Despite this, a visit to Mip is an important reminder not just of the global nature of our industry but also of what priorities sit outside our very particular television culture. The latest pronouncements of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, or the BBC's views on the future of costume drama, pale into insignificance amid the global selling frenzy on the Croisette at Cannes. This year the world seemed interested in only four subjects: sex, crime, natural disasters and whether the French, the Germans or the Belgians now controlled Channel 5. </p> <p>My visit to Mip was preceded by a trip to Aberystwyth to address the Celtic Film and Television Festival. Here was an utterly contrasting world, a different planet to the craziness of Cannes. For a start, you can fly direct to France in two hours, but the Aberystwyth train takes five hours. Second, such is the Celtic ability to drink their own distilleries dry that this festival is informally known as the Whiskey Olympics. </p> <p>Much more important, the delegates at Aberystwyth were passionate about film and television, rather than \"product\", searching for ways not only to protect but to enhance their cultural identity in the face of the global uniformity on display in Cannes. </p> <p>In this context, Chris Smith has, quite rightly, recently highlighted the importance of regional broadcasting. </p> <p>On the other hand, the government has, also quite rightly, been stressing the importance of increasing exports of our television programmes at markets like Mip. </p> <p>The secretary of state's twin ambitions are not as contradictory as they appear to be. There is no reason why producers cannot serve their audience regionally, nationally and internationally. Indeed, each of these ambitions can feed the other. </p> <p>In ITV, regionality is one of our defining characteristics, part of our personality, a crucial difference from other broadcasters. Regional producers have a huge pride in serving their communities and deliver a good-quality, diverse service to viewers.

      "bodyText": "Ten days ago, along with most of British television, I was at the giant Mip TV market in Cannes. Here in an ugly concrete bunker the world's distributors and producers meet to sell their television wares. Mip reduces television to the level of a huge car-boot sale, a street market on Chablis. Beneath the elegant dinners and parties on the beach there is little or no difference between Mip and Petticoat Lane. Despite this, a visit to Mip is an important reminder not just of the global nature of our industry but also of what priorities sit outside our very particular television culture. The latest pronouncements of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, or the BBC's views on the future of costume drama, pale into insignificance amid the global selling frenzy on the Croisette at Cannes. This year the world seemed interested in only four subjects: sex, crime, natural disasters and whether the French, the Germans or the Belgians now controlled Channel 5. My visit to Mip was preceded by a trip to Aberystwyth to address the Celtic Film and Television Festival. Here was an utterly contrasting world, a different planet to the craziness of Cannes. For a start, you can fly direct to France in two hours, but the Aberystwyth train takes five hours. Second, such is the Celtic ability to drink their own distilleries dry that this festival is informally known as the Whiskey Olympics. Much more important, the delegates at Aberystwyth were passionate about film and television, rather than \"product\", searching for ways not only to protect but to enhance their cultural identity in the face of the global uniformity on display in Cannes. In this context, Chris Smith has, quite rightly, recently highlighted the importance of regional broadcasting. On the other hand, the government has, also quite rightly, been stressing the importance of increasing exports of our television programmes at markets like Mip. The secretary of state's twin ambitions are not as contradictory as they appear to be. There is no reason why producers cannot serve their audience regionally, nationally and internationally. Indeed, each of these ambitions can feed the other. In ITV, regionality is one of our defining characteristics, part of our personality, a crucial difference from other broadcasters. Regional producers have a huge pride in serving their communities and deliver a good-quality, diverse service to viewers. They understand that output rooted in these communities and from time to time reflecting those lives back to the nation as a whole is a huge plus for ITV. It puts us in touch with our audience. Good regional production is not just a cultural but a commercial asset. ITV companies know that a threadbare regional schedule would be commercial suicide because many regional programmes win audiences which are big or bigger than the network average. In Wales for example, HTV's ratings for current affairs, consumer journalism or entertainment would make a scheduler at any London network green with envy. Yet, the television mirror must do more than reflect its own regions. We need to know what the stories are in other parts of these lands. Whether it's the dark landscape of Inspector Rebus's Edinburgh or the lives of gay young men in Manchester, we must explore other people's worlds. I n an integrated system where regional output is linked to a strong network base, ITV regional production can flow into network programmes. So, the story of the babies who died after heart surgery in Bristol, for example, can start in a region and then graduate onto national television. Good regional production is the first stepping stone which can eventually lead to national and international production. So, regional output is precious, but in a fiercely competitive multi-channel world it is as vulnerable as any other part of contemporary television. We need to find strategies to support regional talent so that it does not inevitably migrate to London. Why shouldn't ITV, BBC, C4 and others join together to ensure that talent is not only nurtured but kept in the regions?

      "body": "<p>It all goes really well until the dispatch rider asks me if I got it from Fisher-Price. Cheeky bugger. And no, it's not mine. I'm just trying it out for the afternoon, OK? </p> <p>I end up telling a lot of people it isn't mine. Dispatch riders are the worst - they look at it with utter contempt. And the fashionable people of London's fashionable Hoxton aren't great either. I take a spin through the area, it being the place to be right now, and me being on - or should that be \"in\"? - what I had naively imagined was something to be seen on/in. But they look away, embarrassed, or openly pity me. </p> <p>Others are more charitable. A boy in the back of a people carrier gives me the thumbs up. Some Italian tourists on top of an open topped tour bus video me. A man selling the Big Issue in King's Cross looks genuinely delighted by the spectacle and shouts \"Wicked, man\". </p> <p>It's the C1, the world's first bike/car hybrid according to the people at BMW. I don't know about that; it has two wheels right? That, in my book, makes it a bike; cars have four wheels. The C1 is a scooter with a roof - presumably to protect the driver from rocks hurled by disdainful dispatch riders, or Longbridge sympathisers when they spot the little blue and white BMW symbol. </p> <p>But what's this? Seatbelts; that's not very scootery. Plus a windscreen wiper? And the basic model costs \u00a33,945 - hardly scooter money. On the other hand, it doesn't exactly have the people carrying capabilities of a car; you're not supposed to carry someone on the back so there's only room for one - that's exactly half the number of people as my Vespa carries. This is getting confusing. Maybe the people at BMW were right. </p> <p>Whatever, I set off from the office in Covent Garden (they've handed over the marketing side of things to a posh PR company for the C1 - we could be talking \"lifestyle\" product here), do a couple of laps of Trafalgar square and head off up the Mall. </p> <p>It takes a while to get used to the C1. Everything works well, the brakes are brilliant, but it's quite different to driving a scooter. For a start the centre of gravity is a bit higher so it feels wobblier and on this particular day there's a wicked April gale blowing through London, especially over Waterloo bridge, and I'm being buffeted all over the place. It's also less manoeuvrable so you can't weave like you can on a scooter or small bike. And the extra weight means it's not so quick away from the lights as a 125cc scooter. </p> <p>When it comes to parking up, the two-lever stand lowering system, though clever, is perhaps a little over- complicated. And you can't squeeze a C1 into the same tiny gaps in bike parks as you can with a scooter. (Crap name too - have they forgotten the C5, Clive Sinclair's ill-fated experiment?). </p> <p>There are two major pluses though. When an April shower hits you don't get wet (at least not from above). And you feel reasonably safe, much less vulnerable and exposed than on a scooter. The driver is strapped in between shoulder height protective bars, there's an impact absorbing front mudguard and, of course, that rigid aluminium roll-over cage. In a safety video, a crash test dummy comes out a lot better after driving his C1 into a car than doing the same with a conventional bike. This has got to be the main selling point of the thing. In most European countries you don't have to wear a helmet in a C1. Here you do, but that might change. </p> <p>So would I trade in my Vespa for a C1? I don't think so. Longbridge aside, I think four grand is too much to pay for something with only two wheels and a125cc engine. (The executive model - with mobile phone holder and reading light is \u00a34470, but I never find much time for reading on my bike.) Although the C1 is a very clever design and clearly the future and all that, I have a slight problem with the way it looks. It may have been that Fisher-Price comment that did it. </p> <p>But if I was someone who drove a car to work, and wanted to get there a bit quicker, but was scared to get on a bike, I might think about one. So long as the route to work didn't go through Hoxton.</p>",

I take a spin through the area, it being the place to be right now, and me being on - or should that be \"in\"? - what I had naively imagined was something to be seen on/in. But they look away, embarrassed, or openly pity me. Others are more charitable. A boy in the back of a people carrier gives me the thumbs up. Some Italian tourists on top of an open topped tour bus video me. A man selling the Big Issue in King's Cross looks genuinely delighted by the spectacle and shouts \"Wicked, man\". It's the C1, the world's first bike/car hybrid according to the people at BMW. I don't know about that; it has two wheels right? That, in my book, makes it a bike; cars have four wheels. The C1 is a scooter with a roof - presumably to protect the driver from rocks hurled by disdainful dispatch riders, or Longbridge sympathisers when they spot the little blue and white BMW symbol. But what's this? Seatbelts; that's not very scootery. Plus a windscreen wiper? And the basic model costs \u00a33,945 - hardly scooter money. On the other hand, it doesn't exactly have the people carrying capabilities of a car; you're not supposed to carry someone on the back so there's only room for one - that's exactly half the number of people as my Vespa carries. This is getting confusing. Maybe the people at BMW were right. Whatever, I set off from the office in Covent Garden (they've handed over the marketing side of things to a posh PR company for the C1 - we could be talking \"lifestyle\" product here), do a couple of laps of Trafalgar square and head off up the Mall. It takes a while to get used to the C1. Everything works well, the brakes are brilliant, but it's quite different to driving a scooter. For a start the centre of gravity is a bit higher so it feels wobblier and on this particular day there's a wicked April gale blowing through London, especially over Waterloo bridge, and I'm being buffeted all over the place. It's also less manoeuvrable so you can't weave like you can on a scooter or small bike. And the extra weight means it's not so quick away from the lights as a 125cc scooter. When it comes to parking up, the two-lever stand lowering system, though clever, is perhaps a little over- complicated. And you can't squeeze a C1 into the same tiny gaps in bike parks as you can with a scooter. (Crap name too - have they forgotten the C5, Clive Sinclair's ill-fated experiment?). There are two major pluses though. When an April shower hits you don't get wet (at least not from above). And you feel reasonably safe, much less vulnerable and exposed than on a scooter. The driver is strapped in between shoulder height protective bars, there's an impact absorbing front mudguard and, of course, that rigid aluminium roll-over cage. In a safety video, a crash test dummy comes out a lot better after driving his C1 into a car than doing the same with a conventional bike. This has got to be the main selling point of the thing. In most European countries you don't have to wear a helmet in a C1. Here you do, but that might change. So would I trade in my Vespa for a C1? I don't think so. Longbridge aside, I think four grand is too much to pay for something with only two wheels and a125cc engine. (The executive model - with mobile phone holder and reading light is \u00a34470, but I never find much time for reading on my bike.) Although the C1 is a very clever design and clearly the future and all that, I have a slight problem with the way it looks. It may have been that Fisher-Price comment that did it. But if I was someone who drove a car to work, and wanted to get there a bit quicker, but was scared to get on a bike, I might think about one. So long as the route to work didn't go through Hoxton.",

After a few weeks every car takes on the distinctive whiff of its owner and even new cars have a particular smell - but not if you buy an Audi. An Audi should smell of nothing all at. </p> <p>Heiko Luessmann-Gieger is chief sniffer at Audi's offices in Ingolstadt near Munich.

The perfect car should smell of nothing discernible at all,\" he says. </p> <p>In the past, car manufacturers concentrated on the look and feel of their models - the styling, the engine sound, the grip of the steering wheel. Mercedes, for example, employs paint doctors who rub their gloved hands all over the body work looking for blemishes. Ford has an acoustic centre in Cologne that aims to create the perfect \"swish\" for the windscreen wipers and Nissan uses an \"automatic mechanical bottom\" - a pair of jean-clad prosthetic legs that sits up and down on a car seat 15,000 times, to ensure that the fabric is durable. </p> <p>But now manufacturers have to go even further. \"It's about creating a total brand experience,\" says Ralph Ardill, marketing director of branding experts, Imagination. \"Cars have to appeal to all the senses so companies are having to think about what their product smells like and how that reflects the brand's values.\" </p> <p>Second-hand car dealers know the value of a good smelling motor and invest in scented sprays to produce an \"authentic\" leather smell. And in Japan, Nissan is experimenting with scents that are intended to make you a better driver. It has developed a concept car that contains a camera focused on the drivers eyelids. \"If it spots your eyelids drooping then the car will emit a peppermint spray scent which is designed to pep you up and stimulate you,\" explains Nissan's spokesman Frank Shepherd. </p> <p>But Luessmann-Gieger says that adding scents to cars is a bad idea. \"You can't add smells to cars because consumers might not like them and even if they did like the scent they might complain when it faded.\" </p> <p>His team carries out a whole range of tests to get the neutral scent they are seeking. \"We sell to over 100 countries so we have to make sure that the glues and plastics don't smell terrible in really hot climates. We also leave materials underwater for three days to see what they smell like when they are wet.\" </p> <p>So how do you sniff an Audi? Luessmann-Gieger and his nose team collect samples of materials from all Audi's suppliers and store them in airtight jars. \"We get together and each take a sniff from the jars and then award it marks out of six - from one for no smell to six for unbearable,\" he explains. </p> <p>The team, which claims that it can identify the smell of every part of an Audi's interior blindfold, knows which chemicals give off unpleasant odours. \"If something smells of bitter almonds for example, I know why and I can go back to the manufacturer and suggest they modify the materials to get rid of it,\" Luessmann-Gieger says. </p> <p>The scientists have training sessions with perfumiers to improve their sniffing skills, but some are inevitably more suited to it than others. \"Some people just have more sensitive noses than others. We have people who really like particular scents such as leather or PVC and so they tend to concentrate on those areas,\" he says. </p> <p>But dedicated PVC sniffers have to make certain sacrifices for their art. They can't smoke, must have high standards of personal hygiene but can't use heavily scented shampoos or deodorants and they mustn't wear aftershave or perfume. Perhaps most trying of all, they have to watch what they eat. \"You can't eat garlic, and kebabs are banned because they not only affect your sensitivity, but also that of the people around you,\" Luessmann-Gieger says. </p> <p>So is it worth the effort given that within a few weeks owners will stamp their own odour on their Audi? \"Absolutely\" says Luessmann-Gieger. \"If a new car has an unpleasant or intense smell, customers might not buy it in the first place.\"</p>",

The film, which stars Samuel Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones, depicts an anti-US riot at the country's embassy in Yemen - something which has not actually occurred, insist Yemeni officials, for over 10 years. The movie has incurred Yemen's wrath before actually being screened within several thousand miles of the Red Sea state. \"I think that [the Yemenese government] was aware of our reaction to the movie, says Hussein Ibish, speaking for the Arab-American community. \"They probably heard about it through the grapevine. It's a very big movie.\" Paramount defended the feature, arguing that it \"is not an indictment of any government, culture or people.\" Analysts say that such protests were unlikely to hurt the film - on the contrary, they usually help.",

I offered a liberal perspective plus a few facts, while Beast (as Bruce is affectionately known) offered a rich choice of outraged nouns and adjectives. Flood, bogus, influx, that sort of thing. </p> <p>Coincidentally, however, the Geiger counter at Tory HQ was jumping all over the place. The Sunday Telegraph had revealed that William Hague had been deeply offended to learn that no Tory representative had been included in the previous week's Edinburgh edition of BBC2's Question Time. </p> <p>Next day, the Times joined in to report that the Conservative party chairman, Michael Ancram, has personalised it all by suggesting that the perennial Tory obsession with bias at the Beeb had got a lot worse since Greg Dyke \"took over\" from John Birt as director-general. </p> <p>Nonsense or what? I wish it could dismiss it as complete nonsense, but it isn't, even if the usual tired attacks on the Corporation are both longstanding and rarely on target. Do you remember Norman Tebbit flaying Kate Adie (of all people!) for doing her job during the Libyan crisis of 1986? </p> <p>Alastair Campbell repeated the crass error of judgment over Kosovo. This time the target was - of all people - the equally formidable John Simpson. That's politics. As long ago as 1926, the then DG, John Reith, had to beat off Winston Churchill over his sort-of-balanced reporting of the general strike. </p> <p>The Mail and Telegraph, on the other hand, usually berate the Beeb for what are essentially cultural reasons: nudity, swearing, atheism and a dumbing down of the Reithian inheritance. I occasionally sympathise with that. If they treated Islam the way they sometimes mock Christianity then Television Centre would long ago have been burned down. </p> <p>That's part of the trouble, of course. As a publicly-funded institution the BBC has responsibilities, manfully borne most of the time, to respect beleaguered sensibilities, women, minorities, the disabled and - last week - Scots, a very sensitive issue for the BBC. </p> <p>The decision to field an SNP panelist on Question Time was almost certainly taken from the highest motives (these things are carefully monitored too). The SNP is indeed the Opposition in Scotland, but Question Time is a networked show. </p> <p>Thus Roseanna Cunningham, MP, is not a household name among the 50m listeners south of the border and Dennis Canavan, the fiery-but-expelled leftwinger on David Dimbleby's Edinburgh team, is not balm to Bournemouth ears. </p> <p>Beeb-bashing in the Murdoch press is something else: just business. The BBC is a major rival and Murdoch, a bully with a weakness for self-pity ( just like the Sun in fact), thinks it is all unfair, though his own licence fee works out much dearer than Auntie's. </p> <p>Rupe's whinge is most noticeable in the Sun which shamelessly puffs BSkyB, but evident elsewhere in the empire, including the Times. Last year it launched a campaign which failed to block Dyke's appointment as DG on the grounds that he had given New Labour \u00a350,000. </p> <p>Unwise perhaps, but more transparent than some political intimacies down the years. Which BBC chairman at a critical juncture had a Tory cabinet member as a brother-in-law? </p> <p>All the same, like other journalists and outsiders who do a turn for BBC TV or radio, I am sometimes troubled. Down the years I have had to say to researchers or producers who propose to put me on a two-person disco ( discussion) with a fellow-pinko: \"Do you think that one from the Guardian and one from the Mirror is very balanced?\" </p> <p>\"Ooh,\" they invariably reply, \"I hadn't thought of that.\" I'm sure it's not conscious political bias, the BBC is proud of its independence, it's more what the Sunday Telegraph might call cultural. </p> <p>BBC types may no longer be almost exclusively white Oxbridge males, but they still tend to be secular, south of England progressives, urbane metropolitans, instinctively against the government, whoever the government is (otherwise they'd be accountants or management consultants). </p> <p>But many of their assumptions must be unsettling to licence-payers who are none of the above. Another manifestation is when producers want to put one on with another political reporter, say George Jones of the Telegraph or Peter Riddell of the Times. But, I say, \"we're all middle-aged white men of moderate opinion living in the south of England. The licence payer is entitled to at least one immoderate. Is Bruce the Beast available?\" </p> <p>Does that amount to the kind of bias the Tories talk about? Some of my media-savvy friends on both left and right give a guarded yes. They argue that New Labour's \"Big Tent\" approach to politics is in danger of marginalising the hopelessly self-marginalising Tories through the media. Thus, to be Labour is somehow to be \"above politics\" in the same way that being a Tory was the norm in the placid 50s - only odd people were leftwing. Me, I don't see that happening, if only because pendulums of public opinion have a habit of swinging unexpectedly back. We can start to feel it, can't we? </p> <p>There is a larger question of who Question Time or dear old Any Questions field for their panels, which has nothing to do with party politics. Years back these Brains Trust programmes were dominated by large public figures, the JB Priestleys, Professor Joads, AJP Taylors and Lord Boothbys, politically partisan to be sure, but not party political in a Millbank way. </p> <p>More important, they were clever, worldly and, most important, usually entertaining. I'm not sure Jo Brand and Billy Bragg (they're both Tories, aren't they?) quite fit the bill, because they don't know enough. </p> <p>I can think of enough jolly highbrows on the Paxman-Melvyn Bragg circuit to just about fit that bill, though I won't damage their chances by naming any. What I do remember is an Any Questions panel in Brighton where I was pitted against AN Wilson, Vernon Bogdanor and Germaine Greer. \"You may care to know that we've got through a record number of questions tonight,\" Dimbleby Jnr said at the end. \"No politicians on the panel,\" shouted a disrespectful licence-payer in the hall.</p>",

Coincidentally, however, the Geiger counter at Tory HQ was jumping all over the place. The Sunday Telegraph had revealed that William Hague had been deeply offended to learn that no Tory representative had been included in the previous week's Edinburgh edition of BBC2's Question Time. Next day, the Times joined in to report that the Conservative party chairman, Michael Ancram, has personalised it all by suggesting that the perennial Tory obsession with bias at the Beeb had got a lot worse since Greg Dyke \"took over\" from John Birt as director-general. Nonsense or what? I wish it could dismiss it as complete nonsense, but it isn't, even if the usual tired attacks on the Corporation are both longstanding and rarely on target. Do you remember Norman Tebbit flaying Kate Adie (of all people!) for doing her job during the Libyan crisis of 1986? Alastair Campbell repeated the crass error of judgment over Kosovo. This time the target was - of all people - the equally formidable John Simpson. That's politics. As long ago as 1926, the then DG, John Reith, had to beat off Winston Churchill over his sort-of-balanced reporting of the general strike. The Mail and Telegraph, on the other hand, usually berate the Beeb for what are essentially cultural reasons: nudity, swearing, atheism and a dumbing down of the Reithian inheritance. I occasionally sympathise with that. If they treated Islam the way they sometimes mock Christianity then Television Centre would long ago have been burned down. That's part of the trouble, of course. As a publicly-funded institution the BBC has responsibilities, manfully borne most of the time, to respect beleaguered sensibilities, women, minorities, the disabled and - last week - Scots, a very sensitive issue for the BBC. The decision to field an SNP panelist on Question Time was almost certainly taken from the highest motives (these things are carefully monitored too). The SNP is indeed the Opposition in Scotland, but Question Time is a networked show. Thus Roseanna Cunningham, MP, is not a household name among the 50m listeners south of the border and Dennis Canavan, the fiery-but-expelled leftwinger on David Dimbleby's Edinburgh team, is not balm to Bournemouth ears. Beeb-bashing in the Murdoch press is something else: just business. The BBC is a major rival and Murdoch, a bully with a weakness for self-pity ( just like the Sun in fact), thinks it is all unfair, though his own licence fee works out much dearer than Auntie's. Rupe's whinge is most noticeable in the Sun which shamelessly puffs BSkyB, but evident elsewhere in the empire, including the Times. Last year it launched a campaign which failed to block Dyke's appointment as DG on the grounds that he had given New Labour \u00a350,000. Unwise perhaps, but more transparent than some political intimacies down the years. Which BBC chairman at a critical juncture had a Tory cabinet member as a brother-in-law? All the same, like other journalists and outsiders who do a turn for BBC TV or radio, I am sometimes troubled. Down the years I have had to say to researchers or producers who propose to put me on a two-person disco ( discussion) with a fellow-pinko: \"Do you think that one from the Guardian and one from the Mirror is very balanced?\" \"Ooh,\" they invariably reply, \"I hadn't thought of that.\" I'm sure it's not conscious political bias, the BBC is proud of its independence, it's more what the Sunday Telegraph might call cultural. BBC types may no longer be almost exclusively white Oxbridge males, but they still tend to be secular, south of England progressives, urbane metropolitans, instinctively against the government, whoever the government is (otherwise they'd be accountants or management consultants). But many of their assumptions must be unsettling to licence-payers who are none of the above. Another manifestation is when producers want to put one on with another political reporter, say George Jones of the Telegraph or Peter Riddell of the Times. But, I say, \"we're all middle-aged white men of moderate opinion living in the south of England. The licence payer is entitled to at least one immoderate. Is Bruce the Beast available?\" Does that amount to the kind of bias the Tories talk about? Some of my media-savvy friends on both left and right give a guarded yes. They argue that New Labour's \"Big Tent\" approach to politics is in danger of marginalising the hopelessly self-marginalising Tories through the media. Thus, to be Labour is somehow to be \"above politics\" in the same way that being a Tory was the norm in the placid 50s - only odd people were leftwing. Me, I don't see that happening, if only because pendulums of public opinion have a habit of swinging unexpectedly back. We can start to feel it, can't we? There is a larger question of who Question Time or dear old Any Questions field for their panels, which has nothing to do with party politics. Years back these Brains Trust programmes were dominated by large public figures, the JB Priestleys, Professor Joads, AJP Taylors and Lord Boothbys, politically partisan to be sure, but not party political in a Millbank way. More important, they were clever, worldly and, most important, usually entertaining. I'm not sure Jo Brand and Billy Bragg (they're both Tories, aren't they?) quite fit the bill, because they don't know enough. I can think of enough jolly highbrows on the Paxman-Melvyn Bragg circuit to just about fit that bill, though I won't damage their chances by naming any. What I do remember is an Any Questions panel in Brighton where I was pitted against AN Wilson, Vernon Bogdanor and Germaine Greer. \"You may care to know that we've got through a record number of questions tonight,\" Dimbleby Jnr said at the end. \"No politicians on the panel,\" shouted a disrespectful licence-payer in the hall.",

There were the regulation \"sexy\" pictures of a TV soap star, a couple of lurid headlines and a lot of extremely salacious copy. For the actress featured under the headline \"Street star's 8-month marathon of lust\", it was deeply humiliating. </p> <p>A former lover, the man she had once been engaged to marry, had been paid a five-figure sum to disgorge the most intimate details of their relationship. She was, like so many celebrities who have suffered similar intrusions into their private lives, devastated. But unlike numerous other victims who walk away, hiding their red faces and accepting their fate, Jacqueline Pirie - who plays Linda Sykes - refused to accept that the paper had a right to publish. The Coronation Street actress, helped by her employers, Granada TV, made a formal complaint to the press complaints commission (PCC).</p> <p>The outcome has come as a severe shock to the News of the World. In what must rank as a landmark adjudication, the PCC decided that the paper's story had breached clause three of the editors' code of practice, which states: \"Everyone is entitled to his or her private and family life, home, health and correspondence.\"</p> <p>In other words, the one-sided account by Pirie's ex-fianc\u00e9, even though its truth has not been disputed, was considered to have invaded her privacy. At first sight, this seems an extraordinary decision. Surely Lee Atherton, the man who sold his story, has a right to freedom of expression? Regardless of the fact that it was a caddish thing to do, he was talking about his own experiences, after all.</p> <p>But second sight, when sense and sensibility kick in, suggests otherwise. Freedom brings with it a responsibility not to infringe someone's privacy. By revealing their sexual activities in sordid detail he - and the newspaper - were indeed intruding on her private life.</p> <p>What the PCC has done (and our courts will surely do often in future since the European Convention of Human Rights has been incorporated into British law) is balance Atherton's right to free speech with Pirie's right to privacy and, in this specific case, come down on her side.</p> <p>The paper's defence of its story, which ran over two weeks in January, was thin, but it used a ploy that has often proved effective. Aware that it couldn't claim that the story was in the public interest, it chose instead the most common excuse offered by tabloids for such intrusions into the lives of celebrities: that they have previously sought publicity.</p> <p>The News of the World argued that Pirie had spoken about her relationship with Atherton before, to OK! magazine for instance. She had also been paid by the News of the World for an article and, on a separate occasion, another boyfriend had spoken about her without her complaining. The PCC was having none of this. Each case must be treated on its merits and, to that end, the PCC's concept of \"proportionality\" is likely to be an excellent guide to deciding whether previous publicity is, or is not, relevant. By measuring the difference between material already in the public domain and the subject matter of any new article, commission members can decide if intrusion is justifiable. In the plainest of terms, does a spread of posed pictures in a magazine, for which the celebrity has been paid a fee, warrant a paper publishing a one-sided account of the person's bedroom habits? Answer in the Pirie case: a resounding no.</p> <p>To understand the significance of the decision and the growing relevance of proportionality, we should consider two previous cases involving celebrity complainants. In 1996, the PCC rejected a claim by Julia Carling, estranged wife of the then England rugby captain Will Carling, that she was being harassed by the press. Despite being hounded by photographers, it was judged that her privacy had not been invaded.</p> <p>Why? Because she had given previous interviews about her private life. The PCC noted sniffily at the time: \"Persons who put matters involving their private life into the public domain may not be able to claim protection when articles are published without their consent and which seek to comment on, clarify or contrast the impression given by the information provided by the persons concerned.\" That was unduly harsh. The Pirie ruling runs counter to it, but note that it occurred before the death of Princess Diana. It is proof that times have indeed changed.</p> <p>On reflection, the other case from that period, in which television presenter Selina Scott complained about a 1995 News of the World story, also had an unsatisfactory conclusion, even though the PCC agreed that her privacy had been violated. The paper had published a kiss-and-tell story in which a man claimed that he and Scott had had an affair 18 years previously. \"It was a downright lie,\" Scott told the PCC. \"I have never slept with the man in my life.\"</p> <p>The News of the World argued that the man had sworn an affidavit but the commission had no way of testing whether the story was true or false. Instead, it ruled that what had been published - whatever its truthfulness - was an unwarranted breach of privacy without a shred of public interest. Whatever Scott's understandable disappointment that the decision did nothing to nail the lie, the importance of this adjudication, in hindsight, is that it and the Pirie ruling are entirely consistent.</p> <p>Yet in the four years since the Scott ruling, no other celebrity has taken advantage of the PCC's protection, probably because of the concentration on the controversy about whether the storyteller had lied rather than the nature of his, and the paper's, intrusion.</p> <p>The Pirie decision is much more clear-cut, and I believe its change of emphasis from the Carling adjudication offers future kiss-and-tell victims a sure-fire remedy. Though it does not, and could not, settle the dispute about what is properly private and what can be deemed to be public, it does offer a guideline. News of the World editor Phil Hall certainly understands the implications, and is contrite about the Pirie story. \"I totally accept that it was a mistake,\" he says. \"It shouldn't have happened and I accept that we went too far. We are going to address this kind of problem and we'll be much more careful in future.\"</p> <p>Hall has also withdrawn his initial knee-jerk criticism of the PCC decision. He was reflecting the concern among his senior staff about whether the adjudication sets a precedent, outlawing the whole kiss-and-tell genre. It doesn't do that, of course, but it does place yet another hurdle in the way. Even if the form remains, tabloid editors are going to have to think about the content.</p> <p>I suspect that much of the PCC's dislike of the Pirie story was based on its tastelessness. Without repeating the details, there is no doubt that even by the descending standards of such stories, it was undeniably vulgar. One editor has even described it as \"sadistic\". A Granada spokeswoman said: \"In our experience we'd never seen such a tawdry kiss and tell, going well beyond the bounds of other examples. It was the gratuitous sexual detail that upset her.\"</p> <p>Even so, some journalists were surprised that Pirie complained. Would she not attract yet more unwanted tabloid attention? One of Pirie's friends said: \"Jacqui was deeply hurt by the piece and very embarrassed that her private life had been splashed all over the paper without her consent or knowledge, and with no shred of public interest. She was concerned that her complaint would antagonise the News of the World, but she felt the degree of intrusion was so extreme that she had to do something. She also felt that if she didn't complain it was quite likely papers would feel she was 'fair game' in future.\"</p> <p>It is therefore creditable that Pirie, risking further embarrassment, was prepared to press her complaint. In many ways, it can be seen as a selfless act, more likely to help her fellow TV actors than herself, because she had nothing to gain from her action. Indeed, in my view, if she had gone to law she could have made out a good case for breach of confidence. As Pirie's friend pointed out: \"She felt there'd been a trust between her and Lee and that he had betrayed that trust.\" She might also have considered a breach of copyright action because letters were reproduced too. In such circumstances, the fact that she chose to go to the PCC rather than sue reflects well on her.</p> <p>The PCC remained silent on one aspect of Pirie's complaint, that the paper didn't contact her before publication. This just isn't good enough. I understand the journalistic convention that papers leave it to the last possible minute to contact people in order to prevent them taking legal action to stop publication. But to publish a scandalous story without any warning is itself a scandal. The PCC must get to grips with this unjust practice as soon as possible.</p>",

The BBC is busily forging relationships to make its content available through overseas internet service providers, for instance Brazil's Universo Online. The corporation has developed its own multilingual software, enabling PC screens to display Arabic and Urdu, or Mandarin and Cantonese.

World Service boss Mark Byford has his tonic-for-the-troops speech ready. \"The World Service is a public service proposition,\" he declares. \"That's why it gets its money through government, to serve audiences, not to make a profit. We believe its values of trustworthiness, accuracy, fair dealing and impartiality, and also the breadth and depth of its international agenda, will still shine through in a multimedia world.

Chris Westcott, who runs the Service's online operation, argues that the public service remit means that \"we don't do things because there is a commercial market there. We're responding to the same kind of market forces as a CNN or an MSNBC, but we're responding in slightly different ways.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, its rivals are scheming relentlessly to steal as much of the World Service's international audience as they can. \"Anybody who is producing a news and information service in whatever language is certainly a competitor,\" warns Mitch Lazar, who's in charge of business development, new media for Turner Broadcasting System Europe.</p> <p>Lazar was also behind the launch of CNN Mobile last year, a foretaste of emerging technologies which brings CNN content to 41m mobile phone users in 18 countries in SMS, Wap and HDML formats. So far, this is a development that World Service online is only thinking about. CNN has also taken giant steps towards turning itself into an international service, instead of the parochially American institution it used to be. It now has several local-language TV news channels as well as websites in seven languages, while European viewers to its TV service can now count on seeing European anchorpersons, presenting locally tailored content. CNN even offered in-depth coverage of cricket's financial scandals, where once the only sport it seemed to have heard of was American college football. \"We've worked very hard to change the perception that we are an American product,\" says Lazar. \"If you watch the TV network today, it's completely different to what you would have seen five years ago.\"</p> <p>The World Service's future will depend on how effectively it can continue to make its objective, non-commercial voice heard. \"It's key to our position that the unique World Service tone is not eroded,\" Westcott stresses. \"It's often underestimated how sophisticated users of media are. I think there is an increasing wariness about 'you're telling me this, but you're also selling it to me, so why are you telling me?' And of course the BBC doesn't have this problem.\"</p> <p>Mitch Lazar takes the oppo site view, funnily enough. \"I believe one thing we have in our favour, where the BBC might get bogged down, is that in some cases they are not able to move in a commercialised way as fast as a CNN type of operation.

We have to earn our revenues by various ways of licensing and advertising.\"</p> <p>There's plenty of experience and ingenuity lurking in Bush House, but the hard part will be learning how to extract it and exploit it. Westcott hopes he understands how the World Service can promote its distinctive assets.</p> <p>\"Until recently, what we did was make radio programmes,\" he says. \"We can't just take the content from those radio programmes and put it online, it has to be refashioned specifically for that medium. You have to find ways of leveraging the assets of the organisation, its brand and its reputation, across all of the outputs.\"</p> <p>The biggest task has been persuading the stately monolith of the BBC to grasp the necessity for change. \"The BBC's last new medium was when television arrived at Alexandra Palace in 1947, so the organisation had forgotten how to change. We've got a very large job to explain to people why the future is not going to be the same as the present, and why something they have done successfully for a long time is no longer going to cut it. But I think it's remarkable that we've dealt with it so well, given all the brickbats you see in the press about how the BBC is supposed to be stuck in the 1940s.\"</p> <p>The new challenge is to avoid being stuck in the 1990s.</p>",

Without giving any warning, a soldier from the 14th Intelligence Company stuck his 9mm Browning through the open driver's window and blew the suspect's head off; firing eight rounds at near point-blank range. (The driver, it turned out, was unarmed.) </p> <p>Hearing shots, the driver's fellow robbers rushed out the front door of the bookie shop in the Falls Road that they were in the process of robbing and were promptly shot dead. Both men were wearing balaclavas and carrying highly realistic imitation weapons - a fact of which their killer was almost certainly aware. One robber was finished off, SAS-style, with a few rounds to the head as he lay helpless on the pavement. A fourth member of the gang survived by hiding among the bookie shop customers. </p> <p>A couple of days later, the Northern Ireland secretary of state Peter Brooke stood up in parliament and said the passing soldiers had chanced upon what they thought was an armed IRA terrorist gang when the robbers wearing their balaclavas jumped out of the getaway car and ran into the bookie shop. They had no option but to engage the gunmen. </p> <p>It was an important story. Three men, Eddie Hale, John McNeill and Peter Thompson, were dead, killed in a British city by British soldiers. But Ulster was a turn-off, boring, no one cared. There was little sympathy on Fleet Street for a group of foolish west Belfast petty criminals who styled themselves \"the hole-in-the-wall gang\" and who had crossed paths with an elite British special forces unit. No one on the newsdesk was going to waste money sending someone over for a dead story about dead terrorists. </p> <p>But then that was nothing new. I had heard that same mantra during my entire reporting career, which began in Belfast in 1983. There were always a dozen reasons why it was never the right moment to go over and do that awkward story. Ireland was dull, dull, dull. No one wanted to know. </p> <p>Both at the time and in retrospect it was an astonishing response. Ireland's Troubles lasted for nearly 30 years. It was and is the longest-running domestic news story. It brought murder and mayhem onto the streets of the capital city - London - and cost 3,500 lives. A government-sanctioned hit squad on the streets of a British city was not an eight-par page-five filler. It should have been huge, but in fact it hardly got covered at all. </p> <p>On the other hand it's not so surprising. The Troubles may have taken place in what is legally an integral part of the United Kingdom, yet the reporting record there of British journalism, with very few exceptions, is entirely disgraceful. US television and the press may have stopped the war in Vietnam, but the reverse is true in Ulster where the abdication of journalistic integrity allowed the war to go on unhindered by a free press. As Ireland's Troubles recede into memory it's worth asking why it all went wrong. </p> <p>If one of the roles of journalism is to inform the public, then 30 years of British journalism in Ulster singularly failed to do so. This failure was most pointedly evident in the reporting of the IRA, the key protagonist. For decades British newspapers, and particularly the Sunday Times and the Daily Mail, parroted the black propaganda myth - originally promoted by the British army - that the IRA were \"criminal godfathers\", \"psychopaths\" and bloodthirsty killers. There was little analysis of the political structure of the IRA, its organisation, or the nature of its support base. But then of course psychopaths, ipso facto, cannot be organised. Nor was there any sustained attempt by British reporters to go and ask IRA men why they had joined up. There were notable exceptions, the Guardian's David Beresford and David McKittrick of the Independent disproving the general rule. Of course many of those others who did try would often find that their copy never managed to make it into the paper back home. </p> <p>By the time I joined the Ulster trail in 1983, the tabloid press had almost entirely abandoned Ulster as a news outpost, leaving just the broadsheets to reluctantly carry copy on our Irish province. The Troubles were reported, most prominently on the BBC, in a piecemeal staccato fashion - one killing at a time with no attempt at dangerous analysis. Everyone in the state bureaucracy of the BBC remembered the row with home secretary Leon Brittan over the controversial documentary programme At the Edge of the Union, which showed Martin McGuinness being nice to his kids. News reports kept to two favourite clich\u00e9 scripts \"tit-for-tat\" and \"pleas for no retaliation\". It made it all sound like a boring but deadly unintelligible board game. </p> <p>It is said that journalists read everything and believe nothing, but somehow Ulster turned it around. Fleet Street collectively read nothing but then believed everything it was told by government. But when peace broke out, Fleet Street was floundering. Instead of being at the forefront of the story they were miles behind. The revelations that the British government had been secretly negotiating with IRA terrorists for nearly a decade came as a total shock. It is clear that the rapidity of the peace process and the apparent professionalism of the Sinn Fein/ IRA political machine had taken most senior British newspaper executives by surprise. And we are still in the odd situation where both right- and leftwing leader writers are left trailing behind the government's radical agenda on Ireland. </p> <p>Not every newspaper executive was a government dupe, and someone did send me to Ulster for the \"hole-in-the-wall gang\" story. No Fleet Street news editor, and certainly no one from the BBC, had questioned Brooke's account or the remarkable coincidences that gave it coherence. Wasn't it odd that the soldiers just happened to be passing when the robbers jumped out of their car? And was it not a bit strange that the robbers would wear their balaclavas running into the bookie shop rather than just pulling them over their heads as they entered the narrow shop doorway? </p> <p>It did not take much reporting skill - I interviewed the fourth gang member - to find the holes in the official account. Far from being a chance encounter, the gang had been under surveillance by squads of 14th Intelligence Company members as they retrieved their imitation weapons from a hide.

      "body": "<p>When the Sun gets interested in the tribulations of BBC news and current affairs, you know things are serious. \"Down the pan-orama!\" screamed a memorable headline recently, crowing over the dismal viewing figures of the flagship current affairs programme. Ratings are at an all-time low, the show is failing to make nearly as many waves as it used to, and the current affairs department as a whole is suffering from a lack of fire. Even Newsnight's Rottweiler, Jeremy Paxman, has been rumoured to be facing the muzzle. While high-minded BBC staff may mock, the most-watched current affairs programme on television at the moment is ITV's Tonight With Trevor McDonald. </p> <p>It is not a comfortable situation for the department, which is even more rattled by the fact that the biggest BBC current affairs success recently has been the big-budget investigative show MacIntyre Undercover - made by the corporation's documentaries section. With the position of head of current affairs vacant following the departure of Helen Boaden to the controller's job at Radio 4 and further upheaval coming to news with the merger of the breakfast programmes on News 24 and BBC1, speculation is rife about what will follow the Birtist \"mission to explain\". One thing is certain: the BBC is certainly not going to go higher brow.</p> <p>Under John Birt, news and current affairs were split into two distinct departments. But the new regime is said to recognise that the best current affairs is news reactive, so the two departments are now very much part of the same news family, and the new head of current affairs will be expected to work even closer with the news chiefs.</p> <p>The first task facing the appointee - the BBC is close to making an announcement and the aim is to have someone in place by the end of next month - will be what to do with Panorama. That the flagship analysis programme is in dire straits is not denied - the show recorded a dismal 1.9m viewers recently, scoring a 10% audience share: equal to its worst-ever showing. The BBC may insist that it is the only mass broadcaster committed to long-length current affairs (it recently gave a \u00a3300,000 cash boost to the show's annual budget, which sounds good until you learn that MacIntyre swallows that in one episode), but there are many who believe that the genre itself is a thing of the past.</p> <p>Dabbling with Panorama is a daunting task for even the most courageous of executives. It is the longest-running show of its kind in British television, and despite its scandalously low budget it is still regarded as the pride of the BBC current affairs fleet. Any moves to tinker with it will be regarded with great suspicion both inside and outside the corporation.</p> <p>Everyone knows that something must be done - one senior journalist on the show remarked recently that it could be dead in five years - but no-one really knows what to do with it. Clearly it needs more cash, and a greater degree of focus. There has been speculation that it could be moved to BBC2, but if anything that would serve only to hasten its demise.</p> <p>Yet there is clearly an appetite among the British viewing public for current affairs. MacIntyre - the one-man investigative show fronted by Donal MacIntyre - pulled in viewers by the bucketload; ITV's Tonight show is averaging 5m. It is not all that long ago that Panorama could clock up 8m with an agenda-setting story; even Channel 5 takes popular current affairs seriously.</p> <p>The trick is how to do it. By axing World in Action, ITV demonstrated that it believed that the days of the regular, long-length single-story current affairs shows were numbered. But the commercial channel was by no means the first to recognise that the current affairs shibboleths had to be chal lenged. In many senses, Tonight with Trevor McDonald is the bastard son of Here and Now with Sue Lawley: a BBC creation that was derided at the time but whose demise is now seen as premature. Here and Now got better audiences than Tonight archives, even though it was scheduled in the graveyard slot against Coronation Street. To get 5m for current affairs against the might of the Street should have been regarded as a triumph, yet the snooty BBC elite never gave Here and Now the chance to succeed. It was doomed from the day it was conceived, and like so many BBC ideas, was taken up by ITV and done twice as well. Now the BBC has to play catch-up.</p> <p>Whoever takes over from Boaden, it is certain that the axe is to fall on that relic of high Birtism, the Money Programme. During the purest period of the ancien regime, the show was seen as the epitome of high-minded, serious journalism. Unfortunately it was often impenetrable and always dull. It fell between two stools - attempting to speak both to the busi ness elite in the City and Sierra man with a couple of utility shares, and inevitably failing on both scores.</p> <p>Jane Root, the controller of BBC2, has decided this failure can no longer be tolerated. The show will undergo a complete revamp - it may retain its name, which is a strong brand - but will become far more accessible. The transformation will inevitably lead to accusations once again that the BBC is dumbing down, but executives insist that it is perfectly possible to combine intelligence with accessibility.</p> <p>The shake-up, however, is not just confined to current affairs. News programmes on television got a major make-over last year, with the changes made to the 6pm news the most radical.

      "bodyText": "When the Sun gets interested in the tribulations of BBC news and current affairs, you know things are serious. \"Down the pan-orama!\" screamed a memorable headline recently, crowing over the dismal viewing figures of the flagship current affairs programme. Ratings are at an all-time low, the show is failing to make nearly as many waves as it used to, and the current affairs department as a whole is suffering from a lack of fire. Even Newsnight's Rottweiler, Jeremy Paxman, has been rumoured to be facing the muzzle. While high-minded BBC staff may mock, the most-watched current affairs programme on television at the moment is ITV's Tonight With Trevor McDonald. It is not a comfortable situation for the department, which is even more rattled by the fact that the biggest BBC current affairs success recently has been the big-budget investigative show MacIntyre Undercover - made by the corporation's documentaries section. With the position of head of current affairs vacant following the departure of Helen Boaden to the controller's job at Radio 4 and further upheaval coming to news with the merger of the breakfast programmes on News 24 and BBC1, speculation is rife about what will follow the Birtist \"mission to explain\". One thing is certain: the BBC is certainly not going to go higher brow. Under John Birt, news and current affairs were split into two distinct departments. But the new regime is said to recognise that the best current affairs is news reactive, so the two departments are now very much part of the same news family, and the new head of current affairs will be expected to work even closer with the news chiefs. The first task facing the appointee - the BBC is close to making an announcement and the aim is to have someone in place by the end of next month - will be what to do with Panorama. That the flagship analysis programme is in dire straits is not denied - the show recorded a dismal 1.9m viewers recently, scoring a 10% audience share: equal to its worst-ever showing. The BBC may insist that it is the only mass broadcaster committed to long-length current affairs (it recently gave a \u00a3300,000 cash boost to the show's annual budget, which sounds good until you learn that MacIntyre swallows that in one episode), but there are many who believe that the genre itself is a thing of the past. Dabbling with Panorama is a daunting task for even the most courageous of executives. It is the longest-running show of its kind in British television, and despite its scandalously low budget it is still regarded as the pride of the BBC current affairs fleet. Any moves to tinker with it will be regarded with great suspicion both inside and outside the corporation. Everyone knows that something must be done - one senior journalist on the show remarked recently that it could be dead in five years - but no-one really knows what to do with it. Clearly it needs more cash, and a greater degree of focus. There has been speculation that it could be moved to BBC2, but if anything that would serve only to hasten its demise. Yet there is clearly an appetite among the British viewing public for current affairs. MacIntyre - the one-man investigative show fronted by Donal MacIntyre - pulled in viewers by the bucketload; ITV's Tonight show is averaging 5m. It is not all that long ago that Panorama could clock up 8m with an agenda-setting story; even Channel 5 takes popular current affairs seriously. The trick is how to do it. By axing World in Action, ITV demonstrated that it believed that the days of the regular, long-length single-story current affairs shows were numbered. But the commercial channel was by no means the first to recognise that the current affairs shibboleths had to be chal lenged. In many senses, Tonight with Trevor McDonald is the bastard son of Here and Now with Sue Lawley: a BBC creation that was derided at the time but whose demise is now seen as premature. Here and Now got better audiences than Tonight archives, even though it was scheduled in the graveyard slot against Coronation Street. To get 5m for current affairs against the might of the Street should have been regarded as a triumph, yet the snooty BBC elite never gave Here and Now the chance to succeed. It was doomed from the day it was conceived, and like so many BBC ideas, was taken up by ITV and done twice as well. Now the BBC has to play catch-up. Whoever takes over from Boaden, it is certain that the axe is to fall on that relic of high Birtism, the Money Programme. During the purest period of the ancien regime, the show was seen as the epitome of high-minded, serious journalism. Unfortunately it was often impenetrable and always dull. It fell between two stools - attempting to speak both to the busi ness elite in the City and Sierra man with a couple of utility shares, and inevitably failing on both scores. Jane Root, the controller of BBC2, has decided this failure can no longer be tolerated. The show will undergo a complete revamp - it may retain its name, which is a strong brand - but will become far more accessible. The transformation will inevitably lead to accusations once again that the BBC is dumbing down, but executives insist that it is perfectly possible to combine intelligence with accessibility. The shake-up, however, is not just confined to current affairs. News programmes on television got a major make-over last year, with the changes made to the 6pm news the most radical. Next in the firing line are the early morning programmes: Roger Mosey, the head of television news, confirmed last week that the BBC is to launch a new breakfast news show to be broadcast simultaneously on BBC1 and BBC News 24. The move will save \u00a31.5m. A few dozen staff will be axed, but the principal saving is derived simply from producing three hours of programmes instead of six. Work is already under way on developing the new programme, which will be launched in the autumn.

Chelsea are missing Desailly as they strive to cement their place in Europe. There will be no presentation of the Premiership trophy at Old Trafford today.<br></p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> The match gets off to a bizarre start, with Chelsea lining up and applauding the home side onto the pitch, like eleven overgrown mascots in blue. United kick off on a sunny Bank Holiday Monday.<br><strong>2</strong> On the left of the United area Zola picks up a deep cross from Melchiot. He delivers it back into Flo, who meets the centre with a firm header over the penalty spot. The ball arrows towards the top corner, but somehow Van Der Gouw manages to parry the effort with one hand. The resulting corner is wasted.<br><strong>5</strong> Chelsea have controlled these early stages, but suddenly Giggs finds a little space on the left touchline and squares to Yorke. His turn surprises Lambourde, who fells the United forward. Beckham steps up, 25 yards out on the left, and drives his shot straight into the wall. Chelsea manage to hack the ball clear. Lambourde looks to have his hands full already.<br><strong>8</strong> Nicky Butt, Yorke and Keane all combine down the right, sharp passing slicing through the Chelsea defence. De Goey eventually cuts out Keane's cross. United are looking to exact some revenge for the 5-0 drubbing suffered by the champions earlier in the season.<br><strong>10 GOAL! Man Utd 1- 0 Chelsea</strong> Poor old Ed De Goey. Receiving a back-pass with plenty of time to spare, De Goey dawdles and allows Yorke to close him down. As the Dutch keeper kicks clear, Yorke manages to close the gap and the ball ricochets into the net. Even Yorke looks a little embarrassed about that one.<br><strong>13</strong> Chelsea try and reply immediately through Zola, who finds some space to the left of the United area. His shot across goal is well struck, but Van Der Gouw is equal to the challenge.<br><strong>16</strong> Giggs is having his own little party on the left. Three times in one move he beat the same man. Eventually, the cross does come over, from Phillip Neville. It falls invitingly for Nicky Butt on the edge of the area. Butt, unfortunately for him, is no Scholes and his shot poses more of a threat for the Goodyear blimp than the Chelsea goal.<br><strong>18</strong> Chelsea are still looking positive, and Flo seems to fancy his chances against Johnsen, who appears short on match-fitness. The Norwegian latches onto a through-ball from Zola, but his shot clears the crossbar by a metre.<br><strong>22 GOAL! Man Utd 1 - 1 Chelsea</strong> The match comes to life thanks to Dan Petrescu. A throw in from the left is hooked over the area by Flo. At the far post Petrescu challenges for the header, but seems to lose out. Out of nowhere the ball lands at his feet and never one to look a gift horse in the mouth, the Romanian drills the ball past Van Der Gouw from 10 yards.<br><strong>24</strong> A great ball from Beckham in the centre of the park lands on the toe of Solskjaer's boot from 45 yards. This move goes left to Giggs, who returns the ball to Beckham. His shot from 20 yards out on the left is parried for a corner. The set-piece is wasted, but United are swarming forward every chance they get and it is some sight to behold.<br><strong>31</strong> Ronny Johnsen loses his rag with Flo on the left and is lucky to escape a booking. The free kick is floated into the United area, causing all kinds of havoc. Van Der Gouw comes, then he doesn't. Lambourde has a dig, and the move is finished of by Deschamps, who hoofs the ball deep into row Q.<br><strong>33 Man Utd substitution:</strong> Berg for Gary Neville.<br><strong>36 GOAL! Man Utd 1 - 2 Chelsea</strong> A superb goal by Chelsea as Flo nods the ball down for Petrescu on the right of the United area. The home side's marking is looking slack and Zola has enough room to get his body shape right to volley home Petrescu's cross, the ball looping over the stranded Van Der Gouw.<br><strong>38</strong> Solskjaer bundles over Deschamps by the corner flag and is <strong>booked</strong> for his trouble.<br><strong>39 GOAL! Man Utd 2 - 2 Chelsea</strong> Solskjaer gets himself noticed for all the right reasons. A short pass from Beckham to Solskjaer on the left of the Chelsea area opens up a thousand possibilities. The United forward picks his spot and slots the ball inside De Goey's near post.<br><strong>43</strong> Giggs has broken through twice, and both times it took an exceptional tackle from Leboeuf to stop the flying Welshman. Solskjaer also tests the Chelsea defence for pace and the men in blue are looking decidedly slow and tired. <br><strong>45</strong> Another fantastic ball from Beckham on the right, controlled by Phillip Neville in the centre of the area, who lays it off for Solskjaer in the sort of position you would put both your mortgages on him to finish. Well, sell the furniture before the bailiffs call round, because the Baby-Faced Assassin just scooped the ball clean over the bar from 15 yards.<br><strong>46</strong> A frantic half comes to an end - there are more goals to come in this game, make no mistake.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Lambourde crunches into Beckham and Neville in quick succession and gets himself <strong>booked</strong>. Roy Keane forces a corner, but for once Beckham's delivery is poor.<br><strong>47</strong> Chelsea break from the clearance through Zola, who finds Flo on the edge of the area in a central position. His shot is straight at Van Der Gouw, who collects comfortably.<br><strong>48 Man Utd substitution:</strong> Scholes for Keane.<br><strong>50</strong> Chelsea have started this half as brightly as they started the first. In terms of possession they are dominating, but they are finding it difficult to get the ball through to the forwards.<br><strong>54</strong> A break in the action, as the United physio treats an injury to Nicky Butt. Chelsea are still finding a lot of space as the substitutions appear to have temporarily unbalanced United's shape.<br><strong>57</strong> Lambourde manages to break two tackles down the left, and squares to Harley, who blazes over from 20 yards. A poor return for all Lambourde's determination.<br><strong>61</strong> Van Der Gouw takes the Michael - Flo and Zola close down the Dutchman on a back-pass, only for the United keeper to sell Flo an outrageous dummy and clear with ease, much to the delight of the Old Trafford faithful. De Goey must be squirming in his boots.<br><strong>63</strong> A Phil Neville cross almost puts United in the lead, as Solskjaer rises to meet the centre from the right. His header is powerful but just over the bar.<br><strong>64 Man Utd substitution:</strong> Cruyff for Solskjaer.<br><strong>67</strong> Henning Berg, after many minutes of toil, is finally getting the better of Flo. Berg displays a lot of strength to hold off the Chelsea striker on the right of the United area. The ball eventually runs out of play. Goal kick.<br><strong>68 GOAL! Man Utd 3 - 2 Chelsea</strong> Ryan Giggs hares down the left, pursued by three Chelsea defenders. Melchiot finally manages to tackle the winger, but the ball rolls kindly to Cruyff, who picks out Beckham on the right of the area with a great curling pass. Beckham's shot is too strong for De Goey to hold, and his parry falls at the feet of Yorke, in front of an empty goal.<br><strong>72</strong> United push forward yet again, a deep cross to Yorke on the left is met by an overhead kick. The effort is sliced and falls to Cruyff, who scuffs his shot goalwards. De Goey scrambles back and just manages to hold the ball away from the line.<br><strong>74 Chelsea substitution:</strong> Sutton for Petrescu.<br><strong>76</strong> Chelsea almost benefit from great work on the left by Melchiot, who beats three men before squaring to Flo. His side-footed shot flicks off the head of Berg and onto the crossbar. Chelsea are incensed when referee Dunn awards a goal kick.<br><strong>79</strong> Phil Neville, deputizing on the right as Beckham moves infield, drives a low cross towards Yorke, who steps over, leaving the ball for Beckham to strike first time. De Goey is frozen to the spot as the shot just misses his right-hand post. So close.<br><strong>83</strong> Chelsea are allowing United unfettered possession until they approach De Goey's area. Yorke feeds Giggs down the left, who crosses only to find that no-one has bothered to follow his progress upfield.<br><strong>88</strong> United, and Yorke in particular, looking to add a fourth. Beckham, Yorke, Giggs and finally Scholes, who shoots well over, all combine in a sweeping move that takes in the length of the field.<br><strong>92</strong> United win their 25th match out of 35 in the Premiership. Full time: Man Utd 3 - 2 Chelsea<br></p>",

Lambourde has a dig, and the move is finished of by Deschamps, who hoofs the ball deep into row Q. 33 Man Utd substitution: Berg for Gary Neville. 36 GOAL! Man Utd 1 - 2 Chelsea A superb goal by Chelsea as Flo nods the ball down for Petrescu on the right of the United area. The home side's marking is looking slack and Zola has enough room to get his body shape right to volley home Petrescu's cross, the ball looping over the stranded Van Der Gouw. 38 Solskjaer bundles over Deschamps by the corner flag and is booked for his trouble. 39 GOAL! Man Utd 2 - 2 Chelsea Solskjaer gets himself noticed for all the right reasons. A short pass from Beckham to Solskjaer on the left of the Chelsea area opens up a thousand possibilities. The United forward picks his spot and slots the ball inside De Goey's near post. 43 Giggs has broken through twice, and both times it took an exceptional tackle from Leboeuf to stop the flying Welshman. Solskjaer also tests the Chelsea defence for pace and the men in blue are looking decidedly slow and tired. 45 Another fantastic ball from Beckham on the right, controlled by Phillip Neville in the centre of the area, who lays it off for Solskjaer in the sort of position you would put both your mortgages on him to finish. Well, sell the furniture before the bailiffs call round, because the Baby-Faced Assassin just scooped the ball clean over the bar from 15 yards. 46 A frantic half comes to an end - there are more goals to come in this game, make no mistake. 45 Lambourde crunches into Beckham and Neville in quick succession and gets himself booked. Roy Keane forces a corner, but for once Beckham's delivery is poor. 47 Chelsea break from the clearance through Zola, who finds Flo on the edge of the area in a central position. His shot is straight at Van Der Gouw, who collects comfortably. 48 Man Utd substitution: Scholes for Keane. 50 Chelsea have started this half as brightly as they started the first. In terms of possession they are dominating, but they are finding it difficult to get the ball through to the forwards. 54 A break in the action, as the United physio treats an injury to Nicky Butt. Chelsea are still finding a lot of space as the substitutions appear to have temporarily unbalanced United's shape. 57 Lambourde manages to break two tackles down the left, and squares to Harley, who blazes over from 20 yards. A poor return for all Lambourde's determination. 61 Van Der Gouw takes the Michael - Flo and Zola close down the Dutchman on a back-pass, only for the United keeper to sell Flo an outrageous dummy and clear with ease, much to the delight of the Old Trafford faithful. De Goey must be squirming in his boots. 63 A Phil Neville cross almost puts United in the lead, as Solskjaer rises to meet the centre from the right. His header is powerful but just over the bar. 64 Man Utd substitution: Cruyff for Solskjaer. 67 Henning Berg, after many minutes of toil, is finally getting the better of Flo. Berg displays a lot of strength to hold off the Chelsea striker on the right of the United area. The ball eventually runs out of play. Goal kick. 68 GOAL! Man Utd 3 - 2 Chelsea Ryan Giggs hares down the left, pursued by three Chelsea defenders. Melchiot finally manages to tackle the winger, but the ball rolls kindly to Cruyff, who picks out Beckham on the right of the area with a great curling pass. Beckham's shot is too strong for De Goey to hold, and his parry falls at the feet of Yorke, in front of an empty goal. 72 United push forward yet again, a deep cross to Yorke on the left is met by an overhead kick. The effort is sliced and falls to Cruyff, who scuffs his shot goalwards. De Goey scrambles back and just manages to hold the ball away from the line. 74 Chelsea substitution: Sutton for Petrescu. 76 Chelsea almost benefit from great work on the left by Melchiot, who beats three men before squaring to Flo. His side-footed shot flicks off the head of Berg and onto the crossbar. Chelsea are incensed when referee Dunn awards a goal kick. 79 Phil Neville, deputizing on the right as Beckham moves infield, drives a low cross towards Yorke, who steps over, leaving the ball for Beckham to strike first time. De Goey is frozen to the spot as the shot just misses his right-hand post. So close. 83 Chelsea are allowing United unfettered possession until they approach De Goey's area. Yorke feeds Giggs down the left, who crosses only to find that no-one has bothered to follow his progress upfield. 88 United, and Yorke in particular, looking to add a fourth. Beckham, Yorke, Giggs and finally Scholes, who shoots well over, all combine in a sweeping move that takes in the length of the field. 92 United win their 25th match out of 35 in the Premiership. Full time: Man Utd 3 - 2 Chelsea",

Indeed, some of the investment community seem to have welcomed developments even though their portfolios have taken a battering. A shake-out seems inevitable. Investors are becoming more informed and recent developments should help to make expectations more realistic. As with any new industry, it takes some time for people to understand it. Many internet businesses are being reappraised, while new strategies based on using limitless capital to grab huge shares of the market are being viewed with scepticism. Although in the early days of the industry it may have been possible to write a business plan that assumed a significant head start over potential competitors, no-one is letting others take an easy lead anymore. While working on Rools we have seen a significant shift in the approach of venture capitalists to this market. In particular, there is increasing emphasis on strong business ideas that exploit what the new technology can do in a unique way. There is less interest in business models that simply transfer traditional businesses to the online environment. Although venture capitalists are still looking to invest in fresh business-to-consumer ideas, business-to-business services are receiving increasing attention. The relative size of these markets makes them attractive - as does the potential for cost savings and efficiency improvements through genuinely new applications of technology. Investors' love affair with technology is not over. We have simply seen a few plates broken in an argument over businesses that are inherently difficult to value. In the longer term, as the next wave of Internet businesses develop, investors will positively reassess their view of technology stocks. \u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are co-founders of Rools.com, a service that lets teenagers buy online.",

Pierre-Yves Gerbeau said the New Millennium Experience Company was \"assessing the financial situation\", but that he was not looking for more money from the national lottery \"at the moment\". Mr Gerbeau admitted that visitor numbers over the Easter holiday period were so far not as good as he had hoped, but said the key periods for the dome were the summer and the few months before it closes. He said he was hopeful 2m visitors would have gone through the gates by the end of April, but conceded that it would be a challenging task to reach his 10m break-even target for the year - downgraded from an initial target of 12m after the dome's shaky start. Mr Gerbeau said: \"Obviously, the Easter period should be booming. It's not at the moment, I am afraid.\" He said the influx of tourists to London during the summer and the \"last-chance-to-see\" message as the dome approached its scheduled closure date at the end of the year would combine to push visitor numbers up towards 10m. The Sunday Times reported the company was preparing to ask for an extra \u00a320m subsidy from the national lottery, bringing its public backing up to \u00a3529m, and may also seek to write off part of its \u00a3110m loan. But Mr Gerbeau told Sky News he was not seeking new public subsidies: \"We are assessing the financial situation... but I am not asking for \u00a320m at the moment.\" He denied the government was putting pressure on him to force visitor numbers up and save the dome from becoming an embarrassment. He told Sky News' Sunday with Adam Boulton that Lord Falconer, the Cabinet Office minister with special responsibility for the dome, was \"very supportive\". Mr Gerbeau said queues at the dome's Body Zone had been cut, from up to 150 minutes when he joined to 15 minutes now, even on busy days.",

Charles Clarke, the Home Office minister and by coincidence an MP for a Norfolk constituency, has already conceded the argument for further cash for rural police forces, saying independent research commissioned by the Home Office was \"well made and widely accepted\". The research, by ORH Ltd, was then examined and endorsed by an internal Home Office team last summer including police constables, police authorities and local authorities. The report found that it took a police officer three times as long to reach the scene of a crime or incident in a rural area than an officer in an urban area. Mr Clarke has also said that the report's findings have wide support among ministers. The extra cash would help police adopt more visible rural policing strategies. The government was reluctant to act until the completion of the standard spending assessment.

Ministers have defended their actions by pointing out that in 1995 3.9% of households in rural areas were burgled compared with 10.3% of those in inner-city areas and 6.3% of those in urban areas. People living in rural areas were also far less concerned about falling victim to crime than those living in other parts of the country. Meanwhile, Martin's solicitors said he would appeal against his conviction this week. Martin is being held in the hospital wing of Bullingdon prison near Bicester, Oxfordshire, and is said to be still in a state of shock. He is likely to serve his sentence in a segregation unit for his own safety once medical checks have been completed. Nick Makin, one of the solicitors, said: \"There have been threats made to his life and to harm him, for example scalding him with hot water.\" Mr Makin said those threats had been made while Martin was being held in Norwich and added: \"When I spoke to him he was still in a state of shock.\" Police were told that a \u00a360,000 bounty had been placed on Martin's head after Barras's death, a threat that detectives said they were treating very seriously.",

      "bodyText": "Six heavily armed, masked assailants have taken 21 people, including Americans, Europeans and Malaysians, hostage on a remote resort island in eastern Malaysia, the police said today. The abductors surprised and captured the group on Sipadan Island on Sunday night, but two captives escaped, Semporna police chief Sulaiman Junaidi said in a telephone interview. Sipadan is a world-renowned diving island off the north-east coast of Sabah, the Malaysian side of Borneo island, which is shared with Indonesia. Semporna is the port town where divers catch boats for the lush island. Philippine officials said they were investigating a possible link between the hostage-taking in Malaysia and Filipino rebels who took hostages more than a month ago on a southern Philippine island in the same waters as Sipadan. Osman Ibrahim, a police spokesman in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, said two Americans had escaped and were believed to still be in Sabah. He said most of the tourists were Americans and Europeans. Officials said the hostages included 10 foreign tourists, four Malaysians from the wildlife department, five Malaysians working at the resort and a cook from the dining hall, as well as a police officer. Sulaiman said the hostage-takers were believed to be Filipinos. The hostages were said to have been taken onto a boat and are now at sea. Police are currently trying to trace the boat, he said, adding no demands had been made by the hostage-takers. Colonel Ernesto de Guzman, chief of staff of the Philippine military's southern command, said five to six gunmen in camouflage uniforms and armed with M-16 and M-79 rifles forced themselves into the resort. De Guzman said the gunmen took the victims to a waiting outrigger and sped toward Philippine waters. \"We have dispatched two patrol gunboats to verify or intercept the vessel bearing the hostages if it's heading toward Philippine waters,\" he added. He said they were trying to determine whether there was a connection between the Sipadan hostage-taking and a similar incident by Abu Sayyaf rebels on the southern Philippine island of Basilan. Both islands are in the Celebes Sea. \"We are not discounting the possible involvement of Abu Sayyaf rebels, of local pirates and other lawless groups,\" de Guzman said. \"We are not discounting also the involvement of pirates of other nationalities.\" Philippine defence secretary Orlando Mercado said the Philippine and Malaysian navies were now coordinating the hostage rescue. But Mercado emphasised that it had not been definitely established that the hostage-takers were Filipino. Malaysian deputy prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said a police and military team had been sent to the area. He said that six of the hostage-takers were Filipinos. \"Freeing them is uppermost,\" Abdullah said. \"I think the Philippine government can help in this matter.\" Chong Kah Kiat, the minister of tourism and environment for Sabah, said he didn't believe the hostage-takers were Malaysians. \"This has never happened here before, so I don't think there are any Malaysians involved,\" said Chong, concerned that the incident would scare off the 400,000 tourists who visit Sabah beaches and rainforests every year. Chong said Sipadan was considered one of the top 10 diving spots in the world and that six resorts on the island cater mostly to professional divers. He said access to the island was restricted to 80 divers at one time, and 40 staff members at the six resorts, to protect the coral reef and wildlife. Malaysia and Indonesia since 1969 have both claimed sovereignty over the Celebes Sea islands of Sipadan and Ligitan. The south-east Asian neighbours have both filed claims with the international court of justice at The Hague. But there were no early indications that the hostage-takers were involved in the territorial dispute.",

The prison service has warned its area managers and directors of high security prisons that a low level or, in some prisons, a complete lack of training in racism and sexism awareness courses is likely to lead to further problems, including embarrassing employment tribunal rulings. Only last week Martin Narey, the director-general of the prison service, apologised to a black prison officer who an employment tribunal ruled had suffered humiliation and abuse over a 10 year period after he reported an assault by prison staff on a black inmate. \"Cases of harassment and discrimination are politically damaging for the prison service,\" Paul Wray, the head equal opportunities training, has warned prison managers. The prison service told every governor in 1996 that equal opportunities training for all staff and managers was to be made mandatory in the wake of damaging industrial tribunal rulings which revealed the extent of racial and sexual harassment in prisons. The internal Home Office document shows that four years later only about 15% of staff have received any such training at all. \"The expectation... was that the whole training programme would be completed by 2000.

      "bodyText": "Elian Gonzalez could face weeks, even months, of further legal battles in the United States before his father is allowed to take him home to Cuba, it emerged yesterday, following the dramatic seizure of the six-year-old Cuban boy by federal agents in Miami. On May 11, an appeal court in Atlanta will hear arguments by the boy's Miami relatives that Elian should be allowed to make an asylum claim without his father's permission. But the court has given no date for its ruling and when it does come, that ruling is likely to be appealed to the US supreme court, a process which could easily last into next year. Juan Miguel Gonzalez and his son spent their first full day together as a reunited family yesterday, but kept firmly out of the media and public gaze in their \"distinguished guest\" apartment on the Andrews air force base outside Washington. They are expected to be moved to the Wye Plantation conference centre in eastern Maryland, a secure site of several phases of talks in the Middle East peace process, later this week. Meanwhile, the row over the Clinton administration's action in seizing Elian at gunpoint from the home of his Miami relatives in the early hours of Saturday morning continued unabated. The streets of Miami's Little Havana district returned to something approaching normality yesterday after Saturday's disturbances, as the boy's still-distraught relatives took their case against the US immigration service to Washington. They found some support among the Clinton administration's political opponents but failed in repeated bids to meet up with the father and son. Juan Miguel Gonzalez said through his lawyer, Gregory Craig, that he did not wish to meet with the Miami family members, or to allow them access to Elian for the moment. \"He wants minimal intrusions,\" Mr Craig said. \"The worst thing that could possibly happen would be to reintroduce the circus atmosphere, the television lights, the cameras and the emotions of Miami into this family reunion, which is so special,\" Mr Craig told CNN. There were some signs that the Clinton administration's Republican opponents see Saturday's events as too good an opportunity to miss for attacking the administration. George W Bush, the party's presidential candidate, said he was \"profoundly saddened and troubled\" by the seizure, while the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, said: \"The use of this type of force clearly was not justified.\" For the second day running, the Miami relatives gave emotional accounts to the press of the lightning federal raid on Saturday morning, making a stream of allegations against the US government ranging from breach of good faith in earlier negotiations to claims that photographs of the Gonzalez family reunion were faked and doctored.

Even among the Cuban community in Miami, there are many who think the refusal to release Elian to his father was indefensible. They don't say so in public because they are afraid.</p> <p>American public opinion supports what the government did on Saturday, even after the event. An unscientific, but very large, internet poll on America OnLine yesterday, in which 400,000 people took part, showed 60% approval of Elian's seizure.

Internet polls are normally biased against government, not towards it.</p> <p>There will be those -there always are - who will grab the opportunity to attack Bill Clinton and the attorney general, Janet Reno, over the way that the operation was carried out. Anything, absolutely anything, is grist to the mill of the Clinton-haters and the Reno-haters. Yesterday they all piled in, led by Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a man who is so rightwing and so conservative that he couldn't raise even 1% support from his own party in his abortive Republican presidential bid last year.</p> <p>There is a case to be made that the administration waited too long, was too conciliatory, too cowardly, and that it allowed the Elian issue to balloon out of proportion. But it's a case that should be made with care. There were, and are, court proceedings to take heed of. And as long as Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, remained in Cuba, the decision to return the boy was much more complex, and politically charged than it became once Juan Miguel arrived in the US on April 6. If Janet Reno delayed too long, the delay was a matter of days rather than weeks.</p> <p>To describe the Elian case as anybody's triumph would be wrong. Too many of the principals in the saga have been too badly damaged to say that - and it is not over yet. Yet there is no getting away from the fact that Saturday was, at one level, Janet Reno's revenge upon the many critics who have mocked and insulted her for eight years, and especially since the catastrophic end of the Waco siege in April 1993.</p> <p>On Saturday, the St Louis Post-Dispatch published an exclusive story which was inevitably overlooked in the dramas of the day. It reported that a detailed court-ordered re-enactment of the end of the Waco siege had established beyond reasonable doubt that the FBI did not fire shots into the Branch Davidian compound seven years ago - the central charge that the Reno-haters have been making all these years.</p> <p>One way and another, it would be fair to say that one of the most unjustly maligned politicians in the United States had a good day last Saturday.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",

There is a case to be made that the administration waited too long, was too conciliatory, too cowardly, and that it allowed the Elian issue to balloon out of proportion. But it's a case that should be made with care. There were, and are, court proceedings to take heed of. And as long as Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, remained in Cuba, the decision to return the boy was much more complex, and politically charged than it became once Juan Miguel arrived in the US on April 6. If Janet Reno delayed too long, the delay was a matter of days rather than weeks. To describe the Elian case as anybody's triumph would be wrong. Too many of the principals in the saga have been too badly damaged to say that - and it is not over yet. Yet there is no getting away from the fact that Saturday was, at one level, Janet Reno's revenge upon the many critics who have mocked and insulted her for eight years, and especially since the catastrophic end of the Waco siege in April 1993. On Saturday, the St Louis Post-Dispatch published an exclusive story which was inevitably overlooked in the dramas of the day. It reported that a detailed court-ordered re-enactment of the end of the Waco siege had established beyond reasonable doubt that the FBI did not fire shots into the Branch Davidian compound seven years ago - the central charge that the Reno-haters have been making all these years. One way and another, it would be fair to say that one of the most unjustly maligned politicians in the United States had a good day last Saturday. martin.kettle@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Britain and the US are collaborating to design a more powerful nuclear warhead, previously secret documents suggest. The papers, obtained by Greenpeace, shed light on the multimillion dollar submarine warhead protection programme (SWPP), run by the US department of energy to designs and develop nuclear weapons. SWPP was given the job of generating a better mechanism for \"arming, fusing and firing\" the warheads used in the US Trident missiles, according to the papers. The designs of the Trident missile systems used by the US and Britain are closely related. This work is being carried out by the Sandia National Laboratories in the US, which supplies the mechanisms for Britain's Trident warheads. Related work is said to be justified by, among other things, helping to \"allow support of the anticipated UK Trident programme needs\". William Peden, a Greenpeace disarmament campaigner, said yesterday: \"There is now very clear evidence that the US is building a new warhead which will have a vastly improved 'kill capacity'. It is like transforming a Trabant into a Ferrari. \"Given the extensive and close links between the US and this country, it is unbelievable that the UK is not following suit. \"These new documents demand that the MoD comes clean.\" The political sensitivity of the work is revealed in a memo of a US energy department internal meeting in 1996, which was \"concerned about the name of the [SWPP] and the name of the 'high margin warhead' and suggested that we consider changing them\". The minutes of the meeting record that \"it was suggested that the use of the word 'warhead' may not be acceptable\". Two officials noted that the point of SWPP was to demonstrate \"replacement warhead design options . . . that could be used in the future\". The cooperation between the two countries is at the centre of an argument between officials and antinuclear critics on what exactly constitutes work to develop a new warhead. The Ministry of Defence claims that research is being done only to make safe existing nuclear weapons and maintain a minimal scientific expertise to design and manufacture new weapons in the future, if they are required. Britain is expected to face a choice in about 2005 whether to replace the Trident system with more modern weapons.",

      "body": "<p>Anecdotal tales abound of insulting sendoffs given to workers when they ask their boss for a reference. \"She got into the gene pool when the lifeguard wasn't looking\"; \"Joanna worked for me for three years. When she was sober, she was rude.\" Maliciousness on this scale is undoubtedly often apocryphal, but countless amusing and not so amusing examples are recorded on the internet and elsewhere to make anyone considering changing jobs think twice. </p> <p>It is certainly not funny if you suspect that your employer is not going to be honest, measured, or generous when a prospective new boss phones for a reference. And employment law specialists say that in the past few years employers have been giving increasingly vicious responses when asked for their opinion of a staff-member's talents. </p> <p>\"The trend for people to be more honest in the workplace is starting to backfire,\" says occupational psychologist William Ricks. \"Ten or even five years ago, managers became wary of saying anything frank about or to staff, fearing accusations of discrimination. Consequently, there was a trend to send them on courses such as 'How to bring emotion into the office' and 'How to use openness to motivate your team' while remaining politically correct. As a result, we have managers who are clued up on appropriate and inappropriate vocabulary, but who can't wait to give blatantly honest opinions whenever there's a chance.\" </p> <p>And what better chance than writing a reference? It is one of those rare opportunities where what's written about an employee can be legally kept from them. Merciless employers say whatever they wish, in the belief that it will never be seen by the employee. Graham Spring hoped for a favourable reference from his employer, Guardian Assurance plc, when he was offered a job with another insurance firm. But his boss instead accused him of being disloyal, being disliked by staff, keeping the best jobs for himself and over-selling to boost his commission. His job offer was promptly withdrawn. </p> <p>Even when the new data protection act comes into force next year, granting staff access to the majority of their employment records, they still won't be legally entitled to see references without the permission of the writer. In reality, workers often do find out the details of their assessment. \"Either they are given a sealed envelope when they leave - which can be unsealed - or the prospective employer lets it slip,\" says Diane Sinclair, policy adviser to the Institute of Personnel and Development. \"Perhaps they'll say, 'We were so thrilled at your boss's comments on your organisational skills that we can't wait for you to join.' Or, they might lament, 'We were shocked to find that you were suspected of stealing so we're withdrawing our offer.'\" </p> <p>By that stage it's a bit late if you think what has been said is unfair or untrue, although you can take legal action. Spring took his former bosses to court and won \"substantial undisclosed damages\", although the case went to the High Court and took four years to resolve. Belinda Coote, a manager at a London bowling complex, was awarded \u00a3200,000 compensation earlier this year when her boss refused to give her a reference after she had won a sex discrimination case against the company. The payout hit the headlines, but only \u00a320,000 was for damage to her feelings, the remainder compensating for loss of earnings over six years. </p> <p>Many employers who realise they're in the wrong are prepared to offer compensation before it reaches that stage. Michele Brenton, a graduate, received a \u00a325,000 out-of-court settlement from Glamorgan University after a job offer was withdrawn by Monmouth borough council three days before she was due to start work. Council officials said her reference was unsatisfactory but refused to give details. She later discovered that the reference had questioned her \"personal attitude and emotional state\" and said her work was of a very low standard. </p> <p>\"Employees are queuing up to take legal action,\" says employment law specialist Laura Smith. \"Judging from the number of PAs and secretaries doing so, it seems unfair references may be a particular problem among admin staff.\" She believes this is because of the high turnover of secretaries, and the fact that the job is far more responsible and multi-skilled than it used to be. \"Managers often depend on their support staff far more than they mean to. When they are deserted by them, they may be left feeling foolish, aggrieved or vengeful.\" </p> <p>Olga Aikin, an employment law specialist at the Aikin Driver Partnership, says a secretary's best hope of winning a case against an employer over a reference is to prove negligence. \"Most people mistakenly assume they can sue for defamation - which is what celebrities sue newspapers for. But this is unlikely because the defence of 'qualified privilege' applies if referees believe the statements they make are true, even though these may be prejudiced and without foundation. Go for negligence, on the other hand, and you get the chance to win your case based on the fact that though they might believe what they said to be true, it isn't.\" </p> <p>Employees may also have rights if their employer refuses to provide a reference. \"This isn't always the case, but it's worth checking your contract to see if it is company policy to give one, or if your contract states that severance packages include the promise to provide a reference,\" says Aikin. \"Finally, there may be a duty if membership of a regulatory organisation is involved.\" </p> <p>Experience shows that your best bet is to put your boss on the spot when you resign, asking there and then if you can have a reference. If you haven't enjoyed your time with the company, be sure to resist the temptation to tell your boss where he can stick his job. When it comes to who should write it, where possible choose someone who you know likes both you and your work - and ask if they would allow you to have a peek. Careers adviser Alice Moore says this is particularly important since \"some employers give bad references as a way of keeping treasured staff\". </p> <p>It's not only employers who get into deep water over references. When Sue Bryan, 24, from Hertfordshire, applied for a PA job five years ago, she faked her personal assessment and got caught. \"I was fed up of getting rejections and became aware that I didn't have the experience required. I got carried away and concocted this story about how I took the boss's wife under my wing when she was having a nervous breakdown and showed my exceptional life-skills by preventing her from committing suicide. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that I was found out.\" </p> <p>Moore claims that although this is an extreme example, admin staff are increasingly likely to fabricate references in today's tight job market. \"It's partly for this reason that recruitment firms and employers are now very hot on checking references.\" </p> <p>If you must exaggerate a little, save it for the interview, advises Judi James, author of The Office Jungle (HarperCollins, \u00a35.99). \"By no means do you have to be totally honest when job seeking, but don't do it in writing. An interview is a fairly false situation so that's your perfect chance. Your employer will no doubt colour the description of your job so I see no problem with colouring your description of you.\" </p> <p>So severe are the repercussions of untrue references - whether written by employee or employer - that Aikin reckons we will see more cases reaching court over the next few years.

      "body": "<p>Down in neatest Hampshire, just off junction 10 of the M27, where the plush coastal farms meet the executive homes of Fareham, there stands a shrine to the millennium bug.</p> <p> It is a tall medieval barn, in dark brick and black timber, that has been refurbished and occupied by a computer software company. Greenwich Mean Time seems to have done well for itself: it has a car park full of sports cars and, inside, clocks telling the time in Tokyo and Johannesburg. In the company loos, there are brass-effect holders for the toilet roll. </p> <p>Three years ago, Greenwich Mean Time began selling a \u00a320 box of software called Check 2000. \"In less than the time it takes to drink your coffee,\" its packaging promised, \"Check 2000 flags and fixes year 2000 PC problems.\" It sold over 4 m copies. Versions were distributed in English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Japanese, and Afrikaans. \"We ended up selling more year 2000 checking tools,\" says Karl Feilder, the firm's founder, in the kind of exaggeratedly calm voice men use when showing off, \"than anybody else in the world.\" </p> <p>His barn is still full of bug memorabilia. There are newspaper warnings pinned to the walls, Check 2000 posters in the porch, Check 2000 boxes balanced on the office partitions, even scratched Check 2000 discs in service as coffee mats. A prediction from Feilder, given to a Canadian magazine in June 1999, still looms over the visitors' sofas: \"In the first couple of days of January 2000, not much is going to happen, and probably the media will write stories about how it was all a hoax. But you'll get this cumulative data error. There certainly will be some companies that go broke, people will be redundant and inevitably some people will die.\" </p> <p>Feilder, who is in his mid-30s and wears boots and jeans to work and looks a little like a chunkier, less uptight Michael Portillo, is still sticking to most of this. \"There have been a lot of incidents,\" he says, \"but the press have totally lost interest.\" Besides, he continues, \"If those millions of people hadn't checked their PCs, there would have been serious problems.\" He leans back on one of the squashy sofas in his attic office, arms thrown out contentedly, the barn's roof beams behind him, his employees tapping at their keyboards below. At the end of last year, he says, he was so confident about his company's millennium medicine that he gave the whole Greenwich Mean Time staff 10 days off, and diverted all calls to his mobile phone. He only got 15: \"none of them disastrous\". </p> <p>Since January, though, as the weeks have slipped undramatically by, Feilder and his fellow bug experts, many of them both entrepreneurs and advisors to governments, have lost some of their lustre. Their activities have begun to look rather contradictory and self-interested. </p> <p>First, in the lead-up to 2000, they anticipated worldwide computer chaos, declaring that the new date would baffle the machines, and agreed to speculate on the consequences, in melodramatic detail, for the world's media. Next, they insisted loudly that heavy spending on software and technicians was the only way to avert a catastrophe. Then, as 2000 began, and planes failed to plunge from the sky, they maintained that the crisis had been real, but solved. And now, deep into the year, they are pre dicting that problems may continue after all, and that further vigilance and spending could be needed. Early this month, on the evening after the Stock Exchange's computers had collapsed, Feilder phoned me. \"Has anyone asked the question about the millennium bug?\", he said. </p> <p>All this makes Anthony Finkelstein furious. He is professor of software systems engineering at University College London, and perhaps the leading millennium bug sceptic. He speaks with some vigour for an academic: \"Being a prophet of doom is a low-risk occupation,\" he says. \"If things go wrong, you are a prophet. If nothing happens, it's because you warned people... [But] the notion that panic is good for people - it's unprofessional. It's patronising. It's contemptible.\" </p> <p>In truth, there have been bug incidents. The office for national statistics (ONS) counted 74 British companies, or 7% of its sample, with millennium problems in the first week of January. By the first week of February, 14 firms were still suffering. A weather centre in Aberdeen, a tide gauge in Portsmouth, the payroll of the German Opera - there have been enough odd glitches to fill a few newspaper round-ups. British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell by 0.4% in January, against the trend of recent months. And last December, amid a small shower of pre-millennial computer surprises, a \"1900 bug\" made an appearance as well. When Bedfordshire social services tried to track down any 100-year-olds in their care, their newly millennium- compatible computers refused to recognise the relevant date of birth. </p> <p>None of this, however, adds up to global recession, or infrastructure collapse, or accidental nuclear war, as the most heated prophets were anticipating. The ONS has stopped its bug watch, weeks earlier than planned. Action 2000, the Government's millennium-alert agency, has been run down. They barely answer their phones now, and sound awkward when you ask what they still do. The bug has faded to an embarrassing period catchphrase. </p> <p>Yet countering it, imaginary or otherwise, cost the British government \u00a3396m. The world spent between \u00a3150bn and \u00a3500bn - the variation between all the estimates seems itself to suggest out-of-control budgets. So do the vastly greater sums committed in Britain and Japan and the United States, probably the three countries most entranced by the power of computers, than in equally modern and complex societies such as Italy and France. The Italians and French have not suffered greater problems as a result. </p> <p>Robin Guenier may be faintly dreading the day. He is a crisp pinstriped man of 63, with careers in computing, aerospace and law behind him, who, from the mid-90s until this January, was probably Britain's noisiest bug alarmist. These days, he plays it down: \"It all seems a long time ago,\" he says, wearily waving his glasses and looking into the middle distance. \"I think it's a very boring subject.\" </p> <p>In 1997, he felt differently. \"I do not want to seem irrational or a prophet of doom,\" he told the Mail on Sunday that January, \"but there is a possibility of riots.\" He says now that the papers deliberately played up his every hypothetical: \"A warning can easily be turned into a prediction_ There were people who were determined to make me into a doom-monger.\" But then he adds, \"If I'd gone around saying, 'We'll probably get through this,' no one would have printed anything.\" </p> <p>In fact, attention-seeking infected discussion of the bug from the very beginning. The first widely publicized article about millennium computer anxieties was published by ComputerWorld magazine in 1993. \"Doomsday 2000\" was by a Canadian called Peter de Jager, who has since diversified into bug videos, bug lectures and a bug cartoon book. \"Have you ever been in a car accident?\", read his opening sentence. </p> <p>From there, the fears spread and multiplied. The first British newspaper story was in early 1996; in 1997, there were more than 300; in 1998, more than 2,500. The salaries of computer staff escalated over the same period: by an average of 6% in 1996 and 8% in 1997, according to the National Computing Centre, much steeper rises than earlier in the Nineties. </p> <p>During the middle of that decade, Guenier had a grey-sounding job reorganising national computing policy for John Major's cabinet office. In early 1996, one of Guenier's subordinates came to him with an exotic-sounding warning. The millennium bug \"sounded plausible\": Guenier went to America to find out more, and returned as a memo-despatching foreteller of calamity. Very quickly, he says, \"The Government regarded me as a guru.\" How did he actually convince them? He gives a mischevious look. \"If you know a bit more about something than anyone else, and you speak with confidence_\" </p> <p>Feilder became interested in the millennium in 1996 too. He was living in South Africa, on the proceeds of a company he had sold to Microsoft the year before, riding motorbikes and trying to be a rock singer. He was bored. He knew from years as a programmer that a lot of computer products were \"poor quality\" - rushed into use and flawed. \"There was bound to be a problem in the year 2000,\" he says now, smiling on his office sofa, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. \"It was just a question of finding it.\" That done, he devised \"a desktop management product wrapped in the millennium bug\" - Check 2000 - and prepared for all the attention. </p> <p>He had media coaching. He bought memorable suits. And as his software became an international success, he \"volunteered my services\" to the governments of the countries it sold in. A virtuous circle, shared with Guenier (they are on first-name terms) was set in motion: official briefings, conference speeches, appearances in the press, dark predictions, invitations from everyone to come back again and answer any allegations of exaggeration. Both of them deny personal motives: Feilder maintains he kept advice and commerce separate; Guenier says that\"the reason I got involved was that hundreds of thousands of ordinary people could have been affected\". Yet their eyes glow when they remember all the meetings. </p> <p>Finkelstein does not criticise individuals. Instead, he sees the bug panic as a symptom of our immaturity about technology generally. Businesses and the public are increasingly dependent on computers, but still understand little, he says, about how they work. Computer technicians everywhere are busily \"empire building\", and the bug gave them further justification - plus an ideal cover for any existing problems they had left unsolved. Meanwhile the government, under Major and Tony Blair, applied the lessons of unrelated past panics: \"They'd been so badly bitten by mad cow,\" says Finkelstein, \"that they decided that the political risk of over-reaction [to the bug] was less than the risk of under-reaction.\" And finally, the media saw in the millennium an absolutely delicious opportunity: \"The bug wrote itself. It had technology. It had disaster. It had a time horizon. The year 2000 story was too good to check.\" </p> <p>There have been some benefits. The Government, the likes of Guenier, and even Finkelstein, all agree that a certain amount of \"spring cleaning\" has been performed on the computer systems of the world. Perhaps a useful period of hostility towards silicon chips and self-confident computer experts has passed too. A culture of improvisation and exaggeration, however vigorous and growing in importance, has been exposed to plain view. </p> <p>Down in Hampshire, Feilder is pondering a move out of computing. Greenwich Mean Time has new, non-millennial software to sell, but its staff is down to 50 from a peak of twice that during the bug countdown. On plane trips to its remaining overseas outposts, and in his attic office at weekends, Feilder wonders about going into the music business \"like no one's done it before\". He already has records by Deep Purple mounted on his walls. His press releases would make interesting reading.</p>",

As Nigel Lawson could no doubt testify, opinions of treasury overlords can change and change rapidly, with today's brilliant exponent of economic management becoming tomorrow's scapegoat for failure. </p> <p>Certainly, there are the stirrings of an anti-Brown backlash in industry, where the feeling is that the chancellor is spending far too much time fiddling around with marginal tax rates and benefit schemes and too little on the growing imbalances in the economy caused by the over-valued pound. </p> <p>Most of the arguments for and against Labour's economic strategy have been well rehearsed, and Easter Monday is perhaps not the best time to repeat them. Instead, courtesy of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, let's see what the economy of England was like when the Domesday Book was compiled more than 900 years ago. </p> <p>We can do this because the Australian economist Jim McDonald has written a paper for the institute's latest review on the English economy early in the second millennium. Studying the Domesday Book returns for Essex, he found there was a William de Warene, an Aubrey de Ver and a Peter de Valognes but no Gordon le Bruin, which may have been Duke William's loss because the economy of 11th century England was riddled with the sort of structural rigidities that the present chancellor wants to eradicate. </p> <p>William was a big-picture man. He came over in 1066, stuffed Harold at the Battle of Hastings, culled the Saxon nobility, built a string of castles to defend his kingdom, and parcelled up small bits of land owned by the English to hand out in big chunks to his lords. </p> <p>They were then left to get on with running them - before McKinsey consultants provided expensive advice - as they saw fit. Had there been an International Monetary Fund in 1086, William would no doubt have told it that his tough early action against the Keynesian Anglo-Saxons had abolished the boom-bust cycle and created a platform for long-term growth. Now it was up to risk-takers and entrepreneurs to make the most of the wealth-making opportunities. </p> <p>As with Labour in 1997, the economy William inherited was in pretty good shape. According to McDonald, England was one of the wealthiest countries in northern Europe with an economy based on agriculture, wool and fisheries. The administrative infrastructure was sound and there was an effective taxation system. </p> <p>The Robin Hood tales have given the impression that tax after the conquest was arbitrary, with kings extorting from downtrodden peasantry or feudal lords whatever sums they happened to feel like levying and paying no attention to ability to pay. Modern studies of the Domesday Book have suggested that this image may be entirely false and that the taxation system in the 11th century was economically rational, with assessments closely related to income and resources of the manors. </p> <p>One economic historian, Graeme Snooks, compares Saxon and Norman systems of taxation favourably to Mrs Thatcher's poll tax debacle, saying that the one was an example of an absolute monarch grappling with the political and economic realities of his time, while the other was irrational and inequitable. </p> <p>Although the economy of Norman England was feudal and manorial, Snooks says that there was a vigorous market sector and up to 24% of GDP was exported - not that different from the 30% of today. </p> <p>With a labourer on 2d (0.8p) a day, there was no need for the 11th century equivalent of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to worry about growth in earnings. Snooks says that growth between 1000 and 1200 reached 0.6% - higher than the 0.4% to 0.5% per annum in the first 50 years of the industrial revolution. In the days before mechanisation, this was a pretty creditable performance. </p> <p><strong> Perfect territory</strong></p> <p> But, according to McDonald, it could have been a whole lot better. As somone no doubt said at the time, England had some world-class feudal demesnes but a long tail of under-achievers, where productivity was poor, the labour market was inflexible and policies for education and training were straight out of the Dark Ages. Perfect territory for a Gordon le Bruin and his henchman Edward de Balls. </p> <p>England was not simply a subsistence economy at this time, with feudal lords needing to generate a surplus both to pay taxes and so that they could trade their surplus agricultural produce for tools, military hardware, lead, glass, textiles and fine clothing. But the model McDonald has constructed using data in the Domesday Book found huge disparities across estates in Essex. </p> <p>The study assumes that 11th century production was characterised by constant returns to scale - that is if one plough team resulted in one unit of output, two plough teams would mean two units of output. </p> <p>Under McDonald's calculations, estates are measured against those on the frontier of what was possible, given an efficiency measure of 1. Measures ranged from 0.159 for Paglesham, an estate of Robert Corbutio in the hundred of Rochford, to a perfect 1 for 96 estates; 25% of estates had an efficiency measure of 0.435 or less, the median value was 0.625, and 25% had a measure of 0.861 or better. Mean efficiency was 0.643. </p> <p>This makes it sound as though 11th century production was woefully inefficient. In fact, it compares favourably with other more recent studies of cotton plantations in the American South after the civil war and of Californian fruit growers in the 1970s. </p> <p>\"Statistical tests showed that efficiency values vary significantly with the tenant-in-chief, supporting the idea that such chiefs operated their estates at different efficiency levels according to their entrepreneurial flair,\" McDonald said. </p> <p>The results showed that larger estates tended to operate closer to the frontier and those specialising in grazing livestock were also more efficient. But factor markets were poorly developed, there were few opportunities for substitution of capital, labour and land inputs, and the marginal productivity of an extra unit of labour could be zero. </p> <p>\"If the productivity of villeins was higher on one estate than another, there was potential to increase total output by increasing use of villeins on the more productive estate and reducing use on the less productive estate.\" McDonald estimates that, if input factors had been mobile, an increase in total net output of 40% would have been possible. </p> <p>So what conclusions can we draw from this? First, some problems never go away. Second, markets were probably better developed in the 11th century than generally believed. Third, if there is not a document in the public records office somewhere saying that the centre-left government of William the Conqueror has eschewed both tax-and-spend policies and laissez-faire in favour of a long-term effort to close England's productivity gap with its main rivals, there should be. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"mailto:Larry.Elliott@theguardian.com\">Larry.Elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The matron was the only qualified nurse in the place.\" Nor was maternity care much better; every mother at the Redruth Hospital had been infected with puerperal fever and Dr Curnow had to shut the unit entirely to prevent further infection. Not that the feverish mothers would have got much change out of the county's fever hospitals. \"They were shocking. One, I remember well, was a red tin hut in the middle of a field. The caretaker and his wife - both unqualified - were the only staff. \"At another I was horrified on going into the bathroom, to find dirty clothes in the bath and bedpans on a form beside the bath and, at the other end of the form, cups and saucers.\" As for the so-called \"rich tapestry\" of the county ambulance service, horse-drawn vehicles, with the horse borrowed from the local butcher, supplied the main medical transport in Camborne-Redruth with similar arrangements in Falmouth. The interviewer, writing 24 years later, concluded: \"Public health conditions in Cornwall had to be seen to be believed.\" Mr grandfather took a modest view of his achievements: \"When you come to a service in the condition this one was [in], anything one did was bound to be an improvement. \"I couldn't really go wrong.\" No, quite.",

      "body": "<p>Poor old Frank Dobson. Perhaps because he works for London \"24 hours a day\" (even Stalin, Hitler and Thatcher managed at least four hours' sleep a day) and spends too much time \"rolling up his sleeves\" (a nervous tic?), he appears unable to see London as the great city it is. Why do I say that? Because he has looked at a megalomaniacal retail and leisure development planned for west London and proclaimed: \"This is exactly the type of scheme that I would seek to promote as mayor.\" </p> <p>God help London if Dobbo is elected to fulfil that terrible pledge. The development in question, White City, beside the M41, will fill an area the size of almost 40 football pitches with chain stores, supermarkets and a giant car park, rather than parkland and much-needed housing. It will be \"one of the largest traffic-generating developments ever proposed for London,\" according to the Council for the Protection of Rural England. </p> <p>To date, White City has found favour only with its promoters, the property company Chelsfield and London Underground, with local estate agents who see it as a shot in the arm for house prices, and with fawning architectural writers who wish, presumably, to keep in the good books of Elliot Bernard. Bernard is chairman of both Chelsfield and of the South Bank Centre, where he is promoting a much-needed redevelopment. He is also working with Lord Rothschild to enable James Turrell, the world's greatest light artist, to practise his magic along a significant stretch of the Thames. </p> <p>All of London's other main mayoral candidates have taken against the \u00a31bn White City project, which is due to be completed in 2002. \"The idea that in inner London you create a bloody great magnet for cars is totally opposed to everything we're trying to do in London,\" says Ken Livingstone. \"White City,\" says Steven Norris, \"is an example of how not to do it. It makes massive provision for increasing traffic and provides only a few homes [65 in its 40 acres, according to Dobbo; 42 according to everyone else].\" \"It's completely out of scale and a threat to local communities,\" says Susan Kramer. </p> <p>\"The government says it wants 60% of new housing built on brownfield land,\" points out Richard Bourn, director of the CPRE's London branch. \"Instead of badly needed homes, this will provide 4,500 parking spaces. This is not regeneration; it is a recipe for urban degeneration. John Prescott, secretary of state for the environment, transport and the regions, must bow to the wishes of the mayoral candidates and order a public inquiry into the White City development.\" </p> <p>Strong words, but wise ones. So what is it that so attracts Dobbo to this decidedly retro shopping, leisure and parking development? Perhaps it is the Ali G factor. Last year the comedian visited Sydenham in south London, where a horrid new Crystal Palace is under construction against the wishes of local people and just about every environmental concern going. The flashy new building, however, is home to a multiplex with a wicked sound system. Or something. Ali G, on a mission to learn about the environment and stuff, found himself more excited by the promise of mega sound systems. Respect. </p> <p>This was a nice bit of satire. Presumably, however, Dobbo is genuinely thrilled by the idea of a new multiplex (remember the yoof vote, innit), a giant car park and the usual offering of big chain shops such as Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer. Meanwhile, the inner-city borough where the whole thing will sit, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, admits to needing 100,000 new homes. </p> <p>The White City site once housed the long-forgotten 1908 Franco-British exhibition, some of whose buildings have survived and are used as tennis courts and hostels for incontinent pigeons. No one concerned, and certainly not the CPRE, believes that this urban wasteland should be left undeveloped. On the contrary, here is a chance to build a brand-new bit of real city. A chance to redeem the sin of the M41, the motorway that sliced through North Kensington 30 years or so ago, dividing a community so that motorists could drive at 70mph (50mph today) the half mile between the elevated A40(M) or \"Westway\" and the snarl-ups at Shepherd's Bush roundabout. </p> <p>This is an opportunity to connect Old Oak Common and Wormwood Scrubs to Shepherd's Bush along what could become a superb new green corridor set about with new homes for everyone, the finest new public buildings imaginable by the world's best architects, as well as entertainment and some useful shops. With a new tram line, improved public transport generally, a lake perhaps, an ice-rink, tennis courts, nurseries_ There's enough land here, and certainly enough money sloshing through London, to make such a new quarter of the capital possible. It would make economic and cultural mincemeat of the half-hearted Millennium Village in the wind-swept Greenwich peninsula. </p> <p>Instead we have one megastructure - a giant car park bearing a concatenation of whizzy shops, multiplex, bowling alley, \"winter garden\" and other attractions that those who design and pay for the new-look White City would probably never use themselves. Why do we allow this to happen to our cities? Dobbo gives us that most hackneyed of answers. It's worth plonking down Son of Brent Cross here in London's streaming roar, worth the 64,000 extra car journeys a day it will generate at its peak, worth the aesthetic insult because, in Dobbo's words (check <a href=\"http://www.frank.dobson.org.uk\">his website</a>), it will \"secure over 5,000 new jobs\". What sort of jobs? Stacking shelves in superstores? Selling burgers in multiplex cafes? Operating the car park barrier? </p> <p>The scheme dates from the mid-90s. In its earliest phase it was a crude device; more recently, the architect Ian Ritchie was brought in to do a number on the project, to make it shine in the public eye. This is the same Ian Ritchie who has designed the new Crystal Palace given respect by Ali G.

      "bodyText": "Poor old Frank Dobson. Perhaps because he works for London \"24 hours a day\" (even Stalin, Hitler and Thatcher managed at least four hours' sleep a day) and spends too much time \"rolling up his sleeves\" (a nervous tic?), he appears unable to see London as the great city it is. Why do I say that? Because he has looked at a megalomaniacal retail and leisure development planned for west London and proclaimed: \"This is exactly the type of scheme that I would seek to promote as mayor.\" God help London if Dobbo is elected to fulfil that terrible pledge. The development in question, White City, beside the M41, will fill an area the size of almost 40 football pitches with chain stores, supermarkets and a giant car park, rather than parkland and much-needed housing. It will be \"one of the largest traffic-generating developments ever proposed for London,\" according to the Council for the Protection of Rural England. To date, White City has found favour only with its promoters, the property company Chelsfield and London Underground, with local estate agents who see it as a shot in the arm for house prices, and with fawning architectural writers who wish, presumably, to keep in the good books of Elliot Bernard. Bernard is chairman of both Chelsfield and of the South Bank Centre, where he is promoting a much-needed redevelopment. He is also working with Lord Rothschild to enable James Turrell, the world's greatest light artist, to practise his magic along a significant stretch of the Thames. All of London's other main mayoral candidates have taken against the \u00a31bn White City project, which is due to be completed in 2002. \"The idea that in inner London you create a bloody great magnet for cars is totally opposed to everything we're trying to do in London,\" says Ken Livingstone. \"White City,\" says Steven Norris, \"is an example of how not to do it. It makes massive provision for increasing traffic and provides only a few homes [65 in its 40 acres, according to Dobbo; 42 according to everyone else].\" \"It's completely out of scale and a threat to local communities,\" says Susan Kramer. \"The government says it wants 60% of new housing built on brownfield land,\" points out Richard Bourn, director of the CPRE's London branch. \"Instead of badly needed homes, this will provide 4,500 parking spaces. This is not regeneration; it is a recipe for urban degeneration. John Prescott, secretary of state for the environment, transport and the regions, must bow to the wishes of the mayoral candidates and order a public inquiry into the White City development.\" Strong words, but wise ones. So what is it that so attracts Dobbo to this decidedly retro shopping, leisure and parking development? Perhaps it is the Ali G factor. Last year the comedian visited Sydenham in south London, where a horrid new Crystal Palace is under construction against the wishes of local people and just about every environmental concern going. The flashy new building, however, is home to a multiplex with a wicked sound system. Or something. Ali G, on a mission to learn about the environment and stuff, found himself more excited by the promise of mega sound systems. Respect. This was a nice bit of satire. Presumably, however, Dobbo is genuinely thrilled by the idea of a new multiplex (remember the yoof vote, innit), a giant car park and the usual offering of big chain shops such as Sainsbury's and Marks &amp; Spencer. Meanwhile, the inner-city borough where the whole thing will sit, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham, admits to needing 100,000 new homes. The White City site once housed the long-forgotten 1908 Franco-British exhibition, some of whose buildings have survived and are used as tennis courts and hostels for incontinent pigeons. No one concerned, and certainly not the CPRE, believes that this urban wasteland should be left undeveloped. On the contrary, here is a chance to build a brand-new bit of real city. A chance to redeem the sin of the M41, the motorway that sliced through North Kensington 30 years or so ago, dividing a community so that motorists could drive at 70mph (50mph today) the half mile between the elevated A40(M) or \"Westway\" and the snarl-ups at Shepherd's Bush roundabout. This is an opportunity to connect Old Oak Common and Wormwood Scrubs to Shepherd's Bush along what could become a superb new green corridor set about with new homes for everyone, the finest new public buildings imaginable by the world's best architects, as well as entertainment and some useful shops. With a new tram line, improved public transport generally, a lake perhaps, an ice-rink, tennis courts, nurseries_ There's enough land here, and certainly enough money sloshing through London, to make such a new quarter of the capital possible. It would make economic and cultural mincemeat of the half-hearted Millennium Village in the wind-swept Greenwich peninsula. Instead we have one megastructure - a giant car park bearing a concatenation of whizzy shops, multiplex, bowling alley, \"winter garden\" and other attractions that those who design and pay for the new-look White City would probably never use themselves. Why do we allow this to happen to our cities? Dobbo gives us that most hackneyed of answers. It's worth plonking down Son of Brent Cross here in London's streaming roar, worth the 64,000 extra car journeys a day it will generate at its peak, worth the aesthetic insult because, in Dobbo's words (check his website), it will \"secure over 5,000 new jobs\". What sort of jobs? Stacking shelves in superstores? Selling burgers in multiplex cafes? Operating the car park barrier? The scheme dates from the mid-90s. In its earliest phase it was a crude device; more recently, the architect Ian Ritchie was brought in to do a number on the project, to make it shine in the public eye. This is the same Ian Ritchie who has designed the new Crystal Palace given respect by Ali G. Whether it is the same architect who talked so eloquently about ecologically friendly design in the past, I do not wish to find out. The idea, however, that architects with a good eye can still be brought in to spin an unsupportable development beggars belief. Their talent needs to be harnessed to intelligent new city-making, which is not the same thing as dragging Brent Cross, Thurrock and Bluewater - car-generated schemes all - into the centre of our cities when we are trying to make them more civilised places to live. It seems doubly sad that Cabe, the government's new Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, has had nothing to say about White City; nor has the Architecture Foundation chaired by Lord Rogers, whose Urban Task Force report last year took exception to just such developments.

      "bodyText": "The Archbishop of Westminster yesterday stepped into the row over asylum seekers by urging politicians to refrain from using emotive language when dealing with the issue. Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, called on all three major parties to agree not to make refugees a party political football. The archbishop spoke out after a week in which Conservative leader William Hague announced he would intern all asylum seekers in detention camps until their applications had been reviewed. The proposals were calculated to make the issue part of the Tory campaign in the run-up to the local elections. Last week senior Tory backbencher Ian Taylor warned that his party's leadership was running the risk of inadvertently unleashing forces of animosity toward ethnic minorities by making asylum a campaign issue. Talking to GMTV's Sunday Programme yesterday about the use of such phrases as \"bogus\" and \"floods of asylum seekers\", the archbishop said: \"I am not happy with the use of language that is what I would call emotive, because I think on this particular subject, which is so sensitive, especially for those who are actually coming into this country, that we need to look at the thing very objectively. \"I know there are many people who are seeking asylum who have come from very tragic circumstances, and I would like to think that this is a country that can open its doors a little bit to them, but I do appreciate that it can only be done within certain limits.

Delderfield called his autobiography For My Own Amusement, but few perhaps now appreciate - his novels scarcely being comic - the scale of the contribution he made to the national laughter. </p> <p>Delderfield wrote a play called The Bully Boys which, in 1958, was turned into a film by Gerald Rogers. The producer changed the title to Carry On Sergeant. Viewers of the subsequent 28 movies in the series wouldn't realise that the recurring title words hadn't originally been a saucy pun but a piece of army jargon. This was intended as a one-off project, and the little-known actors Kenneth Williams, Kenneth Connor and Charles Hawtrey were retained on a single contract. Yet for 20 years or so these movies would more or less constitute the British film industry. </p> <p>The words Carry On indicated a sense of momentum, but there came a point in the 70s when there was doubt about how long the jokes and the actors could keep going. This dying of the laughter is the subject of a television drama, Cor Blimey! (tonight, 9pm, ITV), written and directed by Terry Johnson, which catches Sid James, Kenneth Williams and Barbara Windsor off-camera on film sets from the series over 14 years. </p> <p>The two-hour piece is adapted from Johnson's 1988 National Theatre hit Cleo, Camping, Emanuelle and Dick, a title - derived from a quiz clue about Carry On films - which has been judged either too rude or too subtle for the ITV audience. Johnson is becoming culture's creative middleman between theatre and the screen. He has just put the movie The Graduate on the West End stage, starring Kathleen Turner, and he has written another stage play - Dead Funny - based around the deaths of Frankie Howerd and Benny Hill. </p> <p>Cor Blimey! - bringing the Carry On movies to television via the stage - is his most complicated mixed-media installation yet, but it succeeds triumphantly. The key decision in theatre-to-screen transfers is the extent of what's known as \"opening out\". As when extending a building, the risk is that you wreck the architecture. But Johnson understands how differently material needs to be shaped for theatre's rectangle of open air and television's oblong of glass. </p> <p>On stage, the piece was a farce, its explosions depending on the enclosed space of Sid James's caravan at Pinewood Studios. On television, the external news brought back in speeches - the Carry On stage show in London, James's death on stage in a play in Sunderland, Windsor's attempt at Shakespeare in Chichester - is dramatised, adding to the biographical weight of the depiction. </p> <p>A film-set moment jokily referred to by Windsor on stage - the diffi culty of redubbing the word \"buttocks\" as \"bottom\" for the censor - benefits from the close-up to become a smart visual gag. And a play driven by the affair between James and Windsor gains from an on-camera scene in which, as they struggle to resist each other, they are required to snog in Carry On England. The one serious theatrical miscalculation - the final scene re-appearance of James as a ghost - is sensibly excised for TV. A writer once described self-editing as doing root-canal surgery on yourself. Johnson has the emotional Novocaine to do it. </p> <p>The biggest risk was that a show which so depended on convincing lookalikes would be exposed on television. An actor who seemed a ringer from Row P might easily appear an impostor from 12 feet in the living room. In fact James (Geoffrey Hutchings), Windsor (Samantha Spiro) and Williams (Adam Godley) are uncannily exact in accent and mannerisms. Oddly - but appropriately - each of the central Carry On trio had a distinctive laugh: James's cackle, Windsor's giggle, Williams' snort. Here, used in almost musical counterpoint, they lead to amazing pairs of tittering, as the Carry On scriptwriter Talbot Rothwell might have put it. </p> <p>But, impressive though the impressions are, this would merely be Madame Tussaud's broadcasting were it not for the depth and intelligence of Johnson's script. Johnson's own smut is more adult than Rothwell's. There's a running gag about cunnilingus which, 10 years ago, would have had ITV in it up to its neck. Oooh, there I go again. </p> <p>The real power, however, is in the characterisations. The grim inner life of the publicly grinning comic is a cliche of fiction, but Cor Blimey! is much more complex about the relationship between stars and parts. These actors are not the opposite of their off-screen personae but - more interestingly - a darker and more dangerous version of the same. James suffers the pain and frustration of really being the reckless lecher he plays effortlessly on screen. Williams, master of the bottom gag, is a martyr to anal ailments. Windsor, whose Carry On persona involved not fully understanding the consequences of what she did or said, ignores for as long as possible the fact that her marriage to Ronnie Knight has made her a gangster's moll. </p> <p>I mentioned here recently the increased use of what might be called website programming: the placing of related shows in the schedules like arrows leading from pages in cyberspace. ITV does the obvious thing of following Johnson's play with Carry On Cleo. </p> <p>And it's a tribute to the visual illusion and imaginative empathy of Cor Blimey! that it will easily survive this proximity with the original. One of the best stage plays of the 1990s has become one of this year's TV highlights.

Here Agutter was the children's troubled, tired-eyed mother, newly impoverished and forever bursting into the living room to say: \"Good news. I've sold another story.

Martin Short's Mad Hatter kept insisting on changing seats before anyone could settle. Delightfully demented, he was backed by the March Hare on a little guitar when he sang. \"Auntie's wooden leg,\" he cooed. \"Everyone thinks it's dead.\" A marvellous adaptation, filled with virtuosic star turns and bafflingly wonderful special effects.

Everyone who has felt let down by estate agents at some point in an often complicated series of transactions (where chains and chance can play a part) will laud her derring-do. Many might feel emboldened to follow her example.</p> <p>But they can't just point to her judgment and expect to win. Unlike the rulings of higher courts, the decisions of district judges in small claims cases don't set a legal precedent; each case will depend on its own facts. And Bairstow Eves may still appeal against the decision.</p> <p>Countrywide's group legal adviser, Sam Themis, who appeared for Bairstow Eves at the hearing, said in a statement: \"We are considering our position in respect of an appeal. We consider there is no basis in law for the decision of the district judge.\"</p> <p>His view is backed up by a legal academic, who says there is nothing in the 1979 Estate Agents Act (which regulates the professional operation of property selling) about the way an agency should keep in contact with a customer from the time it comes up with a potential buyer to the completion of the deal.</p> <p>However, the judge clearly accepted that the Smiths had been let down at several points after they entrusted the sale of their home, in the Essex village of Doddinghurst, to Bairstow Eves. Though chuffed about her court victory, Smith remains indignant about the errors she says the agency made, and about its attempts to try to get her to pay up. Since she has never before been involved in court proceedings, she is still surprised at her determination to take on the professionals.</p> <p>The family decided last spring that they needed a bigger house. She took charge of all the arrangements, and asked Bairstow Eves to act as sole agents after successfully using another branch several years before.</p> <p>She signed an agreement for a commission of \u00a32,500 but says she verbally agreed with the manager, Alan Benton, for a reduced commission of \u00a32,100 on the asking price of \u00a3119,995. He was sympathetic to a couple of special requirements she outlined to him. \"I explained, as I was an extremely busy mother working from home, I would expect to have very little personal input, but would expect to be kept well informed of the progression of any sale.\"</p> <p>As the Smiths wanted to stay in the same patch of Essex and had a very precise idea of the new house they wanted, Benton agreed that he would keep the sale \"low key\" to give them plenty of time for their search.</p> <p>This was crucially important, says Smith, because last summer property in the area was selling quickly, and she did not want to become obligated to a prospective buyer without having secured a new home. However, she says the agency still sent lots of first-time buyers and people who had already sold up.</p> <p>Her expectations took another knock when she tried to correct a mistake in the details of the house sent to potential buyers. The combined living/dining area was 28ft long, but appeared as 21ft 4ins in the particulars. Three times she rang to get this corrected; three times the firm failed to amend the measurement, which it circulated without her approval - a point, the judge said, which put the agency in the wrong.</p> <p>By summer the family had found the house they wanted and the process speeded up - along with the incidence of errors, says Smith. A couple, teachers moving to a new school in Essex, made a firm offer for the house. They set a deadline of August 18 - if they could not move in by then, they would have to rent accommodation.</p> <p>But the Smiths were in the middle of a chain of five house sales, and there was a hold-up: one of the buyers had not received a mortgage offer. Smith says it was she who discovered the obstacle and paid for a courier to take a document from one office to another in Blackpool so the mortgage offer came through, though completion was delayed by about 10 days.</p> <p>Smith agrees that everything turned out all right in the end, but it was the irritation of not getting enough feedback, plus the odd muddle, which she felt warranted much reduced charges. Craig Job, who took over as office manager while negotiations were in mid-flow last year, said in a statement to the court that he had apologised for the various hiccups and had cut the Smiths' bill as a goodwill gesture.</p> <p>The moves were completed, summer turned to autumn, and along came more letters from Bairstow Eves demanding payment. Smith had paid \u00a31,050, half the agreed \u00a32,100 commission. The agency said it would accept a total of \u00a31,550 plus VAT, leaving a balance of nearly \u00a3800.</p> <p>In October the Smiths received a letter from the regional manager saying that if the bill was not paid in 10 days, the firm would be entitled to charge its full commission rate and would demand \u00a34,935. In the event, the court claim was for just under \u00a3800.</p> <p>When she decided to fight the court action, Smith says that two firms of solicitors she approached for advice said she had no chance of winning, while two others said they could not take on the case because they did legal work for the estate agents.</p> <p>That strengthened her resolve. Fortunately, she was used to keeping meticulous records, so the documents, plus dates and times of visits and phone calls, were at hand.</p> <p>It was a worrying time; but the small claims court was anything but intimidating: no gowns or wigs and a room laid out out more like a tribunal rather than a court. Three hours of statements, questions and the judgment - in her favour.</p> <p>Appeal or no appeal, she is glad she did it. The \u00a3800 does not matter: the family could have paid that off easily enough. What does matter, she says, is that she took a stand in an arena which consumers are loath to enter because they feel they have no chance - until now.</p>",

She signed an agreement for a commission of \u00a32,500 but says she verbally agreed with the manager, Alan Benton, for a reduced commission of \u00a32,100 on the asking price of \u00a3119,995. He was sympathetic to a couple of special requirements she outlined to him. \"I explained, as I was an extremely busy mother working from home, I would expect to have very little personal input, but would expect to be kept well informed of the progression of any sale.\" As the Smiths wanted to stay in the same patch of Essex and had a very precise idea of the new house they wanted, Benton agreed that he would keep the sale \"low key\" to give them plenty of time for their search. This was crucially important, says Smith, because last summer property in the area was selling quickly, and she did not want to become obligated to a prospective buyer without having secured a new home. However, she says the agency still sent lots of first-time buyers and people who had already sold up. Her expectations took another knock when she tried to correct a mistake in the details of the house sent to potential buyers. The combined living/dining area was 28ft long, but appeared as 21ft 4ins in the particulars. Three times she rang to get this corrected; three times the firm failed to amend the measurement, which it circulated without her approval - a point, the judge said, which put the agency in the wrong. By summer the family had found the house they wanted and the process speeded up - along with the incidence of errors, says Smith. A couple, teachers moving to a new school in Essex, made a firm offer for the house. They set a deadline of August 18 - if they could not move in by then, they would have to rent accommodation. But the Smiths were in the middle of a chain of five house sales, and there was a hold-up: one of the buyers had not received a mortgage offer. Smith says it was she who discovered the obstacle and paid for a courier to take a document from one office to another in Blackpool so the mortgage offer came through, though completion was delayed by about 10 days. Smith agrees that everything turned out all right in the end, but it was the irritation of not getting enough feedback, plus the odd muddle, which she felt warranted much reduced charges. Craig Job, who took over as office manager while negotiations were in mid-flow last year, said in a statement to the court that he had apologised for the various hiccups and had cut the Smiths' bill as a goodwill gesture. The moves were completed, summer turned to autumn, and along came more letters from Bairstow Eves demanding payment. Smith had paid \u00a31,050, half the agreed \u00a32,100 commission. The agency said it would accept a total of \u00a31,550 plus VAT, leaving a balance of nearly \u00a3800. In October the Smiths received a letter from the regional manager saying that if the bill was not paid in 10 days, the firm would be entitled to charge its full commission rate and would demand \u00a34,935. In the event, the court claim was for just under \u00a3800. When she decided to fight the court action, Smith says that two firms of solicitors she approached for advice said she had no chance of winning, while two others said they could not take on the case because they did legal work for the estate agents. That strengthened her resolve. Fortunately, she was used to keeping meticulous records, so the documents, plus dates and times of visits and phone calls, were at hand. It was a worrying time; but the small claims court was anything but intimidating: no gowns or wigs and a room laid out out more like a tribunal rather than a court. Three hours of statements, questions and the judgment - in her favour. Appeal or no appeal, she is glad she did it. The \u00a3800 does not matter: the family could have paid that off easily enough. What does matter, she says, is that she took a stand in an arena which consumers are loath to enter because they feel they have no chance - until now.",

But many people might be surprised to learn that you cannot sue an advocate - barrister or solicitor - who makes a hash of your case in court.</p> <p>There is no statute that says you can't. But judges have conferred immunity on advocates in a line of court cases. The reason? Public policy. It would be undesirable, it is said, if cases already decided by one court could in effect be re-litigated in another by suing the advocate. And advocates have an overriding duty to the court which may conflict with their client's interests. Hence they need protection.</p> <p>The House of Lords last looked at this issue 20 years ago, and decided that advocates' immunity should stand. But a group of test cases now awaiting judgment in the House could change that.</p> <p>The climate is different now. In the last few years, thanks to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, others who were once immune from being sued have lost that protection.

      "bodyText": "You can sue your doctor if he removes the wrong kidney or your solicitor if she messes up your conveyancing. But many people might be surprised to learn that you cannot sue an advocate - barrister or solicitor - who makes a hash of your case in court. There is no statute that says you can't. But judges have conferred immunity on advocates in a line of court cases. The reason? Public policy. It would be undesirable, it is said, if cases already decided by one court could in effect be re-litigated in another by suing the advocate. And advocates have an overriding duty to the court which may conflict with their client's interests. Hence they need protection. The House of Lords last looked at this issue 20 years ago, and decided that advocates' immunity should stand. But a group of test cases now awaiting judgment in the House could change that. The climate is different now. In the last few years, thanks to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, others who were once immune from being sued have lost that protection. The police, in their crime prevention and investigation role, and local authorities, in their child protection role, were until recently immune. No longer. After all, the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees a fair hearing in civil claims. But how can you have a fair hearing if your claim is struck out before it even gets off the ground? From next October the convention will be incorporated into our law and its guarantees will be enforceable in our courts. So it is opportune that the law lords look again at advocates' immunity and how far it should survive in the new human rights era - if at all. As Lord Bingham, the Lord Chief Justice, said in the Court of Appeal, ruling that the claims could go ahead: \"The law should be slow to grant its own practitioners a protection denied to members of other professions.\" Meanwhile, the Court of Appeal will next month hear an appeal by Mohammed Patel, who alleges he was wrongly convicted because of his barrister's failings in his 1987 trial. The Court of Appeal has ruled that the barrister should come to court to be questioned by both defence and prosecution counsel.

No Ted Heath, though (\"Ted's not really the sort of name . . .\") and no Tony Blair. \"Tone,\" says Lord Carrington, trying it out, with a little shudder.</p> <p>Historians might also observe with interest that the former foreign secretary, noted for his special relationship with the Iron Lady, has never had a Margaret Thatcher. Lord Carrington, who is sitting on the sofa in his mews house in Knightsbridge, does a little dance with his feet, a soft-shoe shuffle. \"People always ask that,\" he says. \"And it's really very difficult to answer.\" He gives a surprisingly impish grin. \"What can you say, 'No, we don't have bitches.'?\"</p> <p>He conducts this interview in two modes. There's the skittish Carrington, the 80-year-old imp, who says \"goody goody\" and \"Can I go now?\" every five minutes like a schoolboy waiting for the bell. He introduces me to Diana, his secretary, an attractive woman 30 years or so his junior, in his office across the courtyard. There's a staircase in the room and I ask what's upstairs. \"Filing,\" she says. He says, suggestively, \"What did you think?\"</p> <p>He is the sixth baron in his line; there are paintings of family piles on the walls, including one - Hideous , he says - which is now Wickham Abbey school for girls. He's an old Etonian, an old Grenadier Guard, an old Tory and at times he camps his toffness for all it's worth. \"I mean, really, \" he says of the Times newspaper devoting half its front page to David Beckham's hair, relishing every scandalised minute. \"I mean, really .\"</p> <p>But on the subject of Zimbabwe, the octaves drop, the jowls sag, his eyes become hooded behind his over-sized specs. Peter Carrington was Thatcher's Foreign Secretary in 1980 at the time of the Lancaster House agreement, which ended white rule in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Letters in the right-wing press (including the Telegraph, of which he is a director) were last week blaming him for the current catastrophe. Certainly it was Carrington who persuaded Thatcher away from her initial support of the (honorary white) Muzorewa regime to accept Mugabe, the self-proclaimed Marxist whom she had described only a few months before as \"no better than the IRA\".</p> <p>\"I think her inclination was she would have liked to have agreed to the Muzorewa thing, a satisfactory settlement from the point of view of the whites,\" says Carrington now. \"But it wouldn't have lasted and it wouldn't have stopped the war.</p> <p>\"It is very far-fetched of people to say that what is happening in Zimbabwe, which is truly awful, is due to the Lancaster House agreement. But for that, there wouldn't be a single white farmer on any farm in Zimbabwe, or any white person in Zimbabwe at all. What was happening in 1979 was people being killed, black and white, and the place was in a state of collapse. Do I think there was anything we should have done differently?\" He pauses and, taking a folded handkerchief out of his top pocket, he dabs the end of his nose. \"No, I don't. Honestly. I was thinking about it and I honestly don't think so because we were very lucky to get an agreement on all sides at all. It was the only solution it was possible to get at that time. And really it started off rather well. For 10 years he stuck to the provisions in the agreement.\"</p> <p>So what went wrong? He gives a sigh. \"The frailty of the leader,\" he says. \"Surrounded by great style and comfort, he's insulated from the economic catastrophe. And he's determined to stay in power at all costs. Really it is always a great mistake, a leader staying too long. . .\" He blinks slowly, or it may have been a wink.</p> <p>He served under Macmillan and Heath, even Churchill, but it was clearly Thatcher who galvanised him the most. He won't have a word said against her, clasps a knee with both hands and rocks back into the sofa cushions when he talks about her. Never been to Africa before they went to Lusaka, he says, \"and brave as a lion\". She had two pairs of dark glasses in her handbag. \"In case they start throwing acid,\" she said. \"And then when I was travelling about with her, it would be about one in the morning, and I'd say 'I'm off to bed,' and she'd look at me and say, 'Poor Peter, are you tired?' A remarkable woman. Remarkable.\" His feet dance around the floor. \"I don't agree with her about everything, in fact I don't agree with her about a lot of things. But a remarkable woman.\"</p> <p>His downfall was her making. He resigned in 1982 at the onset of the Falklands war (after being in the Middle East when Galtieri invaded.) \"It wasn't much fun leaving, as you can imagine. She tried to stop me. She was very nice to me . . . But it cleared the air. And it all turned out very well really. The Falklands was a great fillip to this country and, curiously, Margaret Thatcher might not have got a second term but for it.\" So he could say his resignation paved the way for that? He dabs his nose again and ignores the question. He spends a lot of effort trying to remove himself from the centre of things. \"If you're in politics you have to take your ups and your downs.

      "bodyText": "Lord Carrington keeps wire-haired dachshunds. Has done \"for years and years\". He and his wife, Iona, name them after prime ministers. At the moment they're on Arthur Balfour and Harold Wilson (\"SHUT UP, Harold,\" he yells when Harold Wilson barks at the cleaner) and \"we've had pretty well everyone else\". No Ted Heath, though (\"Ted's not really the sort of name . . .\") and no Tony Blair. \"Tone,\" says Lord Carrington, trying it out, with a little shudder. Historians might also observe with interest that the former foreign secretary, noted for his special relationship with the Iron Lady, has never had a Margaret Thatcher. Lord Carrington, who is sitting on the sofa in his mews house in Knightsbridge, does a little dance with his feet, a soft-shoe shuffle. \"People always ask that,\" he says. \"And it's really very difficult to answer.\" He gives a surprisingly impish grin. \"What can you say, 'No, we don't have bitches.'?\" He conducts this interview in two modes. There's the skittish Carrington, the 80-year-old imp, who says \"goody goody\" and \"Can I go now?\" every five minutes like a schoolboy waiting for the bell. He introduces me to Diana, his secretary, an attractive woman 30 years or so his junior, in his office across the courtyard. There's a staircase in the room and I ask what's upstairs. \"Filing,\" she says. He says, suggestively, \"What did you think?\" He is the sixth baron in his line; there are paintings of family piles on the walls, including one - Hideous , he says - which is now Wickham Abbey school for girls. He's an old Etonian, an old Grenadier Guard, an old Tory and at times he camps his toffness for all it's worth. \"I mean, really, \" he says of the Times newspaper devoting half its front page to David Beckham's hair, relishing every scandalised minute. \"I mean, really .\" But on the subject of Zimbabwe, the octaves drop, the jowls sag, his eyes become hooded behind his over-sized specs. Peter Carrington was Thatcher's Foreign Secretary in 1980 at the time of the Lancaster House agreement, which ended white rule in Zimbabwe. Letters in the right-wing press (including the Telegraph, of which he is a director) were last week blaming him for the current catastrophe. Certainly it was Carrington who persuaded Thatcher away from her initial support of the (honorary white) Muzorewa regime to accept Mugabe, the self-proclaimed Marxist whom she had described only a few months before as \"no better than the IRA\". \"I think her inclination was she would have liked to have agreed to the Muzorewa thing, a satisfactory settlement from the point of view of the whites,\" says Carrington now. \"But it wouldn't have lasted and it wouldn't have stopped the war. \"It is very far-fetched of people to say that what is happening in Zimbabwe, which is truly awful, is due to the Lancaster House agreement. But for that, there wouldn't be a single white farmer on any farm in Zimbabwe, or any white person in Zimbabwe at all. What was happening in 1979 was people being killed, black and white, and the place was in a state of collapse. Do I think there was anything we should have done differently?\" He pauses and, taking a folded handkerchief out of his top pocket, he dabs the end of his nose. \"No, I don't. Honestly. I was thinking about it and I honestly don't think so because we were very lucky to get an agreement on all sides at all. It was the only solution it was possible to get at that time. And really it started off rather well. For 10 years he stuck to the provisions in the agreement.\" So what went wrong? He gives a sigh. \"The frailty of the leader,\" he says. \"Surrounded by great style and comfort, he's insulated from the economic catastrophe. And he's determined to stay in power at all costs. Really it is always a great mistake, a leader staying too long. . .\" He blinks slowly, or it may have been a wink. He served under Macmillan and Heath, even Churchill, but it was clearly Thatcher who galvanised him the most. He won't have a word said against her, clasps a knee with both hands and rocks back into the sofa cushions when he talks about her. Never been to Africa before they went to Lusaka, he says, \"and brave as a lion\". She had two pairs of dark glasses in her handbag. \"In case they start throwing acid,\" she said. \"And then when I was travelling about with her, it would be about one in the morning, and I'd say 'I'm off to bed,' and she'd look at me and say, 'Poor Peter, are you tired?'

      "body": "<p>Benjamin Britten hated television. He never owned a set and, when invited to oversee a broadcast version of his opera Billy Budd in 1965, was horrified by the cable-strewn chaos of the studio. </p> <p>He was right to distrust the long but unsatisfactory marriage of opera and film. His Owen Wingrave was one of the few operas specifically written for TV, but when it was first broadcast in 1971 it was reckoned to be only a partial success. </p> <p>Later productions in the opera house confirmed what had been suspected all along: Britten had conceived the opera with an eye to the stage, and had little sympathy for the technicalities of television production. </p> <p>Now the director Phyllida Lloyd has attempted to better Britten by filming Gloriana, one of Britten's greatest flops when it was first performed. The stony reception this uncompromising portrait of Elizabeth I received at its gala presentation for the coronation of the present Queen meant that it was condemned to the farthest reaches of the repertory for 40 years, until Lloyd's 1994 staging for Opera North. The piece was finally reclaimed, bringing a revelatory performance from Dame Josephine Barstow in the title role. </p> <p>It was Lloyd's dream to rework the production for TV, and the result can be seen on BBC2 tonight. But capturing a hit stage production on celluloid is an elusive goal that has brought many eminent producers, conductors and film-makers to grief. </p> <p>Right from the birth of cinema - even before the first talkies - film-makers were drawn to opera. In 1915 the ambitious young producer Samuel Goldfish tempted Geraldine Farrar - then the biggest star at the New York Met - to Hollywood to realise his pet project: an adaptation of Bizet's Carmen to be directed by Goldfish's young protege, Cecil B DeMille, who at that point did not have a successful film to his name. </p> <p>Farrar's presence lent credibility to a project that established DeMille's characteristic epic style, transformed Goldfish into Goldwyn and taught the soprano a whole new repertoire of realistic, camera-developed acting skills. But as the New York Times critic remarked at the time: \"It is a curious commentary on the crazy economy of the theatre that a supreme dramatic soprano should give any of her precious time to a form of entertainment wherein the chief characteristic is complete and abysmal silence.\" </p> <p>Still, lack of sound did nothing to deter eager directors, even if successes in the genre were few and far between. Notable exceptions include the Strauss-endorsed, silent Der Rosenkavalier of 1926 and the subsequent version of Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann made by the British team of Powell, Pressburger and conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. </p> <p>In the latter part of the century, Joseph Losey's Don Giovanni (1978) used evocative, Palladian locations to complement Kiri Tte Kanawa in a fetching wimple. Placido Domingo and a spectacularly sultry Julia Migenes overcame dodgy dubbing in Francesco Rosi's authentically Andalusian Carmen (1984), while a decade before Ingmar Bergman created what many consider to be the finest example of the breed, with his baroque jewel box of a Magic Flute. So much of the rest, however, is a sorry tale of blunders, such as Pavarotti clowning around oafishly in the 1982 Yes, Giorgio, about which the kindest thing one can say is: No, Giorgio. </p> <p>If transplanting opera from stage to screen has met with limited success, works composed specifically for film have hardly fared any better. Erich Korngold's Give Us This Night, commissioned by Paramount in 1936, could hardly have fielded a stronger team. </p> <p>Oscar Hammerstein II provided the screenplay and lyrics, two singers with established popular appeal, Gladys Swarthout and Jan Keipura, were lined up to star, and Korngold himself was that rare commodity - a \"serious\" composer with a successful sideline in Hollywood scores. </p> <p>Korngold believed he was on the brink of a new era. \"We no longer have to lean on Verdi, Puccini and Mascagni,\" he declared. \"We are now conducting a test which will eventually lead to the writing of entire modern operas for the screen. When that day comes, composers will accept the motion picture as a musical form equal to the opera or the symphony.\" </p> <p>We're still waiting. But if cinematic opera never really got off the ground, the challenge was rather more realistically taken up by television. The year that Give Us This Night was commissioned also saw the first ever television opera broadcast, when, a mere 11 days after first going on air, the BBC brought Albert Coates's Pickwick to the 400 or so people in the London area who owned a receiver. </p> <p>Broadcast opera formed a substantial part of the BBC's early remit. In its first three years of transmission the BBC broadcast 30 operas, including some truly obscure choices such as John Blow's Venus and Adonis, Charles Dibdin's Lionel and Clarissa and Thomas Arne's Thomas and Sally. </p> <p>The first channel to commission an opera for television was New York's NBC, which, in 1949, invited Gian Carlo Menotti to produce the only TV opera besides Britten's Owen Wingrave to have enjoyed any life beyond its initial showing. Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors, a Christmas fantasy about a crippled boy's encounter with the Magi, became a seasonal fixture on most American networks. </p> <p>It was principally NBC's success with televised opera that prompted the BBC to persuade Benjamin Britten to write Owen Wingrave. The composer finally agreed because the proceeds would help rebuild Snape Maltings concert hall near Aldeburgh, which had burned down in 1969. Writing to his friend and sometime librettist William Plomer after the broadcast, Britten confided: \"O what a terrible medium - between ourselves it looked pretty awful. I hope you'll see it on the stage before too long.\" </p> <p> Phyllida Lloyd's version of Gloriana, on the other hand, was never conceived with the small screen in mind. The transformation came about through a moment of inspiration while Lloyd was skulking in the wings of the Grand Theatre, Leeds, and observing the darkened chaos backstage. </p> <p>Her original production implied that Elizabeth's public persona was essentially a theatrical role. Her television version puts on screen the world of singers, stage managers, dressers and technicians as a model of the \"staged\" Elizabethan court. The result is a kind of real-time documentary of a performance in progress utilising the mobility of the camera to create a dimension of intimacy unavailable from a seat in the auditorium. </p> <p>As an opera production that actually gains from being televised, Gloriana - A Film (to give it its official title) is a breakthrough. But whether it signals the way forward for further small-screen operas is debatable. Lloyd's is not a universally applicable solution. </p> <p>Achieved at great expense essentially as a six-year labour of love from Lloyd, Opera North and the production company Illuminations, the film is a glorious one-off. Televised opera may be accessible to all, but it still remains the most expensive noise on air.</p>",

Right from the birth of cinema - even before the first talkies - film-makers were drawn to opera. In 1915 the ambitious young producer Samuel Goldfish tempted Geraldine Farrar - then the biggest star at the New York Met - to Hollywood to realise his pet project: an adaptation of Bizet's Carmen to be directed by Goldfish's young protege, Cecil B DeMille, who at that point did not have a successful film to his name. Farrar's presence lent credibility to a project that established DeMille's characteristic epic style, transformed Goldfish into Goldwyn and taught the soprano a whole new repertoire of realistic, camera-developed acting skills. But as the New York Times critic remarked at the time: \"It is a curious commentary on the crazy economy of the theatre that a supreme dramatic soprano should give any of her precious time to a form of entertainment wherein the chief characteristic is complete and abysmal silence.\" Still, lack of sound did nothing to deter eager directors, even if successes in the genre were few and far between. Notable exceptions include the Strauss-endorsed, silent Der Rosenkavalier of 1926 and the subsequent version of Offenbach's Tales of Hoffmann made by the British team of Powell, Pressburger and conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In the latter part of the century, Joseph Losey's Don Giovanni (1978) used evocative, Palladian locations to complement Kiri Tte Kanawa in a fetching wimple. Placido Domingo and a spectacularly sultry Julia Migenes overcame dodgy dubbing in Francesco Rosi's authentically Andalusian Carmen (1984), while a decade before Ingmar Bergman created what many consider to be the finest example of the breed, with his baroque jewel box of a Magic Flute. So much of the rest, however, is a sorry tale of blunders, such as Pavarotti clowning around oafishly in the 1982 Yes, Giorgio, about which the kindest thing one can say is: No, Giorgio. If transplanting opera from stage to screen has met with limited success, works composed specifically for film have hardly fared any better. Erich Korngold's Give Us This Night, commissioned by Paramount in 1936, could hardly have fielded a stronger team. Oscar Hammerstein II provided the screenplay and lyrics, two singers with established popular appeal, Gladys Swarthout and Jan Keipura, were lined up to star, and Korngold himself was that rare commodity - a \"serious\" composer with a successful sideline in Hollywood scores. Korngold believed he was on the brink of a new era. \"We no longer have to lean on Verdi, Puccini and Mascagni,\" he declared. \"We are now conducting a test which will eventually lead to the writing of entire modern operas for the screen. When that day comes, composers will accept the motion picture as a musical form equal to the opera or the symphony.\" We're still waiting. But if cinematic opera never really got off the ground, the challenge was rather more realistically taken up by television. The year that Give Us This Night was commissioned also saw the first ever television opera broadcast, when, a mere 11 days after first going on air, the BBC brought Albert Coates's Pickwick to the 400 or so people in the London area who owned a receiver. Broadcast opera formed a substantial part of the BBC's early remit. In its first three years of transmission the BBC broadcast 30 operas, including some truly obscure choices such as John Blow's Venus and Adonis, Charles Dibdin's Lionel and Clarissa and Thomas Arne's Thomas and Sally. The first channel to commission an opera for television was New York's NBC, which, in 1949, invited Gian Carlo Menotti to produce the only TV opera besides Britten's Owen Wingrave to have enjoyed any life beyond its initial showing. Menotti's Amahl and the Night Visitors, a Christmas fantasy about a crippled boy's encounter with the Magi, became a seasonal fixture on most American networks. It was principally NBC's success with televised opera that prompted the BBC to persuade Benjamin Britten to write Owen Wingrave. The composer finally agreed because the proceeds would help rebuild Snape Maltings concert hall near Aldeburgh, which had burned down in 1969. Writing to his friend and sometime librettist William Plomer after the broadcast, Britten confided: \"O what a terrible medium - between ourselves it looked pretty awful. I hope you'll see it on the stage before too long.\" Phyllida Lloyd's version of Gloriana, on the other hand, was never conceived with the small screen in mind. The transformation came about through a moment of inspiration while Lloyd was skulking in the wings of the Grand Theatre, Leeds, and observing the darkened chaos backstage. Her original production implied that Elizabeth's public persona was essentially a theatrical role. Her television version puts on screen the world of singers, stage managers, dressers and technicians as a model of the \"staged\" Elizabethan court. The result is a kind of real-time documentary of a performance in progress utilising the mobility of the camera to create a dimension of intimacy unavailable from a seat in the auditorium. As an opera production that actually gains from being televised, Gloriana - A Film (to give it its official title) is a breakthrough. But whether it signals the way forward for further small-screen operas is debatable. Lloyd's is not a universally applicable solution. Achieved at great expense essentially as a six-year labour of love from Lloyd, Opera North and the production company Illuminations, the film is a glorious one-off. Televised opera may be accessible to all, but it still remains the most expensive noise on air.",

The MCN case proved that content can be passed off as journalism, but increasingly journalism is becoming content, no more than binary data to be recycled with ease and at speed. </p> <p>The sly and ancient practice of recycling stories is now an endemic cancer at the heart of the medium in which we will all earn our futures. The concept of authored, bylined journalism on the net is an increasingly hard one to grasp. </p> <p>\"A lot of the big sites take a newsfeed from PA,\" says Lisa Hulme, joint managing director of the internet PR agency, big-mouths.com. \"We place stories on the PA website because we know that they will appear on Yahoo, Excite and several other portals instantaneously and get read by hundreds of thousands of people within hours. Information is circulated at lightning speed on the internet.\" HTML coding tricks mean these PA newsfeeds look as if they are content generated by Excite and Yahoo themselves - right colours, right logos etc - with only a small credit for the original source. A well as these big search engines using the same content, further aggregation of content by services such as moreover.com and newsnow.co.uk recycles stories even further. Moreover and newsnow spider, or check, thousands of sites every minute - with or without the website operator's consent - and collate headlines into a kind of macro newsfeed. These newsfeeds - essentially just a series of headlines linking to the source sites - are then used by other sites making them look like their own branded, constantly updated news service. </p> <p>The combination of theft and internet technology make it very hard to establish ownership over content. But in the quest to gain more traffic and sell advertising, few seem to mind: \"Everyone's very happy to be spidered by us,\" says Nick Gilbert, one of the founders of newsnow.co.uk. \"Some sites even create special messages saying 'as used by newsnow', they're so happy for us to syndicate their content. Our syndication service is a real way of getting people to visit a site.\" </p> <p>Syndication used to mean a split between the originator of the story and the syndication agency. On the internet however, syndication is not a profit driver but a traffic driver. And with everyone apparently desperate - according to Gilbert - to syndicate their content in such a way and equally desperate to carry the \"enhanced\" content of a newsfeed, websites are often sporting links to rivals' offerings without realising: the medium that was supposed to speak with a million voices seems to have very little to say for itself that's original. The internet promised diversity but has delivered - in journalistic terms - homogeneity. </p> <p>Trying to build a reputation for first-class journalism in a medium dominated by porn, unmonitored chat rooms and newsfeeds isn't easy. And when a story you've worked on for weeks appears within minutes on another site without your byline, it's hardly an incentive for excellence. But internet journalists owe it to themselves and their future careers to be more honourable: plagiarism plays into the hands of those who see journalism as just another form of content and who see no reason to pay for our contacts and skill when so much content is available for nada. </p> <p>For the past year I have been establishing an alternative media portal for people working in TV and publishing. My site is not the only site occupying, in net jargon, the media space and the competition for a limited market has meant accusations of plagiarism are made fairly regularly between me and my competitors. I know from my stat logs that my competitors visit my site on a daily basis and it's not often that an exclusive stays exclusive for long. You can watermark content by inserting invisible bits of html code that you can use to unmask the cut and paste merchants, but it's fairly easy to remove those watermarks and that only trips up the amateurs. Ten years ago it took 36 hours for me to recycle and remodel CNN's scoops for my own ends, but now that the ability to cut and paste has replaced nous and contacts as core journalistic skills, stories are replicated within minutes. </p> <p>A decade on from my days stealthily peddling journalism that was not my own and printed under someone else's byline, I find myself employing a team of trained and tenacious journalists producing some of the most original and rigorous journalism on the web. Holding on to a sense of authorship over our content, sorry, journalism, in a medium where newsgathering is done by computers and people with meaningless titles like \"content producer\" is one of the greatest challenges facing independent web publishers. We might get a little sidetracked as we chase the almighty advertising dollar, but we ignore the value of traditional reporting at our peril. </p> <p>\u0095 Josephine Monroe is co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.the-bullet.com\">the-bullet</a></p>",

The concept of authored, bylined journalism on the net is an increasingly hard one to grasp. \"A lot of the big sites take a newsfeed from PA,\" says Lisa Hulme, joint managing director of the internet PR agency, big-mouths.com. \"We place stories on the PA website because we know that they will appear on Yahoo, Excite and several other portals instantaneously and get read by hundreds of thousands of people within hours. Information is circulated at lightning speed on the internet.\" HTML coding tricks mean these PA newsfeeds look as if they are content generated by Excite and Yahoo themselves - right colours, right logos etc - with only a small credit for the original source. A well as these big search engines using the same content, further aggregation of content by services such as moreover.com and newsnow.co.uk recycles stories even further. Moreover and newsnow spider, or check, thousands of sites every minute - with or without the website operator's consent - and collate headlines into a kind of macro newsfeed. These newsfeeds - essentially just a series of headlines linking to the source sites - are then used by other sites making them look like their own branded, constantly updated news service. The combination of theft and internet technology make it very hard to establish ownership over content. But in the quest to gain more traffic and sell advertising, few seem to mind: \"Everyone's very happy to be spidered by us,\" says Nick Gilbert, one of the founders of newsnow.co.uk. \"Some sites even create special messages saying 'as used by newsnow', they're so happy for us to syndicate their content. Our syndication service is a real way of getting people to visit a site.\" Syndication used to mean a split between the originator of the story and the syndication agency. On the internet however, syndication is not a profit driver but a traffic driver. And with everyone apparently desperate - according to Gilbert - to syndicate their content in such a way and equally desperate to carry the \"enhanced\" content of a newsfeed, websites are often sporting links to rivals' offerings without realising: the medium that was supposed to speak with a million voices seems to have very little to say for itself that's original. The internet promised diversity but has delivered - in journalistic terms - homogeneity. Trying to build a reputation for first-class journalism in a medium dominated by porn, unmonitored chat rooms and newsfeeds isn't easy. And when a story you've worked on for weeks appears within minutes on another site without your byline, it's hardly an incentive for excellence. But internet journalists owe it to themselves and their future careers to be more honourable: plagiarism plays into the hands of those who see journalism as just another form of content and who see no reason to pay for our contacts and skill when so much content is available for nada. For the past year I have been establishing an alternative media portal for people working in TV and publishing. My site is not the only site occupying, in net jargon, the media space and the competition for a limited market has meant accusations of plagiarism are made fairly regularly between me and my competitors. I know from my stat logs that my competitors visit my site on a daily basis and it's not often that an exclusive stays exclusive for long. You can watermark content by inserting invisible bits of html code that you can use to unmask the cut and paste merchants, but it's fairly easy to remove those watermarks and that only trips up the amateurs. Ten years ago it took 36 hours for me to recycle and remodel CNN's scoops for my own ends, but now that the ability to cut and paste has replaced nous and contacts as core journalistic skills, stories are replicated within minutes. A decade on from my days stealthily peddling journalism that was not my own and printed under someone else's byline, I find myself employing a team of trained and tenacious journalists producing some of the most original and rigorous journalism on the web. Holding on to a sense of authorship over our content, sorry, journalism, in a medium where newsgathering is done by computers and people with meaningless titles like \"content producer\" is one of the greatest challenges facing independent web publishers. We might get a little sidetracked as we chase the almighty advertising dollar, but we ignore the value of traditional reporting at our peril. \u0095 Josephine Monroe is co-founder of the-bullet",

He could ferret out a ripping yarn in turgid official prose or bland agency copy; he could find a sensitive insight, or a quirky look at life. He was a marvellous reporter.</p> <p>He was always determined to be a journalist, an ambition which alarmed his parents, both distinguished medical practitioners. They had sent him to Haileybury, the school which specialised in turning out servants of Empire, and the Indian Empire in particular. That tickled Ian, but he was never tempted by public service.</p> <p>Instead, he plunged into the rough end, training on the Croydon Advertiser before moving to the News of the World, reporting sleazy court cases, writing features on the comparative merits of holiday camps, and covering the 1966 Aberfan disaster. He moved on to the pre-Rupert Murdoch Sun - the short-lived and much-lamented broadsheet; then, 30 years ago, gravitated to his natural home, the Times.</p> <p>Some of its empire-era languor remained. Ian revelled in the authority of the title, and in gently pricking the pomposity of the institution. He served on the labour staff during the industrial mayhem of the early 1970s, and on the newsdesk. For a year, he also took an executive editorial job on the new London commercial radio station, LBC, but quickly bounced back to the Times.</p> <p>In 1977, his longest-held ambition was realised when he was appointed to the Paris office, serving as deputy to the crusty bureau chief, Charles Hargrove. Ian was a born foreign correspondent, working the diplomatic circuit; his patch included chunks of former French territory in West Africa.</p> <p>In the early 1980s, he became the Times man in Brussels, a news reporter's gulag. But Ian treated the Euro-babble with splendid contempt - and hewed story after story from the European Economic Community word-face. In Strasbourg, where the European Parliament held its monthly jamboree, British correspondents were once dismayed to be confronted by nine potential stories on one day.

      "bodyText": "Ian Murray, who has died of liver cancer aged 59, was a master of the reporting trade, a story-spotter as much as a story-teller. He could ferret out a ripping yarn in turgid official prose or bland agency copy; he could find a sensitive insight, or a quirky look at life. He was a marvellous reporter. He was always determined to be a journalist, an ambition which alarmed his parents, both distinguished medical practitioners. They had sent him to Haileybury, the school which specialised in turning out servants of Empire, and the Indian Empire in particular. That tickled Ian, but he was never tempted by public service. Instead, he plunged into the rough end, training on the Croydon Advertiser before moving to the News of the World, reporting sleazy court cases, writing features on the comparative merits of holiday camps, and covering the 1966 Aberfan disaster. He moved on to the pre-Rupert Murdoch Sun - the short-lived and much-lamented broadsheet; then, 30 years ago, gravitated to his natural home, the Times. Some of its empire-era languor remained. Ian revelled in the authority of the title, and in gently pricking the pomposity of the institution. He served on the labour staff during the industrial mayhem of the early 1970s, and on the newsdesk. For a year, he also took an executive editorial job on the new London commercial radio station, LBC, but quickly bounced back to the Times. In 1977, his longest-held ambition was realised when he was appointed to the Paris office, serving as deputy to the crusty bureau chief, Charles Hargrove. Ian was a born foreign correspondent, working the diplomatic circuit; his patch included chunks of former French territory in West Africa. In the early 1980s, he became the Times man in Brussels, a news reporter's gulag. But Ian treated the Euro-babble with splendid contempt - and hewed story after story from the European Economic Community word-face. In Strasbourg, where the European Parliament held its monthly jamboree, British correspondents were once dismayed to be confronted by nine potential stories on one day. Most of us settled for sending over a couple of the best, Ian filed the lot. He was a generous colleague and splendid companion; his penchant for lamentable puns - he could not see a cloth cap without muttering, \"flat hattery will get you nowhere\" - masked a love of language and letters. He would, when least expected, recite chunks of Shakespeare, and had an ear for Chaucerian speech. From Brussels, Ian went on to distinguished service in Jerusalem and Bonn. In the 1990s, as editors - and accountants - wearied of foreign coverage, he was hauled back to London to the newsroom once more. Wapping was not to Ian's taste, but, as a craftsman, he plunged back into home reporting, became local government correspondent, and, in 1997, medical correspondent. To that role he applied all his experience, his eye for a good story, and his scrupulous regard for the truth. As illness consumed him, he did not deviate an inch from his standards, working until a few days before his death. He wrote of his own predicament, describing the experimental treatment he was undergoing without any self-pity. He was a true reporter. Ian is survived by his wife, Carol, and by a daughter and son. \u0095 Ian Murray, journalist, born June 15 1940; died April 15 2000.",

      "bodyText": "Britain's longest-running industrial dispute has been resolved with the offer of job reinstatement or compensation running into several thousand pounds for 270 sacked strikers at Skychefs. The workers, who provide in-flight catering services for 14 airlines operating from Heathrow airport, were sacked in November 1998 when they went on a legal one-day strike over changes to shift patterns. Resolution of the dispute comes on the eve of the intro duction of new workers' rights in the Employment Relations Act which would have made the sackings illegal. The act, which comes into force today, bars employers from sacking staff during the first eight weeks of a legally called strike. Since their dismissal 17 months ago, the Skychefs strikers, most of whom are women of Asian background, have picketed the company's kitchens and airlines which use the services of LSG Skychefs, part of German national carrier Lufthansa.",

Hence the heroics of labour which the privileged have seized in their arduous calling: high-paid workaholics, helots of the advanced market economy, driven to work longer hours than were ever imposed by factory masters in Victorian England. </p> <p>This explains the urgency of documents, blueprints, reports, plans, schedules and printouts which must be on somebody's desk by yesterday, the unblinking stare of banks of screens before which the burned-out eyes of insomniac whizz-kids monitor minusucule shifts in the value of currencies. And the perpetual birdsong of mobile phones in public places - more imperious even than the factory-hooters which once sounded over the streets of Bolton and Halifax. </p> <p>People serving abstractions such as futures, derivatives, and other invisibles must shout louder to advertise their indispensability; and despite handsome material rewards, they are always complaining of lack of recognition of their dedication and self-sacrifice. </p> <p>The importance of display, the burnishing of images and appearances, presentations and makeovers have loosened our purchase on reality. </p> <p>Our material needs are wafted in from a distant elsewhere; we are self-provisioning in virtually nothing. </p> <p>We must convince ourselves of the value of our functionless activity. The high-octane busy-ness of executives who are head-hunted for their vision, and then dismissed within months because of falling profits, with the meagre consolation of a six-figure bonus. </p> <p>The self-importance of celebrities talking on television about the tragedy of their year-long marriage, or the purposeless mobility of intercontinetal travellers attending conferences in sound-proofed hotel suites close to airports, whose fluttering diaries are chock-full until September at the earliest. </p> <p>Behind the business jargon which is now applied to every human activity - targets and outcomes, productivity and best practice - can be detected high anxiety, doubts over its human purposes, the question not to be asked: what is it all for? </p> <p>We have never been so busy. We find ourselves doing several things at once - shopping, eating and phoning; watching television, reading and helping with the chilldren's homework; travelling, listening to music, working at the lap-top; making love, planning tomorrow's schedule and recalling pornographic images taken off the internet. </p> <p>Our leisure time is even more colonised than our work - so much fun to be packed into the inelastic hours at our disposal! </p> <p>The economy has long ceased to serve humanity; and in recent years even the pretence that it does so has been abandoned. </p> <p>The \"performance\" of the economy is now the highest priority. Bulletins appear daily on its health, whether it is ailing, robust or recovering, whether markets are nervous, volatile or steady. The economy has been anthropomorphised, and human beings diminished, disposable as the trash we become if we cease to be marketable. </p> <p>Stress, bullying, harassment, discrimination are significant features of this economy. Older consolations of work-place solidarity have vanished in favour of a more intensely competitive insecurity: desks are cleared, pay-offs settled, services dispensed with in the twinkling of an eye. </p> <p>This new economy is unpredictable, and we respond to its arbitrariness in much the same way as the serving classes formerly curtsied and touched their forelock to more material masters of flesh and blood. </p> <p>The greatest growth in employment is in leisure and entertainment: a pub chain \"creates\" 5000 jobs; retail outlets promise work for thousands; fast food companies provide career opportunities. </p> <p>These are spoken of as \"real jobs\", unlike the archaic manufacture of expendables such as shoes, steel, cups, clothes and ships. </p> <p>The promised liberation of the \"knowledge-based economy\" remains elusive. We think we are tooling up for the new millennium, but most of us are learning to know our place in the have-a-nice-day service sector. </p> <p>People who do possess skills and knowledge find these being degraded. Those in the \"caring professions\" see their abilities eroded by industrial disciplines - doctors spend more time on paperwork, teachers merely \"facilitate education\", while social workers are busy avoiding blame for any violence their clients may commit. </p> <p>Working with people is a debased ill-paid alternative to flying high in the economy of fantasy. </p> <p>This economy sounds light and insubstantial, but that is an illusion. It weighs oppressively upon the damged resource-base of the earth, and equally upon those who perform the despised labour we have jettisoned: the factory workers, harvesters of our daily bread in Asia and Africa, the servitors of global wealth who are pressed into the maintenance of the precarious and unquiet well-being of the rich. </p> <p>\u0095 Jeremy Seabrook is a writer.</p>",

Hence the heroics of labour which the privileged have seized in their arduous calling: high-paid workaholics, helots of the advanced market economy, driven to work longer hours than were ever imposed by factory masters in Victorian England. This explains the urgency of documents, blueprints, reports, plans, schedules and printouts which must be on somebody's desk by yesterday, the unblinking stare of banks of screens before which the burned-out eyes of insomniac whizz-kids monitor minusucule shifts in the value of currencies. And the perpetual birdsong of mobile phones in public places - more imperious even than the factory-hooters which once sounded over the streets of Bolton and Halifax. People serving abstractions such as futures, derivatives, and other invisibles must shout louder to advertise their indispensability; and despite handsome material rewards, they are always complaining of lack of recognition of their dedication and self-sacrifice. The importance of display, the burnishing of images and appearances, presentations and makeovers have loosened our purchase on reality. Our material needs are wafted in from a distant elsewhere; we are self-provisioning in virtually nothing. We must convince ourselves of the value of our functionless activity. The high-octane busy-ness of executives who are head-hunted for their vision, and then dismissed within months because of falling profits, with the meagre consolation of a six-figure bonus. The self-importance of celebrities talking on television about the tragedy of their year-long marriage, or the purposeless mobility of intercontinetal travellers attending conferences in sound-proofed hotel suites close to airports, whose fluttering diaries are chock-full until September at the earliest. Behind the business jargon which is now applied to every human activity - targets and outcomes, productivity and best practice - can be detected high anxiety, doubts over its human purposes, the question not to be asked: what is it all for? We have never been so busy. We find ourselves doing several things at once - shopping, eating and phoning; watching television, reading and helping with the chilldren's homework; travelling, listening to music, working at the lap-top; making love, planning tomorrow's schedule and recalling pornographic images taken off the internet. Our leisure time is even more colonised than our work - so much fun to be packed into the inelastic hours at our disposal! The economy has long ceased to serve humanity; and in recent years even the pretence that it does so has been abandoned. The \"performance\" of the economy is now the highest priority. Bulletins appear daily on its health, whether it is ailing, robust or recovering, whether markets are nervous, volatile or steady. The economy has been anthropomorphised, and human beings diminished, disposable as the trash we become if we cease to be marketable. Stress, bullying, harassment, discrimination are significant features of this economy. Older consolations of work-place solidarity have vanished in favour of a more intensely competitive insecurity: desks are cleared, pay-offs settled, services dispensed with in the twinkling of an eye. This new economy is unpredictable, and we respond to its arbitrariness in much the same way as the serving classes formerly curtsied and touched their forelock to more material masters of flesh and blood. The greatest growth in employment is in leisure and entertainment: a pub chain \"creates\" 5000 jobs; retail outlets promise work for thousands; fast food companies provide career opportunities. These are spoken of as \"real jobs\", unlike the archaic manufacture of expendables such as shoes, steel, cups, clothes and ships. The promised liberation of the \"knowledge-based economy\" remains elusive. We think we are tooling up for the new millennium, but most of us are learning to know our place in the have-a-nice-day service sector. People who do possess skills and knowledge find these being degraded. Those in the \"caring professions\" see their abilities eroded by industrial disciplines - doctors spend more time on paperwork, teachers merely \"facilitate education\", while social workers are busy avoiding blame for any violence their clients may commit. Working with people is a debased ill-paid alternative to flying high in the economy of fantasy. This economy sounds light and insubstantial, but that is an illusion. It weighs oppressively upon the damged resource-base of the earth, and equally upon those who perform the despised labour we have jettisoned: the factory workers, harvesters of our daily bread in Asia and Africa, the servitors of global wealth who are pressed into the maintenance of the precarious and unquiet well-being of the rich. \u0095 Jeremy Seabrook is a writer.",

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence appear to be at odds in their assessments of US proposals to create a new anti-ballistic-missile system. On the agenda of the talks which begin in New York today on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, Washington's scheme for a national missile defence (NMD) system is one of the most contentious issues. The Foreign Office minister Peter Hain will tell the conference that the American plan, which is meant to protect the US from attacks by \"rogue\" states such as North Korea, \"raises complex and difficult issues\". The Foreign Office is concerned about the plan.The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, is more enthusiastic, saying that the government is \"in a very good position and strong role as far as fetching and carrying [between the US and Russia] is concerned\". Not least of the Foreign Office's concerns is the fact that part of the proposed system would be built in Britain, but Britain would not necessarily be under its protective umbrella. The plan involves upgrading the US radar station at Fylingdales on the North Yorkshire moors. The US satellite communications station at Menwith Hill, near Harrogate, also in North Yorkshire, also plays a key role. Mr Hoon described Menwith Hill as part of a global system able to detect missiles launches throughout the world. \"Clearly, if you've got such a system in place, then that system could be used as part of [the US's] national missile defence. But it is a step we have yet to take,\" he said. On the Fylingdales upgrade he said: \"The position remains that unless and until the Americans take a decision to deploy NMD we are not required to take a decision as to what assistance we might give, and that remains the position.\" For his part, Mr Hain will say tonight that the issue has to be addressed by the US and Russia \"through calm, measured dialogue\". \"Despite obvious differences, we hope they can reach an agreement,\" he will say. \"We have made clear to both sides that we continue to value the [present] anti-ballistic-missile treaty and wish to see it preserved.\" He will be able to argue at the New York conference that Britain under the Labour government has taken unprecedented steps towards greater transparency in nuclear weapons policy. The 1998 strategic defence review said Britain would maintain a stockpile of less than 200 operationally available nuclear warheads. This compares with a maximum of 300 warheads announced by the previous Tory government, and is fewer than those held by the other four members of the official nuclear club. But review also said that the Trident system had to be capable of a \"sub-strategic\" role: the clear implication being that the government would be prepared to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states. It said: \"The credibility of deterrence depends . . . on retaining an option for a limited strike that would not automatically lead to a full-scale nuclear exchange.\" The review also committed the government to include British nuclear weapons in international negotiations towards \"mutual, balanced, and verifiable\" reductions, but only when it was \"satisfied with [the] progress towards our goal of the global elimination of nuclear weapons\". Such language enables the government to argue that Britain's nuclear weapons should be protected for the foreseeable future from any arms reduction negotiations. Meanwhile, more than 270 MPs have signed six separate Commons motions urging the government to have nothing to do with Washington's new anti-ballistic-missile project. Britain will also come under pressure to explain its plans for a successor to Trident and to detail the research it is undertaking with the US. Documents leaked recently from the Aldermaston atomic weapons factory refer to a plan \"to safeguard UK options and capabilities for a future nuclear weapon by December 2000\". But earlier this month the defence procurement minister, Baroness Symons, denied that a \"new nuclear weapon system\" was being developed at Aldermaston. Nevertheless, she added that the factory \"maintains a capability to produce a successor to Trident should this be required by the government. \"That decision is still some way off.\"",

Some observers believe that Nato's strategic concept opens the way to it using nuclear weapons against biological and chemical weapons, in violation of the \"negative security assurances\" given by the nuclear powers in 1995. The British American Security Information Council argues that Nato's existing \"nuclear sharing\" arrangements in time of war - whereby European non-nuclear states could gain access to US nuclear bombs - clearly breach the NPT.

Fundamental religious belief is every bit as strong among contemporary Americans as it was among the first settlers who crossed the Atlantic to seek religious freedom nearly four centuries ago. Forget the man-made American economic miracle: according to a Newsweek poll published yesterday to mark Easter, an astonishing 84% of Americans believed that God performed real miracles. Among Christians - who amount to about 160m of the US's 260m official residents - the proportion who believed in miracles was 90%. And the majority of non-Christians agreed with them. Almost as big a proportion believed that the miracles described in the Bible were true: 79% of all those surveyed and 85% of Christians thought they actually took place. Evangelical Protestants were the most likely to believe in the Bible's literal truth: 96% of them said they did. But even the most sceptical denomination - the Roman Catholics - showed 77% support for the scriptures' literal truth. The findings of the poll were very nearly as gratifying to the Devil they were to God. Exactly three quarters said they believed that Satan or the Devil existed, and four fifths of Christians said they believed in the Devil. According to the responses, a remarkably large proportion of Americans - 48% - say they have personally experienced or witnessed an event which they consider to have been miraculous.

      "body": "<p>Zimbabwe took a cautious step back towards political stability yesterday as a number of white farmers returned to their homesteads, opposition rallies passed off peacefully and police intervened to pacify squatters in some areas.</p> <p>In a weekend of mixed signals, a handful of farm occupations were overshadowed by deals between self-styled war veterans and farmers that allowed squatters to stay on land in return for peace and the promise that farmers would not harbour activists for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.</p> <p>Tension eased after a southern African summit at Victoria Falls on Friday appeared to come up with a formula for defusing the crisis. Leaders from South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia and Namibia apparently persuaded the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, to stop endorsing the farm occupations and hold elections while pushing Britain to fulfil its commitment to help fund land redistribution.</p> <p>Delegates from the British and Zimbabwean governments are to meet in London on Thursday to discuss the issue, with both Britain and the US expected to help fund the purchase of white-owned land for distribution to black peasant farmers.</p> <p>Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said the money would be given on condition that peace prevailed and that the land went to the poor.</p> <p>\"The starting point for our discussions will be the offer we made in 1998 to help fund a programme of land reform,\" he said. \"But it has to be a programme that is within the rule of law and helps the rural poor. And the occupations have to stop.\"</p> <p>The MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, welcomed the prospect of a land redistribution programme but warned that the international community should not use the apparent breakthrough to condone Mr Mugabe's tactics.</p> <p>He told a rally on Saturday: \"We need an orderly and fair distribution of land. We have no problem with that. But if they are endorsing Mugabe's lawlessness then we have a serious problem.\"</p> <p>Hopes that the Easter weekend would pass peacefully were boosted when white farmers returned to the Macheke area, where the farmer David Stevens was killed the previous weekend. Elsewhere police moved on to some farms to prevent squatters causing damage to property or hurting the owners. Previously they simply looked on as the attacks took place, claiming that the occupations were a political matter.</p> <p>On Saturday opposition rallies of several hundred people were held around the capital, Harare, without incident, in contrast to just a few weeks ago when MDC demonstrators were attacked by supporters of Zanu-PF, the ruling party.</p> <p>But the situation remained volatile. On Saturday night there was a bomb attack on an opposition newspaper, the Daily News, in Harare. No one was hurt but the blast followed a death threat to the editor.</p> <p>Meanwhile, sporadic land occupations continued. War veterans armed with guns and clubs invaded another white-owned farm yesterday, trapping the farm manager and two young women.</p> <p>The Forresters farm in the Mvurwi area, about 60 miles north of Harare, was occupied by about 200 veterans, a member of a local farm support group said.</p> <p>The group later reported that the crowd on the farm, one of the world's biggest tobacco operations, had swelled to about 700 and included labourers from nearby farms.</p> <p>It said the farm manager Duncan Hamilton, briefly detained outside the farmhouse, had been sent inside to join the women. Journalists who tried to approach were turned back by the squatters and told not to return. Police put up roadblocks but took no further action.</p> <p>On Saturday another white farmer north-east of Harare reported that 60 people armed with chains and wooden planks had occupied his property and assaulted him and a colleague.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party also stepped up its anti-white, anti-foreign rhetoric. In a full- page advertisement in yesterday's Standard newspaper the party told Zimbabweans: \"Don't throw away that power [won through independence] by surrendering it to unrepentant racial and foreign interests with your hands open in the air.\" It was referring to the raised open palm, the symbol of the MDC.</p>",

In a weekend of mixed signals, a handful of farm occupations were overshadowed by deals between self-styled war veterans and farmers that allowed squatters to stay on land in return for peace and the promise that farmers would not harbour activists for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Tension eased after a southern African summit at Victoria Falls on Friday appeared to come up with a formula for defusing the crisis. Leaders from South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia and Namibia apparently persuaded the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, to stop endorsing the farm occupations and hold elections while pushing Britain to fulfil its commitment to help fund land redistribution. Delegates from the British and Zimbabwean governments are to meet in London on Thursday to discuss the issue, with both Britain and the US expected to help fund the purchase of white-owned land for distribution to black peasant farmers. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, said the money would be given on condition that peace prevailed and that the land went to the poor. \"The starting point for our discussions will be the offer we made in 1998 to help fund a programme of land reform,\" he said. \"But it has to be a programme that is within the rule of law and helps the rural poor. And the occupations have to stop.\" The MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, welcomed the prospect of a land redistribution programme but warned that the international community should not use the apparent breakthrough to condone Mr Mugabe's tactics. He told a rally on Saturday: \"We need an orderly and fair distribution of land. We have no problem with that. But if they are endorsing Mugabe's lawlessness then we have a serious problem.\" Hopes that the Easter weekend would pass peacefully were boosted when white farmers returned to the Macheke area, where the farmer David Stevens was killed the previous weekend. Elsewhere police moved on to some farms to prevent squatters causing damage to property or hurting the owners. Previously they simply looked on as the attacks took place, claiming that the occupations were a political matter. On Saturday opposition rallies of several hundred people were held around the capital, Harare, without incident, in contrast to just a few weeks ago when MDC demonstrators were attacked by supporters of Zanu-PF, the ruling party. But the situation remained volatile. On Saturday night there was a bomb attack on an opposition newspaper, the Daily News, in Harare. No one was hurt but the blast followed a death threat to the editor. Meanwhile, sporadic land occupations continued. War veterans armed with guns and clubs invaded another white-owned farm yesterday, trapping the farm manager and two young women. The Forresters farm in the Mvurwi area, about 60 miles north of Harare, was occupied by about 200 veterans, a member of a local farm support group said. The group later reported that the crowd on the farm, one of the world's biggest tobacco operations, had swelled to about 700 and included labourers from nearby farms. It said the farm manager Duncan Hamilton, briefly detained outside the farmhouse, had been sent inside to join the women. Journalists who tried to approach were turned back by the squatters and told not to return. Police put up roadblocks but took no further action. On Saturday another white farmer north-east of Harare reported that 60 people armed with chains and wooden planks had occupied his property and assaulted him and a colleague. Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party also stepped up its anti-white, anti-foreign rhetoric. In a full- page advertisement in yesterday's Standard newspaper the party told Zimbabweans: \"Don't throw away that power [won through independence] by surrendering it to unrepentant racial and foreign interests with your hands open in the air.\" It was referring to the raised open palm, the symbol of the MDC.",

      "body": "<p>Researchers have confirmed the suspicions of shoppers trawling shopping centres this bank holiday - modern living has left many lost in a bewildering snowstorm of choice.</p> <p>A consumer group, The Future Foundation, says its research, carried out in conjunction with Abbey National, shows an American-style revolution in British consumerism has failed to enrich our lives but has caused confusion and anxiety as people struggle with the mind-boggling array of options available.</p> <p>Far from variety being the spice of life the once straightforward chore of grocery shopping has been complicated hugely over the past 20 years.</p> <p>Two decades ago the typical supermarket was stocked with 5,000 different lines, but it now boasts 40,000 separate products, including 400 brands of shampoo and nearly 100 different types of toothbrush. While 20 years ago buying water may have seemed absurd, Sainsbury's Leeds store now boasts a staggering 101 lines.</p> <p>This trend has also been reflected in the vogue for high street coffee shops. They offer up to 6,000 permutations of coffee, milk, topping and sugar - if you bought one a day it would take nearly 17 years to try them all.</p> <p>Michael Willmott, founder of The Future Foundation, initiated the survey of 1,000 adults to find out what irritates people most about modern living and his findings suggested the consumer explosion is a big factor complicating our already busy and complex lives. Mr Willmott said: \"Individual choice can be very empowering but, as this new research demonstrates, it brings hassles too.</p> <p>\"Consumers are feeling overwhelmed and it is starting to have a negative effect on people, making them feel anxious and stressed about making the right choice.</p> <p>\"But our research shows that consumers are finding their own solutions to cope with this situation. Choosing well-known brands is one, but some people are starting to employ less obvious strategies like buying only organic products or shopping only on a Friday when the supermarket shelves are emptier.</p> <p>\"In this way they are consciously limiting the products available to them.</p> <p>\"But some are unable to cope. One man interviewed during our survey went out to buy his mother a mobile phone but was so confused by the number of different makes and tariffs available he bought her an electric whisk instead.\"</p> <p>Two mothers in their 40s surveyed said: \"We have to get different sorts of cereal for everyone and it is the same with coffee and shampoo.\"</p> <p>A 70-year-old woman said: \"In my day we just had roast on Sunday, bubble and squeak rissoles on Monday, shepherd's pie on Tuesday and fish on Friday - every day you knew what you were going to eat.\"</p> <p>Guy Fielding, a psychologist from Oxford University, claims product saturation was reached more than 25 years ago.</p> <p>He said the British public have been encouraged to adopt an American attitude to consumerism to accommodate this choice revolution.</p> <p>\"Many British people used to deride the Americans asking why they needed so much consumer choice,\" he said. \"But now with the number of possibilities expanding in Britain we too are expected to be active and informed choosers where once our product consumption was marked by familiarity.</p> <p>\"The increase in choice has not necessarily lead to a similar increase in feelings of well-being.

      "bodyText": "Researchers have confirmed the suspicions of shoppers trawling shopping centres this bank holiday - modern living has left many lost in a bewildering snowstorm of choice. A consumer group, The Future Foundation, says its research, carried out in conjunction with Abbey National, shows an American-style revolution in British consumerism has failed to enrich our lives but has caused confusion and anxiety as people struggle with the mind-boggling array of options available. Far from variety being the spice of life the once straightforward chore of grocery shopping has been complicated hugely over the past 20 years. Two decades ago the typical supermarket was stocked with 5,000 different lines, but it now boasts 40,000 separate products, including 400 brands of shampoo and nearly 100 different types of toothbrush. While 20 years ago buying water may have seemed absurd, Sainsbury's Leeds store now boasts a staggering 101 lines. This trend has also been reflected in the vogue for high street coffee shops. They offer up to 6,000 permutations of coffee, milk, topping and sugar - if you bought one a day it would take nearly 17 years to try them all. Michael Willmott, founder of The Future Foundation, initiated the survey of 1,000 adults to find out what irritates people most about modern living and his findings suggested the consumer explosion is a big factor complicating our already busy and complex lives. Mr Willmott said: \"Individual choice can be very empowering but, as this new research demonstrates, it brings hassles too. \"Consumers are feeling overwhelmed and it is starting to have a negative effect on people, making them feel anxious and stressed about making the right choice. \"But our research shows that consumers are finding their own solutions to cope with this situation. Choosing well-known brands is one, but some people are starting to employ less obvious strategies like buying only organic products or shopping only on a Friday when the supermarket shelves are emptier. \"In this way they are consciously limiting the products available to them. \"But some are unable to cope. One man interviewed during our survey went out to buy his mother a mobile phone but was so confused by the number of different makes and tariffs available he bought her an electric whisk instead.\" Two mothers in their 40s surveyed said: \"We have to get different sorts of cereal for everyone and it is the same with coffee and shampoo.\" A 70-year-old woman said: \"In my day we just had roast on Sunday, bubble and squeak rissoles on Monday, shepherd's pie on Tuesday and fish on Friday - every day you knew what you were going to eat.\" Guy Fielding, a psychologist from Oxford University, claims product saturation was reached more than 25 years ago. He said the British public have been encouraged to adopt an American attitude to consumerism to accommodate this choice revolution. \"Many British people used to deride the Americans asking why they needed so much consumer choice,\" he said. \"But now with the number of possibilities expanding in Britain we too are expected to be active and informed choosers where once our product consumption was marked by familiarity. \"The increase in choice has not necessarily lead to a similar increase in feelings of well-being. You can be over-loaded with choice, making informed decisions impossible. \"In such circumstances people select products at random and feel as though their ability to choose has be taken away. Then they are left with a nag ging feeling that their choice has not been the best one.\" Responding to the report, a spokesman for Sainsbury's said: \"As a supermarket we simply respond to consumer demand, nothing stays on the shelf unless the customer wants it. We think that it is fantastic that the public can be offered so much variety.\" Expanding marketplace Television 180 channels Supermarkets 40,000 lines Books Average bookshop has more than 200,000 titles Cars 1,600 models Eating out Food from 150 regions in London restaurants Radio Nearly 250 stations Coffee 6000 permutations of coffee, milk, topping, sugar and size Sandwiches Average sandwich shop has 50 types Music Average record shop has over 1000 titles on offer Holiday 150 tour operators, thousands of destinations",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has held secret crisis talks with the global head of the carmaker Ford amid fears of a meltdown in the British car industry, it was revealed last night. The prime minister met Jack Nasser, head of Ford global operations, at Downing Street and urged him not to end car production at Dagenham. The government fears ending assembly of cars at the Essex plant will anger unions and spark a wave of strikes that could provoke Ford into even more drastic cuts in its operations throughout Britain. Downing Street officials have met car union leaders separately to discuss the proposed closures. They are said to have impressed on the unions the seriousness of the position and the need for the workforce to do everything possible to boost production. Ford is reported to be announcing its restructuring in the next few weeks, including the ending of car production at Dagenham, with the loss of 3,000 jobs. The prime minister, desperate to avoid a repeat of the political fallout from BMW's decision to pull out of the Rover plant at Longbridge, has also been in frequent telephone contact with Nick Scheele, the chairman of Ford Europe. Mr Blair is said to be anxious to ensure that there is no rerun of the BMW fiasco at Longbridge, when the German manufacturer kept ministers in the dark over its plans to close not just the plant, but most of its mass car production facility. More than 19,000 jobs are threatened in the West Midlands. The prime minister, who met the Detroit-based Ford boss two weeks ago, is not in a position to offer the manufacturers short-term subsidies because of strict EU subsidy rules. He also can do nothing in the short term about the high level of sterling, one of the central reasons for closures cited by the British-based car makers. Ford has focused on reduc ing its European car production capacity after the company reported losses of \u00a372m on its overseas operations in the first three months of the year. Managers at Dagenham have repeatedly criticised productivity levels, citing high levels of absenteeism and unofficial strikes. Ford managers down the years have claimed that productivity levels are higher at the company's plant in Cologne, where the next generation of Ford Fiestas seems destined to be built. Mr Scheele met British union leaders last week and told them no decisions had been taken about Dagenham's future. Union sources said he had assured them they would be fully consulted in the event of any job losses. But car assembly at Dagenham has been gradually run down in the past couple of years and a decision to end it next month when Ford announces its major European restructuring would come as no surprise, given worldwide overcapacity. Closing down the car assembly line would mean the loss of just under 3,000 jobs but up to 300 of those workers could be transferred to Ford's highly successful engine building operation, which is expected to remain open. In the meantime, unions are not ruling out strike action. Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the AEEU, said: \"Ford has given us a number of pledges over the future of Dagenham. They have committed themselves to car assembly at the plant and we expect them to honour that commitment in full.

However, we still believe there is something to play for. Ministers must fight to the death to protect car production and jobs at the Dagenham plant.\" The Department of Trade and Industry said: \"Ford has made it clear to the government that its present review is looking at the problems of overproduction and excess capacity across its operations throughout Europe. \"This review is not centred on issues which solely affect the UK.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair will this week step up his drive to improve the adoption system when he urges specialists to adopt a national framework of adoption rules. Ministers have been frustrated by the slowness of some local authority social services departments, the inconsistency of rules and the tendency of some children to become institutionalised in care homes. The Local Government Association responded to Downing Street pressure by setting up an adoption task force, which recommends local authorities to use innovative approaches such as the internet, through secure encrypted sites, to match children with prospective adoptive parents. The LGA also aims to encourage the formation of more local authority adoption consortiums, which give authorities a wider region in which to seek matches while enabling children to stay in a familiar area and in contact with friends. Acknowledging that the performance of councils is patchy, the task force will produce a best practice leaflet so that lessons from those with an excellent adoption record can be learned by others. Councils claim that the recruitment crisis in social work is leaving too many parents who want to adopt waiting too long to be assessed for registration. They also fear that the pressure to speed up adoption could, if pushed too far, result in more failed placements, a pattern found in the 1980s during a similar initiative. Mr Blair will propose a national register of children seeking adoption and couples eager to adopt. At present there are 1,267 applicant adopters and 2,400 children, many in care homes, seeking adoption. The prime minister, in an interview for the women's magazine Red, underlined the well trailed government shake-up of the system by saying: \"I want to make it easier for children to be placed quickly. The most important thing is that children are in a loving family rather than a care home, however well it is run.\" Ministers believe social services departments are delaying processing applications by setting over-complex rules.",
