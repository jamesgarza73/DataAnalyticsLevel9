      "byline": "Keith Cameron",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The ongoing debate about the decriminalisation of cannabis seems redundant when a substantial proportion of the 1,800 people shoehorned into the Astoria have voted with their weed and followed the exhortative directions to \"get high, so high\". Hazily visible through the pungent fog, Cypress Hill's helium-voiced mouthpiece B-Real is celebrating reports that the herb may soon be sanctioned for medicinal purposes in the UK. \"We rock overseas,\" he declares, inhaling deeply, \"and we smoke all the trees.\" </p> <p>Ten years of toking doesn't appear to have had an adverse effect on Cypress Hill. The Los Angeles trio are both hip-hop pioneers and a 12m-unit-shifting crossover phenomenon. What's more, the rap-rock hybrid that currently prevails in mosh-pits everywhere from Brixton to Brazil is a groove pretty much patented by Cypress Hill - B-Real, Sen Dog and their genius producer DJ Muggs. </p> <p>Lest there be any doubt about this, the Hill are returning with a thematically split album: Skull &amp; Bones, featuring actual rock skills from members of Rage Against the Machine and Fear Factory, plus Sen Dog's own funk-metal project SX10, as well as more orthodox hip-hop elements. The latest live show is arranged along similar lines.

      "bodyText": "The ongoing debate about the decriminalisation of cannabis seems redundant when a substantial proportion of the 1,800 people shoehorned into the Astoria have voted with their weed and followed the exhortative directions to \"get high, so high\". Hazily visible through the pungent fog, Cypress Hill's helium-voiced mouthpiece B-Real is celebrating reports that the herb may soon be sanctioned for medicinal purposes in the UK. \"We rock overseas,\" he declares, inhaling deeply, \"and we smoke all the trees.\" Ten years of toking doesn't appear to have had an adverse effect on Cypress Hill. The Los Angeles trio are both hip-hop pioneers and a 12m-unit-shifting crossover phenomenon. What's more, the rap-rock hybrid that currently prevails in mosh-pits everywhere from Brixton to Brazil is a groove pretty much patented by Cypress Hill - B-Real, Sen Dog and their genius producer DJ Muggs. Lest there be any doubt about this, the Hill are returning with a thematically split album: Skull &amp; Bones, featuring actual rock skills from members of Rage Against the Machine and Fear Factory, plus Sen Dog's own funk-metal project SX10, as well as more orthodox hip-hop elements. The latest live show is arranged along similar lines. It's testimony to the primal properties of such classics as I Ain't Goin' Out Like That and Cock the Hammer that the added layers of fretboard viscera don't diminish their impact. The irony is, however, that while many hip-hop groups may usefully incorporate \"real\" instruments in to their moribund live shows, Cypress Hill don't actually need to. It's hardly subtle, but with Muggs at the helm and Eric Bobo adding extra percussive ballast, B-Real and Sen Dog make for brilliantly pugilistic cabaret, at once intimidating and funny.

It was no more than Liverpool deserved and as Redknapp milked the applause, as Houllier punched the air in glee, Owen left his seat in the main stand, probably muttering something about life's unfairness.

Not content with snapping up Martijn Reuser as a last-minute signing on transfer deadline day, Ipswich brought him on as a substitute on Saturday and saw him score the winner in, of course, the last minute. </p> <p>It was a goal that brought a double whammy.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The news from parliament is conveyed to the country almost entirely through male eyes. Many newspapers have all-male lobby teams and the last official count of national newspapers and broadcasting media lobby correspondents shows 72 men and only 15 women. Nearly all the most senior members of the lobby, the powerful political editors, who can make or break stories and reputations, are men. That same count shows only three women out of the 28 political editors. So political news is reported in a way that appeals to and interests men. Issues of particular concern to women are, inevitably, lower on the agenda. This reinforces the sense among women that politics is a male activity of no relevance to them. </p> <p>But it's not easy to be one of the very few women in the lobby. And it's enormously difficult to be a mother in the press gallery. It's not just that lobby journalists have to work long hours. Journalists expect that. The problem is that they have to work night shifts - all the time. Except for Thursdays, the House of Commons chamber does not even start its work till 2.30. It then goes through, usually till 10, but often till the small hours of the morning. The lobby journalists have to be there to report what's going on in the chamber. But they can't clock off when their copy deadline is passed. Because it's late at night MPs have given up on their paperwork and can't make work or personal phone calls because everyone else is in bed. So that's when journalists get the chance to chat with MPs , can hear the whispers and get that precious off the record \"lobby briefing\". So when her children are just finishing their day at school, the lobby journalist is only starting her day's work. And while children need their mother to be predictable and reliable, the Commons hours are anything but that. There's no timetabling or planning from day to day or week to week. </p> <p>So men dominate in the lobby and the male flavour in political reporting obstructs the connection between women and their parliament. </p> <p>Though women are as likely as men to vote, all the evidence is that they are less likely to think that politics and government are concerned with their lives. Thatcher strongly appealed to women voters, and so does Tony Blair. But women's votes remain doubtful and untrusting and they are the ones most likely to switch their allegiance. Political reporting, for much of the time, simply passes them by. Of course it's the case that there are many men who feel politics is irrelevant to them - but it is far more the case for women. It's not just that the priority given to different issues reflects male priorities, it's also to do with the language which is used to write about politics. </p> <p>Political reporting accurately reveals to men in the country the conversation between men in the lobby and men in parliament. Approving talk of \"big hitters\", \"big beasts\" and \"big guns\" is clearly nothing to do with women. It is about men writing about men for other men. No woman would be encouraged to see a \"big beast\" in charge of our schools, \"a big gun\" leading the peace process as secretary of state for Northern Ireland or a \"big hitter\" in the Home Office. Few women talk approvingly of each other as \"heavyweight\"! Political debate couched in these terms leaves women cold. </p> <p>It is not inevitable that political debate should exclude women. The women's magazines, written by women for women, connect with their readers' lives on issues which are highly political - an example is the recent reporting on the issue of maternity pay and leave in Prima Baby magazine. This is not a difference of depth. Some of the daily tabloids don't go into politics in great depth. And some women's magazines tackle highly complex issues in a sophisticated way. Rather, it's about style and who you're talking to. </p> <p>During the past two decades I've seen young women arrive in the lobby. They've got there against the odds. Each time I hope the journalist's enthusiasm and intelligence will mean that she will break the mould and set a new pattern for the future. I see her networking with the few other women journalists, building relationships with her male colleagues, dodging the leering looks of too many male parliamentarians, while she tries to get to the heart of political stories. </p> <p>For the first few years she does exceedingly well. But just as she gets to the age where she is at the foothills of serious authority in the lobby she gets, too, to the age when she starts a family. Even if she comes back after having a baby, she's on borrowed time. By the time she's had her second child she can't help noticing that there are other ways she can be a journalist. She can work as a freelance, on the news desk or in features. Unlike MPs, she has a choice. She doesn't have to work till late at night. She doesn't have to do a job which requires her to match the bizarre and uncivilised hours of the parliament. So she doesn't - she leaves. That is unfair on her, it's a shame for the women MPs, but it's a major problem for the reporting of what is known around the world as the \"mother of parliaments\". </p> <p>Women in the lobby remain an endangered species. Julia Langdon, one of the pioneer women there, justly rose to be a political editor. But her exit from the Sunday Telegraph coincided with her having a baby. Eleanor Goodman has lasted and is Channel 4's political editor. And Scotland is lucky to have Catherine McLeod in a senior position at the Herald. But why isn't Jackie Ashley (formerly of ITN) a political editor? When she had her first child, she battled to win the right to be part-time in the lobby. But now she has three children - and is freelance. Where is Anne Perkins, formerly of the Guardian lobby team? Now she's a mother and a freelance. The Scotsman has let Joy Copley choose to work two days a week when she returns to work in May after having her daughter. We cannot afford to lose the current generation of women in the lobby the way we have lost so many over the past 20 years. </p> <p>It's no good just hoping that, in time, things will change. Editors should determine to recruit more women to work in the lobby. All political editors should ensure they have some women on their team and should groom them for political editorship. But the biggest cause of the lack of women in the lobby is the fault of MPs. We must change the hours of the Commons, so we work during the day, and not day and night. That is important for MPs - men as well as women. But it is essential if we are to see more women in the lobby. </p> <p>Women journalists should not have to jeopardise their family life in order to report parliament, or leave their career in the lobby to balance work and family life. A Commons creche and changing the hours will help women and men in parliament and it will help male journalists, too. But above all it will refresh our democracy by letting women in the country in on our political debate.</p> <p> Harriet Harman is Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham</p>",

But the biggest cause of the lack of women in the lobby is the fault of MPs. We must change the hours of the Commons, so we work during the day, and not day and night. That is important for MPs - men as well as women. But it is essential if we are to see more women in the lobby. Women journalists should not have to jeopardise their family life in order to report parliament, or leave their career in the lobby to balance work and family life. A Commons creche and changing the hours will help women and men in parliament and it will help male journalists, too. But above all it will refresh our democracy by letting women in the country in on our political debate. Harriet Harman is Labour MP for Camberwell and Peckham",

Embracing backstage after the final presentation, Mendes and Spacey sported the drained and exhausted look of two prize-fighters who'd just gone the distance. The suspenseful way the Academy stage-manages these events, it seems, takes a toll on the winners as well as the losers.</p> <p>But even the cavalier dash of Oscars closing minutes could not quite disguise the faint whiff of predictability in the air. In effect, the Oscars were effectively announced on Friday, when the <a href=\"http://interactive.wsj.com/home.html\">Wall Street Journal</a> published its exit-poll predictions of where the major awards were going. </p> <p>The paper may have surveyed a slender 6% of eligible Academy voters, but its conclusions were to prove unnervingly accurate. Mendes won, just as it had said he would. Hilary Swank came from the outside to collect Best Actress for Boys Don't Cry, just as it had said she would. Ditto Michael Caine (Best Supporting Actor for The Cider House Rules), ditto the bee-stung Angelina Jolie (Best Supporting Actress for Girl, Interrupted). If you were taking the Journal as gospel, the sole surprise was Spacey, who won what appeared to be a narrow contest with the paper's tip, Denzel Washington (nominated for The Hurricane). </p> <p>All of which conspired to take some crackle off the night's proceedings. If anything, Oscar 2000 was just too polished and genteel to fully satisfy. The speeches were kept to a Spartan minimum, the victors were dewy-eyed, but never hysterical. Even host Billy Crystal's satirical barbs at the nominees were too well rehearsed and neatly packaged to bite the way they should.</p> <p>Even so, this year's Academy Awards boasted a few sights that will linger in the memory. We had Pedro Almodovar (winning Best Foreign Language Film for All About My Mother) having to be dragged forcibly from the stage when his speech threatened to last longer than the film itself. </p> <p>We had Isaac Hayes choking on a thick waft of dry ice as he tried to sing the theme from Shaft (\"How do you lose Isaac Hayes?\" shrilled Crystal). Later, novelist John Irving (winner of Best Adapted Screenplay for The Cider House Rules) provided the night's only political moment when he acknowledged the National Abortion Rights Action League in his victory speech. The Cider House Rules, which centres around a New England abortion clinic, provoked a protest outside the ceremony from enraged pro-lifers. Irving's response showed that he was not about to shy away from the controversy.</p> <p>Most entertaining of all, however, was Robin Williams' exuberant rendition of the Oscar-nominated South Park song, Blame Canada. A scabrous satirical ditty, Blame Canada had already become one of the night's big talking points, with rumours abounding that the broadcasters were poised to bleep the tune's offending portions. </p> <p>In the event, the song aired in a PG version that still managed to retain much of the original content. Williams may have arrived on stage with tape over his mouth, but Blame Canada still mentioned kids who \"fart and curse\" and run away to join the Ku Klux Klan as well as a reference to \"that bitch Anne Murray\". Only one decidedly R-rated verse (about a mother who is told to \"go fuck herself\") was replaced by a more user-friendly alternative. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the ceremony was rather better behaved. Accepting his award for Best Supporting Actor, Michael Caine lavished praise on his rival nominees and consoled Tom Cruise (nominated for Magnolia) by pointing out that his asking price would have plunged had he won. \"Have you any idea how much supporting actors get paid?\" Caine quipped. Still guaranteed an estimated $20m a movie, Cruise could afford to laugh off the loss. </p> <p>In terms of Hollywood aristocracy, the evening's main event was the presentation of the Irving Thalberg Lifetime Achievement Award to Warren Beatty. Accepting the honour from his old friend and sparring partner Jack Nicholson, the 62-year-old Beatty joked: \"It's a bit soon to be giving this to a guy in his early 40s,\" before going on to thank his wife Annette Bening (\"She is my treasure\"). </p> <p>The heavily pregnant Mrs Beatty, meanwhile, was providing a fascinating side-show all on her own. She was nominated for Best Actress (for American Beauty) and there were worries that she would not be able to haul herself up the stairs to collect the award. \"If she wins, she'll crawl up here on all fours,\" her co-star Spacey assured the audience. But in the end, she kept her seat to leave Swank (virtually unknown until Boys Don't Cry shot her to fame) to stroll on stage and take the award.</p> <p>Bening may have missed out, but her loss was just a blip in an otherwise glorious night for American Beauty, which finished the night with five Oscars in total. Accepting his award, Spacey gave fulsome praise to his \"mentor\", the actor Jack Lemmon, whose performance in <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0053604\">The Apartment</a> was a direct inspiration for Spacey's turn as suburban everyman Lester Burnham. </p> <p>Moments later, Sam Mendes took to the stage to collect his award for Best Director. Still only 34, the Oxford-educated director has come a long way since his days of managing the Donmar Warehouse in London. His last-minute win capped a fruitful night for British hopes; an award to set alongside Michael Caine's, an Oscar for Phil Collins (for Best Original Song, though it didn't sound so original) and the two trophies (for Costume and Make-Up) won by Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy. </p> <p>And so the Oscar congregation breaks up into a welter of after-show parties and news interviews and behind-the-scenes schmoozing. Most of the assembled guests have been here before and know the scene like the back of their manicured hands. But for one man, it is the end of something special and the start of something new. </p> <p>61-year-old Willie Fulgear observed the entire ceremony with a look of wry bemusement. The salvage worker's discovery of the missing Oscars had won him a free ticket to the awards and reward of $50,000. Fulgear says he plans to return to his native Mississippi and buy himself a home there. For him, this Hollywood story is now drawing to a close. </p>",

The fact that he had been crippled since childhood, and was severely ill during his final years as a performer, merely added to his stature. He was truly brave - both physically and in the way he approached his music.</p> <p>That bravery was evident at his first major London concert, at the Hammersmith Odeon in May 1978, at the height of the punk era. The audience were told to prepare for \"one of the jewels in England's crown\", and on came not Dury but his hero, the veteran music-hall star Max Wall, who was barracked by the boisterous crowd until Dury stormed on to quieten them down. When he reappeared with his band, he hobbled across the stage, supported by a stick, looking like some spivvy Cockney update of a Dickensian villain. The punks were suitably impressed.</p> <p>Here was a man already in his mid-thirties who looked crippled but dangerous, and had an armoury of quite extraordinary songs, ranging from the realistically romantic to the outrageous. He could belt out a thoughtful rock song like Sweet Gene Vincent, and then introduce a distinctive Essex spin. Even hardcore punks were taken aback by the stories of Plaistow Patricia or Billericay Dickie, dealing as they did with the life and loves of losers, chancers and wide-boys from the East End and beyond. No one then, or since, could match lyrics like \"a love affair with Nina in the back of my Cortina, a seasoned-up hyena couldn't have been more obscener\".</p> <p>The man responsible was born in Harrow. His father was a bus-driver and later a chauffeur, who split up with his university-educated mother soon after the war. The young Ian went to live in Upminster with his mum, but was struck down by polio at the age of seven. He spent several years in hospital and at a school in Sussex for the disabled, and then moved to the Royal High Wycombe Grammar School. He left with three O-levels and moved back to Essex, to Walthamstow Art School. </p> <p>Then came the Royal College of Art, a stint teaching art in Canterbury, and in 1970 the formation of his first band, Kilburn and the High Roads. They developed a minor following on the emerging London pub-rock scene and their first album, Handsome, in 1974. It included some distinctive Dury lyric but was not successful. Dury had yet to fully develop his exaggerated Cockney stage persona.</p> <p>The transformation came after Dury started writing with pianist Chas Jankel and signed to the independent Stiff label, co-founded by David Robinson, one of the great showmen and the godfather of British funk. </p> <p>Dury toured with his fellow Stiff artists including Elvis Costello, and in October, 1977, released his classic New Boots And Panties. The album, which went on to sell over a million copies, included the erotic Wake Up And Make Love With Me.</p> <p>In April 1978 Dury notched up his first Top Ten single, What A Waste, followed later the same year with the number one hit, Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick, and a year later Reasons To Be Cheerful (Part 3). In 1980, the compilation album Juke Box Dury packaged these hit singles along with Dury's best-known stage anthem, Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock 'n' Roll.</p> <p>At the time, Dury insisted to me that, as an unlikely pop star, he was merely continuing his career as an artist: \"I was a painter for seven years, a successful illustrator for two years, and now I'm a rock 'n' roll singer. I still feel I'm doing the same thing, but I'm not painting with paints.\" As for his physical disability, he had confidently used it as a part of his stage act.</p> <p>\"I'm charismatic and I'm not ashamed about my physical appearance,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Even good-looking people have got a weakness. My weakness is so obvious that there's no point in worrying about it. Luckily I'm quite interesting to look at.</p> <p>I know 'cos I painted myself as an art student about 500 times.\"</p> <p>He succeeded partly because of the care and attention he put into his work,explaining: \"I ain't a poet, I'm a lyricist,\" and spending weeks carefully perfecting his songs. He described his influences as \"the Stax and Motown labels and Max Miller, with a lot of television thrown in\".</p> <p>During the 1980s, with the waning of the punk era and rise of the New Romantics, Dury gradually fell out of fashion, despite some glorious tours with his band the Blockheads. But he still continued his policy of musical bravery, collaborating with trumpeter Don Cherry on the 1980 set Laughter, and travelling to Nassau the following year to record with the reggae rhythm section Sly and Robbie for Lord Upminster.</p> <p>This was the Year Of The Disabled, and Dury contributed the thoughtfully realistic Spasticus Autisticus. The song, which contained lines like \"I dribble when I nibble,\" was considered to be in such bad taste that, despite Dury's own disability, it was banned from radio play.</p> <p>The departure of Chaz Jankel from the Blockheads proved a more serious blow and, in 1984, after the release of the unsuccessful album 4000 Weeks Holiday, Dury took a rest from live performance, and concentrated on acting. He appeared in a series of unremarkable films, including Polanski's Pirates (1986) and Hearts Of Fire, a vehicle for Bob Dylan. </p> <p>He had more success on stage the following year, in the Royal Court production of Jim Carter's Road. Two years later, he was back at the Court with a musical, Apples, which he had co-written with former Blockhead Mickey Gallagher. It was not a success, but Dury had continued with his policy of doing exactly what he wanted.</p> <p>Never too concerned about personal wealth, he had turned down an offer from Andrew Lloyd Webber to provide the lyrics for Cats - a commission that reportedly earned millions for Richard Stilgoe. Dury had a simple explanation for turning Lloyd Webber down: \"I can't stand his music.\"</p> <p>In 1990, the Blockheads came together again, initially to play a benefit for their former drummer Charlie Charles, who was suffering from cancer. The reunion was so successful that further shows followed over the next two years, and several members of the band collaborated on Dury's 1993 album, The Bus Driver's Prayer And Other Stories. Then, just as his career was heading for another upswing, Dury was diagnosed as suffering from cancer. In 1996 a tumour was removed from his colon, but two years later, further tumours were detected on his liver.</p> <p>He reacted, in typical fashion, by plunging himself back into work, and 1998 will be remembered as his finest period since the glory days of the late 1970s. Once again reunited with Chas Jankel and the Blockheads, he embarked on a series of concerts that showed he had lost none of his old verve, wit or musical skill. Their songs ranged from the funk and black humour of Mash It Up Harry and Jack Shit Georgie (an attack on the education system) through to an unashamedly emotional, semi-spoken love song, You're My Baby.</p> <p> \u0095 Ian Dury, singer, songwriter and actor, born May 12 1942; died Mar 27 2000</p>",

Even hardcore punks were taken aback by the stories of Plaistow Patricia or Billericay Dickie, dealing as they did with the life and loves of losers, chancers and wide-boys from the East End and beyond. No one then, or since, could match lyrics like \"a love affair with Nina in the back of my Cortina, a seasoned-up hyena couldn't have been more obscener\". The man responsible was born in Harrow. His father was a bus-driver and later a chauffeur, who split up with his university-educated mother soon after the war. The young Ian went to live in Upminster with his mum, but was struck down by polio at the age of seven. He spent several years in hospital and at a school in Sussex for the disabled, and then moved to the Royal High Wycombe Grammar School. He left with three O-levels and moved back to Essex, to Walthamstow Art School. Then came the Royal College of Art, a stint teaching art in Canterbury, and in 1970 the formation of his first band, Kilburn and the High Roads. They developed a minor following on the emerging London pub-rock scene and their first album, Handsome, in 1974. It included some distinctive Dury lyric but was not successful. Dury had yet to fully develop his exaggerated Cockney stage persona. The transformation came after Dury started writing with pianist Chas Jankel and signed to the independent Stiff label, co-founded by David Robinson, one of the great showmen and the godfather of British funk. Dury toured with his fellow Stiff artists including Elvis Costello, and in October, 1977, released his classic New Boots And Panties. The album, which went on to sell over a million copies, included the erotic Wake Up And Make Love With Me. In April 1978 Dury notched up his first Top Ten single, What A Waste, followed later the same year with the number one hit, Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick, and a year later Reasons To Be Cheerful (Part 3). In 1980, the compilation album Juke Box Dury packaged these hit singles along with Dury's best-known stage anthem, Sex &amp; Drugs &amp; Rock 'n' Roll. At the time, Dury insisted to me that, as an unlikely pop star, he was merely continuing his career as an artist: \"I was a painter for seven years, a successful illustrator for two years, and now I'm a rock 'n' roll singer. I still feel I'm doing the same thing, but I'm not painting with paints.\" As for his physical disability, he had confidently used it as a part of his stage act. \"I'm charismatic and I'm not ashamed about my physical appearance,\" he said. \"Even good-looking people have got a weakness. My weakness is so obvious that there's no point in worrying about it. Luckily I'm quite interesting to look at. I know 'cos I painted myself as an art student about 500 times.\" He succeeded partly because of the care and attention he put into his work,explaining: \"I ain't a poet, I'm a lyricist,\" and spending weeks carefully perfecting his songs. He described his influences as \"the Stax and Motown labels and Max Miller, with a lot of television thrown in\". During the 1980s, with the waning of the punk era and rise of the New Romantics, Dury gradually fell out of fashion, despite some glorious tours with his band the Blockheads. But he still continued his policy of musical bravery, collaborating with trumpeter Don Cherry on the 1980 set Laughter, and travelling to Nassau the following year to record with the reggae rhythm section Sly and Robbie for Lord Upminster. This was the Year Of The Disabled, and Dury contributed the thoughtfully realistic Spasticus Autisticus. The song, which contained lines like \"I dribble when I nibble,\" was considered to be in such bad taste that, despite Dury's own disability, it was banned from radio play. The departure of Chaz Jankel from the Blockheads proved a more serious blow and, in 1984, after the release of the unsuccessful album 4000 Weeks Holiday, Dury took a rest from live performance, and concentrated on acting. He appeared in a series of unremarkable films, including Polanski's Pirates (1986) and Hearts Of Fire, a vehicle for Bob Dylan. He had more success on stage the following year, in the Royal Court production of Jim Carter's Road. Two years later, he was back at the Court with a musical, Apples, which he had co-written with former Blockhead Mickey Gallagher. It was not a success, but Dury had continued with his policy of doing exactly what he wanted. Never too concerned about personal wealth, he had turned down an offer from Andrew Lloyd Webber to provide the lyrics for Cats - a commission that reportedly earned millions for Richard Stilgoe. Dury had a simple explanation for turning Lloyd Webber down: \"I can't stand his music.\" In 1990, the Blockheads came together again, initially to play a benefit for their former drummer Charlie Charles, who was suffering from cancer. The reunion was so successful that further shows followed over the next two years, and several members of the band collaborated on Dury's 1993 album, The Bus Driver's Prayer And Other Stories. Then, just as his career was heading for another upswing, Dury was diagnosed as suffering from cancer. In 1996 a tumour was removed from his colon, but two years later, further tumours were detected on his liver. He reacted, in typical fashion, by plunging himself back into work, and 1998 will be remembered as his finest period since the glory days of the late 1970s. Once again reunited with Chas Jankel and the Blockheads, he embarked on a series of concerts that showed he had lost none of his old verve, wit or musical skill. Their songs ranged from the funk and black humour of Mash It Up Harry and Jack Shit Georgie (an attack on the education system) through to an unashamedly emotional, semi-spoken love song, You're My Baby. \u0095 Ian Dury, singer, songwriter and actor, born May 12 1942; died Mar 27 2000",

      "body": "<p>Under the fake shade of fake trees, a group of actors have set up camp with an air of conviction that makes sunshine seem like a reality. On the foot of a swirling staircase Alicia Silverstone is curled up asleep, her scarlet evening dress capped by sneakers, hair net and a giant puffa jacket (a more realistic reaction to the temperature), a towel cuddled, teddy bear-like, to her chest. </p> <p>While the crew perches on cold simulated stone to discuss piles and other personal problems picked up elsewhere (\"Just wait till you've done the Ouarzazate Quickstep\") the cast, at 9.30 on a chilly morning, is faced with the task of laughing loudly and musically. </p> <p>This is one of Shepperton's biggest sound stages, decked out with walls, willows and punts to make a kind of \"movie Oxbridge\" - otherwise known as the court of Navarre - for Kenneth Branagh's film of Love's Labour's Lost. It is, he says, \"a larger-than-life atmosphere in which people would naturally burst into song.\" </p> <p>Branagh, who adapted, directs and plays the romantic hero, Berowne, is wearing a dinner jacket and has a tiny moustache. He used to dislike the comparison, but his resemblance to Laurence Olivier is extraordinary. Branagh has set the story of four young men sworn to abjure women, and four young women who make them change their minds, in the 30s. And he has replaced two-thirds of the words with the songs of George Gershwin, Cole Porter and Irving Berlin - \"artists who have a chance of sitting alongside Shakespeare and not being embarrassed by it\". </p> <p>The production team tried writing original lyrics. It didn't work. Neither did using the composers' lesser numbers, which would have been cheaper. \"But,\" says Branagh, \"when you have Berowne going on about the transforming power of love, saying that when love speaks, the voice of all the gods makes heaven drowsy with it, it seems very appropriate to start singing 'Heaven, I'm in heaven'. So far, the play has not bucked against our treatment.\" </p> <p>Branagh's previous Shakespeare films (Henry V, Much Ado About Nothing and Hamlet) were more straightforward. But Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet moved the goalposts. A musical Love's Labour's Lost may be a gamble but the initial response (the reception at the Berlin film festival, the Variety review) suggests it has paid off. Unlike the four-hour Hamlet, this clocks in at a brisk 90-odd minutes, and that's nothing to do with Harvey Weinstein, whose firm Miramax is distributing it in many territories: \"This is the director's cut,\" says Branagh firmly. </p> <p>Perhaps he has hedged his bets by going for one of Shakespeare's less popular plays. Love's Labour's Lost couples a simple plot with an elaborate poetry packed with topical references that \"make it seem as if it's written in code\", as Richard Briers (who plays the curate Nathaniel) puts it. Branagh says the play responds best to heroic treatment: \"In this century there have been only five significant productions and they've all had quite strong directors.\" He refers to Harley Granville Barker's line that it is \"a fashionable play 300 years out of fashion\" and says that, like Romeo and Juliet, its youthful energy is a great plus. </p> <p>Back in his RSC days Branagh played the King of Navarre to Roger Rees's Berowne. He admits he didn't understand the work. Perhaps you need to be edging towards middle years to appreciate youthful verve. Now the 39-year-old Branagh says Berowne is less cynical, less set against love, than Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing: \"This is the film about the look across a crowded room.\" </p> <p>Drawing on the late 30s works thematically as well as stylistically. Besides the showtime element - \"very perky and silly and full of fun\" - the period produced a spate of films \"where women called the shots while the men do the posturing\". A recurring theme was men's constancy - \"or inconstancy\" - and women got their turn at \"the game of torturing the boys\", as Silverstone (who plays the Princess) calls it. </p> <p>In the play, the romantic games are ended when the sudden death of the King of France makes the Princess sweep her ladies home. In the film, the visuals give his death a political context; this is 1939 and France is falling to the Germans. As the Princess and her entourage leave Navarre, the film reference is to Casablanca. A plane stands on the tarmac as the cast sing They Can't Take That Away From Me. In crackling black and white news footage the Princess and her ladies are led away to internment camp, while the King of Navarre and his men join the services. </p> <p>\"The play benefits from being set very specifically in time and place, and it fits the prewar generation,\" says Branagh. \"There's something ennobling about that last hurrah.\" It makes sense of the couples' arbitrary separation, the one that has led many Shakespeareans to postulate a long-lost sequel, Love's Labour's Won, and gives a poignancy to their two-day love. </p> <p>Branagh is stirring a rich soup of references, but he sweeps everyone along. On set, he is above all reassuring. He has to be. On the basis of three weeks' rehearsal - \"Shakespeare boot camp\" - a cast not exactly famed for its musical experience is being asked to perform the numbers we are used to seeing done with real panache. Broadway star Nathan Lane, many times a musicals award winner, plays Costard the clown but sings only one number (There's No Business Like Showbusiness, appropriately). Briers, and Geraldine McEwan as Holofernia, get to sing The Way You Look Tonight. Timothy Spall as a Dali-eseque Don Armadio combines RSC experience with Topsy-Turvy, and Adrian Lester as Dumaine combines professional dance and Sondheim's Company with Rosalind in the all-male As You Like It. But many other cast members, including Silverstone and Matthew Lillard as Longaville, mention neither Shakespeare nor musicals on their CV. </p> <p>Eclectic is too mild a word for it - but a mixed cast is something Branagh has used before, even more conspicuously. Hamlet featured Billy Crystal and Charlton Heston alongside John Gielgud. Much Ado had Denzel Washington and Keanu Reeves alongside British unknowns, and Emma Thompson told graphically of how the disparate group had to be welded together by impromptu spaghetti parties - rather as Merchant Ivory casts, in their poorer days, had to be placated with Ismail Merchant's curries. But it is noticeable how many older members of the cast, and the production team, have worked with Branagh regularly. None more so than Briers, who was regarded only as a TV actor when Branagh first cast him on stage in Twelfth Night. Through Branagh's Renaissance company Briers went on to play Lear. \"Lear after The Good Life!\" says Briers incredulously. \"It would have been awful if I had got into my 70s and never had those opportunities.\" As a director, Briers says, Branagh's special gift is to draw ever more emotion out of his performers. \"If you're English middle class, it's very difficult to yield it easily.\" </p> <p>Branagh is planning more Shakespeares: Macbeth should be coming shortly, followed by As You Like It. That's another sort of gamble. His producer, David Barron, says: \"Where Shakespeare films have made money, they've made money. Where they haven't, they really haven't.\" But the energy triggered by Shakespeare in Love and Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet is still pumping. Ethan Hawke's Hamlet and Julie Taymor's terrifying Titus have been praised in the US, and Tim Roth recently announced plans to direct King Lear as adapted by Harold Pinter: \"I'm not interested in a bunch of people standing around a castle talking,\" Roth says. </p> <p>It seems only fair that, given the length of his relationship with Shakespeare, Branagh should ride the wave. But he could have been swept away. Lillard says reading a scene with Branagh is \"like shooting hoops with Michael Jordan,\" but also that in Branagh's company, \"I'm sitting with the grandfather of the Bard.\" It is a double-edged compliment. </p> <p>\"We have broken away from the various earlier periods of Shakespeare movie-making that were linked more closely to theatre,\" says Branagh. \"Now these stories are free for exploration in a way they weren't before. The canvas is blank again. There's a generation out there who have never seen one of Orson Welles's Shakespeare films, or Zeffirelli's - or even one of ours.

He died this morning. Despite his illness, Dury continued to work, helping children's aid organisations and appearing in television advertisements.</p> <p>As well as writing a string of hit songs, Dury was an accomplished actor and broadcaster. His agents confirmed that the musician died from cancer but were unable to say where or at exactly what time.</p> <p>\"We will have more details later this afternoon,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>Disabled by polio as a child, Dury proudly flew the flag for the acceptance of disability. Ironically, news of his final illness brought about a career resurgence. He travelled with Robbie Williams into the Sri Lankan war zone to highlight efforts to vaccinate children against polio. He also continued to performed at concerts, including Paul Weller's annual outdoor London festival in August 1998, and appeared in a number of television advertisements.</p> <p>Attached to a drip, he made the most of his final months, speaking bravely and matter-of-factly about facing death. He sought to remove the taboos about the disease that had already taken some of his closest friends. He had managed to conceal his cancer for three years, but went public in a Sunday paper interview when it spread to his liver and became inoperable. Forever counting his reasons to be cheerful, he said: \"You don't have cancer; it has you. The 'chemo' [chemotherapy] won't get rid of it. But it's another lease of - well, however long it is. You just don't know, but it's better than being hit by a bus tomorrow; you have time to sort yourself out.\"</p> <p>He had reservations about using private medicine \"because I'm a socialist, but I don't want to go on no waiting list and end up a dead socialist\".</p> <p>He leaves two grown up children from his first marriage to Elizabeth, which ended in divorce in 1985, and two young children from his second marriage, to sculptress Sophie Tilson.</p>",

His agents confirmed that the musician died from cancer but were unable to say where or at exactly what time. \"We will have more details later this afternoon,\" a spokesman said. Disabled by polio as a child, Dury proudly flew the flag for the acceptance of disability. Ironically, news of his final illness brought about a career resurgence. He travelled with Robbie Williams into the Sri Lankan war zone to highlight efforts to vaccinate children against polio. He also continued to performed at concerts, including Paul Weller's annual outdoor London festival in August 1998, and appeared in a number of television advertisements. Attached to a drip, he made the most of his final months, speaking bravely and matter-of-factly about facing death. He sought to remove the taboos about the disease that had already taken some of his closest friends. He had managed to conceal his cancer for three years, but went public in a Sunday paper interview when it spread to his liver and became inoperable. Forever counting his reasons to be cheerful, he said: \"You don't have cancer; it has you. The 'chemo' [chemotherapy] won't get rid of it. But it's another lease of - well, however long it is. You just don't know, but it's better than being hit by a bus tomorrow; you have time to sort yourself out.\" He had reservations about using private medicine \"because I'm a socialist, but I don't want to go on no waiting list and end up a dead socialist\". He leaves two grown up children from his first marriage to Elizabeth, which ended in divorce in 1985, and two young children from his second marriage, to sculptress Sophie Tilson.",

Yes he was. That's because they know a winner when they see one (so long as they haven't pulled on a Liverpool shirt at any point during their career).

But the all-new BMW Z8 and the latest version of the Porsche 911 Turbo are, like any other car, only as dangerous as the drug crazed city trader who's driving them. In fact, as the two media launches showed, both are exceptionally good at going very slowly. </p> <p>The venues proved the point. BMW unveiled the car that Pierce Brosnan used in his latest 007 caper in the go-slow of downtown LA. Once you come unstuck from the inner-city glue, you can let rip on the coast road, as long as you stay under 55mph. And if that isn't frustration enough, the 400bhp roadster with a 0-60 time of just 4.7 seconds was accompanied en route by a team of highway police, hired by BMW to make sure everyone stayed calm. </p> <p>The Porsche launch, a few days later in southern Spain, was equally hamstrung. A man with a cane pointed to the fast bits of the route shown on the projector - but the bosses made it clear that we must observe all speed limits. Given the 420bhp of muscle that waited outside (Porsche's most powerful car to date) it seemed Porsche might have had more luck convincing a pack of starving greyhounds not to feel interested in the world's most chewable rabbit. </p> <p>There was a serious reason for BMW's decision to air its first batch of supercars in LA. The Z8 is capable of Tysonesque brutality, but that was not, of course, the maker's key point. More significant to the agenda was that this is \"a sports car virtually purpose-built for a country with boulevards and freeways simply begging you to cruise along in style\" a country, \"where the elite shape their bodies to ultimate beauty\". Dodgy analogy indeed, but the Z8's key charm is its tuxedoed gentility. </p> <p>Of course it's shockingly expensive, though this won't put people off. Only 70 Z8s will come to the UK in the first year and when sales start this May, you'll be lucky to get a sniff - unless you booked a place in the queue a long time ago and are prepared to wait two years. </p> <p>Set for normal response, the Z8 surges forward in town with an unmistakable V8 burble; switch to the sport setting and you get an instant, drag-car punch. In the event, BMW allowed us onto a test track. And when it's pushed hard and the Dynamic Stability Control button is off, the Z8 handles with far more precision and balance than its mighty frame might suggest. Despite the fact that the ride is seriously silky, the aluminium body conceals true supercar potential. It's not 911-nimble, but as a straight-line racer, it's breathtakingly quick. </p> <p>Quickness is, however, a relative concept, as I found when I settled into Porsche's latest. For many reasons, the 911 Turbo is the car that needs no PR. Firstly, it has the kind of heritage that comes only with a model that can trace its roots back to Ferdinand Porsche's first design doodles in the 1930s. Sporty offshoot of the Beetle, the first-throw 911 emerged in 1963, but it wasn't until 1974 that the first turbo came along. With an output of 260bhp, the car was a shocker and it heralded a styling trend that, in the 1980s, would establish Porsche as the tarmac equivalent of the shoulder pad. </p> <p>Moving relentlessly up the power range, the latest incarnation shifts to 62mph in just 4.2 seconds and belts on relentlessly to a permitted maximum of 189mph. Bearing British sensitivity to speed in mind, I asked Porsche's bosses whether they didn't feel sensitive to the social implications of making cars that go faster and faster? For the record, no, they don't. But you can't say I didn't ask. </p> <p>Beneath its skin, the new Turbo harbours big changes. No longer air-cooled, as was the predecessor of 1998, it now relies upon a standard-fit super-intelligent four-wheel drive system which shifts traction to wherever the road best offers grip. Power comes from a six-cylinder engine first designed for use in the Boxster. </p> <p>To prevent the kind of lift-off oversteer that has Audi TT salesmen sweating in their sleep, the Turbo has a PSM (Porsche Stability Management). But with so much technology on board, is it not, perchance, a teeny bit dull to drive? The answer to that is in my test notes: \"Ooh, is that supposed to happen? Blimey! What the_?\" In the first few miles, it does make you go all dizzy. The gearchange is surprisingly light, given its job, but the steering is obsessed with providing you with a forensic report on the road - every tiny twist in the tarmac is faithfully fed back and on the first (slightly unexpected) bend, the trouble downstairs is reported - and ruthlessly ironed out. Given the limitless acceleration and the huge willingness of third and fourth gears to deal with all range of speeds, it's not long before you start to settle in and relax. As looks go, the turbo has returned to the safe side of overt. There is a hinted measure of aggression in the deep front air intakes, while the scoops on the rear haunches make it clear from any distance that this is a one-off car. But its muscularity is far more of a suggestion than a full-on scream. </p> <p>So which is better? Unfortunately, we were not able to run a nose-to-tail test, but the psychological imprint from each test is long-lasting. For the ultimate dynamic drive, the 911 pulls a clear nose ahead of the Z8. Both machines sit comfortably at the pinnacle of supercar status. Yet if shameless decadence is your bag, the BMW may just edge ahead as a true transport of delight. This sort of dosh, however, has to be all about performance. In which case, the only thing you need know is that the Porsche so many of us secretly want has just got that bit better.</p>",

Given the limitless acceleration and the huge willingness of third and fourth gears to deal with all range of speeds, it's not long before you start to settle in and relax. As looks go, the turbo has returned to the safe side of overt. There is a hinted measure of aggression in the deep front air intakes, while the scoops on the rear haunches make it clear from any distance that this is a one-off car. But its muscularity is far more of a suggestion than a full-on scream. So which is better? Unfortunately, we were not able to run a nose-to-tail test, but the psychological imprint from each test is long-lasting. For the ultimate dynamic drive, the 911 pulls a clear nose ahead of the Z8. Both machines sit comfortably at the pinnacle of supercar status. Yet if shameless decadence is your bag, the BMW may just edge ahead as a true transport of delight. This sort of dosh, however, has to be all about performance. In which case, the only thing you need know is that the Porsche so many of us secretly want has just got that bit better.",

Within minutes going online and typing in a search for \"Used cars\", I found a car. T reg, five grand. What a bargain! </p> <p>As instructed, I sent an email. A salesman phoned me back. \"Sorry, mate,\" he breezed. \"We've sold that one.\" There were lots of other Puntos, everywhere, but in the wrong colour, at the wrong price, or at the other end of the country. However, after a couple of weeks of failed enquiries and increasingly square eyes, I was up and off again. A car supermarket called to say they had my dream car. Sure, they were 100 miles away and I didn't have a car to get there, but I wanted that vehicle. I thought about putting down a phoned deposit to hold the car but didn't bother, because a friend had warned me it would look too keen. I was excited and set off. Four trains later, as I approached the garage at dusk I pondered the merits of viewing a car in semi-darkness. I met the slightly sheepish-looking salesman at 4.30. He sat me down and made me a cup of tea as he explained everything: how good the internet was for business, how they got online inquiries from 200 miles away, and how another salesman had sold my car at 1pm.

I pulled out of the deal. </p> <p>The whole fiasco cost me hours of online phone bills, the \u00a3100 deposit, \u00a3150 on the AA inspection/HPI test and a couple of millimetres of my hairline. </p> <p>However, I've finally taken delivery of a beautiful, bargain Punto, courtesy of the first website I visited, who kept my details. It's not turquoise, rialto blue or silver, but a strange \"metallic burnt orange\" that my girlfriend insists matches my remaining barnet. The engine is clean as a whistle, without so much as a fly.

None has been mourned more publicly than the 14 who were shot dead by British paratroopers during a civil rights protest in the Bogside district of Londonderry on January 30, 1972. This morning, more than 28 years after the event, a new public inquiry headed by Lord Saville of Newdigate opened into the shootings. <p><b>Hasn't the Saville inquiry been under way for some time?</b><br> It was announced by Tony Blair in January 1998. He was responding to the persistent demands of the Irish government, a key player in the faltering peace process, for a new and definitive inquiry. Since then, Saville and his co-judges have amassed at least 60,000 pages of written submissions.

      "bodyText": "Why is Bloody Sunday back in the news? Since 1969 more than 3,250 people have died in the Northern Ireland troubles. None has been mourned more publicly than the 14 who were shot dead by British paratroopers during a civil rights protest in the Bogside district of Londonderry on January 30, 1972. This morning, more than 28 years after the event, a new public inquiry headed by Lord Saville of Newdigate opened into the shootings. Hasn't the Saville inquiry been under way for some time? It was announced by Tony Blair in January 1998. He was responding to the persistent demands of the Irish government, a key player in the faltering peace process, for a new and definitive inquiry. Since then, Saville and his co-judges have amassed at least 60,000 pages of written submissions. They have interviewed nearly 1,500 civilians, soldiers, police officers, journalists and government officials. They have been embroiled in interminable legal arguments about the identification of military witnesses. Saville wanted the former soldiers involved in the shootings to be named, but the House of Lords ruled that they were entitled to the protection of anonymity. So what is happening today? Saville is starting to take public evidence in Londonderry's Guildhall, an ornate Victorian building which has been transformed for the hearings into a hi-tech showpiece. Computer screens will show graphic reconstructions of the Bogside as it was in 1972, when the Provisional IRA had made it effectively a no-go area for security forces. Can any genuinely new evidence come to light, so long after the event? There will be keen interest in the testimony of forensic experts, whose science has progressed enormously since the early 1970s. At the Widgery inquiry which followed the shootings, it was damningly suggested that several of the victims had been in contact with firearms or explosives. That finding has been demolished by re-examination of the evidence, using modern techniques. What did Lord Widgery say? He concluded that although there was no evidence that any of the victims had been armed, there was \"a strong suspicion that some others had been firing weapons or handling bombs\". That finding caused outrage among nationalists and republicans, who have always insisted that the human rights march which preceded the riot had been an entirely civilian and peaceful protest. What was Widgery's judgment on the soldiers involved? He said that their action had \"bordered on the reckless\" - a conclusion which many felt was, to put it mildly, inadequate to the occasion. Even the Northern Ireland coroner, Major Hubert O'Neill, concluded that the soldiers \"ran amok that day and shot [the victims] without thinking what they were doing\". Are the Bloody Sunday weapons used still available for examination? Some have been sold, and others destroyed. Three of the army rifles which fired fatal rounds during Bloody Sunday were mysteriously scrapped less than three months ago. The Ministry of Defence says it happened because of a bureaucratic cock-up, but there are suspicions that the rifles had been deliberately adapted for use on just such an occasion as Bloody Sunday, and that their destruction was deliberate. Says who? Earlier this month, veteran Northern Ireland reporters Peter Pringle and Philip Jacobson revealed the existence of a secret memo, in which a senior British army commander recommended shoot-to-kill tactics to deal with riots.

      "standfirst": "Eve Pollard explains why in a market swamped with teenage obsessions she had to launch her own woman's magazine",
      "trailText": "<p>So, you are a woman over 35 who has a serious magazine habit, but every title is full of teenage obsessions. What do you do? If you are like  Eve Pollard  you launch your own title, and reveal why the industry needs to speak to people like her</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It seems like only a dot comma ago that once a woman reached her prime, the best she could look forward to was a graceful slide into the slow lane wearing comfy floral flip-flops, big bow blouses with pleated skirts and a serviceable beige cardigan to cover up as much as possible of a body heading in a southerly direction. </p> <p>But wait. Try a Spring 2000 reality check. Aren't these exactly the clothes and accessories that have been adorning the designer catwalks and boutiques this season? So if today's 30+ woman is wearing them, isn't she flashing her fashion cred rather than thinking that these are the garments to acquire for her advancing years? After all, don't most of us believe we are so much younger than that ridiculous date in our passports? </p> <p>An ICM poll commissioned by Aura, the magazine for \"grown-up\" women that launches on Thursday, reveals that most women aged 35-40 think of themselves as 28; 41-45 year olds feel 31, and even 46-50 year olds feel only 35. So, if these grown-up women still feel so youthful, why don't they simply stick with magazines designed for the age group to which they imagine they belong? </p> <p>Real life, that's why. There's no point reading about multi-orgasms when your partner is more unloaded than Loaded these days. No point reading about how to deal with your bossy mother when suddenly she's frail and vulnerable and relies on you to make decisions for her. No point reading fanzine pieces on Liam or Leonardo when what's wanted are men we can get our hands on. </p> <p>Yet these 30+ women are magazineaholics. They've been reading their glossy fix ever since they became hooked on regular doses of Honey or 19 or Petticoat or Jackie or Cosmopolitan. They need to feed their mag habit, and as they have grown older it's been harder to get satisfaction from just one title. </p> <p>Woman's Journal and Women and Home, whose readers' median age is in their early 50s and Good Housekeeping whose readers' median age is 47, have been the only standard bearers for the older woman. But these magazines were established some 70 or more years ago. They are certainly mature brands. What about the 35- to 50 year old ABC1 sector of the female population which is growing by leaps and bounds? </p> <p>When I first announced plans for Aura some six months ago, it was in the certain knowledge that since this had been such a hitherto unexploited route, nobody else would want to go down it. How wrong I was. Suddenly, targeting the older woman is all the rage, with newspaper supplements, magazine banded-on supplements and rumours that two more magazines targeted at the older woman are hoping to launch in the autumn. Suddenly this woman who had nothing to read is going to be swamped. But this awakening is not before time. </p> <p>By 2004, women aged 35+ will number 17m. They are the fastest-growing sector of the population. More than 80% of them work, with 35-49 year olds making up the largest part of the female workforce. Their personal income comes to \u00a3100bn annually. </p> <p>So, they have money, spending money. Much more than their younger sisterhood. The baby-boomers born between 1946 and 1964 are the biggest-spending group of consumers in history. These women have worked for this cash. They own it. And they possess the right to blow it. Not only that, they want it and they want it now, whether it's glam holidays, chic homes or the cosmetic polyfilla that most efficiently evens out those early wrinkles. These are not disbursements that can be delayed. </p> <p>\"If not now, when?\" is this woman's credo. After all, no point in having that snazzy convertible if you wait until the streaked hair has bits of grey in it and your bad back will not let you buy a chassis that's too low on the ground. And buy them they do. </p> <p>But when you watch TV commercials you'd never know it. When did you ever see a woman old enough to have teenage children featured in one of those adverts that show dramatic Schumacher-style driving techniques on one of those mountain roads so uninhabited that it could be filmed and re-filmed by helicopter camera teams overhead? (Even less likely is it to see a woman in this situation with real childbearing hips, but that's another story.) </p> <p>Adland and, in the main, magland is populated by babes. This must change. Retailers and major companies know it is women that are buying - in our first issue, Vanessa Feltz writes about her car and why she chose it. Toyota's agency saw the piece and booked advertising. I am the self-appointed president and chairman of the movement. </p> <p>Apart from the ageist argument, this is the most educated group of females the world has ever known. Why shouldn't Aura magazine include articles on politics, e-commerce and property? Research shows that women, on the whole, find women's magazines patronising, bland and out of touch with their lives. Aura won't be: it will be urbane, relevant, newsworthy, practical and not afraid of being intellectually adventurous. </p> <p>I believe that when it comes to women's magazines, the differentiating factor between the first-class magazine and any other magazine is its relevance. Brilliant magazines like Vanity Fair recognise that women can enjoy in-depth pieces. OK! and Hello! are successful because they recognise that people are nosy. Aura's reality check is that today's woman is intelligent and independent and very busy. </p> <p>We don't have a cover mount on our first issue because, for example, we know that these women already have a smart make-up bag and don't need a plastic one. What they do need is a magazine they want to read - something that is at once entirely new and absolutely essential. There are no embarrassing cover lines readers wouldn't want their children to see; nor the 50 ways with a chicken breast that makes you want to chicken out. In the first issue of Aura we talk to Cherie Blair, Germaine Greer and Susan Sarandon and we devote a regular monthly section to tackling the problems of the time famine experienced by this audience (and incidentally by the 40-something working mothers who work on the magazine). We also cover medicine and health, career changes, relationships and finance. The entrepreneurial spirit is flourishing among our target readers, too. The growth in self-employed women is much stronger than the growth in self-employed men. Almost a million work for themselves, 30% more than in the 1980s. Women are seeking more flexible working patterns and freedom from large, male-dominated companies. </p> <p>Interestingly, Lloyds Bank monitored companies that were set up a year ago and found that of the businesses that achieved a turnover in excess of \u00a31m, half were run by women. </p> <p>A new Small Business Research Trust report shows that women are more eager to reap the rewards of information technology than men, and older female entrepreneurs in particular are the most keen to make technology work for them. This confirms that today's women are more open-minded and adventurous than most chaps. </p> <p>There's no escaping the fact that some aspects of getting older are very, very boring. For example, I now have to have two sorts of shoes: ones with the high heels I used to wear for those occasions when I know I'll be sitting down and flatter ones when I'll be standing up. When I have any spare time to daydream I inwardly debate the possibility of a little light plastic surgery round the eyes. But when I talk to my friends, most of whom have already indulged, I wonder will this be a bit like painting the hallway and where will it end? </p> <p> All this used to be inadmissible. But nowadays research shows we're actually happy to be growing older - statistically, a woman of 40 has more life to look forward to than back on. She is likely to live well into her 80s. If she wants to have a baby at 40 she can Blair, Bowie or Madonna it. If she wants to start a new career a high proportion of the new female entrepreneurs kick off at 35 plus. </p> <p>So can we change the zeitgeist which dictates that invisibility comes into play once the chin begins to crumble and oestrogen goes on the missing list? Perhaps we may never achieve the wise matriarch status of women in more sensitive societies, but if your partner directs TV commercials and is going off on a shoot with a 23-year-old, why not ask him why she's not 43? </p> <p>And speaking up for that part of female population past the first flush of youth could become fashionable. We hope so. After all that's what our big girl's browse, Aura, is all about. As a sector we are not giving up, we are not giving in. We want a magazine that shows us as we are. We may not be at our most pulchritudinous but we are less callow and more accepting of who we are. </p> <p>And after all whatever adjustments we have to make, getting older is so much better than the alternative.</p>",

Any paper that has Jon Swain and Marie Colvin among its foreign reporting staff can't be all bad. </p> <p>But the gems are harder to find in the main section nowadays amidst the dross too often masquerading as home news. Last autumn I highlighted a series of stories about anarchists and ecology campaigners which were laced with the kind of innuendo which ran counter to the Sunday Times's best traditions for impartiality and fairness. During my researches for that piece, a young man who had briefly worked for the newsdesk told me such stories were the result of \"the system\". He had too little experience of the business to explain what he meant and I didn't take it too seriously. </p> <p>After my article was published though, I was contacted by a former Sunday Times reporter who was surprised that I should have been surprised. \"Surely you know what happens,\" he said. \"Young and inexperienced reporters spend their week trying to stand up a \"wish list\" of stories conceived on a Tuesday. They're under pressure to perform.\" </p> <p>He pointed out that several reporters had left the paper because they were demoralised by working on \"concept stories\". Last week I spoke to two people who had done just that and both confirmed the allegation about the paper's culture. \"It's not a case of following up a tip,\" said one. \"It's about the desk having an agenda and then coming up with ideal stories to suit it. Having sold the story ideas to the editor, they then have to do their best to make them work.\" </p> <p>It isn't a new phenomenon, especially on red-tops where someone conceives of a headline and then expects a writer to make a story or feature fit it. But the Sunday Times, a supposedly respectable broadsheet, is manifesting all sorts of tabloid qualities of late. </p> <p>The most obvious recent example is its run of stories about the royal family, especially Prince William who has, in the main, benefited from revisions to the editors' code of practice which constrained the press in the wake of his mother's death. This change of heart has not inhibited the Sunday Times. </p> <p>The first of its trio of tabloid-style royal stories came on January 20: Prince caught in sights of a low-flying earl, the headline said. This claimed that Prince Charles had demanded that the Earl of Suffolk stop flying over Highgrove and, in retaliation, the Earl had threatened to ban the Beaufort hunt from his estate. A month later the paper carried what its website coyly refers to as \"a clarification\". It was, in fact, a complete retraction of every alleged fact in the story. </p> <p>Sunday Times managing editor, Richard Caseby, explains: \"The story was supplied by a freelance with whom we no longer have a relationship.\" The second story, given front page prominence on February 6, was headlined: Charles and William in nightclub row. This claimed they had had a \"stand-up confrontation\" because William wanted to hold his 18th birthday in a nightclub. In journalistic jargon, this was \"a flier\", a speculative story without a discernible source which gives it deniability and makes it relatively safe to run. </p> <p>I understand that St James's Palace has written to the Sunday Times editor, John Witherow, stating that the story is totally untrue. But the paper is standing by its source and, while willing to carry a letter contesting the story, refuses to publish an apology. Caseby says: \"We don't need to apologise. We are totally happy with the story and are standing by it. We have three sources for the story, including someone in a position to know the truth. I know who the person is, as does John Witherow.\" </p> <p>In that article there was a clue to the story the paper had been hoping to publish. It was alleged that Charles was becoming \"increasingly concerned\" that his son was mixing with people who take drugs. </p> <p>Three weeks later the same allegation surfaced in a new form in the paper's third story, again on the front page: Police fears over William's friends. It was alleged that members of the royal protection squad looking after William, alarmed at drug-takers in his circle, have sought \"clarification\" from their superiors about what action they should take. </p> <p>The whole basis of this front page story is contested by the Metropolitan police. They cannot verify any such request from any officer. \"As far as we are concerned, the story is not true,\" says a spokesman. The squad's senior officer, Commander Peter Clarke, is evidently unaware of any such action. The allegation rests on the word of a source who, the paper said, \"asked not to be identified\". </p> <p>Sunday Times executives argue that neither the Met press office nor Commander Clarke would know about it because of \"the level\" of police officer involved. </p> <p>Other details in the story which attempts to link William with drug-takers were tenuous. Much was made of a named \"leading socialite\" who attends Edinburgh university and who is alleged to have been seen taking cocaine. But William has never knowingly met the woman. He is also not on close terms with two other people named as being in his circle. </p> <p>There was one obvious similarity between the three stories: they all carry the byline of the Sunday Times's royal correspondent, Christopher Morgan, who was shortlisted as specialist writer of the year in the British Press Awards last week. Palace officials believe Morgan has become obsessed with linking Prince William to drug-takers. But his superiors scoff at the claim. \"He is one of our most successful reporters, a serious man with a great contacts book,\" said a newsdesk executive. \"He has impeccable sourcing both within and without the Palace for these stories. He is pressing buttons and the Palace doesn't like it. I am satisfied that his stories tell the truth.\" Caseby agrees. \"Christopher is the best royal reporter in national journalism. He has been instrumental in exposing drug-taking among friends of Prince William.\" </p> <p>But why has the Sunday Times shown such interest in an area previously the preserve of the tabloids? Caseby says: \"It is a matter of genuine public interest. William is the son of the heir to the throne and, though we are sensitive to the issue of his privacy, we regard his circle of friends as a legitimate area of concern.\" </p> <p>That high-minded defence brings a wry smile to the faces of the princes' aides. They believe the stories are largely founded on \"third-party gossip\". Caseby also takes issue with the claim that reporters are pressured to produce preconceived stories. \"The Sunday Times demands flair, drive and accuracy from its reporters. But it has no agenda beyond challenging orthodoxies and presenting readers with intelligent and well-sourced scoops.\" </p> <p> The Sunday Express has also upset Prince William. An \"exclusive\" story headlined \"Isabella, the blonde tipped to be Prince William's wife\" turned out to be unsubstantiated gossip retailed as fact. </p> <p>It all started with a silly squib in December's Tatler which informed readers about Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe: \"Pretty as a picture with a great brain and tipped to be the future Mrs Prince William. Isabella is no fairytale princess: she might be squeaky clean, but she's no bore.\" </p> <p>The presentation and context indicated that it shouldn't be taken literally. But the joke took off. GQ joined in with a similar prediction, as did the Edinburgh University student newspaper. </p> <p>This didn't matter until Sunday Express reporter Shekhar Bhatia came along. His story said that \"glossy magazines\" had \"tipped\" Isabella to marry William, which was a truth of sorts. But then he over-egged the pudding by adding: \"Royal insiders say the 19-year-old blonde has formed a close bond\" with the Prince. </p> <p>A \"tip\" had become a \"fact\" attributed to our old friend \"anonymous sources\". The inclusion of that quote, plus the story's appearance in a national paper, gave it credence.

She was pursued by reporters and photographers, and her boyfriend was none too pleased either. In fact, Isabella and William have never met. Sunday Express spokesman Greg Sage said: \"We don't want to comment.\" </p> <p>Doubtless the paper expects a Press Complaints Commission censure later this week, following a complaint from Isabella's father.

      "body": "<p>It takes a certain type of animal to dig out the truffles. And when that rare delicacy, a good idea, falls into their lap they are apt to use it up and wear it out. It happens with performers and programmes alike, and none more so than with those connected to comedy. Well, comedy is, according to Mark Freeland, head of Sky Production, \"next to premier football, the reason people stay in and watch television\". </p> <p>Along with the docusoap and lifestyle programmes, the comedy panel show is the format that has been reproduced ad nauseam of late, as though Julian Clary and Jo Brand tossing one-liners to friends is on a par with Dorothy Parker at the Algonquin. The comedy panel show has become the final resting place for a generation of comedians who have spread themselves thinly over sitcoms, sketch shows, dramas, documentaries and broadsheet columns, to the extent that there is nowhere left for them to go. Never has a joke been stretched so far, and never has the market been so wide open for new talent. \"There's a goldrush at the moment,\" says Addison Cresswell of the agency Off the Kerb. \"Every new comic is doing a pilot.\" </p> <p>In this clearing, a comedy act is therefore more likely to board the bullet train, rise through the ranks and find itself heading for the mainstream fast, while also quickly becoming the face that brands a channel. These are the adjuncts to the phenomenal success of Ali G, and why all eyes will be on his first series, Da Ali G Show, beginning on Friday. </p> <p>Either a career is about to burn itself out when it has barely begun, or the contract and cash for a second series, a tour, and a film contract will be in the post; film is rapidly becoming the next link on the track for TV comedy, now that Harry Enfield's Kevin character is the subject of a big-screen venture, and The Royle Family are Hollywood-bound. </p> <p>The expectation and anticipation surrounding the new Ali G series is such that industry insiders are going to extremes to get access to information. You could be forgiven for thinking we were about to witness something as significant as Princess Diana's Panorama routine. </p> <p>The pilot for the series got in the wrong hands and inevitably found its way on to the internet. Heat magazine acquired a copy of the tape and published screen grabs from it. Audience members and musical guests from the series have been pursued by journalists eager to discover stories, new catchphrases or characters that Ali G's alter ego, Sacha Baron Cohen, may be introducing. It's almost as though Channel 4 didn't need to invest in the obligatory billboard campaign which started last week - Ali G had already been talked up, hyped up and marked up to a frightening degree. </p> <p>Thus far, a journalist wishing to see programmes in the series requires a summons to Horseferry Road to view the tapes inside the Channel 4 nerve centre, presumably under armed guard and followed by a strip search. </p> <p>The comedian's refusal to do interviews, and the reluctance to offer any information regarding personal details - apart from the fact that he is a Jewish north Londoner who went to Cambridge University and supports the campaign to cancel third world debt - has only contributed to the intrigue. </p> <p>The key to his greater success has been the targeting of a particular audience and the way in which he, alongside Graham Norton, is being used to brand the channel. There have been numerous photo shoots - one with Naomi Campbell - and like Dom Joly of Trigger Happy TV, he made the perfunctory appearance on the podium at the Brit awards. Also Channel 4 apparently insisted that he deliver the alternative Queen's speech on Christmas Day. </p> <p>\"The speed at which this has happened has been extraordinary\", says Kevin Lygo, head of arts and entertainment at Channel 4. \"All he has done are those three-minute interviews, tucked away in a show that transmits at 11 o'clock at night, and suddenly he is written about in the Sun and talked about by kids in playgrounds. He's been promoted beyond his audience base, partly because of clever positioning and by using him strategically.\" </p> <p>According to Jon Plowman, head of comedy entertainment at the BBC, this is part of a wider trend within television comedy. \"The landscape has changed,\" he says. \"A certain type of comedy used to have to elbow its way towards the mainstream to make an impact. Now we look at something like the League of Gentlemen and wonder how we can get it to as wide an audience as possible.\" </p> <p>The character of Ali G was born nearly two years ago when Harry Thompson, producer of the new series, and Channel 4's Andrew Newman plucked Cohen from the obscurity of a batch of amateur videotapes, in which he was discovered portraying an east European reporter. He subsequently developed Ali G, whom Thompson has described as the \"disaffected wannabe homeboy of the suburbs, the kid stuck in Staines who dreamed of Compton or Watts\". </p> <p>For this, his first series, the hallmark one-to-one interview has been abandoned in favour of a studio-based show with a live audience and music, video parodies, panel discussions and sketches. Despite the claims by Channel 4 that he has reinvented the spoof interview, while Dom Joly has reinvented the hidden camera show, there is nothing particularly distinctive or innovative in the actual style or formats that these comedians choose. For real innovation, witness the manner in which Spaced has reinvented the sitcom, and how Chris Morris has subverted the sketch show with the current Jam, and how, elsewhere, the League of Gentlemen has completely shaken up the idea of what constitutes TV comedy. </p> <p>For the series, Cohen has reprised the reporter character that got him noticed, and christened him Borat, a \"journalist from Kazakhstan\". The explanation of the new character's origins may be a swipe at those black comedians who took against Ali G. </p> <p>Perhaps the most significant aspect of Ali G's success is that, like Alf Garnett and \"Loadsamoney\" in the past, he lampoons the very people who make up its audience - in this case the exact market that Channel 4 is courting. In keeping with television's pathological need to reproduce a successful idea until the life is wrung out of it and it is finally put out of our misery, both Channel 4 and BBC2 now appear to be rabidly pursuing youth, and only youth. A call reputedly echoed throughout the corridors of TV centre last week, pointing out that Channel 4 had successfully tapped into the younger audience that the BBC should pursue. </p> <p>\"Television has always had an appetite for young comedy people,\" says Plowman. \"It's simply that instead of tucking them away on a Tuesday night, they now build marketing campaigns around having youth comedy. We now recognise the value of these people and how much we need them.\" </p> <p>Ironically, Ali G came into being because of his creator's abhorrence of youth television. \"There is an obsession with youth and new acts,\" says Thompson. \"But it is as much to do with the pursuit of fashionability as with talent. A really talented 35-year-old is going to find it much harder than, say, a faintly promising 21-year-old.\" </p> <p>At the BBC, the head of comedy, Geoffrey Perkins, is in partial agreement: \"I think this is the remit of the moment for Channel 4, because of the advertising. But BBC2 is actually more scripted and involved with performance-based series.\" </p> <p>A further theory within TV centre is that comedy has become like music, with teenagers not wanting to watch the comedy that their parents like. The BBC is so keen to seem hot on the tail of new young talent that it has embarked on a nationwide campaign in search of it. </p> <p>With so many comedy writers and performers stretched beyond their capabilities, and with the big names creaming off huge parts of programme budgets, the corporation has tumbled that good ideas at a cheap rate may be found within those who provide the material for docu-soaps: the public. For the first time in its history, the BBC has realised that the funniest, the cleverest, the most talented people in this country may not all congregate at Cambridge. </p> <p>This sudden surge of interest in new young talent is also making the traditional comedy route that begins with comedy clubs and evolves through radio and on to television, redundant. Thompson points out that \"it used to be that a comedian's career would have time to build. Now they get picked up when they've only been in the business a few weeks. They get a series - but if they don't get an audience they might be dropped. Someone like Phil Kay, for instance, appears to have been dropped long before reaching his peak.\" </p> <p>This need for the \"new\" also emerges as there becomes increasingly more time to fill in a multi-channel environment - what John Birt described as \"the digitopia\". \"Well, now Sky are getting in on homegrown comedy,\" says Addison Cresswell. \"Then there's all those dreadful acts cluttering up BBC Choice, which seems to be a training ground for the main channel.\" </p> <p>Sky's big signing, Al Murray, with his pub landlord character, seems to have been strategically held back from television, until now - with a loyal fan base behind him, a Perrier award, and a one-man West End show. Mark Freeland says that Sky \"has been after this act for two years. Our hit rate has to be as high as possible. Murray is a perfect face to brand Sky.\" </p> <p>But he speaks for many television channels when he says: \"We would love a face like Ali G as a brand.\" Just don't overstretch him, that's all. </p> <p>Da Ali G Show begins on Channel 4 this Friday at 10.30pm</p>",

The man who made the controversial Power into Art series, Karl Sabbagh, reveals why Channel 4 has some serious questions to answer about it's programmes on the Tate Modern</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When in 1994 I first started making my \"fly on the wall\" series Power into Art, about the new Tate Modern, there was no such thing as a \"docusoap\". The world had not been treated to endless programmes about traffic wardens and shopping centres and airports and learner drivers and hotels and package holidays, all purporting to convey the gritty reality of ordinary life. </p> <p>There had been, of course, Roger Graef's sober series analysing processes in institutions, but here the search for drama and entertainment was not the main point of the exercise - light was as important as heat. The drama simply emerged, as the producers knew it would do, from the material itself. </p> <p>Now, for an audience trained by their diet of docusoaps to expect rows, tantrums, firings and public displays of incompetence, a series like mine, which set out to show the complexity and interest of designing and building the new Tate Modern, faces an uphill struggle with the new breed of television commissioning editors, who are disappointed if they don't get a crisis every 10 minutes as a series evolves. </p> <p>This is why it can seem as if Power into Art is \"a tale of tantrums, clashing egos and errors\" as described in Saturday's Guardian. There are two reasons why the overall impression of drama is heightened in the series. One is that inevitably, behind every short crisp sequence describing, say, a mistake in the staircase design or a disagreement with some consultants, lies a story that is much more complex and less black and white than can be conveyed in the five or six minutes that it has to be boiled down to in the programmes. </p> <p>The other is that, however rich and complex the overall series is at the editing stage, under the relentless pressure of commissioning editors who have a jaundiced view of the audience, sequences conveying good news or stories that are just interesting are removed because they are seen as \"too boring\", or \"slowing things down\". </p> <p>As Harry Gugger, one of the Tate Modern architects, was quoted as saying in Saturday's story, I am \"a fan of the building and think it is a great success\".

      "bodyText": "When in 1994 I first started making my \"fly on the wall\" series Power into Art, about the new Tate Modern, there was no such thing as a \"docusoap\". The world had not been treated to endless programmes about traffic wardens and shopping centres and airports and learner drivers and hotels and package holidays, all purporting to convey the gritty reality of ordinary life. There had been, of course, Roger Graef's sober series analysing processes in institutions, but here the search for drama and entertainment was not the main point of the exercise - light was as important as heat. The drama simply emerged, as the producers knew it would do, from the material itself. Now, for an audience trained by their diet of docusoaps to expect rows, tantrums, firings and public displays of incompetence, a series like mine, which set out to show the complexity and interest of designing and building the new Tate Modern, faces an uphill struggle with the new breed of television commissioning editors, who are disappointed if they don't get a crisis every 10 minutes as a series evolves. This is why it can seem as if Power into Art is \"a tale of tantrums, clashing egos and errors\" as described in Saturday's Guardian. There are two reasons why the overall impression of drama is heightened in the series. One is that inevitably, behind every short crisp sequence describing, say, a mistake in the staircase design or a disagreement with some consultants, lies a story that is much more complex and less black and white than can be conveyed in the five or six minutes that it has to be boiled down to in the programmes. The other is that, however rich and complex the overall series is at the editing stage, under the relentless pressure of commissioning editors who have a jaundiced view of the audience, sequences conveying good news or stories that are just interesting are removed because they are seen as \"too boring\", or \"slowing things down\". As Harry Gugger, one of the Tate Modern architects, was quoted as saying in Saturday's story, I am \"a fan of the building and think it is a great success\". It's all the more regrettable, therefore, that the only way Channel 4 wants to tell this sort of story in the current television climate is to play down the success and concentrate on the inevitable challenges and problems. They have even imposed a subtitle on the series, calling it \"The Battle for the New Tate\", when there was no battle, only a difficult and challenging task.

For me, the techniques I use in my documentaries to try to capture \"real life\" produce far more riveting material than the traditional \"interventionist\" approach of the documentary director who feels he has to intervene if the shot isn't quite right or the \"performance\" of the person he is filming doesn't quite come up to expectations.

On Saturday, Manchester United's Paul Scholes volleyed in a Beckham corner from 25 yards against Bradford. It was such a thumper that many thought the goal of the season had been decided there and then. Trust Paolo Di Canio to totally confuse the issue less than 24 hours later.

      "bodyText": "Pope John Paul II yesterday stood humbly before the great stone slabs of the Wailing Wall and slipped a prayer into its crevices, bearing a plea for forgiveness for the sins of many generations. His visit to the holiest site of Judaism, the last remnant of a temple destroyed in 70AD, lasted only moments, but the memory of his presence here during the twilight of his papacy will undoubtedly prove the most resonant of his journey to the Holy Land. \"We are deeply saddened by the behaviour of those who, in the course of history, have caused these children of yours to suffer and, asking your forgiveness, we wish to commit ourselves to genuine brotherhood with the people of the Covenant,\" the prayer said. It was immediately plucked from the Wailing Wall, and entrusted to the archives of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial. Yesterday's visit to the holiest sites of the three main faiths - Islam, Christianity and Judaism - all within the ancient city walls of Jerusalem - offered the most rigorous test of the Pope's crowning achievement during his pilgrimage: his ability to hover serenely above the fray, and yet somehow satisfy the region's feuding factions. Around 7,000 Israeli security forces were deployed in the old city's winding alleys in case the passions stoked during the Pope's visit - especially over rival Palestinian and Israeli claims to Jerusalem - became explosive. In fact, the last day of his visit ended without violence but was marked by several minor squabbles. When the Catholic prelates in the papal entourage set foot in the Muslim sanctuary of the Dome of the Rock, where the prophet Mohammed is believed to have ascended to heaven, they were greeted by activists shouting: \"Homos, go home.\" On Saturday the supreme Muslim cleric of Jerusalem, Mufti Ikrema Sabri, dismayed Israelis by denying the Holocaust, saying: \"It is true, the number was less than six million and Israel is using this issue to get sympathy worldwide.\" Yesterday Mr Sabri used the papal audience to appeal for the Vatican's endorsement of Palestinian claims to Jerusalem, and to seek its support in ending the Israeli occupation of the eastern part of the city, captured after the 1967 war. There were small scuffles, too, at the Wailing Wall, where an Orthodox Jewish woman stood in the centre of the plaza before the ceremony and shouted: \"There are so many churches around the world to visit, why do you have to come here?\" Hours later, after a visit to the Holy Sepulchre, which houses the tomb of Jesus, the Pope was gone - borne aloft by a plane called Jerusalem.

The first exists solely thanks to the nationalist community of Derry. They not only had to mourn their dead but ensure that the injustice that killed them was not forgotten either.</p> <p>Today may herald the beginning of the end of that incongruity. As Lord Saville of Newdigate begins to take oral evidence at Derry's Guildhall this morning in the inquiry into Bloody Sunday, the nationalist community is feeling cautiously optimistic. \"My greatest hope is that the truth of what happened on the day is finally told,\" says Patricia Macbride, the manager of the Bloody Sunday centre in Derry. \"That the people killed and injured on the day are finally vindicated as innocent and that those who were responsible are held accountable for their actions.\"</p> <p>It is a substantial wish list, punctuated with scepticism. They have been here before. An inquiry in 1972 by Lord Chief Justice Widgery effectively exonerated the army of all wrongdoing, arguing only that some of their actions had \"bordered on the reckless\". More recently the army has admitted to destroying rifles that could have provided fresh and vital evidence to the inquiry, even after Lord Saville asked the Ministry of Defence to keep them safe.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Saville already promises far more than Widgery could ever deliver. The Widgery report was a 39-page document, written in 10 weeks. The Saville tribunal has already been running for a year and a half, and has collected around 60,000 pages, more than 5,000 photographs and 36 hours of videotape.</p> <p>As such, Saville has the potential to do for Northern Ireland what Macpherson did for Britain. It could confirm what a minority has been insisting for years, by elevating a long-held grievance to an established fact. It might illustrate how those responsible for maintaining law and order can and do use bureaucracy, malice and prejudice to ensure that those facts never emerge. And, by drawing a clear line of command from the pen pushers to the army snipers, it could show that the flaws that brought them about are not individual and erratic but institutional and endemic.</p> <p>The parallels are not lost on locals here. \"We have every sympathy with the way Neville and Doreen Lawrence were treated by the police,\" says Mickey McKinney, whose brother Willie was shot dead on Bloody Sunday. \"There was no sense of shock here that something like that could happen in Britain because we've all been through it.\"</p> <p>But even a partially favourable outcome will allow not just the families of those who perished but the entire city of Derry to move on. For so long as there is a logjam in the judicial process there will be a hold-up in the grieving process. The city has become defined by the events of Bloody Sunday. Coming into the Bogside you are struck by a huge white edifice announcing \"You are now entering Free Derry\". On the walls of the flats, which have now been renovated, are huge murals depicting what happened on the day. One row of flats, in Glenfada Park, has not been touched up. It bears a mural of an RUC man and a soldier beating a protester and bullet holes from Bloody Sunday which may be useful for the inquiry. The event is even being commodified. The Bogside has become one of the city's major tourist attractions; within Derry's historic walls you can buy T-shirts marking the event.</p> <p>Given the current state of the peace process, the political ramifications of an inquiry which finds the authorities guilty of systematic and pervasive wrongdoing could be immense. If nothing else it will provide a tangible context for the \"lack of trust\" which republicans refer to as the obstacle in the path of decommissioning and remove the facade that the British government is nothing more than an honest broker in a local religious dispute.</p> <p>\"Trust is a two-way street,\" says Macbride. \"Trust has not been forthcoming from them so there's not going to be much trust going to them.\"</p> <p>But a critical report from Lord Saville will not only provide a boost for the people of Derry but a jolt for the British, who practise a selective amnesia when it comes to ugly parts of our recent history. It could force us, not by guilt but by intellect, to redefine who we are through what we, as a nation, have done. \"I inherit from the past of my family, my city, my tribe, my nation a variety of debts, inheritances, rightful expectations and obligations,\" writes Alasdair MacIntyre in his book, After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory. \"I am born with a past; and to try to cut myself off from that past is to deform my present relationships. The possession of an historical identity and the possession of a social identity coincide.\"</p> <p>Which brings us back to the two monuments. For through the different ways in which the American and British establishments recognise their specific Bloody Sundays one begins to see where greater trust could emerge. The plaque in Selma shows that when it comes to the past the US has an ability to sacrifice parts in favour of the whole. They will admit a specific wrongdoing so that you may still retain some faith in the country's broader ideological narrative. Such an approach suggests that the nation's political culture is underpinned by a notion of right and wrong. By admitting it has been wrong it has the ability to claim that it has also been right. This does not make American history more morally acceptable. But it does make the official versions of it more believable.</p> <p>The absence of any common marker in Derry indicates how, in the United Kingdom, there is no such distinction. For when a nation rarely admits it has done wrong, even in the face of undeniable evidence, it denies the opportunity for any critical support. You can either believe in the whole or you can reject the whole. You cannot take it in parts. You cannot think that what happened in Derry was wrong and still believe in the union flag since the establishment still insists those wrongs were committed in the name of the union flag. Nowhere are these contradictions clearer than in Ireland. By apologising for the potato famine and expressing regret for Bloody Sunday, Tony Blair has made some commendable headway here. By setting up an inquiry he has set the ball rolling. Once again it will be down to a lord to pick it up and run with it.</p>",

The possession of an historical identity and the possession of a social identity coincide.\" Which brings us back to the two monuments. For through the different ways in which the American and British establishments recognise their specific Bloody Sundays one begins to see where greater trust could emerge. The plaque in Selma shows that when it comes to the past the US has an ability to sacrifice parts in favour of the whole. They will admit a specific wrongdoing so that you may still retain some faith in the country's broader ideological narrative. Such an approach suggests that the nation's political culture is underpinned by a notion of right and wrong. By admitting it has been wrong it has the ability to claim that it has also been right. This does not make American history more morally acceptable. But it does make the official versions of it more believable. The absence of any common marker in Derry indicates how, in the United Kingdom, there is no such distinction. For when a nation rarely admits it has done wrong, even in the face of undeniable evidence, it denies the opportunity for any critical support. You can either believe in the whole or you can reject the whole. You cannot take it in parts. You cannot think that what happened in Derry was wrong and still believe in the union flag since the establishment still insists those wrongs were committed in the name of the union flag. Nowhere are these contradictions clearer than in Ireland. By apologising for the potato famine and expressing regret for Bloody Sunday, Tony Blair has made some commendable headway here. By setting up an inquiry he has set the ball rolling. Once again it will be down to a lord to pick it up and run with it.",

If you want to get published, it helps to be a man. And if you write a novel starring men, you'd better be a man. </p> <p>I learned this ugly truth 12 months ago when my novel, Walk of Fame, a satire about America's obsession with fame and celebrity, started doing the rounds of American publishers. </p> <p>Its lead character, Tom Webster, is a man. A red-blooded, 43-year-old American male - baseball mad, newly separated, midlife crisis.

I live in a world half male; I love men, I observe men, and I didn't, and still don't, think it's brain surgery to fictionalise them. And yet the book was rejected by a number of American publishers because, I was told repeatedly, no one would read a novel about a man written by a woman. </p> <p>Better yet, few publishers believed I even was a woman. My agent received a slew of calls insisting she cough up my \"real name\". We don't believe Sharon Krum exists, they said. We don't believe a woman can get inside a man's head like that, they said. I was flattered, then insulted. They were convinced I was male and the name a hoax - a gimmick to give the book an edge. </p> <p>I quickly learned publishers are terrified of women who write fiction about men, that I was their worst marketing nightmare. I was advised, in all seriousness, to change my name to Stanley Krum, cancel my subscription to Vogue and throw out my beloved high heels. </p> <p>\"Your gender is holding you back,\" one editor who liked the book but wouldn't buy it because I have XX chromosomes said to me privately. </p> <p>\"Men don't believe women can get inside their heads. Men don't think women can be funny about them. Change your name if you want to sell it.\" </p> <p>On further prodding I discovered the industry thought Helen Fielding was a good girl because she wrote a comic book about a woman, and she was one. Nick Hornby was a good boy because he was a man writing wickedly about men. </p> <p> But I was a bad girl because I crossed the line, putting my protagonist in a suit instead of a dress. If I had written Fever Pitch, it would, they swore, still be in my drawer. I wondered aloud whether JK Rowling used her initials because her protagonist was male. Was she worried little boys everywhere would reject Harry Potter if they knew his creator was a woman? </p> <p>Americans consider themselves the most equal-opportunity nation on earth, but when it comes to reading, forget about it. Publishers confessed in hushed tones that American men won't rush to read a novel - even if it's is about them - unless the author reeks of testosterone. They just refuse to believe women can x-ray their minds. </p> <p>Here in the UK, the recent Orange Prize gender survey concluded the situation is just as bad. It found men divide books into \"male\" and \"female\" reads, and run for the hills from the latter. </p> <p>Ian McEwan's Enduring Love was considered a \"female read\" by 78% of men but only 38% of women. And only 13% of men, compared with 70% of women, would consider reading The English Patient. The problem? They thought it a book about nursing and therefore clearly \"chick-lit\" territory to be avoided at all costs. </p> <p>The survey concluded that \"men are far more biased towards books written by men than women are to books written by women\". </p> <p>And that is exactly why prizes like the Orange are crucial, to chip away at that gender bias, to validate and promote women's writing, to highlight great books men otherwise may not be inclined to read. </p> <p>There is, you will be pleased to know, a positive ending to my story. I refused to change my name. I still wear skirts and cherry red lipstick. The book sold in five countries outside the US (in the UK, thankfully, my gender was not an issue for the publisher, but the public is yet to cast its vote) and we are now in talks with an American publisher prepared to take a risk on Sharon, not Stanley. </p> <p>But I still think those Bront\u00eb girls were smart. They never gave anybody an excuse not to read their books. </p> <p>Walk of Fame is published at \u00a310 by Quartet on April 3.</p>",

Nick Hornby was a good boy because he was a man writing wickedly about men. But I was a bad girl because I crossed the line, putting my protagonist in a suit instead of a dress. If I had written Fever Pitch, it would, they swore, still be in my drawer. I wondered aloud whether JK Rowling used her initials because her protagonist was male. Was she worried little boys everywhere would reject Harry Potter if they knew his creator was a woman? Americans consider themselves the most equal-opportunity nation on earth, but when it comes to reading, forget about it. Publishers confessed in hushed tones that American men won't rush to read a novel - even if it's is about them - unless the author reeks of testosterone. They just refuse to believe women can x-ray their minds. Here in the UK, the recent Orange Prize gender survey concluded the situation is just as bad. It found men divide books into \"male\" and \"female\" reads, and run for the hills from the latter. Ian McEwan's Enduring Love was considered a \"female read\" by 78% of men but only 38% of women. And only 13% of men, compared with 70% of women, would consider reading The English Patient. The problem? They thought it a book about nursing and therefore clearly \"chick-lit\" territory to be avoided at all costs. The survey concluded that \"men are far more biased towards books written by men than women are to books written by women\". And that is exactly why prizes like the Orange are crucial, to chip away at that gender bias, to validate and promote women's writing, to highlight great books men otherwise may not be inclined to read. There is, you will be pleased to know, a positive ending to my story. I refused to change my name. I still wear skirts and cherry red lipstick. The book sold in five countries outside the US (in the UK, thankfully, my gender was not an issue for the publisher, but the public is yet to cast its vote) and we are now in talks with an American publisher prepared to take a risk on Sharon, not Stanley. But I still think those Bront\u00eb girls were smart. They never gave anybody an excuse not to read their books. Walk of Fame is published at \u00a310 by Quartet on April 3.",

In 1981, the Awards were postponed for 24 hours due to the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. \u0095 In 1974, the ceremony was interrupted by a streaker (prompting presenter David Niven to quip: \"Just think, the only laugh that man will probably ever get is for stripping off and showing his shortcomings.\") \u0095 More people have been nominated for playing Henry VIII than for any other character, historic or fictional. \u0095 The first black actor to win Best Actor was Sidney Poitier, in 1963 for Lilies of the Field. \u0095 The only person to receive an award posthumously was actor Peter Finch (for Network, 1976).",

It was the first time the acting president had faced the voters.</p> <p>With nearly 70% of the vote counted in Russia's third direct presidential election, Mr Putin had won 51.17%, just over the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff on April 16. His main challenger, the communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, was on 30.37%, and complained of widespread fraud.</p> <p>Mr Putin's share was expected to rise as results came in from St Petersburg and other western regions, where his support is strongest.</p> <p>At a press conference early this morning he acknowledged that the Communists had done well and that his government would have to take popular discontent into account. \"Our policy must be more balanced, take into account the existing realities and aim at increasing living standards,\" Mr Putin said.</p> <p>In a swift attempt to build a national consensus behind his new team, whose policies are unclear, he went out of his way to praise Mr Zyuganov and his other main political rivals, the former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's mayor, Yury Luzhkov.</p> <p>They had all supported him over the war in Chechnya, he said, and had never taken an \"anti-state position\".</p> <p>At 47, Mr Putin will be the youngest person to rule Russia since Stalin succeeded Lenin as Soviet leader 76 years ago.</p> <p>A a former KGB career officer whose critics denounce him as a warmonger because of his brutal prosecution of the war in Chechnya, he has sold himself to Russians who yearn for a strong leader.</p> <p>The Moscow liberal, Grigory Yavlinsky, trailed in a poor third place, with 5.78% of the vote after Mr Putin's media acolytes smeared him in the closing days of a lacklustre campaign. Fearing that a bigger vote for Mr Yavlinsky could leave Mr Putin short of outright victory, state television claimed that he was supported by homosexuals and Jews, and funded by foreigners.</p> <p>The turnout was put at 68%, well above the 50% required for the ballot to be valid. But throughout the day the state television broadcast alarmist reports about a low turnout to mobilise the Putin vote among the electorate of 108m - voting at 90,000 polling stations across 11 time zones.</p> <p>Mr Zyuganov accused the government of widespread fraud, saying that the true Communist vote was more than 40%. \"They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to cheat citizens,\" he said.</p> <p>There were no independent reports of vote irregularities.</p> <p>Mr Yeltsin, who appointed Mr Putin prime minister last August and then transferred power to him when he resigned on New Year's Eve, stressed that the reforms would continue. \"The main thing is that the reform course must be maintained and it will be,\" said Mr Yeltsin. \"Everyone is waiting for change. There will be some changes.\"</p> <p>But Mr Putin may be chastened by a scrutiny of the results. Given that one-third of voters stayed at home, he can only claim the explicit support of one-third of voters.</p> <p>His programme is unclear, and he made minimum effort to outline any policies as acting president. He is expected to rule as a \"liberal nationalist\" - espousing free market policies and greater state regulation, and a tougher line that favours law and order over civil liberties - but to drive a hard bargain on foreign policy and relations with the west.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Russia was thrust into an uncertain era this morning when Vladimir Putin secured the sweeping powers of the presidency in a landslide election triumph, only eight months after being launched into national politics by his patron, Boris Yeltsin. It was the first time the acting president had faced the voters. With nearly 70% of the vote counted in Russia's third direct presidential election, Mr Putin had won 51.17%, just over the 50% he needed to avoid a runoff on April 16. His main challenger, the communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, was on 30.37%, and complained of widespread fraud. Mr Putin's share was expected to rise as results came in from St Petersburg and other western regions, where his support is strongest. At a press conference early this morning he acknowledged that the Communists had done well and that his government would have to take popular discontent into account. \"Our policy must be more balanced, take into account the existing realities and aim at increasing living standards,\" Mr Putin said. In a swift attempt to build a national consensus behind his new team, whose policies are unclear, he went out of his way to praise Mr Zyuganov and his other main political rivals, the former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow's mayor, Yury Luzhkov. They had all supported him over the war in Chechnya, he said, and had never taken an \"anti-state position\". At 47, Mr Putin will be the youngest person to rule Russia since Stalin succeeded Lenin as Soviet leader 76 years ago. A a former KGB career officer whose critics denounce him as a warmonger because of his brutal prosecution of the war in Chechnya, he has sold himself to Russians who yearn for a strong leader. The Moscow liberal, Grigory Yavlinsky, trailed in a poor third place, with 5.78% of the vote after Mr Putin's media acolytes smeared him in the closing days of a lacklustre campaign. Fearing that a bigger vote for Mr Yavlinsky could leave Mr Putin short of outright victory, state television claimed that he was supported by homosexuals and Jews, and funded by foreigners. The turnout was put at 68%, well above the 50% required for the ballot to be valid. But throughout the day the state television broadcast alarmist reports about a low turnout to mobilise the Putin vote among the electorate of 108m - voting at 90,000 polling stations across 11 time zones. Mr Zyuganov accused the government of widespread fraud, saying that the true Communist vote was more than 40%. \"They have set up a zone of blanket fraud to cheat citizens,\" he said. There were no independent reports of vote irregularities. Mr Yeltsin, who appointed Mr Putin prime minister last August and then transferred power to him when he resigned on New Year's Eve, stressed that the reforms would continue. \"The main thing is that the reform course must be maintained and it will be,\" said Mr Yeltsin. \"Everyone is waiting for change. There will be some changes.\" But Mr Putin may be chastened by a scrutiny of the results. Given that one-third of voters stayed at home, he can only claim the explicit support of one-third of voters. His programme is unclear, and he made minimum effort to outline any policies as acting president. He is expected to rule as a \"liberal nationalist\" - espousing free market policies and greater state regulation, and a tougher line that favours law and order over civil liberties - but to drive a hard bargain on foreign policy and relations with the west.",

Look at Tim Jackson, the ex-Financial Times and Independent foreign correspondent. He runs QXL, the online auction business.</p> <p>He is now 111th in the Sunday Times Rich List, and \"worth\" \u00a3272m. Then there's Danny Kelly, former editor of Q and NME. He's the chief executive of the 365 corporation, which provides content for websites, Wap phones and digital TV. The company's current stock market value is a somewhat piffling \u00a3550m. I ask this question only because there is a small, but nevertheless real, chance, that a small fortune might be coming my way. And the fact that I'm a journalist has a lot to do with it. Let me explain.</p> <p>In January, I was commissioned by Hodder and Stoughton to write a book, to be published in January 2001, called How To Make Your Million from the Internet (and what to do if you don't). It will be a diary of my attempts to turn \u00a350,000 into \u00a31m by using the internet to trade shares. I raised the money by mortgaging my house. Month one went well. Through a mixture of judgment, instinct and luck (and not trading every day, but going for long-term bets), I made a real cash profit of more than \u00a330,000.</p> <p>I have already received a five-figure advance for the book, and two national newspapers are inquiring about serialisation rights. Hodder tell me that several foreign publishers are interested too. But - and this is where the serious money comes in - I have started up my own website, so interested punters can track my progress. And if that works, the title of my book might - just might - become a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have an email, sent last week, from the chief executive of a stock market listed dot.com company, enquiring about buying a sizeable stake in my project.</p> <p>The thing is, my experience is illuminating to all those journalists out there (yes, you) who say: \"My God, shouldn't I be making lots of money out of all of this stuff?\" How many people like that do you know? Lots and lots, all feeling a little bit of envy about their former colleagues making lots and lots of money. Two weeks ago Martin Dunn announced that he was leaving his post as head of new media at Associated Newspapers. Now Danny Meadow Klue has said he is leaving a similar position at the Telegraph. Both are going into the start-up business.</p> <p>What's struck me is the speed, and the relative ease, with which things happen: I keep expecting someone to say \"No you can't do that mate, not possible.\" But so far, no one has. However - and I don't want to sound disingenuous here - this project is primarily about journalism, not making money. I want to see how the stockmarket and the internet work, from the sharp end. I want to see how easy it is for someone like me, a complete cyberdunce until two months ago, to make - or lose - vast amounts of money. What I've now realised is that it's journalists who are in a much better position than most to take advantage of the net. Why? Because we have the two things that the net is crying out for. Ideas and communication skills. \"As journalists, when we have a great idea, we write about it. Now, thanks to the net, we can turn it into something a lot more interesting,\" says David Thomas, a freelance writer currently raising funding for his Shobiz.com internet venture.</p> <p>\"The net is overflowing with computer wizards and moneymen, but there's a real shortage of people who can get good ideas over simply and effectively. A lot of sites out there are, quite frankly, filled with crap.\"</p> <p>The basic journalistic skills are invaluable, all the way along the line. Take writing a business plan: the key first step to securing the all-important interest of the Men with the Wallets. \"A business plan is to an internet start-up what a film script is to a movie,\" Thomas says. \"It's the first and most important thing you need to attract investment. You can still make a bad movie from a good script: but it's impossible to make a good movie from a bad script. And the same applies to business.</p> <p>\"To write a good plan you have to take an idea and develop it - tell a story in fact - which is, let's face it, what journalists do every day of the week. I've lost count of the number of venture capitalists who've told me how rare it is to see a well-written document.\"</p> <p>Crucially, journalists are also pretty good at getting publicity. Because of the incestuous nature of our business, we know plenty of other people who make it too, be they in papers, radio or television.</p> <p>The key point here is that if there's one thing a young dot.com venture needs more than anything, in a hopelessly overcrowded marketplace, it's publicity. In fact you only need the slightest whiff to get your bandwagon rolling: within minutes of a small paragraph appearing in the Media Guardian diary about my project last week, I had the BBC on the phone asking to make a documentary about me. And the Mail on Sunday, asking for an interview. Net entrepreneurs also need the ability to become expert (or at least appear to be) in several different fields at once: technical, financial and logistical. They should be able to cope with vast amounts of complex information, extract the key points, and then act on them quickly. That, of course, is what journalists do with varying degrees of success. The other thing is contacts.\"I've spent a long time in the media. I know how things work,\" says Danny Kelly. \"I knew good content providers, for example, because I'd met them through work. And because I'm a journalist, they took me seriously.\" Guardian readers will of course be familiar with the classic Marxist principle that real power stems from owning the means of production. A decade ago that was way out of reach for most of us. Now, for journalists, it's never been easier. More importantly, the net offers real excitement: even if my project goes pear-shaped and I lose a packet I'll have learned skills I never knew existed and I'll have had a great time doing it.

The trio of books - which are a month away from publication - will cast new light on the background to the child-like fable as they expose a stormy marriage between the pioneering aviator and author, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, and his Salvadorean wife, Consuelo, the model for the rose to which the little prince is devoted. The arguments threaten to overshadow this year's celebrations to mark the centenary of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's birth in Lyon. First published in 1943, a year before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry died, The Little Prince, a children's book but also seen as an account of a man's struggle to come to terms with an impossible marriage of passion, still sells a million copies a year. The three books about his wife are a biography of Consuelo, an album of previously unpublished photos and letters, and Consuelo's 300-page diary. The author's nephews and nieces - the couple had no children - are objecting to the biography, written by the Guardian's Paul Webster, because of its frank account of Consuelo's turbulent love life before and after she met Saint- Exup\u00e9ry. Meanwhile, Consuelo's family are anxious to block publication of the other two books because they doubt their authenticity.

President Mugabe said he would ignore a ruling by the Zimbabwe high court that the occupation of around 750 farms was illegal and that police should remove the squatters, most of whom support his government. His decision brought strongly worded statements of concern from the international community, with criticism from Britain, the United States, South Africa and the European Union. Mr Mugabe's increasing isolation will make it more difficult for him to get the financial assistance his country desperately needs. In an interview with CNN this weekend, Mr Mugabe unequivocally stated that he would not obey the court order. \"It would bring chaos if we attempted to implement the decision of the court,\" he said. \"I view it as merely a peaceful demonstration by the war veterans.

      "body": "<p>Warning: work can be addictive, and even if you don't like your job, you could still be hooked. It's understandable if you are appreciated, well paid and get a real buzz from seeing projects delivered on time and below budget. But frustrating, unfulfilling jobs can be just as difficult to leave. Once you have been in a role for a while, familiarity is every bit as seductive as the chance of winning a pay rise. </p> <p>It's all too easily done - what was intended to be a transient post gradually becomes familiar, work colleagues develop into friends, and before long framed photographs adorn the desk and you are following office gossip more closely than TV soaps. You may still pine for the dream job you promised you'd be doing by 30, but perhaps you now fear it may be too late. </p> <p>The most difficult thing for workers frustrated by their role is knowing where to turn for advice. You can hardly ask your boss for an honest opinion. Step forward the career psychologist. These are \"work therapists\" who claim to be able to assess your skills and attitudes, feed back on your hidden aptitudes, and recommend the next step towards that elusive fulfilling career. And increasing numbers of dissatisfied secretaries are paying up to \u00a3300 a day for the benefit of their insights. </p> <p>\"We get a lot of people coming to us saying, 'I have had so many tests done on me telling me I'm this or I should be doing that, but I still don't feel any wiser,'\" says Liz Reddish, client co-ordinator at the Tavistock clinic in London. \"We prefer to talk things through with clients trying to establish what it is that has brought them to this particular juncture. People tend to come to us when they have reached a crisis point in their relationship with work.\" </p> <p>\"About 20%-30% of our clients are people working in administrative-type roles,\" says Sophie Rowan of career management specialists Career Psychology. \"People who took a job on for six months in the hope that it would lead to something else, and three years later they are still doing it. Often, they haven't had any training, have made little or no progress and have gone without a salary review. The biggest complaint is that they feel under-challenged and unfulfilled.\" </p> <p>The company carries out assessment tests to measure a client's aptitude, personality and interests. \"It's like doing a jigsaw and finding the best compatibility of the various components of an individual,\" says Rowan. </p> <p>Psychometric testing was developed in the US a century ago to measure how well-suited soldiers were to the pressures of war. Career management specialists offer a complete day of tests filling in forms and answering questions. Information is collated and processed to provide the client with a written assessment of their aptitudes and skills. The plan is that you can present it to future employers as a measure of your abilities. </p> <p>Do not be surprised if they don't believe all they read, however. Judy James, senior associate adviser for the Industrial Society, is sceptical about career assessment tests. \"Often people need a bit of a booster and want someone to thrust them in the right direction. But it really is a bit like getting your colours done before going out to buy a whole new wardrobe. If companies want to do that kind of thing they'll prefer to carry out the tests for themselves. Handing over your own test results at application is a bit like selling your house and presenting the buyer with a survey that you've done yourself. \" </p> <p>James is more interested in the suggestion that some workers will apply for secretarial positions as \"safe options\", and fail to push their career in line with their ambitions. \"Secretarial work can be very seductive. If you are intending to go into a certain line of work and then stop to do a particular job - it's like wanting to climb a mountain to get to the top, stopping midway to admire the view, and then staying there. That's fine if you are happy, but there is the possibility that you might become miserable. Obviously there is a certain amount of regret in all of our lives but you want to try and limit it as much as possible.\" </p> <p>\"A lot of secretaries are not at all suited to their job,\" says Sheridan Hughes, a management consultant. \"Some middle-aged women became secretaries because that is what women did - become secretaries, nurses or teachers. Many return to the workplace after having a family and continue as secretaries. Younger women who come to us have slipped into secretarial jobs because they learnt typing prior to their degrees so that they could temp during the holidays or after graduating when taking a year out before making their \"real\" career choices. You rarely find the boys doing the same.\" </p> <p>The important thing to remember, she says, is that it's never too late to set yourself a fresh challenge. The recruitment market is booming at the moment, so candidates with good skills should have little difficulty finding a position that is more fulfilling and to which they are better suited. \"There's a lot to be said for not having anything to lose,\" says James. \"Often it makes you far more ambitious and adventurous.\" She even argues that sometimes being better qualified can hold you back. \"If I had good secretarial skills I would have hit a glass ceiling ages ago! I certainly wouldn't have taken risks.\" </p> <p>All agree that settling on the career that is right for you can take time. \"People who are thinking of changing jobs are quite often very negative about their experiences and abilities largely because they have been unhappy for a long time,\" says Rowan. \"Time needs to be spent identifying positive experiences and skills.\" </p> <p>Her advice is to look into all possibilities at your current workplace before jumping ship. \"Being a PA or a secretary can be a very logical stepping stone into other areas of a company such as accounts, PR or marketing. Often support staff have built up quite a strong knowledge of the firm because they have been involved in various facets of the company and are aware of the organisational structure.\" </p> <p>Those who want to think more daringly in terms of changing career should remember that recruitment agencies can be useful sources of guidance and information.\"Even if you are not on our books, our consultants are happy to talk through any career problems,\" says Rachel Johnson, regional manager of Manpower. \"If a secretary decides she wants to become a lorry driver, we could train her. Remember that work should be the creative part of a person's life - and so often it isn't.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Warning: work can be addictive, and even if you don't like your job, you could still be hooked. It's understandable if you are appreciated, well paid and get a real buzz from seeing projects delivered on time and below budget. But frustrating, unfulfilling jobs can be just as difficult to leave. Once you have been in a role for a while, familiarity is every bit as seductive as the chance of winning a pay rise. It's all too easily done - what was intended to be a transient post gradually becomes familiar, work colleagues develop into friends, and before long framed photographs adorn the desk and you are following office gossip more closely than TV soaps. You may still pine for the dream job you promised you'd be doing by 30, but perhaps you now fear it may be too late. The most difficult thing for workers frustrated by their role is knowing where to turn for advice. You can hardly ask your boss for an honest opinion. Step forward the career psychologist. These are \"work therapists\" who claim to be able to assess your skills and attitudes, feed back on your hidden aptitudes, and recommend the next step towards that elusive fulfilling career. And increasing numbers of dissatisfied secretaries are paying up to \u00a3300 a day for the benefit of their insights. \"We get a lot of people coming to us saying, 'I have had so many tests done on me telling me I'm this or I should be doing that, but I still don't feel any wiser,'\" says Liz Reddish, client co-ordinator at the Tavistock clinic in London. \"We prefer to talk things through with clients trying to establish what it is that has brought them to this particular juncture. People tend to come to us when they have reached a crisis point in their relationship with work.\" \"About 20%-30% of our clients are people working in administrative-type roles,\" says Sophie Rowan of career management specialists Career Psychology. \"People who took a job on for six months in the hope that it would lead to something else, and three years later they are still doing it. Often, they haven't had any training, have made little or no progress and have gone without a salary review. The biggest complaint is that they feel under-challenged and unfulfilled.\" The company carries out assessment tests to measure a client's aptitude, personality and interests. \"It's like doing a jigsaw and finding the best compatibility of the various components of an individual,\" says Rowan. Psychometric testing was developed in the US a century ago to measure how well-suited soldiers were to the pressures of war. Career management specialists offer a complete day of tests filling in forms and answering questions. Information is collated and processed to provide the client with a written assessment of their aptitudes and skills. The plan is that you can present it to future employers as a measure of your abilities. Do not be surprised if they don't believe all they read, however. Judy James, senior associate adviser for the Industrial Society, is sceptical about career assessment tests. \"Often people need a bit of a booster and want someone to thrust them in the right direction. But it really is a bit like getting your colours done before going out to buy a whole new wardrobe. If companies want to do that kind of thing they'll prefer to carry out the tests for themselves. Handing over your own test results at application is a bit like selling your house and presenting the buyer with a survey that you've done yourself. \" James is more interested in the suggestion that some workers will apply for secretarial positions as \"safe options\", and fail to push their career in line with their ambitions. \"Secretarial work can be very seductive. If you are intending to go into a certain line of work and then stop to do a particular job - it's like wanting to climb a mountain to get to the top, stopping midway to admire the view, and then staying there. That's fine if you are happy, but there is the possibility that you might become miserable. Obviously there is a certain amount of regret in all of our lives but you want to try and limit it as much as possible.\" \"A lot of secretaries are not at all suited to their job,\" says Sheridan Hughes, a management consultant. \"Some middle-aged women became secretaries because that is what women did - become secretaries, nurses or teachers. Many return to the workplace after having a family and continue as secretaries. Younger women who come to us have slipped into secretarial jobs because they learnt typing prior to their degrees so that they could temp during the holidays or after graduating when taking a year out before making their \"real\" career choices. You rarely find the boys doing the same.\" The important thing to remember, she says, is that it's never too late to set yourself a fresh challenge. The recruitment market is booming at the moment, so candidates with good skills should have little difficulty finding a position that is more fulfilling and to which they are better suited. \"There's a lot to be said for not having anything to lose,\" says James. \"Often it makes you far more ambitious and adventurous.\" She even argues that sometimes being better qualified can hold you back. \"If I had good secretarial skills I would have hit a glass ceiling ages ago! I certainly wouldn't have taken risks.\" All agree that settling on the career that is right for you can take time. \"People who are thinking of changing jobs are quite often very negative about their experiences and abilities largely because they have been unhappy for a long time,\" says Rowan. \"Time needs to be spent identifying positive experiences and skills.\" Her advice is to look into all possibilities at your current workplace before jumping ship. \"Being a PA or a secretary can be a very logical stepping stone into other areas of a company such as accounts, PR or marketing. Often support staff have built up quite a strong knowledge of the firm because they have been involved in various facets of the company and are aware of the organisational structure.\" Those who want to think more daringly in terms of changing career should remember that recruitment agencies can be useful sources of guidance and information.\"Even if you are not on our books, our consultants are happy to talk through any career problems,\" says Rachel Johnson, regional manager of Manpower. \"If a secretary decides she wants to become a lorry driver, we could train her. Remember that work should be the creative part of a person's life - and so often it isn't.\"",

      "body": "<p>Few people dread anything as much as a job interview. For most of us the hour of nerve-wracking tension is mercifully rare; but for Angela Visagie, recruitment officer for property consultants Jones Lang LaSalle, it's a regular occurrence. \"I conduct the first interviews for support staff,\" she says. \"We liaise with the department to get an accurate job description and forward that to the agency. I then choose candidates from the CVs they send over.\" </p> <p>Visagie believes that interviewing is a skill that has to be learnt. \"Obviously you do gain a first impression of every candidate, but it's important not to let that affect you too much. The most important thing is to get a picture of each person's competency to do the particular job - and that includes the skills they have, their past experience and personality.\" </p> <p>Getting the candidate to relax and feel at ease is one of the most important aspects of interviewing. \"There is a fine balance between conducting the interview on a personal level, so that the interviewee feels that you are really interested in them as an individual, and keeping it professional. Its not only the candidate who's under scrutiny; demand for good support staff currently outstrips supply, so you need to give the most positive image of your company to encourage them to want to work for it.\" </p> <p>Interviews at Jones Lang LaSalle are a mix of personal interview and tests, and Visagie believes it is important to make clear the form the interview will take. \"A lot of people are nervous in an interview because they worry that something unexpected will be asked of them.

      "bodyText": "Few people dread anything as much as a job interview. For most of us the hour of nerve-wracking tension is mercifully rare; but for Angela Visagie, recruitment officer for property consultants Jones Lang LaSalle, it's a regular occurrence. \"I conduct the first interviews for support staff,\" she says. \"We liaise with the department to get an accurate job description and forward that to the agency. I then choose candidates from the CVs they send over.\" Visagie believes that interviewing is a skill that has to be learnt. \"Obviously you do gain a first impression of every candidate, but it's important not to let that affect you too much. The most important thing is to get a picture of each person's competency to do the particular job - and that includes the skills they have, their past experience and personality.\" Getting the candidate to relax and feel at ease is one of the most important aspects of interviewing. \"There is a fine balance between conducting the interview on a personal level, so that the interviewee feels that you are really interested in them as an individual, and keeping it professional. Its not only the candidate who's under scrutiny; demand for good support staff currently outstrips supply, so you need to give the most positive image of your company to encourage them to want to work for it.\" Interviews at Jones Lang LaSalle are a mix of personal interview and tests, and Visagie believes it is important to make clear the form the interview will take. \"A lot of people are nervous in an interview because they worry that something unexpected will be asked of them. I always start the interview with a fairly relaxed conversation explaining the whole procedure - what tests there will be and how long it will all take.\" Visagie also tries to gain more insight into each candidate by asking about their lives outside work. \"It's always worth asking about hobbies or interests as people often relax more when talking about non-work topics,\" she says. \"Success in this job depends on matching the right candidate to the right department and to do so you need a good idea of their personality as well as their abilities.\" \"A lot of it is about doing the proper research.

The news of the military setback on the morning of the presidential election threatened to embarrass the favourite, Vladimir Putin, whose popularity is founded on his ruthless and largely successful campaign to crush the Chechen rebels - and the claims were swiftly denied by Kremlin officials. Despite beefed-up security across the region, early reports suggested that Russia's army had been surprised by a group of 2,000 rebels who seized the centre of Nozhai-Yurt, 35 miles from the Chechen capital, Grozny, which has been under Russian control since January. \"An operation to encircle the rebels is underway,\" the regional military headquarters told a Russian news agency yesterday morning, adding that a large division of Russian soldiers had been dispatched to the area. Later, however, the defence ministry in Moscow and the Kremlin's spokesman for Chechnya denied the report as rebel propaganda. The government spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhemsky, insisted that Nozhai-Yurt remained in Russian hands. A rebel victory in Nozhai-Yurt would have represented a badly-timed humiliation for the Russian military, which claims to have established a firm hold in the region apart from a few small villages in the southern mountains. As he cast his vote yesterday, Mr Putin, who is acting president, said there was no firm information about the situation in Nozhai-Yurt, but insisted that the campaign in general was \"going to plan\". Senior Kremlin officials had expected to have the Chechen campaign wrapped up before the presidential vote, but the relatively fast conquest of the northern plains has stalled in the foothills of the mountains. Military officials have made a great show of preparing for the election to show life returning to normal in the Russian-occupied areas of Chechnya. Nightly news bulletins have shown polling stations being set up in villages recently seized from the rebels. A group of foreign journalists was taken into Chechnya yesterday to witness civilians turning out to vote amid the shattered remains of Grozny.

Having exploited Chechnya as his vehicle to power, he may now turn to the search for an exit strategy and the quest for a political settlement.</p> <p>But although Chechnya is the most pressing issue in his in-tray this morning, Mr Putin must also confront a formidable array of problems, dealing with the fall-out from a decade of post-communist upheaval.</p> <p>\"Law enforcement and relations between Russia's regions and the centre are the key problems,\" says Vladimir Mau, a leading economist and a Putin associate working on a 10-year development plan. Publication of the programme has been delayed until after yesterday's election. It is expected to be unveiled in May.</p> <p>Mr Mau forecasts that the first two years of the new regime will avoid radical structural reforms on the economy and that President Putin will focus on consolidating his power.</p> <p>\"It will be a period of low investment and vulnerability for the Russian economy.\"</p> <p>Mr Putin looks likely to try to increase the huge powers enjoyed by Russian presidents. He has floated the suggestion that the presidential term should be extended from four to seven years and that the powerful governors of Russia's regions should be presidential appointments rather than being elected by the people.</p> <p>The new president, a former KGB officer, says he will draw on his secret police friends to combat all-pervasive corruption and will upgrade police powers. But any anti-corruption drive will lack public credibility unless at the same time he tackles the \"oligarchs\", the tycoons who have made fortunes through asset stripping.</p> <p>These oligarchs, embodied by the oil and media magnate Boris Berezovsky, also wield enormous political clout and Mr Putin owes his rise through the ranks to them. Will he now bite the hand that fed him? Has he the authority and the courage to tackle them?</p> <p>\"Putin really understands the problems facing Russia. He's going to do what needs to be done without the help of the financial oligarchs, make it possible for every citizen to live decently, not just the oligarchs,\" says Vladimir Litvinenko, a St Petersburg friend of the president and head of the city's mining institute.</p> <p>But Mr Berezovsky is sanguine. \"The role of the oligarchs will increase. They'll play an even greater role,\" he said. \"I know what Putin doesn't want. I don't know what he wants ... I don't know whether he's a strategist or not.\"</p> <p>Mr Berezovsky snorts that \"there is not a single new idea\" in the plans being drawn up by Mr Mau and others.</p> <p>Moscow is buzzing with rumours that Mr Putin may move swiftly to streamline government. Unlike Mr Yeltsin, he has the vigour for such a purge and can rely on a much more compliant parliament to support him.</p> <p>\"President Putin will be a democrat to the degree that it is necessary,\" predicts Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a newspaper which supports Mr Putin.</p>",

He projects tough-minded resolve, but is also extremely calculating and cautious. In his three months as acting president, his only policy has been to prosecute ruthlessly his war in the Caucasus. Having exploited Chechnya as his vehicle to power, he may now turn to the search for an exit strategy and the quest for a political settlement. But although Chechnya is the most pressing issue in his in-tray this morning, Mr Putin must also confront a formidable array of problems, dealing with the fall-out from a decade of post-communist upheaval. \"Law enforcement and relations between Russia's regions and the centre are the key problems,\" says Vladimir Mau, a leading economist and a Putin associate working on a 10-year development plan. Publication of the programme has been delayed until after yesterday's election. It is expected to be unveiled in May. Mr Mau forecasts that the first two years of the new regime will avoid radical structural reforms on the economy and that President Putin will focus on consolidating his power. \"It will be a period of low investment and vulnerability for the Russian economy.\" Mr Putin looks likely to try to increase the huge powers enjoyed by Russian presidents. He has floated the suggestion that the presidential term should be extended from four to seven years and that the powerful governors of Russia's regions should be presidential appointments rather than being elected by the people. The new president, a former KGB officer, says he will draw on his secret police friends to combat all-pervasive corruption and will upgrade police powers. But any anti-corruption drive will lack public credibility unless at the same time he tackles the \"oligarchs\", the tycoons who have made fortunes through asset stripping. These oligarchs, embodied by the oil and media magnate Boris Berezovsky, also wield enormous political clout and Mr Putin owes his rise through the ranks to them. Will he now bite the hand that fed him? Has he the authority and the courage to tackle them? \"Putin really understands the problems facing Russia. He's going to do what needs to be done without the help of the financial oligarchs, make it possible for every citizen to live decently, not just the oligarchs,\" says Vladimir Litvinenko, a St Petersburg friend of the president and head of the city's mining institute. But Mr Berezovsky is sanguine. \"The role of the oligarchs will increase. They'll play an even greater role,\" he said. \"I know what Putin doesn't want. I don't know what he wants ... I don't know whether he's a strategist or not.\" Mr Berezovsky snorts that \"there is not a single new idea\" in the plans being drawn up by Mr Mau and others. Moscow is buzzing with rumours that Mr Putin may move swiftly to streamline government. Unlike Mr Yeltsin, he has the vigour for such a purge and can rely on a much more compliant parliament to support him. \"President Putin will be a democrat to the degree that it is necessary,\" predicts Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a newspaper which supports Mr Putin.",

      "bodyText": "Peter Kilfoyle will reignite the debate about the north-south divide today in his resignation speech in the Commons, two months after quitting as defence minister, when he claims that Gordon Brown's Budget has not done enough to help the Labour heartlands. Doug Henderson, who was sacked from the Ministry of Defence a year ago, joined him yesterday and said the prime minister did Labour's cause no good by going north and claiming there was no north-south divide. Mr Henderson, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne North, has been in close touch with Mr Kilfoyle since the Liverpool Walton MP resigned. In a sign that middle ranking ministers are acutely aware of the scale of feeling over the regions, the industry minister Dick Caborn told a weekend meeting: \"A lot of people do feel they are losing out and that in terms of influencing policy and decentralising powers the English regions have missed the boat ... that they are, in a nutshell, getting short-changed by London and the Whitehall machine and outplayed by the Scots and the Welsh.\" He believes Britain is no longer a level economic playing field because the new devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales have stronger powers to intervene and help businesses, while enjoying a much higher level of public spending. Mr Henderson called on the Treasury to offer differential regional tax breaks to the north-east and the west, especially on capital gains tax and venture capital. He also urged the government to move more civil servants to the north. He added: \"The north knows there is a north-south divide. The south knows there is a north-south divide. There is no sense the government insisting it does not exist. \"Of course, there are pockets of wealth in the north. There have always been pockets of wealth in the north.

He pointed out that only 0.5% of new starts in hi-tech ventures came from the north, even though 4% of the population lived in the region. Jeremy Beecham, the leader of the Local Government Association and a former leader of Newcastle city council, also backed Mr Kilfoyle's call for more help for the north. In a separate attack a third former minister, Frank Field, claimed the government's welfare reforms were leading to further social exclusion. Appointed welfare minister immediately after the election, Mr Field was sacked in 1998 amid claims that his plans were too costly or too vague. In a preface to a collection of essays, he claimed the Budget had extended the number of families subject to means testing. He wrote: \"Welfare changes, masquerading as reform, have undermined the principle of work, mocked the idea of saving, and weighted public policy against people who tell the truth. Far from all welfare reform measures adding to social inclusion, a growing number have become an ever more powerful agent of exclusion.\"",

Britain will still be there no matter how long it takes, he smiles. He possesses a tracksuit, Western Union money orders from a friend in London and a belief that Britain will shelter him.</p> <p>Five years ago Saddam Hussein's police arrested his father and brother in their photocopying shop in Kirkuk, northern Iraq, on suspicion of printing rebel Kurdish pamphlets. Two years ago they were hanged.</p> <p><b> Death threat</b><br></p> <p>Two months ago Azad tried to reopen the shop and was told he was next. It was time to leave. Kissing his mother and two younger sisters farewell, he joined the refugee trail to northern Europe.</p> <p>Azad started his journey by contacting a local smuggler. For $1,000 (\u00a3630) he was driven with three others from northern Iraq over the mountains into south-eastern Turkey and taken to Istanbul.</p> <p>It is here that Albanian and Turkish gangs gather their human cargo from all over the Middle East. Some send recruiters into Iraq offering package deals. Typically, refugees are bundled into groups of 30 and told to choose a representative to liaise with the lone guide who will accompany them on foot across Greece's eastern rugged, open frontier.</p> <p>For this stage of the journey the price for each person is a lump sum of $850 or $100 a day. The groups walk by night, sleep rough by day and, if they do not have their own provisions, are given bread and water. When it snowed in January a Romanian woman and a Ukrainian woman died of exposure and 20 others suffered frostbite.</p> <p>\"Add two days to the trip and I make another $6,000,\" grins one Albanian smuggler in Patras. For an extra $500 some Kurds travel by truck or ship but the risk of interception is greater.</p> <p>At Salonika Azad's group was shuttled by car to Athens and given train tickets to Patras, where they joined 130 other Kurds. And here in Norman Square they have been waiting six days to board a lorry that will take a ferry to Ancona, half-way up Italy's east coast.</p> <p>Their Albanian contacts have not explained the delay, but the reason is to be found in Brussels, where tomorrow the cash-strapped Albanian government will pitch for more than $1bn in aid at a two-day funding conference.</p> <p>The EU has been blunt. Money will flow only if Tirana chokes illegal trafficking. Corrupt politicians and police have helped gangs funnel a stream of humanity to the southern port of Vlore, where at night 20 inflatables used to ferry more than 30 people each to Italian beaches.</p> <p>Gangs roved unmolested, kidnapping honest police officers and machine-gunning Italian coastguard patrols. Nightly revenue of up to \u00a3400,000 funded corruption. \"They could have closed us down any time,\" says Ilyr, a retired smuggler. Now they have. In the past month nine dinghies have been seized, the police chief of Tirana airport has been arrested for alleged smuggling and five air companies have been put under investigation.</p> <p>The two officers at a police checkpoint by a bullet-holed signpost for Vlore are incredulous. \"We've been told to stop the immigrants.\" Up to 20 families in Vlore who used to rent their houses to Kurds while they waited to move on are feeling the pinch. The beachfront bars are full of unemployed mechanics and drivers. They say only one clan continues to operate, sending a lone boat once a week.</p> <p>\"The question,\" says one diplomat, \"is how long after Brussels will it stay like this?\"</p> <p><b> Backlog</b><br></p> <p>Two hundred miles south of Vlore, in Patras, two smugglers, sunning themselves on the beachfront, ask the same question. They say it took their bosses less than a day to select the Greek port as an alternative.</p> <p>Word went out to their contacts in Italy, Turkey, Iraq and north Africa and within three days the package deals were adjusted. But the immigrants are not getting through quickly and a backlog is building, so the hunt is on for more lorry drivers.</p> <p>The nightly landings on the beaches around the Italian port of Bari have ended, to the dismay of the pool of fixers, drivers and informers who smoothed the next stage of the journey. That business has moved north to Ancona.</p> <p>Michele Emiliano, Bari's top anti-mafia magistrate, shrugs. In addition to geography, Italy's entry into the Schengen free-movement agreement made it an irresistible port of call. \"What do you expect? These guys are versatile. If you close one door they open another. It's economics. People will always get through.\"</p> <p>The new route from Ancona will use the rail network to take immigrants and asylum seekers north to Milan and Turin, where they will be met at the station or directed to a safe houses for the day or two it takes to assemble groups that want to go the same countries.</p> <p>By 10pm the waters off Patras are black. The ferries have become bobbing lights. Some of the Kurds in Norman Square kick a ball around to keep warm. Those huddled around the fire speak in low voices of the journey ahead and their new lives.</p> <p>Karzan Ahmed, 20, studied agriculture before fleeing Iraq. \"I didn't want to join the army and they threatened to cut off my ears. It's what they do to those who refuse.\" He plans to join a friend in Germany. When a group of 40 is asked how many want to go to Britain, less than a quarter raise their hands. Germany and Sweden are much preferred.</p> <p>Azad is heading for London because his friend there has a job in a hotel. \"Britain is a good place for us. Safe. We can work.\" His truck from Turin is to take him to Calais, where an Albanian contact will put him into another bound for Britain.</p> <p>The closure of Albania was a shock to the smugglers but their customers have barely noticed. The price was unaffected.</p> <p>But from April 3 there will be another shock. Britain is to impose a fixed \u00a32,000 fine on lorry drivers for each asylum seeker and illegal immigrant found in their vehicles. Every cord, strap, lock and seal must be checked under the new law.</p> <p>The risk of detection is not high.

      "bodyText": "Another sundown at Patras port and still the Albanian smugglers have not returned, so the 150 Iraqi Kurds in Norman Square light a fire, slide cardboard beneath their sleeping bags and watch the lorries disappearing into ferries, wondering when it will be their turn. Six nights of waiting at this Greek port is draining their money but the usual route to Italy has just been closed and the smugglers need time to open a new one. Azad Abdullah Ali, 23, is patient. Britain will still be there no matter how long it takes, he smiles. He possesses a tracksuit, Western Union money orders from a friend in London and a belief that Britain will shelter him. Five years ago Saddam Hussein's police arrested his father and brother in their photocopying shop in Kirkuk, northern Iraq, on suspicion of printing rebel Kurdish pamphlets. Two years ago they were hanged. Death threat Two months ago Azad tried to reopen the shop and was told he was next. It was time to leave. Kissing his mother and two younger sisters farewell, he joined the refugee trail to northern Europe. Azad started his journey by contacting a local smuggler. For $1,000 (\u00a3630) he was driven with three others from northern Iraq over the mountains into south-eastern Turkey and taken to Istanbul. It is here that Albanian and Turkish gangs gather their human cargo from all over the Middle East. Some send recruiters into Iraq offering package deals. Typically, refugees are bundled into groups of 30 and told to choose a representative to liaise with the lone guide who will accompany them on foot across Greece's eastern rugged, open frontier. For this stage of the journey the price for each person is a lump sum of $850 or $100 a day. The groups walk by night, sleep rough by day and, if they do not have their own provisions, are given bread and water. When it snowed in January a Romanian woman and a Ukrainian woman died of exposure and 20 others suffered frostbite. \"Add two days to the trip and I make another $6,000,\" grins one Albanian smuggler in Patras. For an extra $500 some Kurds travel by truck or ship but the risk of interception is greater. At Salonika Azad's group was shuttled by car to Athens and given train tickets to Patras, where they joined 130 other Kurds. And here in Norman Square they have been waiting six days to board a lorry that will take a ferry to Ancona, half-way up Italy's east coast. Their Albanian contacts have not explained the delay, but the reason is to be found in Brussels, where tomorrow the cash-strapped Albanian government will pitch for more than $1bn in aid at a two-day funding conference. The EU has been blunt. Money will flow only if Tirana chokes illegal trafficking. Corrupt politicians and police have helped gangs funnel a stream of humanity to the southern port of Vlore, where at night 20 inflatables used to ferry more than 30 people each to Italian beaches. Gangs roved unmolested, kidnapping honest police officers and machine-gunning Italian coastguard patrols. Nightly revenue of up to \u00a3400,000 funded corruption. \"They could have closed us down any time,\" says Ilyr, a retired smuggler. Now they have. In the past month nine dinghies have been seized, the police chief of Tirana airport has been arrested for alleged smuggling and five air companies have been put under investigation. The two officers at a police checkpoint by a bullet-holed signpost for Vlore are incredulous. \"We've been told to stop the immigrants.\" Up to 20 families in Vlore who used to rent their houses to Kurds while they waited to move on are feeling the pinch. The beachfront bars are full of unemployed mechanics and drivers. They say only one clan continues to operate, sending a lone boat once a week. \"The question,\" says one diplomat, \"is how long after Brussels will it stay like this?\" Backlog Two hundred miles south of Vlore, in Patras, two smugglers, sunning themselves on the beachfront, ask the same question. They say it took their bosses less than a day to select the Greek port as an alternative. Word went out to their contacts in Italy, Turkey, Iraq and north Africa and within three days the package deals were adjusted. But the immigrants are not getting through quickly and a backlog is building, so the hunt is on for more lorry drivers. The nightly landings on the beaches around the Italian port of Bari have ended, to the dismay of the pool of fixers, drivers and informers who smoothed the next stage of the journey. That business has moved north to Ancona. Michele Emiliano, Bari's top anti-mafia magistrate, shrugs. In addition to geography, Italy's entry into the Schengen free-movement agreement made it an irresistible port of call. \"What do you expect? These guys are versatile. If you close one door they open another. It's economics. People will always get through.\" The new route from Ancona will use the rail network to take immigrants and asylum seekers north to Milan and Turin, where they will be met at the station or directed to a safe houses for the day or two it takes to assemble groups that want to go the same countries. By 10pm the waters off Patras are black. The ferries have become bobbing lights. Some of the Kurds in Norman Square kick a ball around to keep warm. Those huddled around the fire speak in low voices of the journey ahead and their new lives. Karzan Ahmed, 20, studied agriculture before fleeing Iraq. \"I didn't want to join the army and they threatened to cut off my ears. It's what they do to those who refuse.\" He plans to join a friend in Germany. When a group of 40 is asked how many want to go to Britain, less than a quarter raise their hands. Germany and Sweden are much preferred. Azad is heading for London because his friend there has a job in a hotel. \"Britain is a good place for us. Safe. We can work.\" His truck from Turin is to take him to Calais, where an Albanian contact will put him into another bound for Britain. The closure of Albania was a shock to the smugglers but their customers have barely noticed. The price was unaffected. But from April 3 there will be another shock. Britain is to impose a fixed \u00a32,000 fine on lorry drivers for each asylum seeker and illegal immigrant found in their vehicles. Every cord, strap, lock and seal must be checked under the new law. The risk of detection is not high. Trucks carrying fresh flowers, meat and pet food are favoured because they confuse sniffer dogs. Four lorries cross the channel every minute and it takes 30 minutes for customs to check one. Price rise But the law's effect is likely to be immediate. According to Albanian and Italian officials and the smugglers, the price for crossing the channel will soar. \"The smugglers may try to threaten some drivers, improve false passports or try to land on remote beaches, but the rise in price will be the main result,\" Mr Emiliano says. Grammoz Pashko, a leading Albanian politician, says legitimate asylum seekers will be squeezed out: \"Only criminals could afford to pay such a price.\" Azad reacts in disbelief. He starts to stammer. \"If it happens before I get there, I'll never get in. I wanted to go to Britain because I thought I would be welcome.\"",

He brings his own gurus from Henley college with him. He wants to cut spending on bureaucracy from 25% of revenue to 15%. Hundreds - maybe thousands - of managers will go, the layers of Birtism and its simulated internal market dismembered. Smaller teams, swifter decisions, more creative juices. The aim, it is said, will be \"stonking good programmes\"; nothing else matters. </p> <p>Well, fine: but that - from one step back - only etches the curiosity of this transition in clearer relief. John Birt ruled the BBC for eight tumultuous years - and not all the panegyrics that went with his leaving champagne were hollow. He did a good deal that was, politically, difficult but necessary: at great public cost, with great public effort. And now, apparently, much of it will be dismembered, at further great cost in redundancy pay-offs. </p> <p>Why? The rejoicings in the newsroom, perhaps, supply one answer - and yet there's a gigantic hole where more rational reasonings ought to be.

John Birt, who'd never run anything bigger than programmes at London Weekend, was required to turn himself into the super-manager of 23,000 distrait souls and sometimes drowned in McKinsey-speak; Greg Dyke, fresh from the thrusting Pearson empire, knows what he doesn't like (long memos and endless committees). The BBC habitually imports its supreme leaders from the private sec tor and tailors its public operations to fit whoever the choice may be. After Greg, in four or eight years, there'll doubtless be further revolution. It would be surprising, looking down the long and random tunnel from Milne to Checkland to Birt to Dyke, if there were not. </p> <p>Yet see how bizarrely other sectors of public life echo these oscillations. What, for instance, was I supposed to think about the health service in those scary, fluey days after Christmas? That its doctors and nurses were coping magnificently. That we all owed them a debt of gratitude. That they were heroes and heroines. The politicians, from Milburn to Blair, told us so. When the prime minister submitted himself to another of those long Newsnights of the soul, facing assorted angels of mercy, he uttered not a single word of criticism. Unlike (say) teachers, they were terrific, every one. Sir Christopher Bland couldn't have put it better. </p> <p>But now it's the fag-end of ides-ridden March, and the song is different. We know that some hospitals manage without long trolley waits, while others have them on a regular basis; that some patients can see their GP in 24 hours, while others have to wait four or five days; that some health authorities perform four times more hip replacements than others. We know this, and many similar horrors of discrepancy, because the prime minister tells us so. </p> <p>We know that the NHS cost of a lung transplant can vary between \u00a32,448 and \u00a331,430; that the cost of replacing a knee can be \u00a3489 or \u00a311,922, because Whitehall tells us so. We know that the sector is riddled with discrepancies and restrictive practices (many of them protected by the same saintly medics who filled our TV screens in January). A bed at Leicester royal infirmary costs \u00a37,300 a year less than a bed at Leicester general just down the road. </p> <p>Enter the hit teams and the elite squads of experts and the grand committees of plans to come, chaired by the selfsame T. Blair. It is all a bit sudden. Over-arching pundits, like Polly Toynbee, may have recognised the shambles for years - but they never got a word of it into the speeches of Dobbo or Milburn.

That's administrative life, whether in Wood Lane or Leicester general. The question for Greg, relentlessly put, is whether it's possible to run a massive public-service broadcaster in the modern age. The question for Blair and Brown, put even more apocalyptically, is whether a National Health Service is a beast that can be tamed. </p> <p>Don't hold your breath.

But this is not an area where it is easy to set common standards, like you can with plugs or microwaves.\" Last October's Tampere summit in Finland, the first devoted to tackling these questions, established a first rough draft of the way ahead. Since then EU officials have been looking at cooperation on burden-sharing, repatriation and a database and fingerprinting system. Some of these measures worry civil liberties groups. Support is broadest for plans focused on specific countries of origin - Somalia, Iraq, Morocco, Albania, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan - so that immigration policies can be integrated with development aid to tackle poverty and the causes of instability. Yet, as on any other EU issue, approaches differ. Smaller countries see greater benefit in working together than bigger ones. But Fortress Europe will not work. Portugal, current holder of the EU's rotating presidency, argues that plummeting birth rates and ageing populations mean that the union urgently needs a strategy for legal immigration. Romano Prodi, the European commission president, led calls at last week's Lisbon summit for measures to bridge the rapidly growing gap between information technology needs and trained workers. Germany is already inviting in non-EU foreigners to help fill the ranks. According to a new UN report, Mr Prodi's native Italy would need to raise the working-age limit to 77 if it did not accept the 2.2m migrants a year needed to maintain the ratio of four working people for every retiree - vital for pension provision. Still, though, there is unease about coordination. Britain will not opt into the Schengen system, under which EU citizens can cross borders without passport checks. Belgium temporarily suspended its partic ipation in January to cope with an influx of unregistered foreigners. \"Basically,\" says Graham Watson, the Liberal Democrat chairman of the European parliament's justice and home affairs committee, \"governments have not decided how much they want to do at EU level and how well they can make it work.\" What is clear is that huge problems lie ahead as the EU takes in former Communist countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania, all accused of discrimination against the same Gypsies who end up begging on the London underground. Supporters of enlargement insist that EU aid to candidate countries is designed in part to ensure that there is no mass migration, and point out that scare stories about an Iberian influx never materialised when Spain and Portugal joined. But not everyone is convinced. \"We are talking about an enormous expansion of Europe and its borders and not enough thought has gone into it,\" warns Timothy Kirkhope, a Tory MEP and former immigration minister. \"Too many politicians steer clear of the subject for fear that they'll be accused of being racist - or of failing to stop foreigners coming in. But Europe needs a policy, or we could end up with a disaster.\" The displaced \u0095 Of the 4.2m refugees for which UNHCR offices reported gender and age, 50.9% were female \u0095 Of the 2.2m refugee population of Africa, 16.3% are below the age of five \u0095 Up to 400,000 people are smuggled into EU every year \u0095 The EU may contain as many as one million displaced people - the largest number since the second world war \u0095 Europe is the only region where most urban refugees are female \u0095 Typically, a refugee camp population is made up of families. Refugees in urban areas are more often adult males",

      "bodyText": "You report that Tony Blair has not yet made up his mind (Will this woman's husband take paternity leave? March 24). Tony might consider a compromise and take half his paternity leave entitlement. And in true team spirit, delegate the job of running the country to Gordon, Robin, Peter, Jack and John. To avoid getting out of touch, he could take the opportunity to brush up his IT skills and be available for a little bit of on-call work. But only if essential, ie anyone seriously disagreeing with anyone else. The on-call time should be restricted to 5-7pm, so he could have had lunch and a nap after changing nappies all night. Ali should ensure a few shots of the new baby we would all want to know about - and maybe an occasional comment, just so it is not forgotten who is the elected prime minister. Sylvia Armour London \u0095 What a set of antediluvian attitudes (Bonding with Baby - do men want or need time off, G2, March 22). We have everything from the bolshie Mr Humphrys, who apparently has no sense of connection at all with this soon-to-be born child of his, through to the \"work comes first\" e-company man. Too right we'll never catch up with Scandanavia in this, as in so many sensible social policies which affect children. The high-powered male Brit has not the remotest idea of what the benefits to him might be in being a little more present for \"his\" new arrival. (It seems pointless to dwell on the possible benefits to the mother and the baby.) What a strange world we live in when high-flying middle-class couples wait for years to have a child, prepare to lavish untold sums on its care and education but where the father can't spare even a measly week to be around, to marvel at this extraordinary unique being. It beats me why some people have kids at all. Rosemary Milne Glasgow \u0095 Mary Kenny tells us (Grow up Cherie, March 23) that men will never do the same amount of housework and childcare as women because their brains are not programmed for domestic detail. Common sense often tells us to disregard our biological conditioning: a man's natural instinct is to jump on every woman in sight and impregnate her; luckily, most have learned that to do so is to risk uncomfortable consequences. Men may not be naturally inclined to care for their children or do housework, but they may face uncomfortable consequences if they don't, not least the collapse of an unfairly overstressed wife, with a consequent domino effect on the children. One in five British children has a stress-related health problem. It is in the interest of all families that our prime minister sets an example of a modern father who accepts his family responsibilities. Shirley Conran Chair, Mothers in Management \u0095 On December 15 employees became entitled to parental leave. But is the prime minister an employee? As the only prime minister of the country, Tony Blair is surely an exception. His decision should not be taken as making any political statement for the rest of the country. Quader Mahmud London \u0095 The short history of this government shows that without Mr Blair at the helm there is usually a mini-crisis, as occurred in the first two summers when he decamped to the continent with his family. Certainly, Cherie, he is the father of your children and has a personal responsibility to see them into this world and to play his full paternal part as they mature.

They approved it; if they hadn't, the deal might not have gone through. I do hope that this procedure has set a precedent. This was, admittedly, a special appeal under the Education Act, but why shouldn't the principle be extended?</p> <p>There's a strong argument for following every trial or appeal with a courtroom debate to see if the parties liked the suggested result. I see a typical scenario. \"No, I really think the 10 years the judge intends to impose is well out of order for my robbery,\" the villain proposes; \"I think it's about right,\" his old mother chips in. \"Remember, you've got two previous.\" \"Besides,\" his criminal associate adds, \"you showed no remorse.\" \"Yeah, I'd forgotten that. OK, maybe 10 years is fair. Let's tell the judge we agree with his sentence.\"</p> <p>I'm sure that such apr\u00e8s-trial debates would take a lot of bitterness out of our justice system.

      "bodyText": "After the deal negotiated last week which ended Summerhill School's appeal against the education secretary's attempt to take action against it - he seemed to be unhappy about nude pupils not attending classes - Court 40 of the Royal Courts of Justice was taken over by the students (fully clothed on this special occasion) for a lively discussion about their attitude to the settlement. The 15-year-old girl who chaired the meeting did so from the judges' bench. They approved it; if they hadn't, the deal might not have gone through. I do hope that this procedure has set a precedent. This was, admittedly, a special appeal under the Education Act, but why shouldn't the principle be extended? There's a strong argument for following every trial or appeal with a courtroom debate to see if the parties liked the suggested result. I see a typical scenario. \"No, I really think the 10 years the judge intends to impose is well out of order for my robbery,\" the villain proposes; \"I think it's about right,\" his old mother chips in. \"Remember, you've got two previous.\" \"Besides,\" his criminal associate adds, \"you showed no remorse.\" \"Yeah, I'd forgotten that. OK, maybe 10 years is fair. Let's tell the judge we agree with his sentence.\" I'm sure that such apr\u00e8s-trial debates would take a lot of bitterness out of our justice system. If Mr Hamilton and Mr Fayed had adopted the Summerhill School approach, they would be best friends by now; and General Pinochet would happily have taken a plane to Spain. Strangely, Messrs Hamilton and Fayed were absent from a party for the launch of David Hooper's jolly new book on the sensational libel cases of recent years (Reputations under Fire, published by Little, Brown). We had to make do with listening to a hilarious tape of the two men in acrimonious combat when Hamilton phoned in to a radio phone-in guested by Fayed. Other absentees included Jonathan Aitken, Robert Maxwell and Gillian Taylforth, who also feature heavily in Hooper's book. We were not, alas, treated to a tape of anyone paying a bill at the Ritz, falling in the sea, or helping a boyfriend out of his pancreatic pain in a four-wheel drive on a lay-by off the A1. Hooper's book is full of splendid behind-the-scenes anecdotes, especially about Maxwell's promiscuous use of the libel laws. When he died, more than 100 libel suits - for and against - died with him.

To test the burgeoning number of legal websites, we recruited a panel of four, each of whom had a legal problem.</p> <p>Philip had tripped on an uncovered gully in a shop, breaking his elbow and wrist and suffering months of pain; the shop had offered \u00a3800 in compensation and he wanted to know if this was reasonable.</p> <p>Susan lets out a flat to tenants who have been playing loud music at all times of night and day, and breaching other terms of the tenancy agreement. She wanted to know if there was any way of getting them out.</p> <p>Robert had bought a toaster, which broke after two months. The shop replaced it with another which broke in the same way after five months. They refused to replace the second one.</p> <p>Alan wants to regain contact with his four-year-old daughter. He has a contact order, issued by a court, which allows him access every two months. But the child's mother has broken off all contact. Alan wants to know if, and how, he can enforce the order. We sat down and logged on, stopping off at various sites:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lawrights.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.lawrights.co.uk</a></p> <p>Lawrights offers free legal advice, in the form of questions and answers, on most areas of law the public is likely to be involved with, such as accident claims, family law and employment rights.</p> <p>For example, the answer to \"My children have been taken into care by social services. What can I do?\" is: \"You should see a solicitor if you want to try and get your children back. Usually social services will apply to the court for an order so that they can take your children into care. You can oppose this order. Even if an order has been made you might later be able to have the order changed.\"</p> <p>This is correct advice, if a little cursory. The phrase \"see a solicitor\" makes up a substantial part of many answers. Lawrights itself offers personalised legal advice on a premium-rate phone number, at \u00a31.50 a minute, and presumably a major reason for the website is to drum up business for this.</p> <p>Our panel were not over-impressed. None of their specific questions were answered. Had Susan wanted to draw up a new assured shorthold tenancy for her flat, Lawrights would have sold her a \"personalised\" one for \u00a335, although the personalisation went little further than including the names and addresses of the parties to the agreement, the rent payable and the items in the inventory.</p> <p>\"It's not a bargain,\" she says. \"I usually just copy the standard AST agreement in The Which?

It's not particularly cheap: for instance, a simple will costs \u00a319.99 and an assured shorthold tenancy agreement is \u00a329.99. However, if you decide you need to rewrite your will in the middle of the night, it might be the solution.</p> <p>Desktop lawyer also gives free general advice, which could charitably be described as patchy, giving the impression of having been written by someone paid by the word but without much to say. On divorce, for instance, the expert advice is: \"More often than not a relationship will break down by degrees - there is very rarely a day upon which it could be said that a marriage came to an end . . .\", advice which continues for another 150 words of waffle.</p> <p>The advice on \"crime and punishment\" is limited to two subjects, \"drinking and driving\" and \"mobile phones and driving\".

      "body": "<p>Richie Hammond was putting in the plumbing at a Luton service station when he heard about a job going that confirmed his faith in how far drainage systems can take a man. He's 23 and built like an outhouse, with a squaddie's haircut. \"I thought I'd see the world, have an adventure,\" he says. He rang the hastily scrawled number passed on to him by a workmate. A month later he was up a mountain in Kosovo, putting in the toilets at a British army camp and pitching his good humour against temperatures of minus 27C (minus 17F) and mercy missions from Jim Davidson and Rio from Gladiators.</p> <p>The 5,000 British troops in Kosovo have a well-documented presence. Less visible are the 280 British tradesmen - plumbers and electricians, mainly - living under the wing of the military in a country that is at that surreal, post-conflict stage where ordinary life tries to arrange itself around extraordinary circumstances. While tanks cruise the streets of Pristina and gunfire cracks through the night, plumbers from Tyneside lag pipes and put in shower units, watch the football and send off lottery coupons. \"Certain aspects of it remind me of Stoke on Trent,\" says Rick, an electrician from Blackburn. \"I'm more likely to have a gun pulled on me in the pub at home.\"</p> <p>The timetable observed by these men doesn't encourage them to take an anthropological view of the posting, which has a 10-20% dropout rate. They are housed, two to a room, in a terrace of customised Portakabins behind the bombed-out shell of a Serbian barracks. They rise at 5.30am, are bussed to one of 13 building sites by 7am and don't knock off until the light fades at 6pm, after which they have a choice of watching British Forces Television or venturing into Pristina, a mile away. When the first batch went out last summer they were strongly discouraged from leaving the MoD-protected compound.</p> <p>And yet they still came. Hunting Engineering, the prime contractor for Britain's \u00a3100m troop accommodation in Kosovo, started asking for workers in August. \"The phone didn't stop ringing,\" says Gerry Sherry, personnel manager on site in Pristina. \"We didn't mention salary and worded it to make it sound exciting. A lot of people responded to the emotive tone of the ad - the romance of working in a designated war zone.

Both were shocked by what they saw, and Ingram had a particularly nasty fright on his first night in Pristina, when a man was shot dead 200m from his hotel. \"I was shaking for a couple of days afterwards,\" he says. \"I wondered if I had made the right decision to come here.\"</p> <p>What surprised them most was not the violence of the place, but the fact that their interest in life beyond the building site was not widely shared by the other Brits.

The Albanians, while largely viewed with sympathy, do not escape censure either.

Together, they are known as the Fixers. \"We try to keep in with everyone,\" says Henderson, a former army cook who, through his contacts with 80 Squadron, has set up a forces postal address, oiled the alcohol supply route and run a karaoke night for the camp.

      "bodyText": "Richie Hammond was putting in the plumbing at a Luton service station when he heard about a job going that confirmed his faith in how far drainage systems can take a man. He's 23 and built like an outhouse, with a squaddie's haircut. \"I thought I'd see the world, have an adventure,\" he says. He rang the hastily scrawled number passed on to him by a workmate. A month later he was up a mountain in Kosovo, putting in the toilets at a British army camp and pitching his good humour against temperatures of minus 27C (minus 17F) and mercy missions from Jim Davidson and Rio from Gladiators. The 5,000 British troops in Kosovo have a well-documented presence. Less visible are the 280 British tradesmen - plumbers and electricians, mainly - living under the wing of the military in a country that is at that surreal, post-conflict stage where ordinary life tries to arrange itself around extraordinary circumstances. While tanks cruise the streets of Pristina and gunfire cracks through the night, plumbers from Tyneside lag pipes and put in shower units, watch the football and send off lottery coupons. \"Certain aspects of it remind me of Stoke on Trent,\" says Rick, an electrician from Blackburn. \"I'm more likely to have a gun pulled on me in the pub at home.\" The timetable observed by these men doesn't encourage them to take an anthropological view of the posting, which has a 10-20% dropout rate. They are housed, two to a room, in a terrace of customised Portakabins behind the bombed-out shell of a Serbian barracks. They rise at 5.30am, are bussed to one of 13 building sites by 7am and don't knock off until the light fades at 6pm, after which they have a choice of watching British Forces Television or venturing into Pristina, a mile away. When the first batch went out last summer they were strongly discouraged from leaving the MoD-protected compound. And yet they still came. Hunting Engineering, the prime contractor for Britain's \u00a3100m troop accommodation in Kosovo, started asking for workers in August. \"The phone didn't stop ringing,\" says Gerry Sherry, personnel manager on site in Pristina. \"We didn't mention salary and worded it to make it sound exciting. A lot of people responded to the emotive tone of the ad - the romance of working in a designated war zone. For others it was just a question of economics.\" The economics, when they were finally disclosed, were an underwhelming \u00a3700 for a seven-day, 70-hour week, and Hunting had to re-advertise in areas of high unemployment to make up the numbers.

The success of those efforts is a matter of urgency for all three countries. Mr Clinton's presidency has entered its final months; Mr Assad, 69, is in poor health and wants to ensure a smooth succession to his son and heir; and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has pledged to withdraw troops from south Lebanon by July - a high-risk manoeuvre in the absence of a wider peace with Syria. The summit in Geneva was the first between Mr Clinton and Mr Assad since 1994, and a rare appearance abroad for the ailing Syrian leader. The extraordinary nature of the encounter has stoked specula tion about a breakthrough. The talks, at the Intercontinental Hotel overlooking Lake Geneva, opened with apparent warmth as the two leaders shook hands and exchanged smiles. A flurry of recent reports has predicted an immediate resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks, but Israeli and US officials yesterday sought to lower expectations of a breakthrough. They said that no announcement would be made until Mr Clinton confers with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. Mr Clinton has been holding three-way telephone negotiations with Mr Assad and Mr Barak, but they are believed to remain deadlocked on several key areas. Mr Barak told a cabinet meeting in Jerusalem that he rated Mr Clinton's chances of salvaging the peace process at no higher than 50%. \"Either we have a partner, or we do not have a partner,\" he was quoted as saying. \"But I cannot give more than a 50% chance to either option.\" The US national security adviser, Sandy Berger, was equally cautious about the prospects for an immediate renewal of Syrian-Israeli talks. He said he hoped the two sides would resume negotiations within weeks, but added: \"That is by no means certain.\" Mr Berger said the differences between Israel and Syria were not irreconcilable, but \"there needs to be a higher level of confidence - not certainty but confidence - that their respective needs can be met in an ultimate agreement\". There was no official statement from Damascus yesterday, but the state-controlled newspaper al-Wadi said: \"Most of the political forces in Israel are not mature enough for a just peace.\" The biggest obstacle to resuming the peace talks is Syria's insistence that Israel commits in advance to total withdrawal from the Golan Heights, returning to the ceasefire line that divided the territory before the 1967 war. Israel maintains that it will accept no ultimatums in advance of talks. It has tried to persuade Syria to accept a proposal under which Israel would retain a strip of shore line around the Sea of Galilee, which would safeguard the source of 40% of its water. In return, Israel would trade another parcel of land near the strategic Golan Heights. Analysts believe that other areas of dispute - including security guarantees, an early warning site on the Golan, and a pledge from Damascus to control Hizbullah guerrillas in south Lebanon - will be easier to resolve. The urgency of yesterday's encounter has been underscored by the frailty of Mr Assad, who is reported to be seeking to complete a peace agreement with Israel to ensure a smooth handover to his designated heir, Bashar, when he leaves power. For his part, Mr Barak has publicly recognised the risks of going ahead with his pledge to withdraw Israeli forces from south Lebanon by July in an absence of a wider agreement with Syria. After a four-year freeze, Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations resumed late last year but broke off in January after Syria demanded that Israel agree to returning the entire Golan Heights before other issues could be discussed.",

      "body": "<p>The relation between a woman and her body is often seen as problematic. She is aware of herself as a \"physical object\", someone seen, assessed and known as a body. This self-awareness begins at an early age. Diaries of girls as young as eight show that they engage in what the author and academic Joan Jacobs Brumberg calls \"the body project\" - seeing themselves as something to change, mould, perfect. They form resolutions to pare down through dieting and build up through exercise. Being body beautiful becomes a moral mission.</p> <p>The female as object can be traced throughout the lifespan: from puberty, when she becomes aware of her sexuality through others' responses, to midlife, when many women report becoming invisible socially, women note a link between being attractive and being significant.</p> <p>Of course, men are not impervious to how they look. At the launch of a book of his collected essays, a university professor was asked whether he had any regrets. Caught charmingly off-guard, he blurted out, \"I would have liked to be four inches taller.\" A retrospective of a brilliant career was clouded by a constant sense that he was \"too short\".</p> <p>Men may objectify their bodies in other ways. They sometimes emphasize the body's performance more than their pleasure. They experience pain as something to be contained rather than expressed. They try to look strong, rather than as they are. Such objectification may go some way to explaining the current debate over the existence of the male menopause, dismissed by some clinicians, which was raging in the British Medical Journal last week.</p> <p>Critical awareness of our own bodies in terms of how they look rather than in terms of how they work is an impediment to a good life. If we look in the mirror and despise ourselves because of our breasts or cellulite, or if we flare with envy for another woman who looks the way we think we ought to, then we collude in a way of seeing that diminishes us.</p> <p>But recent research has highlighted another aspect of women's special body awareness: they may also be more aware of the body as subject. In other words, they are more attuned to what they feel, and have higher standards for feeling well.</p> <p>Men and women have different bodies and different body chemistry. It should not be all that surprising that female and male pain follow different pathways to the brain. In all probability, the different pathways are a result of evolution. Men had to learn how to endure the traumatic pain of sudden injury while hunting, and women had to endure the more visceral pain of childbirth.</p> <p>Some people find this argument compelling, and some find it infuriatingly speculative. But while the differences between the sexes, in terms of pain, are really very small, we can still learn much from looking at the different ways different people read their bodies.</p> <p>The menstrual cycle teaches women how their moods are affected by their hormones.

      "bodyText": "The relation between a woman and her body is often seen as problematic. She is aware of herself as a \"physical object\", someone seen, assessed and known as a body. This self-awareness begins at an early age. Diaries of girls as young as eight show that they engage in what the author and academic Joan Jacobs Brumberg calls \"the body project\" - seeing themselves as something to change, mould, perfect. They form resolutions to pare down through dieting and build up through exercise. Being body beautiful becomes a moral mission. The female as object can be traced throughout the lifespan: from puberty, when she becomes aware of her sexuality through others' responses, to midlife, when many women report becoming invisible socially, women note a link between being attractive and being significant. Of course, men are not impervious to how they look. At the launch of a book of his collected essays, a university professor was asked whether he had any regrets. Caught charmingly off-guard, he blurted out, \"I would have liked to be four inches taller.\" A retrospective of a brilliant career was clouded by a constant sense that he was \"too short\". Men may objectify their bodies in other ways. They sometimes emphasize the body's performance more than their pleasure. They experience pain as something to be contained rather than expressed. They try to look strong, rather than as they are. Such objectification may go some way to explaining the current debate over the existence of the male menopause, dismissed by some clinicians, which was raging in the British Medical Journal last week. Critical awareness of our own bodies in terms of how they look rather than in terms of how they work is an impediment to a good life. If we look in the mirror and despise ourselves because of our breasts or cellulite, or if we flare with envy for another woman who looks the way we think we ought to, then we collude in a way of seeing that diminishes us. But recent research has highlighted another aspect of women's special body awareness: they may also be more aware of the body as subject. In other words, they are more attuned to what they feel, and have higher standards for feeling well. Men and women have different bodies and different body chemistry. It should not be all that surprising that female and male pain follow different pathways to the brain. In all probability, the different pathways are a result of evolution. Men had to learn how to endure the traumatic pain of sudden injury while hunting, and women had to endure the more visceral pain of childbirth. Some people find this argument compelling, and some find it infuriatingly speculative. But while the differences between the sexes, in terms of pain, are really very small, we can still learn much from looking at the different ways different people read their bodies. The menstrual cycle teaches women how their moods are affected by their hormones. Few women need a pregnancy test to tell them they are pregnant: there are other, clear signs, such as the tenderness of their breasts - and acute irritability. They key into the different physical messages of different days, and are much quicker to know when something's wrong.

Police in Birmingham are examining remains of a home-made nail-and-staple latch which may have prevented the three teenagers escaping as the creosoted wood and felt shack in the suburb of Kingstanding became an inferno. Firefighters who responded in under four minutes to a call from a babysitter at the nearby house needed counselling after discovering that an apparently minor domestic fire was a catastrophe. \"Our crews were deeply shocked,\" said Allan Rotchell, divisional officer of West Midlands fire service. \"The last thing you expect to find in a situation like this is three kids, three young boys, dead in a shed at the bottom of the garden, three families devastated.\" Relatives were still in disbelief yesterday that a modest suburban adventure, which the youths had done several times before after carpeting the windowless shed and turning it into a den with a radio and duvets, could end so horribly. The oldest boy was named by relatives as Matthew Collins, 17, from Short Heath, Birmingham, who worked locally as a fishmonger. It is understood the other two were 14-year-olds Blake Mountney, who lived at the house where the fire occurred, and Chris Williams, whose family are thought to live nearby. Matthew had organised sleep-outs in the den on several occasions with the other boys. He was described as \"well-liked and very pleasant\" by his uncle, Ray Collier, 49, a motor mechanic from Castle Bromwich, Birmingham. \"As far as we know at the moment, they were all camping out in the shed like boys do and the next thing you know there was an explosion. Matthew lived with his parents and he was the life and soul of the house. He said he was going to stay over at this place with his mates.\" Matthew's father, Michael, who was told the news at 4am yesterday with his wife Delaine, was taken to hospital with shock. The parents at the house where the tragedy happened were out at the time and were told at 2am what had happened. Mr Rotchell said that there were no suspicious circumstances and no gas canisters, lighter fuel or other highly combustible material had been found in the ashes. But about 10 candles and a number of tea-lights had been recovered. \"Young people enjoy sleeping out in tents or summerhouses but our warning to families is: please do not let them have candles or tea-lights or there will be more tragedies. \"They need to use torches or battery-operated lights.\" Firemen have established that the eight foot by six foot shed had a proper door-handle outside but an only an amateur fixing inside. Mr Rotchell said: \"There was a nail and a piece of string which you had to fiddle about with to open the door. The fire spread very quickly and they could not get out in time.\" A man aged 19 who had been at the house with the babysitter was taken to hospital with hand burns after trying vainly to reach the boys when the fire broke out at 11.30pm on Saturday. He also suffered minor facial injuries after being spattered with burning felt from the roof of the shed. A neighbour was also taken to hospital suffering from shock. Olive Hawkesford, who lives in the same street, said: \"I saw all the flames coming from the shed and I thought someone had just set it on fire because we get a lot of vandalism around here.\" Police are also examining a cigarette lighter found in the debris and further evidence is expected from a postmortem today.",

This month he slipped into Britain to give a lecture at Sheffield University, where he claimed that the latest Russian gravity shielding experiments had made objects 5% lighter, compared with 2% in the Finnish study.",

But other statistics included in the report demonstrate significant changes in family demographics with profound if, often unexplored, consequences.</p> <p>More than 6.5m people in Britain - about 28% of households - now live on their own, three times as many as 40 years ago, the report says. Nearly a quarter of women born in 1973 will still be childless at the age of 45, compared with about one in 10 of those born in 1943. Women are having children later, on average at 29 rather than at 26, as in the 1970s, and they are having fewer offspring.</p> <p>The average of 1.73 children per woman in the late 1990s, though higher than in most EU countries, is well below the 2.1 needed to retain the population at its present level in the long term.</p> <p><b> Lone parents trebled</b><br></p> <p>The 21% of dependent children living in lone parent households (the vast majority with their mother) has trebled from the 7% in 1972. The number of lone parents has trebled in the past 25 years - there were about 1.6m such parents and 2.8m dependent children by the mid 1990s, compared with just over 500,000 lone parents and 1m dependent children in 1971. Within that 1.6m, the fastest growing group is single, never-married lone mothers. Their proportion, 42% in 1997, is nearly double the proportion of 24% for 1984.</p> <p>\"Twenty years ago such women would have married only to see their relationship end in separation or divorce,\" the report says. \"Single lone mothers should be seen as the modern equivalent of teenagers in earlier generations whose shotgun marriages failed.\"</p> <p>The annual marriages rate is at its lowest level since records began 160 years ago. In 1961 approximately 330,000 first- time marriages and 50,000 remarriages took place. By 1997 these figures had dropped to fewer than 200,000 first-time marriages and approximately 120,000 remarriages.</p> <p>Of every five marriages, two will end in divorce. More than 150,000 children under 16 experience the divorce of their parents, and if present rates continue, 28% of children under 16 will experience divorce. The cost of family breakdown to the public purse has been estimated at about \u00a35bn a year.</p> <p>But marriage is still more stable than cohabiting, with couples who live together unmarried three or four times more likely to split up. Future research will show a rise in the proportion of cohabiting couples, from the one in 10 in the most recently available figures. And the presence of children in a cohabiting relationship does not appear to reduce the breakdown rate significantly.</p> <p>Although the centre itself devotes some space in its report to children, it says ministers should broaden their scope to consider the wider implications of these changes. \"The impact right across the life cycle, including that on the growing numbers of older people, must be fully taken on board, as must the effect of these family changes on society,\" said Ceridwen Roberts, director of the centre.</p> <p>Ms Roberts said: \"When we just talk about children, I think this fudges the issue sometimes. We have also got to look at the effects on adults. I think the government has a responsibility to look at the full social and economic cost of relationship fragility. We need to encourage a public debate about whether those costs should be borne by private individuals, or directly and indirectly by society. If we are going to have a serious discussion about whether there is a social policy impact on relationship breakdown you can't just ignore the cost.\"</p> <p>Through his chairing of the ministerial group on the family, Jack Straw, the home secretary, has concentrated on the impact of family breakdown on children. That is unlikely to alter. \"The main part of our family policy is about ensuring children are better supported, everything springs from that,\" said a Home Office source.</p> <p><b> Misconceptions</b><br></p> <p>The centre recommends introduction of family impact statements, spelling out the impact of any government policy.</p> <p>In its report, the centre also dispels some common misconceptions: that people living alone are not part of a family, when in fact the family remains \"the key social network and primary source of informal care and support for most people\"; that most non-resident fathers do not keep in contact with their children, when nearly half in 1996 saw their children at least once a week. The extended family continues to be very important, although contact with relatives has lessened, and family members are the main providers of care for elderly relatives. Grandparents are still important in childcare.</p> <p>Mr Straw last week confirmed his commitment to promoting the family, but he said he wanted to \"develop policies that support people in families as they really are today, not according to some outdated ideal\".

Tell yourself before breakfast that life stinks, and for the rest of the day you will bask in a rosy glow of fulfilled expectations. De Botton preached Seneca's gospel of gloom with such charm that it was impossible not to be instantly converted. Never again will the TV listings pages be flung across the room in a fury of disappointment; no, henceforth we snuggle up with Seneca and positively look forward to the next series of My Hero. </p> <p>Alain de Botton is to philosophy what Delia Smith is to cookery: a sensible, practical enthusiast. Big ideas, like souffl\u00e9s, are no longer stumbling blocks but simple things that can, in his words, \"make a real difference\". </p> <p>The closing episode of <strong> Casualty</strong> (Saturday, BBC1) was also full of philosophy. We learned that \"we love people and lose people - and it hurts\" and that \"you mustn't beat yourself up over this\". Also that \"the hardest thing about this job is not letting it get to you\". Nobody actually said \"It never rains but it pours,\" but they should have done, as water poured from the sky throughout the entire episode, and misery piled upon misery in a way that might have tried even Seneca's patience. A mother attempted to kill her own daughter, a haemophiliac got his knees smashed up (we were spared no detail of the wounds), a man died of pneumonia and an irritating Scottish woman wandered around reception. As if this wasn't enough, Tina (Claire Goose) and Sean (Gerald Kyd) were transported to Australia and forced to star in a dreadful Oz soap with lines like \"I love you, Mrs Sean Maddox\". </p> <p>As ever, they saved the best till last. Just when we'd been lulled into thinking that this series of Casualty would have a happy ending, Charlie (Derek Thompson) locked himself in the toilet and had a completely unexpected heart attack. Were the attentions of the irritating Scottish woman too much to bear? Was he, too, longing for a new life in Australia? Will the next series open with the funeral cortege, the name CHARLIE picked out in used swabs? Are the producers really so worried that nobody will watch the next series unless someone's life hangs in the balance? </p> <p>It could so easily have been Robson Green lying there on the cold tiles - let us not forget that he was once known as Jimmy the porter out of Casualty. That was a long time ago, though, and now Green is a big star - which is just as well, because his latest vehicle, <strong> The Last Musketeer</strong> (Sunday, ITV) was an outrageous piece of hokum that only he could have pulled off.</p> <p> Green played Steve McTear, fencing champ, ex-con (he was framed) and major stud. The secret of fencing, said Steve, is \"good point control\", and six minutes into the film he was demonstrating his technique with a posh blonde woman in a hotel bedroom. Steve was involved with some villains (we knew they were villains because they frequented the ITV pole-dancing club) and decamped to the Scottish coast where his girlfriend ran a boarding school. Here he secured a job as a fencing master, carried on with the headmistress and fended off the horny students. But, as is the way with these things, the teacher ended up getting taught. \"You don't have to be working class to feel pain,\" said his star pupil Emily, before attempting to indulge in a spot of extra-curricular training. \"You have to know where to draw the line,\" said Steve. </p> <p>All of which mysteriously gave him the courage to face his gangland enemies in a deeply improbably denouement up on the roof (cue for a Robson and Jerome hit on the soundtrack, sadly overlooked). In anyone else's hands, The Last Musketeer would have been hilariously awful, but thanks to Green it rattled along with good humour and tongue-in-cheek. Special mention is due to the sex scenes, which must have taken a great deal of rehearsal. When Steve and headmistress Elizabeth (Arkie Whiteley) rekindled their passion after the third advert break, she gave a look of stunned delight at the moment of engagement that more than made up for the absence of any jokes about \"weapons\". One longed in vain for Steve to cry \"touch\u00e9!\".</p>",

Nobody actually said \"It never rains but it pours,\" but they should have done, as water poured from the sky throughout the entire episode, and misery piled upon misery in a way that might have tried even Seneca's patience. A mother attempted to kill her own daughter, a haemophiliac got his knees smashed up (we were spared no detail of the wounds), a man died of pneumonia and an irritating Scottish woman wandered around reception. As if this wasn't enough, Tina (Claire Goose) and Sean (Gerald Kyd) were transported to Australia and forced to star in a dreadful Oz soap with lines like \"I love you, Mrs Sean Maddox\". As ever, they saved the best till last. Just when we'd been lulled into thinking that this series of Casualty would have a happy ending, Charlie (Derek Thompson) locked himself in the toilet and had a completely unexpected heart attack. Were the attentions of the irritating Scottish woman too much to bear? Was he, too, longing for a new life in Australia? Will the next series open with the funeral cortege, the name CHARLIE picked out in used swabs? Are the producers really so worried that nobody will watch the next series unless someone's life hangs in the balance? It could so easily have been Robson Green lying there on the cold tiles - let us not forget that he was once known as Jimmy the porter out of Casualty. That was a long time ago, though, and now Green is a big star - which is just as well, because his latest vehicle, The Last Musketeer (Sunday, ITV) was an outrageous piece of hokum that only he could have pulled off. Green played Steve McTear, fencing champ, ex-con (he was framed) and major stud. The secret of fencing, said Steve, is \"good point control\", and six minutes into the film he was demonstrating his technique with a posh blonde woman in a hotel bedroom. Steve was involved with some villains (we knew they were villains because they frequented the ITV pole-dancing club) and decamped to the Scottish coast where his girlfriend ran a boarding school. Here he secured a job as a fencing master, carried on with the headmistress and fended off the horny students. But, as is the way with these things, the teacher ended up getting taught. \"You don't have to be working class to feel pain,\" said his star pupil Emily, before attempting to indulge in a spot of extra-curricular training. \"You have to know where to draw the line,\" said Steve. All of which mysteriously gave him the courage to face his gangland enemies in a deeply improbably denouement up on the roof (cue for a Robson and Jerome hit on the soundtrack, sadly overlooked). In anyone else's hands, The Last Musketeer would have been hilariously awful, but thanks to Green it rattled along with good humour and tongue-in-cheek. Special mention is due to the sex scenes, which must have taken a great deal of rehearsal. When Steve and headmistress Elizabeth (Arkie Whiteley) rekindled their passion after the third advert break, she gave a look of stunned delight at the moment of engagement that more than made up for the absence of any jokes about \"weapons\". One longed in vain for Steve to cry \"touch\u00e9!\".",

By the end of the 50s, it was a poor third in the home market after the BMC and Ford. A prolonged and damaging strike in 1961 lost one-third of that year's production and \u00a33m profit, a blow from which the company never really recovered. So in 1964, the American Chrysler corporation bought a stake in the Rootes Group and in 1967 took full ownership.</p> <p>The company's top management, mostly members of the Rootes family, had been long accustomed to dictate product policy.

He then joined the Bristol Aeroplane Company, where he worked for the visionary but mercurial Sir Roy Fedden, and followed his chief on to the Admiralty's motor torpedo boat commission.</p> <p>During the second world war, Fedden gathered a small team to design a rear-engined car, which was intended to be a British world-beater. Ware was a member of this group. The F-car project ended when the single prototype crashed because of the undesirable behaviour of its suspension. On Ware's advice, Fedden stopped work on the project, and his company was liquidated in 1947.</p> <p>After a short spell at Leyland, Ware worked for CAV Ltd, part of the Lucas organisation, and Dowty Fuel Systems during the 50s. He was farsightedly convinced of the merit of the fuel-injection, turbo-charged diesel engine.</p> <p>In 1958, he returned to the mainstream motor industry, accepting a job at Rootes, where he soon became chief executive engineer and a director. He did not actually design the Hillman Imp. Since 1955, a small rear-engined car, the creation of Mike Parkes and Tim Fry, had been on the Rootes drawingboard.

Rootes, unable to extend its manufacturing base in Coventry, bought a redundant railway carriage factory at Linwood, Scotland from Pressed Steel to make the new model. Ware's contribution was to replace the primitive swing axle rear suspension of the Apex car with more sophisticated trailing arms. Unhappy experiences with the Fedden car must have been fresh in his mind.</p> <p>The Imp bristled with innovation and was far more refined in appearance and equipment than BMC's contemporary Mini. Rootes's lack of a small car to compete with Austin, Ford and Morris had been the biggest barrier to further growth of the company. The Imp was always a gamble, and one that failed.</p> <p>It was a misjudgment to introduce a rear-engined car when this concept was becoming out of date. The car was rushed to the market and was beset by teething troubles; it never had really competed with the ubiquitous Mini. And Ware, who had become the champion of the project on the Rootes board and in public, might have carried the can.

      "bodyText": "Four mourners and 23 police officers were injured this weekend when violence erupted at the funeral of the fourth unarmed black man to be shot dead by New York police in 13 months. The row over the death has now emerged as a major campaign issue in the senatorial race between the New York mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, and the First Lady, Hillary Clinton. Patrick Dorismond, 25, a security guard who was the son of a Haitian immigrant, was killed on March 16 in a struggle with undercover drug squad officers engaged in a \"buy and bust\" operation outside a bar in Manhattan. The funeral procession had started peacefully in the streets of Brooklyn on Saturday, with thousands following the coffin and lining the streets. But trouble began as the cortege arrived at a Roman Catholic church. Some of the 5,000-strong crowd surged towards the church as the pallbearers removed the coffin, draped with US and Haitian flags, from the hearse. Several snatched the US flag and burned it. Throughout the funeral, the crowd outside was hostile but relatively peaceful, confining its anger to shouts of derision against the mayor and the police, who now numbered about 300 officers in helmets and other riot gear. Later, as the funeral ended and the procession set off for a cemetery, scuffling broke out between protesters and the police. People on fire escapes and in windows began hurling bottles on to the street. The police formed a human barricade, and officers used their batons to knock down flying glass. A total of 27 people were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct offences. The Rev Al Sharpton, who has been associated with the family since the shooting, did not condone the violence but said he blamed the police for provoking the fighting by arriving dressed in riot gear. Mr Giuliani, who did not attend the scene, visited injured officers in hospital afterwards. \"Police officers should receive the thanks of the entire community in the face of sustained hostility and abuse,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, when you allow demagogues to take over for political and divisive purposes, the American flag gets shredded and burned, steel barricades are hurled and bottles are thrown, injuring police officers and civilians.\" Over the weekend, Detective Anthony Vasquez, the officer who shot Dorismond, issued a statement in which he expressed his sympathy. \"On behalf of my family and myself I wish to extend our heartfelt condolences to [the dead man's mother] and the Dorismond family. As a father and a son, I can only imagine the depth of your grief. Our prayers are with you at this sorrowful hour.\" Dorismond had no drugs in his possession when he was shot to death during a scuffle with Det Vasquez. Lawyers for Det Vasquez, who has now been assigned to desk duty, claim that the police officer's gun went off accidentally. Part of the reason for the anger over the shooting has been connected with the decision by Mr Giuliani to release details of Dorismond's record, dating back to an arrest when he was 13. The dead man had been arrested in the past for robbery, attempted robbery, assault and illegal weapons possession but had been charged with the much lesser offence of disorderly conduct. Following his death, the mayor had said that Dorismond was \"no altar boy\" and \"had spent a good deal of his life punching people\". This angered the dead man's friends and family as it was seen as a justification for his death. Hillary Clinton, Mr Giuliani's opponent in the senate race this November, condemned his stance \"At just the moment when a real leader would have reached out to heal the wounds, he has chosen divisiveness,\" she said. Mr Giuliani responded by accusing her of reading from a script prepared for her by Mr Sharpton.",

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office minister Peter Hain appealed to the international community yesterday to confront the key obstacles to a breakthrough in long drawn-out negotiations for an effective agreement outlawing biological weapons. Speaking on the 25th anniversary of the existing biological weapons convention - an agreement with many loopholes - Mr Hain said it was time to make \"crunch decisions at a political level\". Britain and South Africa have taken a leading role in talks in Geneva for a new protocol which would lay down effective verification measures, which are lacking in the current convention. A tougher agreement is becoming increasingly urgent because of the growth of the biotechnology industry, whose products can be used for medical and agriculture purposes, but also for what Mr Hain called \"a deadly weapon of mass destruction\". The EU says a new protocol is needed to force states and companies to declare their production of biological and toxin agents, and to allow random inspections. In the past the US biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have objected to on-site inspections, claiming commercial confidentiality.",

Fears of a disaster have been growing as more vessels - triggered by the boom in Azerbaijan's oilfields - navigate the twisting channel between Istanbul's European and Asian shores. Most of the tankers are Russian, loading up with oil from Russian and Georgian pipeline terminals. A spate of accidents in the last decade has heightened concerns about the dangers for Istanbul, which has a population of at least 10m. Many people live close to the waterway, which is always thronged with ferries, pleasure boats and fishing vessels. Just after Christmas, a tanker ran aground and spilt 800 tonnes of diesel oil, which the authorities are still clearing up. In 1991, the Bosphorus was shut for 10 days after a Lebanese ship carrying 22,000 sheep sank following a collision with a Philippine vessel. The Black Sea Borders conference, convened in Istanbul by the British Council, brought together British activists and environmental groups from the region. Among the speakers was the former Conservative minister, John Gummer, who runs an environmental consultancy. \"We are expecting traffic to double by the year 2005 because of the Caspian oil boom,\" Aykut Turker, of the Turkish group Society of Peace with Nature, said at the conference. Fifty million tonnes of cargo pass through the Bosphorus every year. Vessels are not obliged to hire local pilots familiar with the treacherous currents. Mr Turker claimed that 85% of recent accidents involved ships which had tried to save money by not using a pilot. Gulnur Tumbat, a researcher at the Middle East University in Ankara, said: \"The Bosphoros handles three times as many ships as the Suez canal, has numerous blind curves where ships cannot see each other approaching, and 12 abrupt turns.\" Turkey has been lobbying hard to encourage oil companies to support the construction of a much longer pipeline that would transport crude oil direct to Ceyhan by its Mediterranean coast. The issue is moving up the international political agenda, but the costs - estimated at \u00a32.3bn - are so high that neither Georgia nor Azerbaijan is prepared to start work without Turkish subsidies. Turkey's commercial rivals in Russia and elsewhere claim the dangers to the Bosphorus are being talked up in order to make the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline appear more attractive. But Professor Laurence Mee, of Plymouth University, who wrote a report entitled How to Save the Black Sea, yesterday added his voice at the conference to concerns about excessive shipping in the straits. \"Transporting this oil bonanza from the Caspian to the west by sea is a cheap way of doing it,\" he said. \"It starts out free but someone pays the cost if anything goes wrong and there is a major accident.\" Engin Ural, secretary general of the Environment Foundation of Turkey, wanted swift action. \"Our country is very sensitive about this traffic but it is time to use our sovereignty and control the shipping,\" he said. \"We can't stop vessels but we can slow them down.

      "body": "<p>I have a weakness for Latin women,\" says Greg Martin, halfway through my glass of wine. \"I love Latin women. I'm engaged now to an Italian girl. I just love people like that. And I mean, I'm a man. Like Zorba the Greek said, 'Aren't I a man? Aren't I stupid?' You know, I've got a libido. And when Tara walked in with Elton John that night, in that bikini and white sarong, she looked incredible. And she was really funny. She said Mick Jagger had said, 'Wanna come to Reykjavik with me?' and she'd said, 'I'll come if you can spell it.' And he said: 'I dunno. There's an \"h\" in there somewhere.' I thought that's very witty. She's witty.\"</p> <p>He drinks the other half of my wine. \"Oh, sorry,\" he says and returns to his own. He puffs his lips out in a noisy sigh. He rolls his denim-blue eyes. \" But I had no idea what I was getting into . I wish I'd known she was straight out of rehab. She's sweet but she's loopy, an overindulged, spoilt brat. Two weeks later I'm knocked for six. I'm a scumbag, serial-philandering pig. I'm a creepy Casanova. I'm a con man. Twice in the Daily Mail Tara called me a con man. I'd like to see her prove that in court.\"</p> <p>Greg Martin, 43, the eldest son of the record producer Sir George Martin, is the \"failed actor\" (\"What is a failed actor? Is a failed actor someone who's starred in a mini-series with Richard Burton and Faye Dunaway, who's done over 60 plays all over the world?\") who didn't marry Tara Palmer-Tomkinson last summer.</p> <p>They met at Jagger's 56th birthday party in the south of France. Martin was with another socialite, Sabrina Guinness (he calls me Sabrina a couple of times and winces). But minutes later, Palmer-Tomkinson, who had been making an It of herself, had scrawled \"Tara's getting married\" in lipstick on her handbag and the papers were full of their whirlwind romance.</p> <p>It was all over with the summer sales. Too many Latin women in the woodwork, not to mention American, Russian and Chinese, willing to sell their stories for the right price. Too many former marriages (one more than he had admitted to, anyway). Too many enemies. Maybe not quite enough money in the bank. Palmer-Tomkinson retreated to the bosom of her royally connected family. The portcullis came down. Society turned its back. And Martin, an ordinary red-blooded bachelor (\"Before all the names, I honestly, honestly, honestly, from my heart, thought I was pretty normal. I've always loved women, I adore the little darlings, and I thought most men were the same\") found himself, alone, in his rented flat in Knightsbridge, with certain \"business ventures\" in ruins, branded Love Rat, the James Hewitt of the Tatler-meets-Hello! reading classes.</p> <p>He's written a book now, a memoir called Dirty Rotten Scoundrel. As an attempt to re-establish his reputation it's a disaster. A diary of his years at Rada and in the film and TV business in the US (among other things, he starred in Ellis Island, and co-starred in Ellen) as well as the events of last year, it is full of \"birds\" and \"horny little slappers\", of \"sexy young blueblood vixens\", and \"gorgeous, sweet, hot-as-a-chilli-pepper-ridden-chicken-vindaloo beauties\".</p> <p>There is the time he slept with Madonna. The night he couldn't get it up with Sharon Stone. Tara and her G-string. But he has his defences ready. He said Tara stormed round recently and said, \"'How dare you exploit our relationship for your own publicity ends?' and I said, 'Excuse me, isn't that the way you've lived your life?'\"</p> <p>When I told him I found some of it a bit dubious, he said, \"Come on Sabrina, it's witty, it's humorous, it's tongue in cheek. I'm sending myself up. You know that.\" I got off lightly. Further down the bottle of wine, he tells me a female reviewer who didn't like it \"is probably a lonely middle-aged woman who can't get laid\".</p> <p>So why does one feel sorry for him? Is it because he looks identical to his father, the same stooping, lopsided gait, the same flop of hair, though the son dyes his (\"Yes, I do. So what? I've got bits of like silver in it and I'm too young. David Beckham dyes his\"), the same prominent cheekbones and Adam's apple? The same charm: walking down the street, he greets the flower-stall man and the Evening Standard vendor by name; he introduces me to the bloke who sells him cigarettes; when he smiles at the waitress in the wine bar, she giggles. Or is it because this resemblance is his downfall?</p> <p>Greg Martin may not have been what he appeared to be to the Palmer-Tomkinsons, but then he appears to be his father, whom he certainly isn't. George Martin: the English icon, the man who produced the Beatles in the maelstrom of the 60s and yet remained the embodiment of gentlemanliness and restraint. Just what an It Girl needs. \"He's a god,\" says his son simply.</p> <p>Or perhaps it's because he seems so isolated from the man he talks about all the time. Later, when we go back to his flat, there is one CD out on top of the stereo. The Beatles: 1967-70. Greg is from George Martin's first marriage, which finished when he was five. There is another son, the good son, who works with his dad, from the second. Did he feel usurped?</p> <p>He suddenly forgets he's being interviewed, stops posturing. He says he was \"over-sensitive\" as a young man, \"never felt he was good enough\". He talks about how \"wounded\" his old mum was. \"Maybe that's why I'm drawn to slightly off kilter women. Ha. Ha. Ha.\" He talks about his stepmother with the rawness of a teenager. He can't believe his father didn't speak up for him last year. \"He could have said something and he didn't,\" says Martin. \"It wasn't simply because he chose to maintain a distance. I think he was frightened. He was made frightened by those around him. All I'll say about my dad,\" he says, \"is that if anybody appears to be pure as the driven snow don't believe it. If anyone appears to be the devil don't believe that either. Nobody is one or the other.\"</p> <p>His family nickname is Poggy. What does his father call him? \"Greg,\" he says coldly. We go back to his flat so he can give me some information about his new film company, Independence Films, and a tape of his appearance on Ellen.</p> <p>On the way, he talks about the recent story in the Express claiming his mother's house has been put in his name with a mortgage taken out on it. \"She did that of her own volition,\" he says. Though, he admits, his sister now isn't talking to him. He seems to have a habit of making enemies close to home. There are other family members out to get him, he says, \"including someone who's a prominent silk. Put that in. I want him to know I'm on to him.\"</p> <p>These are his real enemies he says. Not \"Tara, who is a bit player in a drama that is nothing to do with her, a spear carrier\". And what's the motive? \"I'm sorry to say, absolute malice and jealousy. Jealousy. Jealousy. Jealousy.\" Jealousy of what? \"My apparent prodigious success with women.\" He chuckles.</p> <p>Martin's flat is plain and featureless. It is brightened by two things: lots of photographs of his son, Connor, who lives in New Hampshire with his ex-wife, with whom he is on good terms. (His other marriage was arranged to secure a green card.) And a 24-year-old Italian girl called Vittoria, who is curled up on a chair saying \"Good Morning. Good Afternoon\" into a tape recorder. They are getting married in Rome later this year, though Martin must first convert to Catholicism. He is in the process of getting his two previous marriages annulled. Can you get two marriages annulled? \"Yeah,\" he says shortly. Then adds, \"Hey. I hope so.\"</p> <p>This relationship is going to last, he says. No more philandering. No more screwing around. Does he worry at all about the age difference? \"You think she's too young? For me? In your opinion?\" he barks. \"Look at Salman Rushdie. Look at Michael Douglas. Look at John Paul Getty. Vittoria is amazing. She's got the mind of a businesswoman. She thinks the book's hysterical. She's proud of my past. I bet someone will say he's only with this girl to clean up his image, but I feel in all honesty she is my reward for last year. The secret of a good relationship is that the person is your best friend and I've never had that. Until now.\" He pauses. \"Obviously a good sex life helps,\" he says. \"Personally, I couldn't have a good relationship without that.\"</p> <p>If in any doubt about their future together, about the laying of his past, he has the stars to help him. Martin is a firm believer in astrology. He says, looking at his chart, he should have seen what he was getting into last summer. \"It's as clear as daylight. Aquarius with Scorpio rising. Public crisis.\" As for the future, he's got a dodgy few days this week, but the beginning of April, when his book is published, is going to be good for him - and a \"lousy time\" for his enemies. \"So I'm looking forward to that.\"</p> <p>He also believes in reincarnation. Who does he think he'll come back as next time? \"Ha ha ha ha,\" he laughs. \"The Dalai Lama?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have a weakness for Latin women,\" says Greg Martin, halfway through my glass of wine. \"I love Latin women. I'm engaged now to an Italian girl. I just love people like that. And I mean, I'm a man. Like Zorba the Greek said, 'Aren't I a man? Aren't I stupid?' You know, I've got a libido. And when Tara walked in with Elton John that night, in that bikini and white sarong, she looked incredible. And she was really funny. She said Mick Jagger had said, 'Wanna come to Reykjavik with me?' and she'd said, 'I'll come if you can spell it.' And he said: 'I dunno. There's an \"h\" in there somewhere.' I thought that's very witty. She's witty.\" He drinks the other half of my wine. \"Oh, sorry,\" he says and returns to his own. He puffs his lips out in a noisy sigh. He rolls his denim-blue eyes. \" But I had no idea what I was getting into . I wish I'd known she was straight out of rehab. She's sweet but she's loopy, an overindulged, spoilt brat. Two weeks later I'm knocked for six. I'm a scumbag, serial-philandering pig. I'm a creepy Casanova. I'm a con man. Twice in the Daily Mail Tara called me a con man. I'd like to see her prove that in court.\" Greg Martin, 43, the eldest son of the record producer Sir George Martin, is the \"failed actor\" (\"What is a failed actor? Is a failed actor someone who's starred in a mini-series with Richard Burton and Faye Dunaway, who's done over 60 plays all over the world?\") who didn't marry Tara Palmer-Tomkinson last summer. They met at Jagger's 56th birthday party in the south of France. Martin was with another socialite, Sabrina Guinness (he calls me Sabrina a couple of times and winces). But minutes later, Palmer-Tomkinson, who had been making an It of herself, had scrawled \"Tara's getting married\" in lipstick on her handbag and the papers were full of their whirlwind romance. It was all over with the summer sales. Too many Latin women in the woodwork, not to mention American, Russian and Chinese, willing to sell their stories for the right price. Too many former marriages (one more than he had admitted to, anyway). Too many enemies. Maybe not quite enough money in the bank. Palmer-Tomkinson retreated to the bosom of her royally connected family. The portcullis came down. Society turned its back. And Martin, an ordinary red-blooded bachelor (\"Before all the names, I honestly, honestly, honestly, from my heart, thought I was pretty normal. I've always loved women, I adore the little darlings, and I thought most men were the same\") found himself, alone, in his rented flat in Knightsbridge, with certain \"business ventures\" in ruins, branded Love Rat, the James Hewitt of the Tatler-meets-Hello! reading classes. He's written a book now, a memoir called Dirty Rotten Scoundrel. As an attempt to re-establish his reputation it's a disaster. A diary of his years at Rada and in the film and TV business in the US (among other things, he starred in Ellis Island, and co-starred in Ellen) as well as the events of last year, it is full of \"birds\" and \"horny little slappers\", of \"sexy young blueblood vixens\", and \"gorgeous, sweet, hot-as-a-chilli-pepper-ridden-chicken-vindaloo beauties\". There is the time he slept with Madonna. The night he couldn't get it up with Sharon Stone. Tara and her G-string. But he has his defences ready. He said Tara stormed round recently and said, \"'How dare you exploit our relationship for your own publicity ends?' and I said, 'Excuse me, isn't that the way you've lived your life?'\" When I told him I found some of it a bit dubious, he said, \"Come on Sabrina, it's witty, it's humorous, it's tongue in cheek. I'm sending myself up. You know that.\" I got off lightly. Further down the bottle of wine, he tells me a female reviewer who didn't like it \"is probably a lonely middle-aged woman who can't get laid\". So why does one feel sorry for him? Is it because he looks identical to his father, the same stooping, lopsided gait, the same flop of hair, though the son dyes his (\"Yes, I do. So what? I've got bits of like silver in it and I'm too young. David Beckham dyes his\"), the same prominent cheekbones and Adam's apple? The same charm: walking down the street, he greets the flower-stall man and the Evening Standard vendor by name; he introduces me to the bloke who sells him cigarettes; when he smiles at the waitress in the wine bar, she giggles. Or is it because this resemblance is his downfall? Greg Martin may not have been what he appeared to be to the Palmer-Tomkinsons, but then he appears to be his father, whom he certainly isn't. George Martin: the English icon, the man who produced the Beatles in the maelstrom of the 60s and yet remained the embodiment of gentlemanliness and restraint. Just what an It Girl needs. \"He's a god,\" says his son simply. Or perhaps it's because he seems so isolated from the man he talks about all the time.

      "body": "<p>The increase in stamp duty of half a percentage point on houses worth \u00a3250,000 or more will do little to dampen the property boom in substantial areas of the UK. </p> <p>In contrast, property tax reform could have been extremely effective against this and other economic problems. The table shows the evolution of the UK house prices/earnings ratio and the south-east minus UK difference in this ratio since 1970. </p> <p>Many of the forces driving the market are comparable to those of the 1980s: higher incomes; easy loan conditions; relatively low interest rates; rises in financial asset prices; rises in house prices themselves which increase the equity cushion of owners; and the feeling of consumers that recent high rates of return in housing will continue. </p> <p>Spectacular rates of return are being achieved, because mortgage borrowers are gearing up and so investing relatively little of their own cash. With the high returns believed to be available by many in London and the south-east, the rise in stamp duty will do little to dampen the market. Paradoxically, the impact of stamp duty will be felt more strongly in the next housing market downturn, when it will reduce mobility and have a larger effect on rates of return. </p> <p>Property taxes are the most distorted part of the UK tax system. The current system is perverse: the largest houses in the most expensive locations, belonging to those with more than one home, attract the lowest tax rates. Moreover, small homes are proportionately the most highly taxed. Since almost half of those in the lowest tax band get council tax benefit, the tax also causes an unemployment trap. </p> <p>If someone in a \u00a340,000 house pays council tax of \u00a3500, the tax rate is 1.25%. The rate drops to 1.07% at \u00a370,000, 0.47% at \u00a3320,000, and to 0.15% at \u00a31m. Second or third houses attract only half the tax rate on first houses. </p> <p>The New Policy Institute has suggested ways of making council tax less grossly unfair. Reforms that we have suggested go further. </p> <p>They include allowing pensioners to defer council tax until the property is sold or it can be paid from their estate. This removes the biggest objection to a property tax, which is that pensioners in expensive houses often have little cash.

      "bodyText": "The increase in stamp duty of half a percentage point on houses worth \u00a3250,000 or more will do little to dampen the property boom in substantial areas of the UK. In contrast, property tax reform could have been extremely effective against this and other economic problems. The table shows the evolution of the UK house prices/earnings ratio and the south-east minus UK difference in this ratio since 1970. Many of the forces driving the market are comparable to those of the 1980s: higher incomes; easy loan conditions; relatively low interest rates; rises in financial asset prices; rises in house prices themselves which increase the equity cushion of owners; and the feeling of consumers that recent high rates of return in housing will continue. Spectacular rates of return are being achieved, because mortgage borrowers are gearing up and so investing relatively little of their own cash. With the high returns believed to be available by many in London and the south-east, the rise in stamp duty will do little to dampen the market. Paradoxically, the impact of stamp duty will be felt more strongly in the next housing market downturn, when it will reduce mobility and have a larger effect on rates of return. Property taxes are the most distorted part of the UK tax system. The current system is perverse: the largest houses in the most expensive locations, belonging to those with more than one home, attract the lowest tax rates. Moreover, small homes are proportionately the most highly taxed. Since almost half of those in the lowest tax band get council tax benefit, the tax also causes an unemployment trap. If someone in a \u00a340,000 house pays council tax of \u00a3500, the tax rate is 1.25%. The rate drops to 1.07% at \u00a370,000, 0.47% at \u00a3320,000, and to 0.15% at \u00a31m. Second or third houses attract only half the tax rate on first houses. The New Policy Institute has suggested ways of making council tax less grossly unfair. Reforms that we have suggested go further. They include allowing pensioners to defer council tax until the property is sold or it can be paid from their estate. This removes the biggest objection to a property tax, which is that pensioners in expensive houses often have little cash. We also propose regular revaluations and reducing the regional inequalities in council tax rates. A 35% income tax band could compensate the more affluent whose council tax bills would rise. For the macro-economy, such a package would have helped to halt speculative fever in the property hot-spots and slowed the growth in spending in those areas, allowing interest rates and the exchange rate to fall. Instead, sterling rose 1% against the euro after the Budget, in part reflecting the market view of what the monetary policy committee would have to do. The committee will surely push rates up only slowly, given the outcry over Rover and worries about other parts of manufacturing and agriculture which have to compete against continental Europe. And, with the public finances in good shape, gilt yields, against which fixed rate mortgages tend to be priced, will in any case remain low. The high exchange rate will raise relative unemployment and cut relative earnings in the west midlands and other parts of the economy more exposed to European competition. Migration to the south-east will be supported by these trends, despite increasingly high housing costs, in turn tending to sustain higher house prices there. A more level property tax playing field would have reduced many of these current and future problems - possibly saving Longbridge and Dagenham, and helping to rescue farmers from bankruptcy. It would also prevent the waste of resources symbolized by empty homes in the north and overbuilding in the south-east. \u0095 Gavin Cameron is a research fellow and John Muellbauer is professor of economics at Nuffield college, Oxford.",

Getting the pound down was what Labour governments did with metronomic regularity.

It means cheaper imports. It means more pesetas for the pound. Crudely, it means a stronger feelgood factor, while devaluation means a feelbad factor. Over the medium term, ministers would probably prefer the pound to be a bit lower than it is, but not by too much and certainly not too rapidly. </p> <p>The prime minister is broadly right about the lack of attractive options. Self-evidently, the best way to get the level of the pound down would be to cut interest rates, but that will only happen when the Bank of England is convinced cheaper borrowing is compatible with hitting the government's 2.5% inflation target.

Adding to the tax burden when the government is running hefty annual surpluses and is already under sustained (if fatuous) attack from the opposition for clearing up the budgetary mess left in 1997 lacks political appeal. As for cutting public spending, that is even more of a non-starter. </p> <p>Where critics of the government's exchange rate strategy have a point is when they say the Budget did little to help matters because a looser fiscal policy and a tight monetary policy tend to lead to a higher exchange rate. They are also right to say ministers would do well to stop wittering on about how well industry is coping with a strong pound, because the effect of that is to push the currency higher. </p> <p>Mr Blair is also part-right when he says industry is making a good fist of surviving, perhaps because survivors of the past quarter century know how to cut costs, boost productivity and stay competitive. While Friday's trade figures showed a deficit in trade in goods of \u00a38bn in the three months to January, all but \u00a31.3bn of this was with countries outside the European Union. During the period of sterling's appreciation against European currencies, its deficit in goods with the EU rose from \u00a34bn in 1997 to \u00a36.2bn in 1999. That is a substantial deterioration but dwarfed by what has happened to trade with the rest of the world, where the deficit has gone from \u00a37.9bn to \u00a320.4bn. </p> <p>Even so, appreciation of the pound against the euro is clearly having a deleterious effect on profit margins. But the government's view is that the problem is not sterling strength but euro weakness, which will eventually turn around, as sentiment changes on the foreign exchanges. That analysis has a ring of truth about it. Sterling has remained rock steady against the strong dollar since the mid-90s but has jumped by close on 20% against the euro since its launch 15 months ago. This has caused enthusiasts for Britain's membership of the single currency one or two headaches because their original sales pitch was Britain needed to join a strong euro as a bulwark against inflation. Now there has been a complete about-turn and immediate entry into a weak euro is vital to save jobs in manufacturing. </p> <p>The presumption that the euro is grotesquely under-valued and due for a sustained rally has been around for some time. There looks to be only one way for the dollar to go and that is down. There looks to be only one way for the euro to go and that is up. Nick Parsons at Commerzbank, for example believes that there is a herd mentality at work. At 0.96 to the dollar the euro is a sell because everybody is selling it, even though it looks cheap. However, if it rose to 1.06 everybody would be buying it, even though it would be 10% dearer. But, as Parsons says, as far as the foreign exchange markets are concerned a degree in behavioural psychology is more useful than a degree in economics. </p> <p>There are those who say there will be no early bounce in the euro. Marc Hendriks at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale says that a cursory glance at what is happening to euroland's capital account suggests the currency could have further to fall against the dollar. Direct investment into the single currency zone last year was about 25% down on the previous year, and there was a less favourable balance for portfolio flows. There was a an acceleration of equity outflows, which Hendriks puts down to diversification, while equity inflows were unchanged even though European shares looked cheap relative to those in the US. </p> <p>At the Bank, there is no longer the same confidence that the pound is about to fall against the euro. It is possible the pound will stay high for some time, increasing the chances of further high-profile manufacturing casualties. The Rover case has certainly caused some members of the government - especially those with a high concentration of exporters in their constituency - to think carefully about the implications of sterling's strength. Actually, the Longbridge saga was more about global economic trends than about currencies. The reason the plant had troubles was that it was less productive than other factories at a time when a global glut of cars has made brand loyalty all the more important. BMW had it; Rover did not. </p> <p>So where does the government go from here? Looking at what the government does rather than what it says, the strategy seems to be to try to skip an industrial generation. Deep down, ministers see no long-term future for industries where Britain has been struggling to keep up over the past three or four decades and would rather devote resources to boosting the sunrise industries of the third industrial revolution. These industries, based on innovation, are much less price sensitive because, as yet, there is no developing-country competition. </p> <p>The risk is that Britain does not cut it in the sunrise industries either and that, instead of humming with biotechnology companies, internet start-up firms and audio-visual entrepreneurs, the UK is transformed into Europe's offshore call centre.

But it has stopped short of recommending direct regulation of highly leveraged institutions (HLIs), primarily hedge funds. However, the group - set up under the auspices of the Financial Stability Forum, which is backed by the Group of Seven - warned that if its plans for tighter regulation proved ineffective it would look again at the idea of direct supervision. The inquiry into the regulation of highly leveraged institutions followed the near collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998. This raised concerns about potential risks to the world's financial system and about the impact HLIs could have on a number of small and medium size economies which were open to sharp movements in capital. The working group recommended a series of measures designed to counter the perceived risks. They include stronger risk management both for HLIs and the firms with which they do business and tougher regulation of institutions which provide them with credit.

We are careless with our best and most enjoyable seaside architecture. We let it fall to pieces, destroy it or undermine it, as if the sea itself were not threat enough. </p> <p>Now the same fate hangs over the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea, a Modern masterpiece that shares its Grade I listing with cathedrals and great country houses.</p> <p>This spacious, streamlined, light structure is a perfect foil to both the boisterous grey of the English Channel and the harsh brick Edwardian buildings that stretch along much of Bexhill's shoreline. When it opened on December 12, 1935, visitors felt as if they were inside an ocean liner. The walls were painted ivory-cream, the floors covered in cork or cream terrazzo. Diners sat on bentwood chairs at beechwood tables lit by Bauhaus globe lamps. The public had seen nothing like it.</p> <p>Sir Charles Reilly, then professor of architecture at Liverpool University, described the pavilion, with its welded-steel frame, as \"a revelation from another planet in the rococo redness of that terrible town\". More than six decades on, a recent poll for English Heritage ranked the De La Warr Pavilion the country's third best-loved building of the past 100 years.</p> <p>Since 1989 it has been cared for by the Pavilion Trust, established by Jill Theis, a former local councillor, and by Troughton McAslan, the architects charged with its renovation. But now Rother District Council is thinking of selling the place to the Watford-based pub chain JD Wetherspoon. Theis and her colleagues are not happy about it. Wetherspoon, they fear, may not respect the spirit of this rare and elegant structure, and the sale itself ignores its special history as a public building.</p> <p>Arts minister Alan Howarth recently said he was \"strongly opposed\" to the proposal to turn the building over to a commercial concern. But this is the choice: cultural centre with sun and fun included at a cost of \u00a3750,000 a year, or a commercially-driven leisure centre (including a 1,000-seat theatre) revolving around a pub. The council wants to reduce running costs for local taxpayers, but the trust is already in negotiation with the Arts Council, which says it has earmarked \u00a34m to help guarantee the building's future. A previous bid for lottery money was rejected, though it is hard to understand why.</p> <p>In Wetherspoon's favour, it must be said that it is unlikely to damage the pavilion. The company has a policy of taking over impressive buildings, especially ones, like old banks and post offices, that appeared to have little future until bars and pubs started moving in 10 or 15 years ago.</p> <p>Wetherspoon has also won Civic Trust and Camra/English Heritage awards for the design of its pubs. \"When we took a look at the old opera house in Tunbridge Wells some years ago,\" says spokesman Eddie Gerschon, \"we were attacked in no uncertain terms: we would do this and that to destroy the place. In fact, the opera house had been left to rot for quite some time and had been a bingo hall. We took it on, looked after it and some months later some of the same people who had berated us were instrumental in our winning a Civic Trust award.\" He also proudly cites the Commercial Rooms in Bristol, the Half Moon in east London and the Billiard Hall in West Bromwich. \"About 15 per cent of our buildings are listed. We do care about them.\"</p> <p>Fair enough, but the De La Warr pavilion is not some neglected white elephant. Since its restoration over the past decade, it has offered a programme of music, dances, theatre, children's shows, comedy, conferences (on architecture, especially), as well a place for the famously elderly population of Bexhill to while away the afternoon.</p> <p>But there's more than a building or a local resource at stake here. There's a fascinating history that should not be reduced to a series of prints on a bar wall. It began in the early 30s when the town invited private companies to come up with a design and programme for a new leisure development on the seafront. The local grandee, Earl de la Warr, a wealthy socialist, stepped in with his influence and chequebook (to the tune of \u00a3100,000). He persuaded the council that it should develop the site itself. A new publicly owned building would be designed only after a competition was held and judged according to rules established by the Royal Institute of British Architects.</p> <p>This was the first significant competition in Britain that called specifically for a Modern building. There were no fewer than 230 entries, but the contract was finally awarded to Erich Mendelsohn, who had arrived in England from Nazi Germany just three months before, and the flamboyant Serge Chermayeff, an interior designer and ballroom dancer. Chermayeff was all but unknown; Mendelsohn, however, was considered to be one of Weimar Germany's finest architects.</p> <p>Born in Allenstein, East Prussia in 1887, he made his name with a sequence of at first curious and then magnificent streamlined buildings. His Schocken department store in Chemnitz led directly to William Crabtree's Peter Jones store in Chelsea. But, while Peter Jones stands unchanged today, the Schocken store was obliterated by Allied bombers; Nazi bombers, meanwhile, strafed Bexhill-on-Sea, winging the pavilion.</p> <p>Mendelsohn and Chermayeff were, of course, delighted by their victory. Not so some of their British colleagues, who wrote aggressive letters to the Architects' Journal attacking the design by these \"aliens\". An article in Fascist Week railed, inevitably, against the employment of German and Russian Jews.</p> <p>Mendelsohn and Chermayeff set to work all the same, ably assisted by the likes of Peter Moro (who later worked on the design of the Royal Festival Hall, which was greatly influenced by the pavilion), Felix Samuely and Cyril Sweett, a quantity surveyor specialising in Modern design. What they produced was the first modern \"people's palace\".</p> <p>So it's easy to understand why those who have fought so hard to bring the De La Warr pavilion back to life are worried about it being taken out of public ownership. JD Wetherspoon, with 370 pubs under its belt, may well insist that it works with architects \"whose job is to respect the architecture and make each pub look different from the next\". But this is one of our most important 20th-century buildings.</p> <p>Meanwhile, deep inland, the residents of Hinchley Wood in Surrey have succeeded in saving their pub from being turned into a McDonald's. There are already 1,116 branches of the burger joint in Britain. Suddenly Wetherspoon seems like small beer. If not in Bexhill-on-Sea.</p>",
