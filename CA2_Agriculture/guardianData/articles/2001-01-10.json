He crosses for Owen in space inside the area but the Liverpool striker snatches at the shot and puts it over.

Gerard shrugs off Rubins on the half-way line and lobs the ball over the top to release Heskey. And guess what? Heskey puts it over. Palace's night maybe.<br> <strong>23</strong> Indeed it could be as great work by Austin in the Liverpool area opens the game up for the home side.<br> <strong>26</strong> The crowd crank it up as Forssell crosses from the left to Morrison. Morrison shoots with his right from just outside the area to force a flying save by Westerveld.<br> <strong>27</strong> Forssell has a great chance to score but can only win a corner. Austin charges into the area to head just wide of the far post.<br> <strong>31</strong> Great spell for Palace as they win a free-kick 30 yards out. Rodger takes but the ball is cleared after a brief spell of head tennis.<br> <strong>32</strong> Smith tries to find Austin on the far post from deep on the right but Liverpool clear.<br> <strong>33</strong> Heskey and Owen play a lovely double one-two on the edge of the Palace area, but the keeper comes out to claim as Owen turns goes for goal.<br> <strong>38</strong> Palace win a free-kick - high and deep into the area. Liverpool clear as far as Thompson; he finds Mullins deep on the right, who crosses for Morrison to shoot early and high from the edge of the area when he should have waited for the ball come down.<br> <strong>43</strong> Where everything was going Liverpool's way early in the half, every ball that bounces now appears to be going to Palace.<br> <strong>45</strong> Liverpool work the ball around the Palace half. Murphy holds it up on the edge of the area before laying it back for Gerard to shoot wide of the left-hand upright. The half winds up with Owen breaking into the area shadowed by the ever-present Zhiyi, who forces the Liverpool striker to poke the ball wide of the near post. <strong>Half-time</strong> Palace have recovered well. The game is now evenly balanced and Liverpool have only themselves to blame for not having wrapped things up already.</p> <p> <strong>46</strong> Palace get the second half underway with a punt up to Westerveld in the Liverpool goal.<br> <strong>48</strong> Palace corner from the left; played short and then centred for Austin to shoot - comes to nothing.<br> <strong>49</strong> Carragher plays Owen into the Palace area but Zhiyi forces him out to the touchline.<br> <strong>50</strong> Owen unlucky not to get on the end of Heskey's flick-on from the edge of the area before Zhiyi clears.<br> <strong>53</strong> Liverpool break to the edge of the area for Gerard to shoot early; Kolinko saves.<br> <strong>54</strong> Owen finally gets away from Zhiyi but can only hit Kolinko's legs as he tries to lift it over. Resulting corner comes to nothing.<br> <strong>56 GOAL: Crystal Palace 1 - 0 Liverpool</strong> Henchoz the culprit as he gives the ball away in his own area. Rubins charges away to the left and shoots early with his left to beat Westerveld at the far post. A blinder.<br> <strong>59</strong> Free-kick to Palace after Morrison is hacked down by Henchoz 30 yards out. Comes to nothing.<br> <strong>61</strong> Liverpool break, but Palace chase well to clear before Hyppia plays in an offside Barmby to shoot wide. <br> <strong>62</strong> Forssell ducks and dives into the Liverpool area before shooting a yard wide of the far post.<br> <strong>64 Substitutions</strong> Litmanen and Smicer on for Murphy and Owen.<br> <strong>67</strong> Free-kick to Liverpool just outside the Palace area but the home sdie clear with ease. Palace then wiin a free-kick deep on the right but it comes to nothing.<br> <strong>70</strong> Liverpool miss two golden chances in a row. Barmby's the greatest clanger when he fails the score when one on one with Kolinko. Litmanen provided the pass but then makes a hash of his second attempt after Barmby's miss.<br> <strong>73</strong> Liverpool now effectively playing four up front with Barmby coming straight through the middle. Not that it does much good as Palace dig themselves into the Liverpool half with Houllier's men unable to clear.<br> <strong>77 GOAL: Crystal Palace 2 - 0 Liverpool</strong> Palace pressure plays off as Forssell stops dead a cross just inside the area for Morrison to put Palace two up. <br> <strong>78 GOAL: Crystal Palace 2 - 1 Liverpool</strong> Litmanen the provider as he races to the by-line and pulls the ball back from just inside the area for Smicer to bring some respectability to Liverpool's visit to South London.<br> <strong>84</strong> Liverpool belatedly get themselves together in search of a result and Palace are left chasing shadows as they try and hold out for the final whistle.<br> <strong>86</strong> Dodgy moment for Liverpool as Henchoz clears a Morrison cross from the hands of Westerveld.<br> <strong>90</strong> Palace refusing to give up as they attempt to keep the ball in the Liverpool half. Two minutes extra to play. Palace corner comes to nothing but the ball finds its way back into the area for Forssell to direct a weak header at Westerveld. <br>Full-time<br>Crystal Palace 2 - 1 Liverpool</p>",

Gerard shrugs off Rubins on the half-way line and lobs the ball over the top to release Heskey. And guess what? Heskey puts it over. Palace's night maybe. 23 Indeed it could be as great work by Austin in the Liverpool area opens the game up for the home side. 26 The crowd crank it up as Forssell crosses from the left to Morrison. Morrison shoots with his right from just outside the area to force a flying save by Westerveld. 27 Forssell has a great chance to score but can only win a corner. Austin charges into the area to head just wide of the far post. 31 Great spell for Palace as they win a free-kick 30 yards out. Rodger takes but the ball is cleared after a brief spell of head tennis. 32 Smith tries to find Austin on the far post from deep on the right but Liverpool clear. 33 Heskey and Owen play a lovely double one-two on the edge of the Palace area, but the keeper comes out to claim as Owen turns goes for goal. 38 Palace win a free-kick - high and deep into the area. Liverpool clear as far as Thompson; he finds Mullins deep on the right, who crosses for Morrison to shoot early and high from the edge of the area when he should have waited for the ball come down. 43 Where everything was going Liverpool's way early in the half, every ball that bounces now appears to be going to Palace. 45 Liverpool work the ball around the Palace half. Murphy holds it up on the edge of the area before laying it back for Gerard to shoot wide of the left-hand upright. The half winds up with Owen breaking into the area shadowed by the ever-present Zhiyi, who forces the Liverpool striker to poke the ball wide of the near post. Half-time Palace have recovered well. The game is now evenly balanced and Liverpool have only themselves to blame for not having wrapped things up already. 46 Palace get the second half underway with a punt up to Westerveld in the Liverpool goal. 48 Palace corner from the left; played short and then centred for Austin to shoot - comes to nothing. 49 Carragher plays Owen into the Palace area but Zhiyi forces him out to the touchline. 50 Owen unlucky not to get on the end of Heskey's flick-on from the edge of the area before Zhiyi clears. 53 Liverpool break to the edge of the area for Gerard to shoot early; Kolinko saves. 54 Owen finally gets away from Zhiyi but can only hit Kolinko's legs as he tries to lift it over. Resulting corner comes to nothing. 56 GOAL: Crystal Palace 1 - 0 Liverpool Henchoz the culprit as he gives the ball away in his own area. Rubins charges away to the left and shoots early with his left to beat Westerveld at the far post. A blinder. 59 Free-kick to Palace after Morrison is hacked down by Henchoz 30 yards out. Comes to nothing. 61 Liverpool break, but Palace chase well to clear before Hyppia plays in an offside Barmby to shoot wide. 62 Forssell ducks and dives into the Liverpool area before shooting a yard wide of the far post. 64 Substitutions Litmanen and Smicer on for Murphy and Owen. 67 Free-kick to Liverpool just outside the Palace area but the home sdie clear with ease. Palace then wiin a free-kick deep on the right but it comes to nothing. 70 Liverpool miss two golden chances in a row. Barmby's the greatest clanger when he fails the score when one on one with Kolinko. Litmanen provided the pass but then makes a hash of his second attempt after Barmby's miss. 73 Liverpool now effectively playing four up front with Barmby coming straight through the middle. Not that it does much good as Palace dig themselves into the Liverpool half with Houllier's men unable to clear. 77 GOAL: Crystal Palace 2 - 0 Liverpool Palace pressure plays off as Forssell stops dead a cross just inside the area for Morrison to put Palace two up. 78 GOAL: Crystal Palace 2 - 1 Liverpool Litmanen the provider as he races to the by-line and pulls the ball back from just inside the area for Smicer to bring some respectability to Liverpool's visit to South London. 84 Liverpool belatedly get themselves together in search of a result and Palace are left chasing shadows as they try and hold out for the final whistle. 86 Dodgy moment for Liverpool as Henchoz clears a Morrison cross from the hands of Westerveld. 90 Palace refusing to give up as they attempt to keep the ball in the Liverpool half. Two minutes extra to play. Palace corner comes to nothing but the ball finds its way back into the area for Forssell to direct a weak header at Westerveld. Full-time Crystal Palace 2 - 1 Liverpool",

What is an \"affordable tax cut\" when Labour's own slogan admits there is still so much to do? No tax cut is affordable in this under-taxed, under-spent land unless it is a redistribution of the current burden from the broadest shoulders of the highest earners to the lowest earners. (Why not consider the Lib Dem policy of taxing more from the over \u00a3100,000 bracket?) If Labour says \"affordable\" tax cuts are desirable, they concede too much ground to Tory ideology.

In the cascade of facts and factoids, none of them outright lies, none the whole truth, all requiring adept deconstruction, yesterday's opening salvoes produced two choice ones on each side. Tories say Labour has taxed an extra \u00a3670 off the typical \"hard-working\" family. Labour replies: \"On average the typical family with children will be \u00a3850 better off.\" Who is right? Both and neither. First, the Tory \u00a3670: if total taxes have risen some 2% under Labour, dividing the extra \u00a320bn a year by the 28m national households produces roughly that sum, agrees the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But it gets more complicated: the Tories have added in a notional \u00a3400 a year that people would need to pay into their pensions to cover the devious stealth tax stolen from pension funds. Right? Not quite. Pension funds have boomed by 70% in the last three buoyant years and many are actually in surplus so need no topping up. On further inspection, the Tory figure gets worse. They have used a couple on \u00a340,000 - in the top 10% of earners. They have failed to add in \u00a3500 arriving to a couple with children next April or the \u00a383 cut in national insurance they've already had. They have added a notional \u00a3193 for smoking 20 cigarettes a day.</p> <p>So is Labour's \u00a3850 figure right? No, not altogether. Labour adds up the extra income coming directly to all families with children. But they have left out indirect taxes on petrol, cigarettes or drink, claiming it is too difficult to guess what a \"typical\" family might consume. Does that mean families are worse off under Labour? No. National average earnings have risen by 10% over the last three boom years, a million more people are in work and large extra sums have been paid out directly to poorer families and pensioners. All average earners with children will also get a new \u00a310 a week child tax credit in their pay packets in April. On top of that, lower interest rates mean mortgage payers have gained an average \u00a31,000 a year. No one, including the IFS has yet attempted a total profit and loss calculation on all this, but there is no doubt that virtually all voters have been winners, and most by quite a lot, even if some hardship cases like poor tennant farmers or the unemployed without children did see their living standards drop.</p> <p>Crooked figures will be rife. Take Mr Hague's claim yesterday that more patients are waiting for operations: \"Four years later waiting lists are 55,000 higher.\" True? No. Waiting lists for operations have fallen by over 130,000, which is 30,000 more than promised at the election. Ah, the Tories reply, but waiting lists for out-patient appointments have risen by 188,000. Deduct the 130,000 from that, and you end up with a 55,000 increase. Fair? Not really. Only 40% of those waiting for out-patient appointments ever need an operation, and the Tories have no idea how long they have been waiting. The number waiting is of no interest to patients, only how long they must wait. In the fog of electioneering, very few figures are what they seem but the battleground will be just such disputed performance figures.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Hague promised that \"in the coming weeks Conservatives will demonstrate how we can improve public services and cut taxes\". How is the magic trick to be done? So far their confection of imaginary savings has been an entertaining porridge of bogus figures looking for savings where few voters will notice - lone parents, industrial injuries, crack -downs on fraud - all airy impossibilities that pass unscrutinised because no one thinks they can win.</p> <p>For Labour, fantasy Tory accounting is beside the point. In the real world where a Labour win is certain, the serious question is what now to say to the electors. On Frost's sofa and again yesterday, Tony Blair seemed to be marching out ahead of his chancellor, talking up spending, decrying Tory tax cuts. No more big tent, no more tugging on both ends of the rope. Prime ministerial sources volunteer the thought that Mr Brown's 1p income tax cut had zero political impact when it arrived last April, money thrown away. By then politics had moved on: public services are the only issue.</p> <p>Yet still the chancellor continues to talk of \"targeted tax cuts\" to come. This is a question Labour must resolve immediately. Last-minute tax cuts in March instead of every penny spent on public services will only encourage the dangerous public cynicism that is Labour's only real threat.

No tax cut is affordable in this under-taxed, under-spent land unless it is a redistribution of the current burden from the broadest shoulders of the highest earners to the lowest earners. (Why not consider the Lib Dem policy of taxing more from the over \u00a3100,000 bracket?) If Labour says \"affordable\" tax cuts are desirable, they concede too much ground to Tory ideology.

Tories say Labour has taxed an extra \u00a3670 off the typical \"hard-working\" family. Labour replies: \"On average the typical family with children will be \u00a3850 better off.\" Who is right? Both and neither. First, the Tory \u00a3670: if total taxes have risen some 2% under Labour, dividing the extra \u00a320bn a year by the 28m national households produces roughly that sum, agrees the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But it gets more complicated: the Tories have added in a notional \u00a3400 a year that people would need to pay into their pensions to cover the devious stealth tax stolen from pension funds. Right? Not quite. Pension funds have boomed by 70% in the last three buoyant years and many are actually in surplus so need no topping up. On further inspection, the Tory figure gets worse. They have used a couple on \u00a340,000 - in the top 10% of earners. They have failed to add in \u00a3500 arriving to a couple with children next April or the \u00a383 cut in national insurance they've already had.

Does that mean families are worse off under Labour? No. National average earnings have risen by 10% over the last three boom years, a million more people are in work and large extra sums have been paid out directly to poorer families and pensioners. All average earners with children will also get a new \u00a310 a week child tax credit in their pay packets in April. On top of that, lower interest rates mean mortgage payers have gained an average \u00a31,000 a year.

Ah, the Tories reply, but waiting lists for out-patient appointments have risen by 188,000. Deduct the 130,000 from that, and you end up with a 55,000 increase. Fair? Not really. Only 40% of those waiting for out-patient appointments ever need an operation, and the Tories have no idea how long they have been waiting.

      "bodyText": "Election time is upon us, season of lists of doubtful truthfulness. One thousand Tory posters went up all over the country bearing the message: \"You paid the tax, so where's all the money gone?\" William Hague's speech, using his usual quaintly dated slang, claimed the people have been \"clobbered\" by Labour taxes. Meanwhile down in Bristol Tony Blair opened fire with his own list of facts, enumerating all Labour's triumphs so far. Here is the shape of the election to come, to be fought as a tug of war between lower tax and higher public spending. Or so it should be. But in these opening stages both sides are trying to tug on both ends of the rope, each pointing eagerly to the other's contradictions. The Tories chant that there is too little to show for all the high expectations and extra tax levied by Labour. They have a point, with so much still left undone. But every time they point to the famines and chasms in public services, they remind the voter of 18 years of private tax cuts and public neglect. Every time they promise \"a Conservative government will reduce taxes\", the ghost of Tory public services past looms. But Labour's riposte is hamstrung by its own ambivalence on tax. Gordon Brown remains unable to admit in public or to the Treasury select committee that he has actually put up taxes, let alone that tax is a public good. Instead his people stick to his old mantra, the three Brownite objectives - low and stable interest rates, more public investment and then - yes, it's still there - \"affordable tax cuts\". What is an \"affordable tax cut\" when Labour's own slogan admits there is still so much to do?

      "body": "<p>The day after my birthday I have to admit we were pretty lazy - although I think it was well deserved! In the evening we went out for a belated birthday dinner to a place called Pontoons on Darling Harbour - already one of my favourite areas in Sydney. Dinner was pretty reasonable, although the drinks were more pricey. Besides staying up late chatting at the hostel, we didn't really do much that evening, as we were determined to get up early and be active the next day. </p> <p>The following morning we took the popular but still pretty walk from Bondai to Coogee beach. It was fairly easy, only complicated by my insistance that we take the more difficult route across the rocks for a challenge. I had a double reason for wanting to get to Coogee - I'm hoping to settle there for a short while to find work, as Sydney is too large and crowded for my liking. </p> <p>Stopping for a drink at the huge Coogee Bay Hotel, I definitely felt this was somewhere I could stay; the whole atmosphere just seemed that bit more relaxed than Sydney and it sits on the beach, which is a bonus. </p> <p> In the evening we attempted to cook dinner at the hostel. This is harder than it sounds, as Glebe Village must boast the worst kitchen facilities I've seen - there are no plates, cups or cutlery (although they do have a bafflingly large selection of carving forks). After consuming our meal of pasta and stir-fried fresh vegetables, which felt nutritionally good, we settled in for an evening's drinking. There's a pretty nice atmosphere in Glebe and a good number of outdoor tables, so evenings can be happily spent in this way (with the bonus that it's pretty cheap entertainment). </p> <p>The next day I had an inexplicable low day, which I occasionally seem to suffer from. By now, I've got used to my various emotions but I'm not so sure that Josh was prepared for it! Still, besides that, he tells me that I haven't changed at all in the last month, aside from being more independent. I'm yet to decide if this is a good thing or not. </p> <p> New Year's Eve in Sydney was always going to be a significant night for me. That evening, a few of us at the hostel organised a barbeque for the early evening, which really topped off my successful morning's shopping. It was incredible how much food we managed to cook between the eight of us - and even more impressive how much we managed to eat! I can honestly say I've not had that big a meal since leaving home - but it was a special day, after all. In the evening we followed the millions into the city centre to enjoy the various free events put on in Sydney. </p> <p>Despite being restricted to where we could go by the 'no alcohol' areas, and the unbelievable amount of people who'd appeared as if from nowhere, we still managed to listen to a bit of live jazz before heading to Circular Quay for the first round of fireworks. These were spectacular, but were surpassed by the display a few hours later to call in 2001. Fireworks were going off in every direction, including a golden waterfall under the harbour bridge. The display ended with the rainbow spirit, an Australian symbol of unity, and the crowds went wild. It really was one of the best New Year's Eve celebrations I've ever seen - but it was definitely good to not be alone. I hope Sue and Sam found some good company during what could have been a lonely time of year. </p> <p>On New Year's Day we got up early (seriously!) to lounge in the sun in the Botanical Gardens. Also, one of our dorm-mates scares us, so it's always nice to get away. In the afternoon we watched the 100 year federation parade. It was a spectacle of weird and wonderful floats celebrating the history of Australia, which was very long but ultimately enjoyable. And if anyone can tell me why Estonia appeared in the middle that will solve a great mystery. The evening was spent watching the live music and street theatre around Darling Harbour - this really is a buzzing time of year to be in Sydney. </p> <p> The next day, we were determined to complete the more challenging walk from Manly Beach to Spit Bridge. Getting up early(ish), we caught the packed ferry to Manly, which is a lovely journey in itself. Stopping for lunch there, I got to check out the beach, which is claimed to be the best in Sydney - and I have to say, it was pretty beautiiful, if even more crowded than Bondai had been. Grabbing a map, we set off on what should have been a nine kilometre walk - although the way we did it, it was significantly longer. I would definitely recommend it - we came across some spectacular views and saw some Aboriginal carvings as well as parrots, lizards and an unidentified spider all in the space of an afternoon. One tip - take plenty of water. We ran out two kilometres before we came to a shop and were seriously dehydrated by the time we got there. The Australian sun can be pretty relentless at times. </p> <p>The following day was our check-out day from Glebe, and our chance to escape the hordes for the Blue Mountains. Catching the train from Central to Katoomba, we arrived, as usual, without having booked anywhere to stay. Finding an advert for a place called Wollangambe Lodge in a backpacker magazine, we gave it a call. After a long chat with the owner Shaun, we realised this place was truly in the middle of nowhere - but we both wanted to give it a try. In fact, it's so remote we were told to bring all our groceries with us, and to request to get off at Bell station, as it is so seldom used. This gave Josh just enough time to try a kangaroo burger at the cafe in Katoomba, which was delicious, with a taste closer to steak or venison than chicken. When we arrived at Bell, Shaun himself picked us up in his van, which rattled as though it would fall apart when it went round the bends. </p> <p>Every hostel is always a new experience, but this one tops the lot. Set deep within the bush in a town that was a once thriving community but now has only five houses, you really couldn't get further away from it all. It felt more like a house than a hostel, with the kitchen, bathroom and living room (complete with open fire) shared by everyone, including Shaun and his son. The only other residents were an American named Scott who'd been there for months, and a Dutch couple who arrived the same night as us bearing a tent. This hostel had no rules and no key deposit - because there was no key. </p> <p>In the morning Shaun went to work, leaving us to amble round as we pleased. That first evening he took me and Josh for a walk down from his back yard to see some stunning views across valleys, and later that night we stayed up cooking, drinking, and chatting about the walks and the history of the area. We could tell we were going to love staying here, even though it was only for a couple of days. </p> <p>Until next week (when I'll be having fun in the Blue Mountains), <br>Milly.</p>",

      "byline": "Sean Ingle and Scott Murray",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>WORLD'S FASTEST SENDING OFF</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Can you tell me who holds the world record for the fastest sending off (excluding substitutes)?\"</strong> asks Candy Stephens</p> <p>We've had plenty of suggestions, but not much of a consensus. However, these facts hold true:</p> <p>1) The fastest sending-off during a World Cup match is - as many of you point out - Uruguay's Jose Batista, who was red carded after 56 seconds against Scotland during Mexico 86. </p> <p>2) The fastest sending in British football is held by Sheffield Wednesday keeper Kevin Pressman - who was sent off after just 13 seconds for handling a shot from Wolverhampton's Temuri Ketsbaia outside the area during the opening weekend of this season.</p> <p>3) But that time is beaten by Bologna's Giuseppe Lorenzo - who as Peter De Gryse points out - was sent off after just 10 seconds for striking an opponent in an Italian league match against Parma on December 9th, 1990. </p> <p>And if you want to include substitutions, then Walter Boyd (of Jamaica and Swansea) also merits a mention. Last season, Boyd came on just as the Swans were about to take a free-kick - but before it could be taken he became involved in some argy-bargy on the edge of the box, cuffed his opponent and was sent off after a total of 0 seconds. Thanks to Simon Adams for that.</p> <p><strong>SHARING THE GOALS AROUND</strong></p> <p><strong>When, I am sorry to say, Cardiff beat Exeter 6-1 on New Year's Day, there were seven Cardiff players each on the scoresheet (they scored ours for us). Has such a democratic sharing of goals ever been matched or exceeded in the past? </strong> asks Stephen Pepper</p> <p>When Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 9-0 during the 1989-90 season, eight different players found the net, a top-flight record.</p> <p>Steve Nicol opened and closed the scoring, with Steve McMahon, Ian Rush, Gary Gillespie, Peter Beardsley, John Aldridge, John Barnes and Glenn Hysen filling their boots in between.</p> <p>To add to Palace's misery, Geoff Thomas missed a penalty. What a nice end to the tale there would have been if the vanquished could have taken revenge in a high-profile Cup tie later that season ...</p> <p><strong>MURPHY'S LAW</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Was Danny Murphy the first Englishman to score against Manchester United in the Premiership this season?\"</strong> asks Neil Walters</p> <p>Yes, he was. Before Murphy's cracking curler of a free-kick in Liverpool's 1-0 defeat of the Red Devils, you have to go back to May 6 2000, when Chris Armstrong scored for Spurs during their 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford, for the last Englishman to score against United in the Premiership.</p> <p><strong>WHICH CROONER PLAYED FOR REAL MADRID?</strong></p> <p><strong>Which pop star played in goal for Real Madrid?</strong> asks Chris</p> <p>Julio Iglesias, the man who crooned classics such as To All The Girls I've Loved Before and Begin The Beguine, is your man. And a damn fine sexy man at that.</p> <p>The hairy-chested Spanish crooner played in goal for Real Madrid's youth team during the early 1960s. But in 1963, the young keeper was involved in a near-fatal car crash on the night before his 20th birthday which rendered him paralysed for over two years.</p> <p>Sadly, Iglesias's footballing career was over. But during his convalescence, he learnt to play guitar, discovered his talent for singing and the rest is history, etc. and so on.</p> <p><strong>TAFFAREL'S STRIKING CONFESSION</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Was Taffarel, the Brazil keeper during the last World Cup, playing as a striker for some remote European team prior to the tournament? I have a vague memory of one of the commentators saying something about it but I'm not sure?\"</strong> says Simon Cook</p> <p>Yes he did. According to Hugh Johnston: \"A couple of years ago Taffarel was out of contract and couldn't get a new one so to keep himself sharp and fit he played up front for his local church team in Italy. Can't remember what they were called though,\" he adds. Can anyone else help?</p> <p><strong>WHO HAS WON SUCCESSIVE FA CUPS WITH DIFFERENT TEAMS?</strong></p> <p><strong>Can you think of a player who has been in a winning FA Cup side two years running but for different teams each time?

      "bodyText": "WORLD'S FASTEST SENDING OFF \"Can you tell me who holds the world record for the fastest sending off (excluding substitutes)?\" asks Candy Stephens We've had plenty of suggestions, but not much of a consensus. However, these facts hold true: 1) The fastest sending-off during a World Cup match is - as many of you point out - Uruguay's Jose Batista, who was red carded after 56 seconds against Scotland during Mexico 86. 2) The fastest sending in British football is held by Sheffield Wednesday keeper Kevin Pressman - who was sent off after just 13 seconds for handling a shot from Wolverhampton's Temuri Ketsbaia outside the area during the opening weekend of this season. 3) But that time is beaten by Bologna's Giuseppe Lorenzo - who as Peter De Gryse points out - was sent off after just 10 seconds for striking an opponent in an Italian league match against Parma on December 9th, 1990. And if you want to include substitutions, then Walter Boyd (of Jamaica and Swansea) also merits a mention. Last season, Boyd came on just as the Swans were about to take a free-kick - but before it could be taken he became involved in some argy-bargy on the edge of the box, cuffed his opponent and was sent off after a total of 0 seconds. Thanks to Simon Adams for that. SHARING THE GOALS AROUND When, I am sorry to say, Cardiff beat Exeter 6-1 on New Year's Day, there were seven Cardiff players each on the scoresheet (they scored ours for us). Has such a democratic sharing of goals ever been matched or exceeded in the past? asks Stephen Pepper When Liverpool beat Crystal Palace 9-0 during the 1989-90 season, eight different players found the net, a top-flight record. Steve Nicol opened and closed the scoring, with Steve McMahon, Ian Rush, Gary Gillespie, Peter Beardsley, John Aldridge, John Barnes and Glenn Hysen filling their boots in between. To add to Palace's misery, Geoff Thomas missed a penalty. What a nice end to the tale there would have been if the vanquished could have taken revenge in a high-profile Cup tie later that season ... MURPHY'S LAW \"Was Danny Murphy the first Englishman to score against Manchester United in the Premiership this season?\" asks Neil Walters Yes, he was. Before Murphy's cracking curler of a free-kick in Liverpool's 1-0 defeat of the Red Devils, you have to go back to May 6 2000, when Chris Armstrong scored for Spurs during their 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford, for the last Englishman to score against United in the Premiership. WHICH CROONER PLAYED FOR REAL MADRID? Which pop star played in goal for Real Madrid? asks Chris Julio Iglesias, the man who crooned classics such as To All The Girls I've Loved Before and Begin The Beguine, is your man. And a damn fine sexy man at that. The hairy-chested Spanish crooner played in goal for Real Madrid's youth team during the early 1960s. But in 1963, the young keeper was involved in a near-fatal car crash on the night before his 20th birthday which rendered him paralysed for over two years. Sadly, Iglesias's footballing career was over. But during his convalescence, he learnt to play guitar, discovered his talent for singing and the rest is history, etc. and so on. TAFFAREL'S STRIKING CONFESSION \"Was Taffarel, the Brazil keeper during the last World Cup, playing as a striker for some remote European team prior to the tournament? I have a vague memory of one of the commentators saying something about it but I'm not sure?\" says Simon Cook Yes he did. According to Hugh Johnston: \"A couple of years ago Taffarel was out of contract and couldn't get a new one so to keep himself sharp and fit he played up front for his local church team in Italy. Can't remember what they were called though,\" he adds. Can anyone else help? WHO HAS WON SUCCESSIVE FA CUPS WITH DIFFERENT TEAMS? Can you think of a player who has been in a winning FA Cup side two years running but for different teams each time? The person's name (either first or last) should be the make or model of a car. It might be a vague link, though. asks Alan Steele Have you been doing pub quizzes, Alan? The man you're after is Brian Talbot, who was in Ipswich's 1978 Cup-winning side. A year later, Talbot, now with Arsenal, could be seen at the Wembley showpiece looking pretty narked - and with good reason. He scoring the opening goal against Manchester United in the 1979 final, but received none of the credit from his team-mates, who all charged off after Alan Sunderland instead. He still got a winner's medal, mind, as Arsenal won 3-2 thanks to a late goal from ... Alan Sunderland. HIGHEST PREMIERSHIP NUMBER \"What is the highest shirt number that has been used in the Premiership or Nationwide League?\" \"Swindon Town, when they were in the Premiership, went through loads of shirt numbers,\" says Lee Stickings. \"And a certain Brian Kilcline, complete with sideburns et al, was wearing a number 62 shirt.\" CAN YOU HELP? \"When was the last time that two brothers scored in the same match, either in the same team or opposite?\" asks Derek Tonkin \"What is the longest period either in games or time that the newly-crowned World Champions have remained unbeaten after winning their title? England were soon beaten by Scotland, and France have lost a few games. Has any team remained unbeaten until they defended their crown in the following World Cup?\" asks Iwan Fox \"Which English football teams have had the best away form over a season?

      "body": "<p>Council housing services have deteriorated in the past year, possibly due to the lack of a full-scale housing inspectorate, figures from the audit commission reveal today. </p> <p>Overall, local councils' delivery of education and social services by contrast have improved, the commission reports. Both of these services are subject to tough inspections, based on best practice and monitoring performance. </p> <p>The commission also reports deep dissatisfaction from the public at the absence of police foot patrols; less than one in five people surveyed were happy at the number of \"bobbies on the beat\". </p> <p>The annual audit commission survey, of more than 100 key performance indicators, covers council services provided in the 12 months to March 2000. Since then the government has introduced its \"best value\" regime requiring councils to monitor the competitiveness of their services. </p> <p>The study shows only 88% of council housing repairs are completed within government time limits, and the number of housing lets with rent arrears of more than 13 weeks has also risen, increasing from 4% to 4.6. In London, only 68% of housing benefit and council tax benefit claimants are satisfied with their council services; the figure is 78% across the country. </p> <p>The crisis in Hackney council, north London, is starkly exposed, with only 68.4% of council tax receipts collected, whereas the average in London is 91%. Hackney also managed to collect only 78.2% of due rent, the lowest figure for any English council. Only 53% of Hackney housing repairs were completed within government time limits. Only Reading and Selby had a worse record. </p> <p>Hackney also takes 181 days to process new council tax benefit claims and 150 days to process new housing benefit claims; the average across England is 50 days to process council tax and 44 days for housing benefit claims. </p> <p>The study shows that the police only spend 53% of their time out on the streets. Nottinghamshire police appear the most reclusive, spending only 37% of their working hours in public; Cumbrian police, meanwhile, spend three-quarters of their time outside their offices. </p> <p>Huge public dissatisfaction - 57% of those surveyed - is expressed at the absence of police foot patrols, and, to a lesser degree, mobile patrols, even though surveys show that having police on the beat does not help in crime detection. </p> <p>But generally the public is found to be content with the police response to burglary and to violent crime. </p> <p>The number of crimes solved per officer rose in the year to March 2000, from 12 to 12.2 crimes. The most successful police force in terms of solved crimes per officer is Gwent with 25 clear-ups per officer. The Met is the lowest, with seven per officer. </p> <p>The number of 999 calls answered within police forces' target times fell from 89.1% in 1998-99 to 88.6% in 1999-00. The number of constables available for work in England and Wales fell, on average from 2.14 per 1,000 of the population in 1998-99 to 2.11. </p> <p>The survey also finds the proportion of children receiving pre-school education to be rising with 93% of four-year-olds now in nursery school. Lincolnshire claims to have 103% of its four-year-olds in nursery school - a performance it will have difficulty improving on. </p> <p>The proportion of street lights not working is less than 0.25 % in a few councils, but over 10 times that rate on a handful of others. The darkest London council in terms of most streetlights not working is Ealing. Nationwide, Tameside has the highest proportion of streetlights not working. </p> <p>The district council which spends least per head of population is Mid Bedfordshire - at \u00a370.38 a head. The most parsimonious county council is wealthy Surrey which spends only \u00a3611 per head of its population. York council spends least of unitary councils at \u00a3695 per head. </p> <p><strong>Good, bad and ugly</strong></p> <p>\u0095 The filthiest council, in terms of street cleanliness: <strong> Stockton-on-Tees </strong>. Only 54.7% of the council's streets were deemed to be of a high or acceptable standard. Residents of <strong> Southend, South Buckinghamshire, East Cambridgeshire, Carlisle, Christchurch </strong> and 23 other councils will be delighted, or possibly surprised to know that 100% of their streets are clean. </p> <p>\u0095 The city with most public lavatories is <strong> Sheffield</strong> (65). <strong> Liverpool</strong>, by contrast, has none </p> <p>\u0095 The population most keen to swim is <strong> Reading,</strong> with 16,028 swims per 1,000 population. </p> <p>\u0095 The education authority with the most excluded pupils is <strong> Doncaster,</strong> with 3.12 pupils excluded per 1,000 pupils. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Tower Hamlets</strong> spends most per pupil on primary education: \u00a33,080 per pupil. </p> <p>\u0095 The cheapest school meal in the country can be bought in <strong> Worcester</strong> at 90p. </p> <p>\u0095 The council spending least on children's services is <strong> Rutland</strong>, at \u00a314.53 per head of population.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Council housing services have deteriorated in the past year, possibly due to the lack of a full-scale housing inspectorate, figures from the audit commission reveal today. Overall, local councils' delivery of education and social services by contrast have improved, the commission reports. Both of these services are subject to tough inspections, based on best practice and monitoring performance. The commission also reports deep dissatisfaction from the public at the absence of police foot patrols; less than one in five people surveyed were happy at the number of \"bobbies on the beat\". The annual audit commission survey, of more than 100 key performance indicators, covers council services provided in the 12 months to March 2000. Since then the government has introduced its \"best value\" regime requiring councils to monitor the competitiveness of their services. The study shows only 88% of council housing repairs are completed within government time limits, and the number of housing lets with rent arrears of more than 13 weeks has also risen, increasing from 4% to 4.6. In London, only 68% of housing benefit and council tax benefit claimants are satisfied with their council services; the figure is 78% across the country. The crisis in Hackney council, north London, is starkly exposed, with only 68.4% of council tax receipts collected, whereas the average in London is 91%. Hackney also managed to collect only 78.2% of due rent, the lowest figure for any English council. Only 53% of Hackney housing repairs were completed within government time limits. Only Reading and Selby had a worse record. Hackney also takes 181 days to process new council tax benefit claims and 150 days to process new housing benefit claims; the average across England is 50 days to process council tax and 44 days for housing benefit claims. The study shows that the police only spend 53% of their time out on the streets. Nottinghamshire police appear the most reclusive, spending only 37% of their working hours in public; Cumbrian police, meanwhile, spend three-quarters of their time outside their offices. Huge public dissatisfaction - 57% of those surveyed - is expressed at the absence of police foot patrols, and, to a lesser degree, mobile patrols, even though surveys show that having police on the beat does not help in crime detection. But generally the public is found to be content with the police response to burglary and to violent crime. The number of crimes solved per officer rose in the year to March 2000, from 12 to 12.2 crimes. The most successful police force in terms of solved crimes per officer is Gwent with 25 clear-ups per officer. The Met is the lowest, with seven per officer. The number of 999 calls answered within police forces' target times fell from 89.1% in 1998-99 to 88.6% in 1999-00. The number of constables available for work in England and Wales fell, on average from 2.14 per 1,000 of the population in 1998-99 to 2.11. The survey also finds the proportion of children receiving pre-school education to be rising with 93% of four-year-olds now in nursery school. Lincolnshire claims to have 103% of its four-year-olds in nursery school - a performance it will have difficulty improving on. The proportion of street lights not working is less than 0.25 % in a few councils, but over 10 times that rate on a handful of others. The darkest London council in terms of most streetlights not working is Ealing. Nationwide, Tameside has the highest proportion of streetlights not working. The district council which spends least per head of population is Mid Bedfordshire - at \u00a370.38 a head. The most parsimonious county council is wealthy Surrey which spends only \u00a3611 per head of its population. York council spends least of unitary councils at \u00a3695 per head. Good, bad and ugly \u0095 The filthiest council, in terms of street cleanliness: Stockton-on-Tees . Only 54.7% of the council's streets were deemed to be of a high or acceptable standard. Residents of Southend, South Buckinghamshire, East Cambridgeshire, Carlisle, Christchurch and 23 other councils will be delighted, or possibly surprised to know that 100% of their streets are clean. \u0095 The city with most public lavatories is Sheffield (65). Liverpool, by contrast, has none \u0095 The population most keen to swim is Reading, with 16,028 swims per 1,000 population. \u0095 The education authority with the most excluded pupils is Doncaster, with 3.12 pupils excluded per 1,000 pupils. \u0095 Tower Hamlets spends most per pupil on primary education: \u00a33,080 per pupil. \u0095 The cheapest school meal in the country can be bought in Worcester at 90p. \u0095 The council spending least on children's services is Rutland, at \u00a314.53 per head of population.",

Laboratory work is crucial to the diagnosis and treatment of a range of illnesses including heart disease, diabetes, Aids, the so-called hospital killer-bug known as MRSA and tuberculosis. The most high profile work is probably cytolgy - the screening process that identifies cancer. The NHS cancer plan's challenging targets to speed up cancer detection will not be met if laboratories are not working at full capacity. According to work carried out last year by the University of Warwick, NHS vacancy levels for cytologists were running at 17%. The same study found that one in five laboratory posts were unfilled. Low pay is the main problem affecting recruitment. A trainee NHS pathologist will have a university degree in science, yet will start on just \u00a39,000 - several thousand less than he or she would earn doing a similar job in the private sector. A further two years training is required to earn a qualifying diploma, at which point the salary rises to \u00a313,000. The head of a hospital laboratory with several years' experience earns \u00a332,000. Many laboratory staff are forced to moonlight to make ends meet; many others have simply quit, knowing that they could earn more money stacking shelves in their local supermarket.",

Opinion polls show Barak trailing badly behind his far-right challenger, Ariel Sharon. But one poll - interestingly enough produced by Barak's own brother - shows that Sharon would be beaten by Barak's One Israel party colleague and former prime minister, Shimon Peres. Several close observers believe that Barak is about to throw in the towel and concede the candidature to Peres. Such a sensational development would not be out of keeping in the rumbustious context of Israeli politics. And, with less than four weeks to polling day, more sensations may yet emerge. Sharon has kicked off his campaign with a typically blunt assertion that the Oslo peace accords - Israel's favoured shorthand description for the agreement secretly negotiated in Norway with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation - are dead. He has already promised dire retaliation against the Palestinians if their current intifada (uprising) continues. The intifada erupted at the end of September, sparked by Sharon's provocative visit to the main mosque compound in Jerusalem. It has since claimed around 360 lives, the overwhelming majority of them Palestinian. Most Israelis believe that the violence is being cynically directed by Arafat and his lieutenants, in the hope of squeezing territorial concessions with Barak, who has long portrayed himself as the only man who can bring about a final peace settlement. Now Barak's drive for peace is over, and the former army chief is widely seen as a lame-duck leader bereft of ideas for quelling the unrest. Peres, on the other hand, is seen as Israel's most seasoned politician, with more than half a century's experience and an unrivalled relationship of trust with Arafat, his fellow Nobel peace laureate. Barak's woes, meanwhile, have been deepened by a strident campaign within Israel's Arab minority for a poll boycott. The nation's 1.1m Arab citizens, who identify strongly with their 2m Palestinian kinsfolk in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, are deeply disillusioned with the prime minister. He promised them rapid improvements in living conditions, and failed to deliver. He pledged himself to peace settlement which, for now, has evaporated in violence. Most of all, he presided over the heavy-handed response to the rioting in Arab areas which accompanied the start of the intifada. Thirteen Arab citizens of Israel were shot dead, and the community, which largely supported Barak in the last prime ministerial election in 1999, is in no mood to do so again.

      "bodyText": "Lockerbie trial prosecutors today closed their case against the two Libyan defendants they insist are guilty of the 1988 bomb attack on Pan Am Flight 103. Alastair Campbell QC said the evidence clearly showed the accused men were responsible for placing an unaccompanied bag containing a bomb on board the plane. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, the two accused men, worked together and were constantly in each other's company in the days leading up to the bombing, he said. \"The evidence demonstrates that there was a plan to attack an aircraft and that that plan was successfully brought to fruition,\" he told the trial, held under Scottish law at Camp Zeist in Holland. \"The sending of a bomb in an unaccompanied bag was a method of attack against an aircraft of which everyone in the airline industry was only too well aware.\" The prosecution had also shown that the pair travelled from the Libyan capital, Tripoli, to Malta - where the bomb began its journey - on the day before the attack. Mr Campbell rejected defence claims that others, namely two Palestinian terror groups, carried out the bombing. He said there was no evidence to support the \"special defences\" which blame the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command and named individuals including convicted terrorist Abu Talb for the outrage. The court adjourned until tomorrow to allow defence lawyers time to study the changes before beginning their final speeches. Mr Megrahi and Mr Fhimah deny bombing Flight 103 which exploded over Lockerbie on December 21 1988 killing 270 people, 11 of them on the ground in the Scottish town.

We do not have a particular problem with teenage pregnancies, but the governors decided to make the morning-after pill available in school via a trained nurse practitioner. This facility is part of a wide-ranging health education programme within the school and is supported by advice and counselling. The service to our students is highly confidential (unless the nurse considers a student \"at risk\"). The response to the scheme from parents has been overwhelmingly positive.<br><strong>Verdict: Yes</strong></p> <p><strong> Dr Trevor Stammers</strong> <br>Spokesperson Family and Youth Concern </p> <p> Any school sex education policy should have as its basis giving young people assistance in resisting pressure to have sex, but I think the morning-after pill is the lesser of two evils rather than an abortion which is much more traumatic. But what worries me is whether the school nurse will take on the related health issues. Statistically, teenage girls who get pregnant are far more likely to smoke and take drugs, and they're at risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Just giving these girls a couple of pills and telling them to use a packet of condoms next time is utterly inadequate.<br><strong>Verdict: No</strong></p> <p><strong> Mark Blake</strong> <br>Spokesperson Blackliners sexual health project </p> <p>Blackliners is a black and minority ethnic sexual health project in south London. Part of our area has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the UK: our work is to prevent those pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. I think giving the morning-after pill out at school is a good idea because girls do not always want to go along to a clinic; but it should involve parents. It should be available in the context of effective sex and relationship education which will prevent young people from getting to the stage where they need the pill in the first place.<br><strong>Verdict: Yes</strong></p> <p><strong> Jenny Bacon</strong> <br>Parents Against Oral Contraception for Children </p> <p>Sexually transmitted diseases in this country are at epidemic levels and making this sort of contraception available to children won't help. I believe some of these girls wouldn't be getting involved in sex if contraception wasn't so easily available to them. Parents have a right to know if their children are involved in under-age sex. Schools can't give out aspirin without seeking parental permission, but they can give out the morning-after pill, which contains a very high dose of hormones - it's not like eating a Smartie. We should be promoting chastity and abstinence to our children.<br>Verdict: No</p>",

The service to our students is highly confidential (unless the nurse considers a student \"at risk\"). The response to the scheme from parents has been overwhelmingly positive. Verdict: Yes Dr Trevor Stammers Spokesperson Family and Youth Concern Any school sex education policy should have as its basis giving young people assistance in resisting pressure to have sex, but I think the morning-after pill is the lesser of two evils rather than an abortion which is much more traumatic. But what worries me is whether the school nurse will take on the related health issues. Statistically, teenage girls who get pregnant are far more likely to smoke and take drugs, and they're at risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Just giving these girls a couple of pills and telling them to use a packet of condoms next time is utterly inadequate. Verdict: No Mark Blake Spokesperson Blackliners sexual health project Blackliners is a black and minority ethnic sexual health project in south London. Part of our area has the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the UK: our work is to prevent those pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. I think giving the morning-after pill out at school is a good idea because girls do not always want to go along to a clinic; but it should involve parents. It should be available in the context of effective sex and relationship education which will prevent young people from getting to the stage where they need the pill in the first place. Verdict: Yes Jenny Bacon Parents Against Oral Contraception for Children Sexually transmitted diseases in this country are at epidemic levels and making this sort of contraception available to children won't help. I believe some of these girls wouldn't be getting involved in sex if contraception wasn't so easily available to them. Parents have a right to know if their children are involved in under-age sex. Schools can't give out aspirin without seeking parental permission, but they can give out the morning-after pill, which contains a very high dose of hormones - it's not like eating a Smartie. We should be promoting chastity and abstinence to our children. Verdict: No",

Staying upright on two wheels must be experienced for the subconscious mind to realise that a cycle's stability increases with speed - just the opposite of what one would expect on foot.

It was the artificial, stilted language, the goody-goody kids, the complete absence of life and fun as we know it.

They're stick figures in a dull reading scheme. </p> <p>I still remember the first real book my parents gave me: The Pancake. It had a mottled purple cover, and it was filled with stories. They were simple, they were repetitive, but they were real, entertaining stories. It was marvellous - my reward for the months spent learning how letters and sounds fit together. Until then, I don't think I realised that books were meant to be fun. </p> <p>I learned to read on Dick and Jane: I did not become a reader. That was thanks to Enid Blyton, PL Travers, Andrew Lang's wonderful fairytale books, Tintin, Edward Eager's magic books, and Beverly Cleary.

He read comics, Horrible Histories and computer game manuals on his own. But I am happy that he enjoys reading.

I remember all the parental playground moans that the books their kids were given to read were \"too easy\". The teachers would protest that the children had chosen the books themselves. No matter: a book that is too easy is a bad book. Children rarely get to enjoy the reading stage they are at. Give them something harder. Harder! Make them learn. Make them sweat. </p> <p>Here is the next target for the bedtime core curriculum. I've seen well-meaning parents drag kids away from the picture book section in bookshops because the books are no longer \"age-appropriate\". Where's the pleasure here? My son's teenage babysitter has read picture books all her life. She's now at Cambridge University, so I hardly think she was stunted intellectually by reading \"beneath\" her. </p> <p>Another way we punish children for their progress is to stop reading to them the moment they can read for themselves. I find this very sad. There's such a huge gap between what young children are able to read, and what they can enjoy. Reading to them keeps them in contact with a voice, as well as reminding them again and again: reading is a joy, an entry into different, magical worlds. I remember reading Swallows and Amazons to my son, and struggling through a page of mysterious sailing terms. Finally, I stopped and asked if he minded not understanding. No, he said: he liked hearing the words. </p> <p> In fairness, I should point out that first readers are incredibly difficult to write for.

Mr Glocer is to leave his job as head of Reuters Information and oversee the transfer of the group's main businesses onto the internet. His role will be filled by Philip Green, chief executive of Reuters Trading solutions. Reuters' expansion strategies received several knocks last year, after it postponed the flotation of its Greenhouse technology investment fund and abandoned the launch of a retail version of its Instinet share trading unit. mr Glocer, who is the first American and non-journalist to head the group, will also relinquish day-to-day management of Reuters' American operations.

It yesterday announced plans to change its name to Consignia from the end of March. Post Office, it explained, no longer adequately described what it did. </p> <p>John Roberts, its chief executive, was quick to point out that as far as the general public was concerned there would be little visible change. </p> <p>Its main brand names and logos will remain the same. The postman delivering letters to the door will still work for the Royal Mail, parcels will be distributed by Parcelforce Worldwide in its distinctive vans and local post offices will still display the familiar logo. </p> <p>The change immediately came under fire from the Post Office's own workers, however. The Communication Workers Union pledged to campaign against the decision, complaining that it was \"dumping\" 350 years of tradition. Deputy general secretary John Keggie believed the exercise was \"rushed and ill-conceived\". He said: \"We should be trading on the British Post Office's worldwide reputation.\" </p> <p>The driving force behind the name change has been the Post Office's determination to become a leading player in the international distribution and logistics business. The new name is based on to consign: to entrust to the care of. </p> <p>The Post Office is a generic term which cannot be legally protected and this was hindering its international expansion plans, the organisation said. Overseas people inevitably referred to the organisation as the British Post Office to distinguish it from its local rivals. </p> <p>\"We did not think British Post Office was as strong as Consignia,\" said Neville Bain, the Post Office chairman. \"It would be abbreviated to BPO and the branding consultants said that a word which is recognisable and describes what you do is better than some conglomerate of initials.\" </p> <p>The Post Office worked with consultants, Dragon, and ran focus groups to judge reactions to various names. The words \"British\" and \"Royal\" got a poor reception. Other names were already registered or meant something unacceptable in other languages. </p> <p>The Post Office, which faces the rapid erosion of its traditional letter monopoly in Britain, has spent \u00a3500m during the past two years buying foreign logistics and parcel companies, largely in mainland Europe. </p> <p>Mr Roberts said the Post Office would present itself as Consignia overseas and to the big corporate customers who account for the bulk of its business. It would also consider using Consignia as a brand name if it moved into new markets. </p> <p>Post Office executives stressed that the business was changing rapidly. International operations account for about \u00a31.2bn of its \u00a37.5bn turnover and would account for more in the years ahead. </p> <p>It is also turning to new activities such as call centres, warehousing, logistics and collection points for goods ordered over the internet. </p> <p>The change is timed to coincide with the change in the Post Office's status to a government-owned public limited company on March 26. The status gives it greater commercial freedom. Mr Roberts said the organisation was spending \u00a31.5m in connection with the switch to plc status, and that the name change would add a further \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>By comparison Andersen Consulting is spending \u00a3100m on promoting its name change to Accenture. \"It's the difference between changing a corporate name and changing a whole brand identity,\" a Post Office executive said.</p>",

The new name is based on to consign: to entrust to the care of. The Post Office is a generic term which cannot be legally protected and this was hindering its international expansion plans, the organisation said. Overseas people inevitably referred to the organisation as the British Post Office to distinguish it from its local rivals. \"We did not think British Post Office was as strong as Consignia,\" said Neville Bain, the Post Office chairman. \"It would be abbreviated to BPO and the branding consultants said that a word which is recognisable and describes what you do is better than some conglomerate of initials.\" The Post Office worked with consultants, Dragon, and ran focus groups to judge reactions to various names. The words \"British\" and \"Royal\" got a poor reception. Other names were already registered or meant something unacceptable in other languages. The Post Office, which faces the rapid erosion of its traditional letter monopoly in Britain, has spent \u00a3500m during the past two years buying foreign logistics and parcel companies, largely in mainland Europe. Mr Roberts said the Post Office would present itself as Consignia overseas and to the big corporate customers who account for the bulk of its business. It would also consider using Consignia as a brand name if it moved into new markets. Post Office executives stressed that the business was changing rapidly. International operations account for about \u00a31.2bn of its \u00a37.5bn turnover and would account for more in the years ahead. It is also turning to new activities such as call centres, warehousing, logistics and collection points for goods ordered over the internet. The change is timed to coincide with the change in the Post Office's status to a government-owned public limited company on March 26. The status gives it greater commercial freedom. Mr Roberts said the organisation was spending \u00a31.5m in connection with the switch to plc status, and that the name change would add a further \u00a3500,000. By comparison Andersen Consulting is spending \u00a3100m on promoting its name change to Accenture. \"It's the difference between changing a corporate name and changing a whole brand identity,\" a Post Office executive said.",

      "body": "<p>Several senior police officers will have chuckled today as they watched Jack Straw announce new initiatives to combat muggings and mobile phone robberies.</p> <p>Just before Christmas Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, led the calls for phone manufacturers to \"design out crime\", pointing to surges in mobile robberies in certain areas of London.</p> <p>The evidence for the rise was patchy - and still is. Officers thought the increase might be down to school bullying being displaced from the playground, but no proper analysis had been done.</p> <p>When the British Crime Survey was published last year, the Home Office statistician Paul Wiles warned the 14% increase in robberies had to be taken with a pinch of salt.</p> <p>Because robberies are rare, the rise was down entirely to reports by 15 teenagers who were mugged for money and their phones. He argued 15 muggings nationwide was not an epidemic.</p> <p>But someone with influence at the Home Office was obviously listening to Sir John. In fact, the commissioner, whose political skills were questioned before he took over from Sir Paul Condon, has proved quite deft.</p> <p>He demands more officers. The Home Office gives him more officers. He says police morale low is low. He gets more money for recruits. Sir John wants mobile phone manufacturers brought to book.

      "bodyText": "Several senior police officers will have chuckled today as they watched Jack Straw announce new initiatives to combat muggings and mobile phone robberies. Just before Christmas Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, led the calls for phone manufacturers to \"design out crime\", pointing to surges in mobile robberies in certain areas of London. The evidence for the rise was patchy - and still is. Officers thought the increase might be down to school bullying being displaced from the playground, but no proper analysis had been done. When the British Crime Survey was published last year, the Home Office statistician Paul Wiles warned the 14% increase in robberies had to be taken with a pinch of salt. Because robberies are rare, the rise was down entirely to reports by 15 teenagers who were mugged for money and their phones. He argued 15 muggings nationwide was not an epidemic. But someone with influence at the Home Office was obviously listening to Sir John. In fact, the commissioner, whose political skills were questioned before he took over from Sir Paul Condon, has proved quite deft. He demands more officers. The Home Office gives him more officers. He says police morale low is low. He gets more money for recruits. Sir John wants mobile phone manufacturers brought to book. Of course, says Mr Straw. And with a General Election looming, and law and order likely to be the key battleground, expect more helpful suggestions from chief constables in the coming months. Then watch the unedifying spectacle of the government and the opposition competing over who will do more to satisfy them. \"No party ever won a General Election arguing for less officers on the beat,\" said one senior officer at Scotland Yard. There is, however, a graver issue over mobile phones which needs to be addressed far more urgently than street muggings. Nearly every major police investigation requires mobile phone analysis - to track calls between criminals, to pinpoint where villains have been. But manufacturers are under no obligation to help the police. They do help, but it is not considered a priority. Hundreds of inquiries end up grinding to a halt, waiting in turn. For most detectives, that is a far more pressing, and frustrating, issue.

It is believed that he has clinched a record-breaking deal with ITV worth at least \u00a32.5m to present News at Ten for the next four years.

His contract means that he retains his position as the highest paid newscaster in Britain. Top presenters at ITV get a minimum of \u00a3250,000 a year but individual deals differ, say sources. It is thought Sir Trevor's deal also includes his fees for presenting the Tonight programme. The veteran newscaster spoke of his surprise and pleasure at returning to present the bulletin after two years. \"If anyone had told me a couple of years ago that I would be presenting News at Ten and the Tonight show, I would say they should have a close look at what they'd had for their tea,\" said Sir Trevor today. \"Ten o'clock is very much an ITV time.

      "bodyText": "ITV bosses today threw down the gauntlet to the BBC over the 10pm news clash, insisting they will never move the News at Ten again. Director of programmes David Liddiment said that if ratings for the two channels' late evening bulletins suffer after they go head-to-head at 10pm from January 22, \"the onus will be on the BBC\" to move its news back to 9pm. He added: \"This is the second time we've moved our news in two years. I have no plans to move it again - as far as I'm concerned that's that.\" Mr Liddiment said culture secretary Chris Smith \"had made it clear that he would expect the BBC to rethink their news move if audiences decline\". ITV controller of news Steve Anderson added that BBC director-general Greg Dyke and chairman Sir Christopher Bland \"were on record as saying that if news audiences do decline, they will move their news back\". In the keynote MacTaggart speech at the Edinburgh TV Festival last year, Mr Dyke said: \"The main reason for the move is that we believe more people will watch it, it's as simple as that.\" Mr Liddiment also contrasted the long process ITV had gone through with the Independent Television Commission to gain regulatory approval for its latest news move, with the BBC's self-regulatory regime that allowed it to move its news at short notice. \"Unfortunately there's no mechanism for making them accountable in the way that we are accountable,\" he said. ITV is doing its best to ensure a grand first night entrance for the returning News at Ten, scheduling Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? in the 9-10pm slot. The following night the bulletin will follow Peak Practice, while on Wednesday, January 24 it will be pushed back to 10.30pm by a 90-minute edition of police drama The Vice. On Thursday 25 drama At Home with the Braithwaites will run before the news. On Wednesday nights later in the winter season the ITV news bulletin is to run after Champions League coverage and Coronation Street at 10.15pm, which will also deliver a considerable ratings boost. Mr Liddiment said: \"Assuming I do my job and get the lead-in programming right, then I'm confident that the news audience will not suffer.\"",

      "bodyText": "More than half a century after the event, it seems that France is finally set to follow Switzerland and Germany by reaching a multi-million pound settlement with the descendants of Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust. The French and US governments expect to sign a pact by the end of the month with lawyers representing thousands of death camp survivors or relatives of victims who then lived in France, but are now mostly in the US, Canada, Australia, Israel and elsewhere around the globe. Under the terms of the deal, which should head off a major diplomatic row between Washington and Paris, eight leading French banks will pay \"a substantial, multi-million-dollar sum\" into accounts. These will be held at the disposal of victims or their heirs, who will be invited to submit claims based on lists of names posted on the internet. In return, the lawsuits against the banks - launched in 1997 in the US, where the courts were felt more likely to look favourably on them - will be dropped. France's collaborationist Vichy government froze some 80,000 accounts of French or foreign Jews at the start of the Nazis' four-year occupation of the country in 1940. Some 76,000 Jews - about a quarter of those in France at the time - were deported to Nazi death camps, where all but 2,500 died. The deal marks another important, if belated, step in France's awakening to the degree of guilt the nation must bear for the horrors of the Nazi occupation. This is a country that has had more trouble than most in looking one of the darkest eras in its history full in the face. It took until 1995 before the French president, Jacques Chirac, was able to admit that the state bore a heavy share of responsibility in the mass round-ups and deportations of Jews, as well as in the property and asset seizures that were carried out with the active help of the Vichy regime. Public awareness was then heightened by the trial in 1998 of Maurice Papon, a senior Vichy official who was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for complicity in crimes against humanity as a result of the part he played in organising the deportation of 1,590 Jews from the Bordeaux area. Late last year, a Wall of Memory similar to Jerusalem's Yad Vashem was erected at the Memorial to the Jewish Martyr in Pariss Marais district, the home of most of the capital's pre-war Jewish community. Dozens of trees were planted along the road leading up to the memorial, forming an \"avenue of the righteous\" to honour French citizens who sheltered Jews or helped them to escape. A permanent museum and library recording French Jews' experience of the Holocaust has been installed in cellars beneath the memorial. And slowly, France is also beginning to make more material reparations. The prime minister, Lionel Jospin, last year announced a new programme under which children whose parents were deported from France by the Vichy regime will get either a lump sum, or a monthly pension. Last year too, France set up a committee to process individual requests for reparation for all confiscated French property, estimated by the government-appointed Matt\u00e9oli commission at well over \u00a31bn. But very few people around the world actually know of its existence, and the issue of illegally seized assets remains a highly sensitive one. Many authorities feel that outside lobbying amounts to unhelpful meddling in France's attempts to face up to its responsibilities. Progress is, however, being made. The French national museum authority - which had taken no action whatsoever since 1954 - has finally started seeking the rightful owners of some 2,000 art works that were taken from Jews during the war and shipped to Germany. The US lawyers handling the financial class-action suits filed in the US had long complained of similar non-cooperation and delaying tactics on the part of the French banks, which include such well-known institutions as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, BNP-Paribas and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais. In its vast, 3,000-page report, the Matt\u00e9oli commission estimated that the present-day equivalent of some \u00a3300m was currently lying dormant in French banks. The US lawyers, who dispute the commission's findings that most accounts were reclaimed by holders or their relatives after 1945, say that the true figure is probably closer to \u00a31bn. Michel Japkowicz, a 65-year-old Paris pharmacist who lost his father and 15-year-old brother to the Holocaust, and is one of the people who filed suit against the banks, said \"The deal was 55 years late. \"But it's moral satisfaction.

With the Dome, the millennial celebrations and the general feeling of \"Was that it?\" behind us, we have become slaves to cynicism, artificial passions and desperately forced excitements. It is not a time for great art. However, if it is fuelled by world-weariness alone, the future may not last long. Perhaps, in our imaginations, we could bypass this period entirely. I would like to discuss a possible literature, the kind of writing that will take place in the post-future age. </p> <p>One symptom of the current future is the perceived sorry state of the English novel. The people who complain that the English novel is dead spend the rest of their time praising the latest masterwork that manages to tell a good story in a simple enough manner. In other words, a retreat is made into the past. Almost every novel published this year will use a template invented three centuries ago, and set in stone during the Victorian age. </p> <p>Those few books that do try a new approach are met with tired groans. This is the fashionable ennui of current emotion. The writers are being too clever, there's too much going on, too many ideas, it's too much like hard work. Oh, the constant laments of this or that book being unreadable. </p> <p>What the naysayers really mean is that they themselves cannot read it. It's too difficult for them. Compared with what? Jeffrey Archer? James Joyce? What is this benchmark of readability? Ian McEwan, JK Rowling, Salman Rushdie? What are these lines drawn in the sand, over which writers are not supposed to tread? Have we lost the courage to engage with a challenging text? </p> <p>Two British writers, Nicholas Blincoe and Matt Thorne, recently made a set of 10 rules by which to create fiction. The collection of stories they put together, All Hail the New Puritans, is a peculiar document. Fifteen fairly young writers have decided to remove all traces of formal density from their work. There are to be no flashbacks, no authorial voices, no dual narratives. The writers will \"shun poetry and poetic licence in all its forms\". </p> <p>The New Puritans have nailed their colours to the mast, and what a drab, lifeless banner it is. These are the dry, deft, slightly engaging tales that so many of our writers produce already, without any rules other than fixed tradition. The small thing, done well; a fearsome denial of the imagination. </p> <p>Where does this fixation with the linear narrative come from? By dismissing the textual adventures of Joyce, British writers stayed true to the old pleasures of straightforward storytelling. This leads to our current situation, where the vast majority of novelists are still intent on drawing a single narrative thread through a complex world. </p> <p>Yet we live daily in a web of connections, all of us becoming adept at riding the multiple layers of information. This is the fluid society. Tracing pathways through this intricate landscape needs a different kind of narrative art. It is in this spirit of adventure that I envisage the post-future novel. </p> <p>I do not mean a refusal to tell stories. But we need to expand the notion of what a story is, and to seek out new ways of telling these stories. We need to be brave in this, as writers, as critics, and as readers. </p> <p>It is pertinent, in this regard, to look at the recent novel House of Leaves, by the American writer Mark Z Danielewski. More a vast, convoluted labyrinth than a simple book, House of Leaves contains wondrous delights on every page. There are poems, photographs, quotations, areas of text printed upside down, almost blank pages, footnotes, an index, a playful use of typography. The book also tells a great story. Searching for the narrative clues scattered throughout the text becomes an intense pleasure. </p> <p>I would propose that this book is one of the first examples of post-futurism. It is exactly the kind of storytelling we now need. House of Leaves was a big success in the States. It is interesting to imagine what the critical reaction to the book would have been in this country if the novel had been written by a British author. Could such a beautifully complex story even be told at this time, on this damp, grey island? </p> <p>By reaching towards an imaginary literature, the post-future novel offers itself as a way forward. First of all, we have to accept that English writing has been far too slow in its adoption of avant-garde techniques, in comparison with popular music, art and films. The narrative fabric of the latest cult movie is woven through with jump cuts, freeze-frames, montage, slow motion shots, tracking shots, hand-held camera techniques, and the like. House, hip-hop and garage recordings contain elements of remixing, scratching and sampling. </p> <p>We can also look at the branching narratives of computer games, at the strange connections that hypertext links reveal on the internet, at the games played with image and text in a graphic novel. </p> <p>All of these are fluid mediums, for a fluid society. Set against such material, no wonder the contemporary novel seems moribund. As writers, we need to open ourselves up to this fluidity. What are the prose equivalents of the tracking shot, the hyperlink, the remix, the freeze-frame? As readers, we need to bring the expertise we use when enjoying a film or a piece of visual art into our appreciation of the novel. </p> <p>As I write this, I'm playing Decks, EFX and 909, a CD by the techno DJ and musician Richie Hawtin. Listening to it now, an idea has come to me. I'll present this idea as the possible outline of a post-futurist novel. The CD consists of 38 pieces of music, played on a number of turntables, with two or three records being played simultaneously. Hawtin includes a diagram on the CD's sleeve, which depicts where each record begins and ends. </p> <p>The DJ also employs the other two devices mentioned in the title, a special effects processor, and a Roland 909 drum machine. With these various elements, Hawtin produces a coherent musical narrative. I use the word \"narrative\" without compromise. Anybody who has enjoyed a good DJ set in a nightclub will attest to this sense of a story being unfolded through the music. </p> <p>With this in mind, we could use Richie Hawtin's CD as the template for a novel. We need to create 38 stories, which then blend into each other using the CD's diagram as a guide. As one story comes to an end, another story, or two other stories, are mixed into it. These new stories are then carried on, until further stories are added to the mix. </p> <p>Hawtin will return to the same record twice, or to a different remix of the record; we can use this technique to allow our various stories to reappear at different places in the narrative. The special effects and the drum machine elements can be interpreted in their own ways, according to the individual imagination. There are no rules, only opportunities. Above all, imagine the pleasure gained from following the various stories through the mix. </p> <p>This gives just one possible structure for a post-futurist novel. I now want to talk a little about the language that such a novel could use. We have become very adept in this country, at writing \"books\". By this, I mean that we tend to concentrate on the big picture, rather than the interplay of words. </p> <p>Looked at in a different light, however, words become a liquid medium, a malleable substance capable of being transformed in surprising ways. Words can be stretched, broken, melted, drugged, mutated, forced into submission, set free. We need writers who revel in the wild excitement of language, at this deepest level, creating a kind of dub fiction. </p> <p>Our writing will then be charged, sensual, and alive with the poetic effects the New Puritans fear so much. Let us not be afraid of intensity of expression. </p> <p>Hip-hop DJs have a phrase to describe the detailed, moment to moment controlling of a set of turntables, celebrated in the classic early track by Gang Starr, \"DJ Premier in Deep Concentration\". The post-futurist novel will employ just such a concentration in its use of language. </p> <p>At the same time, it will utilise a fluid, organic structure, a network of storylines. It will be experimental, and yet will place a firm accent on the portrayal of human desires. It will be Raymond Chandler writing Ulysses, James Joyce writing The Big Sleep. It will move away from lazy cynicism and nihilism. Post-futurism reveres the narrative imagination. If the English novel is truly dead, we should place a flower on its grave, trample down the dirt. Now is the time to raise up the fragile, blossoming ghost. </p> <p>\u0095 Jeff Noon's new book, Cobralingus, is published by Codex, price \u00a39.95. </p> <p><strong>How to make a modern novel</strong></p> <p>Over the past few years there has been an upsurge of interest in experimental electronic music. Allied to the outer fringes of dance culture, and produced by groups such as Pole, Autechre, Oval, and Mouse on Mars, this is the music of machines with diseases. Decay, static, the raw buzz of a frayed connection. </p> <p>Reading interviews with the people involved, I started to learn a little about the computer software employed, and the techniques of creation, and to wonder if the same processes could be used to manipulate and transform the written word. </p> <p>Imagine a musical signal travelling along a pathway. The signal passes through various gates, or filters, each of which has a different effect on the music. These effects might include distort, echo, overload, and so on. Described like this, it sounds a very cold, mechanical operation; in fact, the music created in this way often reveals an astonishing, ruined beauty. </p> <p>Sometimes, a diagram of the signal's pathway will be included in the sleeve design. One of the earliest examples can be found on the back cover of Brian Eno's 1975 album, Discreet Music. </p> <p>The idea behind the Cobralingus project is quite simple: could a piece of text be pushed along a similar pathway? </p> <p>The first task was to create a set of filter gates. These came out of a period of experimentation, playing games on screen, and on paper, thinking up different ways in which language could be transformed. Some of the filters, such as Randomise, Decay, or Explode, break text down, whereas others, such as Enhance, Control, and Find Story, have a more constructive property. </p> <p>I could also drug the language, using such concepts as Anagramethane, Metaphorazine and Fecundamol. These are not computerised effects; they are imaginary technologies, designed to fire the writer's imagination. </p> <p>The book of Cobralingus contains my first explorations in this process of metamorphiction, each piece starting with a passage sampled from another writer. How the text is to be transformed by any particular filter is entirely up to the individual. The filters can be used in any order, so that the text undergoes a continuous mutation, as it passes along the pathway. </p> <p>It's fun, and more than a little scary sometimes, especially when a piece dissolves down into pure nonsense. But it can always be rescued and, eventually, some phrase or image will emerge from the process, some clue as to how the overall piece will end, and the work can now be pushed along in this direction. I am always amazed when this happens. I can only think that some hidden text has been brought to light, out of the original inlet. This can be seen as the ghost, or unconscious desire, of the original text. </p> <p>One particular piece starts with the description of a horse, taken from The Taming of the Shrew, which transforms, eventually, into a poem containing these lines: \"Infect the text! Inspect, reflect, enrage! Have sex! Let language fashion, fuse and breed, explode and hatch anew.\" In this way, Cobralingus attempts a new kind of writing, somewhere between poetry and prose, that revels in the secret life of words. </p> <p>\u0095 For a sample of the Cobralingus project, go to <a href=\"http://www.cobralingus.com\">Cobralingus</a>.</p>",

We need to be brave in this, as writers, as critics, and as readers. It is pertinent, in this regard, to look at the recent novel House of Leaves, by the American writer Mark Z Danielewski. More a vast, convoluted labyrinth than a simple book, House of Leaves contains wondrous delights on every page. There are poems, photographs, quotations, areas of text printed upside down, almost blank pages, footnotes, an index, a playful use of typography. The book also tells a great story. Searching for the narrative clues scattered throughout the text becomes an intense pleasure. I would propose that this book is one of the first examples of post-futurism. It is exactly the kind of storytelling we now need. House of Leaves was a big success in the States. It is interesting to imagine what the critical reaction to the book would have been in this country if the novel had been written by a British author. Could such a beautifully complex story even be told at this time, on this damp, grey island? By reaching towards an imaginary literature, the post-future novel offers itself as a way forward. First of all, we have to accept that English writing has been far too slow in its adoption of avant-garde techniques, in comparison with popular music, art and films. The narrative fabric of the latest cult movie is woven through with jump cuts, freeze-frames, montage, slow motion shots, tracking shots, hand-held camera techniques, and the like. House, hip-hop and garage recordings contain elements of remixing, scratching and sampling. We can also look at the branching narratives of computer games, at the strange connections that hypertext links reveal on the internet, at the games played with image and text in a graphic novel. All of these are fluid mediums, for a fluid society. Set against such material, no wonder the contemporary novel seems moribund. As writers, we need to open ourselves up to this fluidity. What are the prose equivalents of the tracking shot, the hyperlink, the remix, the freeze-frame? As readers, we need to bring the expertise we use when enjoying a film or a piece of visual art into our appreciation of the novel. As I write this, I'm playing Decks, EFX and 909, a CD by the techno DJ and musician Richie Hawtin. Listening to it now, an idea has come to me. I'll present this idea as the possible outline of a post-futurist novel. The CD consists of 38 pieces of music, played on a number of turntables, with two or three records being played simultaneously. Hawtin includes a diagram on the CD's sleeve, which depicts where each record begins and ends. The DJ also employs the other two devices mentioned in the title, a special effects processor, and a Roland 909 drum machine. With these various elements, Hawtin produces a coherent musical narrative. I use the word \"narrative\" without compromise. Anybody who has enjoyed a good DJ set in a nightclub will attest to this sense of a story being unfolded through the music. With this in mind, we could use Richie Hawtin's CD as the template for a novel. We need to create 38 stories, which then blend into each other using the CD's diagram as a guide. As one story comes to an end, another story, or two other stories, are mixed into it. These new stories are then carried on, until further stories are added to the mix. Hawtin will return to the same record twice, or to a different remix of the record; we can use this technique to allow our various stories to reappear at different places in the narrative. The special effects and the drum machine elements can be interpreted in their own ways, according to the individual imagination. There are no rules, only opportunities. Above all, imagine the pleasure gained from following the various stories through the mix. This gives just one possible structure for a post-futurist novel. I now want to talk a little about the language that such a novel could use. We have become very adept in this country, at writing \"books\". By this, I mean that we tend to concentrate on the big picture, rather than the interplay of words. Looked at in a different light, however, words become a liquid medium, a malleable substance capable of being transformed in surprising ways. Words can be stretched, broken, melted, drugged, mutated, forced into submission, set free. We need writers who revel in the wild excitement of language, at this deepest level, creating a kind of dub fiction. Our writing will then be charged, sensual, and alive with the poetic effects the New Puritans fear so much. Let us not be afraid of intensity of expression. Hip-hop DJs have a phrase to describe the detailed, moment to moment controlling of a set of turntables, celebrated in the classic early track by Gang Starr, \"DJ Premier in Deep Concentration\". The post-futurist novel will employ just such a concentration in its use of language. At the same time, it will utilise a fluid, organic structure, a network of storylines. It will be experimental, and yet will place a firm accent on the portrayal of human desires. It will be Raymond Chandler writing Ulysses, James Joyce writing The Big Sleep. It will move away from lazy cynicism and nihilism. Post-futurism reveres the narrative imagination. If the English novel is truly dead, we should place a flower on its grave, trample down the dirt. Now is the time to raise up the fragile, blossoming ghost. \u0095 Jeff Noon's new book, Cobralingus, is published by Codex, price \u00a39.95. How to make a modern novel Over the past few years there has been an upsurge of interest in experimental electronic music. Allied to the outer fringes of dance culture, and produced by groups such as Pole, Autechre, Oval, and Mouse on Mars, this is the music of machines with diseases. Decay, static, the raw buzz of a frayed connection. Reading interviews with the people involved, I started to learn a little about the computer software employed, and the techniques of creation, and to wonder if the same processes could be used to manipulate and transform the written word. Imagine a musical signal travelling along a pathway. The signal passes through various gates, or filters, each of which has a different effect on the music. These effects might include distort, echo, overload, and so on. Described like this, it sounds a very cold, mechanical operation; in fact, the music created in this way often reveals an astonishing, ruined beauty. Sometimes, a diagram of the signal's pathway will be included in the sleeve design. One of the earliest examples can be found on the back cover of Brian Eno's 1975 album, Discreet Music. The idea behind the Cobralingus project is quite simple: could a piece of text be pushed along a similar pathway? The first task was to create a set of filter gates. These came out of a period of experimentation, playing games on screen, and on paper, thinking up different ways in which language could be transformed. Some of the filters, such as Randomise, Decay, or Explode, break text down, whereas others, such as Enhance, Control, and Find Story, have a more constructive property. I could also drug the language, using such concepts as Anagramethane, Metaphorazine and Fecundamol. These are not computerised effects; they are imaginary technologies, designed to fire the writer's imagination. The book of Cobralingus contains my first explorations in this process of metamorphiction, each piece starting with a passage sampled from another writer. How the text is to be transformed by any particular filter is entirely up to the individual. The filters can be used in any order, so that the text undergoes a continuous mutation, as it passes along the pathway. It's fun, and more than a little scary sometimes, especially when a piece dissolves down into pure nonsense. But it can always be rescued and, eventually, some phrase or image will emerge from the process, some clue as to how the overall piece will end, and the work can now be pushed along in this direction. I am always amazed when this happens. I can only think that some hidden text has been brought to light, out of the original inlet. This can be seen as the ghost, or unconscious desire, of the original text. One particular piece starts with the description of a horse, taken from The Taming of the Shrew, which transforms, eventually, into a poem containing these lines: \"Infect the text! Inspect, reflect, enrage! Have sex! Let language fashion, fuse and breed, explode and hatch anew.\" In this way, Cobralingus attempts a new kind of writing, somewhere between poetry and prose, that revels in the secret life of words. \u0095 For a sample of the Cobralingus project, go to Cobralingus.",

The station's in-depth study of teenagers who have breast implants gained a 19% share of the 10pm to 11pm slot, outgunning Gail Porter's Pulling Power on ITV, which registered 3m viewers at 10.30pm. Channel 5 ran Jon Voight action film Most Wanted against the documentary, but only managed 2.6m and a 12% share, its biggest audience of the day. Elsewhere yesterday, BBC1's Martin Shaw vehicle Judge John Deed held up well against ITV big-hitters The Bill and Peak Practice. The feature-length drama took 6.6m and 27% share for 8pm, against 8m for The Bill and 33%. However, it failed to cling onto EastEnders' audience of 14.3m, who tuned in to watch nasty Nick Cotton's increasing woes at 7.30pm. The whopping share of 59% more than halved for Judge John Deed. Peak Practice predictably dominated the 9pm slot with 8m viewers and 34% of the audience. Channel 4 trailed behind with 2.6m with its To Diet For documentary on the history of dieting.",

The hospital closest to the arrivals hall has dealt with 30 passengers killed by the thrombosis in the last three years. Many die within minutes of landing at the airport, says the research by John Belstead, a consultant at Ashford hospital, Middlesex. The condition, linked to cramped seating aboard airliners, is known as \"economy class syndrome\" but can affect passengers in more expensive seats. On long haul flights a blood clot forms in a vein, usually in the leg, and works its way into the heart or lungs where it causes death. Doctors say a simple aspirin tablet taken a few hours before take-off thins the blood during long periods of inactivity. The number of victims would fall significantly if more passengers followed this advice. A third of the study's patients, who were aged between 28 and the late 70s, had flown to Heathrow from Australia in economy class seats.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, is calling on the mobile phone industry to play its part in reducing street crime by making it harder for thieves to steal mobile phones. Mr Straw will be holding a briefing later today on the issue, and hopes to meet manufacturers sometime discuss the possibility of building greater security measures into the phones. The mobile phone industry estimates that 15,000 handsets are stolen every month, and Metropolitan police figures show that the number of street crimes involving mobile phones increased more than fourfold in the period from April 1998 to July 2000. Even Mr Straw admits that such security measures will not be easy to achieve, particularly given the prevalence of pay-as-you-go plans that do not link a phone to an identifiable owner. He has likened the problem to that faced by car manufacturers who built security measures into car stereos in order to make them unattractive to thieves. The home secretary will also unveil the government's latest plan to reduce violent crime. The British Crime Survey showed a 10% fall in total crime between 1997 and 1999, but robberies were up by 14%. In the 12 months to March 2000, the number or robberies reported to the police rose by 26%. Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe described Mr Straw's claim that it was impossible to say whether, overall, violent crime had gone up or down, as his \"feeblest excuse yet\". \"If, overall, it had gone down, he would be shouting that from the rooftops,\" she said. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, urged Mr Straw to encourage police officers approaching retirement to stay on for up to five years and also to invite back good officers who had recently retired. He said, \"I am today formally asking Jack Straw to invite police officers approaching retirement to stay for up to five years and to invite back good police officers who have retired in the last five years.\" Mr. Straw answered both points. He said: \"The number of police officers who have been retiring or resigning has actually gone down in the last three years. \"We have pushed up the pay for London officers by \u00a33,500 and recruitment is now in many parts of the country at its highest level. \"Conservatives have basically nothing to say on crime. During their period in office, crime doubled,\" he added. \u0095 Home Secretary Jack Straw surprised a Big Issue seller today by handing over a tenner - then asking for his change. Homeless Big Issue salesman Jaz Walter offered the politician a copy of the \u00a31 magazine during a walkabout in King's Cross, central London. Mr Walter said that he thought Mr Straw was going to give him the whole lot when he took the \u00a310 note out of his wallet. But confusion followed when he then had to dig round in his pockets to reimburse him. Mr Straw, who was viewing the success of a scheme to tackle street crime, eventually settled for \u00a38, which was all that Mr Walter had with him.

The author, Jack Zipes, professor of German at the University of Minnesota, says the wildly successful books are part of the \"process by which we homogenise our children\". \"Rowling's books conventionally repeat much of the same sexist and white patriachal biases of classical fairy tales,\" he says in his book, Sticks and Stones: The Troublesome Success of Children's Literature from Slovenly Peter to Harry Potter, to be published by Routledge. \"Rowling has intended from the beginning to write seven novels altogether, a magic number, but if you've read one, you've read them all: the plots are the same, and the storylines become tedious and grating after you have read the first,\" Zipes writes. \"What distinguishes the plots, however, are their conventionality, predictability, and happy ends despite the clever turns of phrases and surprising twists ... They sell extraordinarily well precisely because they are so cute and ordinary.\" Rowling's publishers, Bloomsbury, said the author was away.",

      "bodyText": "ITV is reviving the double-anchor format for its teatime news, with rising star Mary Nightingale flying straight into the top seat alongside Dermot Murnaghan. ITV bosses today also they will be reuniting Sir Trevor McDonald with the News at Ten on January 22. But the biggest promotion goes to Ms Nightingale, long a favourite of ITV bosses. She made her name as Alastair Stewart's co-presenter on London's local TV news service but has been groomed for greater things ever since joining Carlton TV as presenter of ITV holiday programme Wish You Were Here. Ms Nightingale will be standing in for Kirsty Young, who is due to give birth in February. But the maternity cover will be longer than usual because Ms Young was forced to quit work early because of pregnancy-related illness, giving Ms Nightingale a golden opportunity to establish herself as a household name. The decision to relaunch the teatime news with co-anchors comes eight years after the format was dumped for News at Ten. The promotion means newscaster Katie Derham stays put to present the ITV Weekend News from Fridays to Saturdays and will continue as media and arts correspondent for ITV News. Some say this is a blow for Ms Derham, who was tipped as the face of the millennium. ITV bosses, however, say that the weekend news is one of the network's biggest showcases with big audiences. ITV also revealed that they would be sticking with the News at Ten title, referring to the bulletin as ITV News at Ten. Mr McDonald said: \"I am delighted to be back with the news in the 10 o'clock slot. I'm looking forward to the new programme immensely and to the challenge of taking ITV News head-to-head with the BBC for the first time.\" Sir Trevor, along with other high-profile ITN journalists, was known to be furious at the decision by ITV at the beginning of 1999 to move News at Ten, a national institution.

The charity commission says the new trustees are well on the way to restructuring their management and cutting administrative costs.</p> <p>Documents passed to the Guardian and Channel 4 News show it was the bribery revelation that forced the patrons and former trustees to take action. Bill Leeson, the charity's co-founder, and Mike Terry, employed as a consultant, took a DM40,000 (\u00a314,716) gift in November 1996 from Hydrogradnja, the main contractor, for building the Pavarotti music centre in Mostar. The pair offered to share the proceeds with David Wilson, the Mostar centre director and co-founder, who refused and notified trustees.</p> <p>The trustees convened an extraordinary meeting and ordered that the money to be returned - only to discover that Mr Leeson had six months earlier also taken DM5000 (\u00a31,670) from the sale of bakery machinery. The charity says this was authorised.</p> <p>Nigel Osbourne, director of music for the centre and professor of music at Edinburgh University, described the \"bung\" as \"a catastrophic betrayal\" for \"those who have risked their lives and livelihoods for the music centre\".</p> <p>Bill Leeson, who had spent some of the cash, defended his decision to Mr Wilson saying: \"It was a totally legitimate business gift ... a small consolation for the price I have paid financially and emotionally and probably physically for the last four years.\"</p> <p>The trustees hushed up the episode from the patrons, kept Mr Leeson in his post and told Mike Terry he must quit.</p> <p>Two years later Mr Terry was re-engaged on fresh projects against the trustees' advice. This led David Wilson to inform Luciano Pavarotti in New York about the scandal. Within a month, on April 9 1999, Brian Eno and Sir Tom Stoppard met trustees at the charity's office in London to try to sort out the problem.</p> <p>They called for the retirement of Bill Leeson, the disolution of the management committee, and the transfer of Pavarotti projects out of War Child UK. But nothing happened and the patrons and nearly all the trustees quit.</p> <p>Sir Tom Stoppard told the Guardian: \"It was a very confusing situation and I became confused myself and I felt it could only be resolved by a thorough inquiry, so I decided to leave.\"</p> <p>Bill Leeson, who could not be contacted, has inflamed the situation by now saying on behalf of War Child that he wanted to get rid of the celebrities all along.</p> <p>Rosie Boycott, editor of the Daily Express, a current trustee of War Child, said yesterday that she hoped the charity would overcome what she admitted had been a nightmare and continue its unique work.</p> <p>Daily Express readers raised \u00a3165,000 for a War Child bakery in Kosovo last year - a project praised by Parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, and given \u00a3350,000 by the government.</p> <p><b>Related story</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,420168,00.html\">A charity caught up in chaos</a></p> <p><b>Useful link</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.warchild.org/\" target=\"_new\">War Child</a></p>",

A joint investigation by the Guardian and Channel 4 News - to be shown at 7pm tonight - has discovered that the decision by the celebrities to quit and resignations from 11 trustees over the last two years has led to an inquiry by the charity commission into the running of War Child UK. The inquiry - conducted with the co-operation of the remaining trustees - has confirmed the payment of bribes in Bosnia, excessive administrative expenditure and that too many staff took trips abroad to visit projects and attend fund-raising concerts. The charity commission says the new trustees are well on the way to restructuring their management and cutting administrative costs. Documents passed to the Guardian and Channel 4 News show it was the bribery revelation that forced the patrons and former trustees to take action. Bill Leeson, the charity's co-founder, and Mike Terry, employed as a consultant, took a DM40,000 (\u00a314,716) gift in November 1996 from Hydrogradnja, the main contractor, for building the Pavarotti music centre in Mostar. The pair offered to share the proceeds with David Wilson, the Mostar centre director and co-founder, who refused and notified trustees. The trustees convened an extraordinary meeting and ordered that the money to be returned - only to discover that Mr Leeson had six months earlier also taken DM5000 (\u00a31,670) from the sale of bakery machinery. The charity says this was authorised. Nigel Osbourne, director of music for the centre and professor of music at Edinburgh University, described the \"bung\" as \"a catastrophic betrayal\" for \"those who have risked their lives and livelihoods for the music centre\". Bill Leeson, who had spent some of the cash, defended his decision to Mr Wilson saying: \"It was a totally legitimate business gift ... a small consolation for the price I have paid financially and emotionally and probably physically for the last four years.\" The trustees hushed up the episode from the patrons, kept Mr Leeson in his post and told Mike Terry he must quit. Two years later Mr Terry was re-engaged on fresh projects against the trustees' advice. This led David Wilson to inform Luciano Pavarotti in New York about the scandal. Within a month, on April 9 1999, Brian Eno and Sir Tom Stoppard met trustees at the charity's office in London to try to sort out the problem. They called for the retirement of Bill Leeson, the disolution of the management committee, and the transfer of Pavarotti projects out of War Child UK. But nothing happened and the patrons and nearly all the trustees quit. Sir Tom Stoppard told the Guardian: \"It was a very confusing situation and I became confused myself and I felt it could only be resolved by a thorough inquiry, so I decided to leave.\" Bill Leeson, who could not be contacted, has inflamed the situation by now saying on behalf of War Child that he wanted to get rid of the celebrities all along. Rosie Boycott, editor of the Daily Express, a current trustee of War Child, said yesterday that she hoped the charity would overcome what she admitted had been a nightmare and continue its unique work. Daily Express readers raised \u00a3165,000 for a War Child bakery in Kosovo last year - a project praised by Parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, and given \u00a3350,000 by the government.

      "bodyText": "UK newspapers are facing a tough 2001 after market leader Trinity Mirror reported a slump in circulation. The owner of the Mirror and Sunday People said in a trading statement that circulation at its regional and national titles had fallen last year, although its Daily Record and Sunday Mail titles improved their share of the Scottish market. \"The group's regional newspapers continued to experience a decline in circulation during the second half of the year in line with the regional newspaper market,\" the group said. Trinity Mirror added that the Mirror, the Sunday Mirror and Sunday People had suffered \"small losses\" in market share. In line with the rest of the media sector, Trinity Mirror's national newspapers experienced a fall in advertising growth. The group said that revenues had grown by just 0.6% in the last six months of 2000, against 5% for the first half of the year. However, Trinity Mirror said that full-year revenues were in line with the company's expectations, buoyed by better sales in the final two months of last year. Worries about falling ad revenues have been compounded by rising newsprint costs, which are expected to increase by 15% this year and hit margins at newspaper publishers. Analysts are concerned that manufacturing costs are climbing at a time when earnings are under increasing pressure. Trinity Mirror hopes to offset the rising price of paper with increased revenues from its internet businesses and \u00a34m-worth of savings from its acquisition of Southnews last year. Trinity Mirror's shares fell 1%, or 4.5p, to 454p in early trading.",

      "byline": "David Hencke Westminster correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Luciano Pavarotti has walked out of the high-profile overseas aid charity, War Child UK, with five other celebrity patrons after discovering that its co-founder had taken a bribe from contractors building a prestigious music centre named after him in Bosnia. </p> <p>The opera maestro - who along with the rock musician Brian Eno persuaded other stars like Elton John, Bono and Eric Clapton to perform in concerts and donate royalties to raise millions of pounds for the charity - quit after discovering that two people involved with the organisation had taken bribes and that there were concerns over financial and management controls. Pavarotti himself has raised more than $10m (\u00a36.6m). </p> <p>High profile patrons of the charity included the playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, film and Royal Shakespeare Company actress Juliet Stevenson, pop star David Bowie, and MTV chief Brent Hanson. They have also resigned because they are not happy about the direction of the organisation which helps children rebuild their lives in war-torn countries from former Yugoslavia to Liberia and Rwanda. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Pavarotti said: \"He did not want to be associated with anything that was corrupt and wanted every dollar that he had raised to be accountable. On one project - the Liberian children's village - he had to wait one year before he could get the accounts and then found most of the money had been spent on the project in London but without practical result.\" </p> <p>As a result, the world-famous tenor personally directed that money for former War Child UK projects in former Yugoslavia, Liberia and Guatemala be chanelled by other charities. </p> <p>A joint investigation by the Guardian and Channel 4 News - to be shown at 7pm tonight - has discovered that the decision by the celebrities to quit and resignations from 11 trustees over the last two years has led to an inquiry by the charity commission into the running of War Child UK. </p> <p>The inquiry - conducted with the co-operation of the remaining trustees - has confirmed the payment of bribes in Bosnia, excessive administrative expenditure and that too many staff took trips abroad to visit projects and attend fund-raising concerts. The charity commission says the new trustees are well on the way to restructuring their management and cutting administrative costs. </p> <p>Documents passed to the Guardian and Channel 4 News show it was the bribery revelation that forced the patrons and former trustees to take action. Bill Leeson, the charity's co-founder, and Mike Terry, employed as a consultant, took a DM40,000 (\u00a314,716) gift in November 1996 from Hydrogradnja, the main contractor, for building the Pavarotti music centre in Mostar. The pair offered to share the proceeds with David Wilson, the Mostar centre director and co-founder, who refused and notified trustees. </p> <p>The trustees convened an extraordinary meeting and ordered that the money to be returned - only to discover that Mr Leeson had six months earlier also taken DM5000 (\u00a31,670) from the sale of bakery machinery. The charity says this was authorised. </p> <p>Nigel Osbourne, director of music for the centre and professor of music at Edinburgh University, described the \"bung\" as \"a catastrophic betrayal\" for \"those who have risked their lives and livelihoods for the music centre\". </p> <p>Bill Leeson, who had spent some of the cash, defended his decision to Mr Wilson saying: \"It was a totally legitimate business gift ... a small consolation for the price I have paid financially and emotionally and probably physically for the last four years.\" </p> <p>The trustees hushed up the episode from the patrons, kept Mr Leeson in his post and told Mike Terry he must quit. </p> <p>Two years later Mr Terry was re-engaged on fresh projects against the trustees' advice. This led David Wilson to inform Luciano Pavarotti in New York about the scandal. Within a month, on April 9 1999, Brian Eno and Sir Tom Stoppard met trustees at the charity's office in London to try to sort out the problem. </p> <p>They called for the retirement of Bill Leeson, the disolution of the management committee, and the transfer of Pavarotti projects out of War Child UK. But nothing happened and the patrons and nearly all the trustees quit. </p> <p>Sir Tom Stoppard told the Guardian: \"It was a very confusing situation and I became confused myself and I felt it could only be resolved by a thorough inquiry, so I decided to leave.\" </p> <p>Bill Leeson, who could not be contacted, has inflamed the situation by now saying on behalf of War Child that he wanted to get rid of the celebrities all along. </p> <p>Rosie Boycott ,editor of the Daily Express, a current trustee of War Child, said yesterday that she hoped the charity would overcome what she admitted had been a nightmare and continue its unique work. </p> <p>Daily Express readers raised \u00a3165,000 for a War Child bakery in Kosovo last year - a project praised by Parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, and given \u00a3350,000 by the government.</p>",

The opera maestro - who along with the rock musician Brian Eno persuaded other stars like Elton John, Bono and Eric Clapton to perform in concerts and donate royalties to raise millions of pounds for the charity - quit after discovering that two people involved with the organisation had taken bribes and that there were concerns over financial and management controls. Pavarotti himself has raised more than $10m (\u00a36.6m). High profile patrons of the charity included the playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, film and Royal Shakespeare Company actress Juliet Stevenson, pop star David Bowie, and MTV chief Brent Hanson. They have also resigned because they are not happy about the direction of the organisation which helps children rebuild their lives in war-torn countries from former Yugoslavia to Liberia and Rwanda. A spokeswoman for Pavarotti said: \"He did not want to be associated with anything that was corrupt and wanted every dollar that he had raised to be accountable. On one project - the Liberian children's village - he had to wait one year before he could get the accounts and then found most of the money had been spent on the project in London but without practical result.\" As a result, the world-famous tenor personally directed that money for former War Child UK projects in former Yugoslavia, Liberia and Guatemala be chanelled by other charities. A joint investigation by the Guardian and Channel 4 News - to be shown at 7pm tonight - has discovered that the decision by the celebrities to quit and resignations from 11 trustees over the last two years has led to an inquiry by the charity commission into the running of War Child UK. The inquiry - conducted with the co-operation of the remaining trustees - has confirmed the payment of bribes in Bosnia, excessive administrative expenditure and that too many staff took trips abroad to visit projects and attend fund-raising concerts. The charity commission says the new trustees are well on the way to restructuring their management and cutting administrative costs. Documents passed to the Guardian and Channel 4 News show it was the bribery revelation that forced the patrons and former trustees to take action. Bill Leeson, the charity's co-founder, and Mike Terry, employed as a consultant, took a DM40,000 (\u00a314,716) gift in November 1996 from Hydrogradnja, the main contractor, for building the Pavarotti music centre in Mostar. The pair offered to share the proceeds with David Wilson, the Mostar centre director and co-founder, who refused and notified trustees. The trustees convened an extraordinary meeting and ordered that the money to be returned - only to discover that Mr Leeson had six months earlier also taken DM5000 (\u00a31,670) from the sale of bakery machinery. The charity says this was authorised. Nigel Osbourne, director of music for the centre and professor of music at Edinburgh University, described the \"bung\" as \"a catastrophic betrayal\" for \"those who have risked their lives and livelihoods for the music centre\". Bill Leeson, who had spent some of the cash, defended his decision to Mr Wilson saying: \"It was a totally legitimate business gift ... a small consolation for the price I have paid financially and emotionally and probably physically for the last four years.\" The trustees hushed up the episode from the patrons, kept Mr Leeson in his post and told Mike Terry he must quit. Two years later Mr Terry was re-engaged on fresh projects against the trustees' advice. This led David Wilson to inform Luciano Pavarotti in New York about the scandal. Within a month, on April 9 1999, Brian Eno and Sir Tom Stoppard met trustees at the charity's office in London to try to sort out the problem. They called for the retirement of Bill Leeson, the disolution of the management committee, and the transfer of Pavarotti projects out of War Child UK. But nothing happened and the patrons and nearly all the trustees quit. Sir Tom Stoppard told the Guardian: \"It was a very confusing situation and I became confused myself and I felt it could only be resolved by a thorough inquiry, so I decided to leave.\" Bill Leeson, who could not be contacted, has inflamed the situation by now saying on behalf of War Child that he wanted to get rid of the celebrities all along. Rosie Boycott ,editor of the Daily Express, a current trustee of War Child, said yesterday that she hoped the charity would overcome what she admitted had been a nightmare and continue its unique work. Daily Express readers raised \u00a3165,000 for a War Child bakery in Kosovo last year - a project praised by Parliament's financial watchdog, the national audit office, and given \u00a3350,000 by the government.",

The rock musician Brian Eno describes both as \"heroic figures\" for being brave enough to go to Bosnia when bullets and bombs were flying and ethnic cleansing was at its height. It was launched at the Royal Festival Hall, London, during a three-day event at which the playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, its first patron, gave a reading. </p> <p>The charity's first big project was a mobile bakery in Bosnia that was feeding 15,000 people a week in east Mostar and frontline villages. </p> <p>Stoppard also describes their work as heroic: \"Here it was a bakery in the centre of the war zone - feeding people whether they were Muslims or orthodox Christians. It was a tremendous thing to do - when it was really needed in an area where nobody would go.\" </p> <p>The success of the bakery also led to their first contact with the world of pop.

War Child UK was becoming increasingly ambitious, with sister organisations established in Holland, West Africa, Italy and the United States. </p> <p>Mr Ritchie said: \"It took us some time to realise we didn't know how much money was coming in. We certainly didn't know how much was being spent.\" </p> <p>Mrs Huhne said: \"It concerned me that at every meeting we had, we didn't have full financial reports.

War Child said its policy for both aid and fundraising trips has always been to spend as little as possible on flights and accommodation. </p> <p> The biggest row broke out over plans to send 19 employees to a concert for Liberian children organised by Pavarotti at Modena in 1998. Khawar Qureshi, a barrister in the chambers of Lord Neill (later to become chairman of the committee for standards in public life) who had taken over as chairman of trustees, warned at the time that this was excessive. \"We are working with public money for the public and are accountable to the public,\" he said in a memo sent on June 2 to Bill Leeson.

Bono, Bob Geldof, myself - there are a lot of people who have some kind of history of being involved in charitable work and in somehow using whatever power they have to change the world and they feel insulated when they are told their views don't count.\" Stars who gave support David Bowie Rock musician and businessman with a personal fortune estimated at \u00a3500m. Born in Brixton, Bowie became a rock superstar in the 1970s. Now known as much as a big Wall Street player as a rock star, he was introduced to War Child through Brian Eno Juliet Stevenson Royal Shakespeare and film actress who was recently awarded a CBE. Now 44, she juggles her acting career with a family. She saw herself \"more as a sleeping patron\" but backed the other patrons over the issues which led to her resignation from her role at War Child Sir Tom Stoppard The renowned playwright was a strong patron of War Child from the start - he even dipped into his own pocket to help David Wilson and Bill Leeson survive in Mostar. He quit the charity with Brian Eno after the ill-fated trustee meeting in 1999 Brent Hanson The head of the 24-hour MTV Europe music channel is not a traditional TV executive. He left TV New Zealand in 1986 because he was \"pissed off that it was getting so corporation-minded\" and still describes himself as \"pretty hip\". He was encouraged to join War Child by Brian Eno and quit at same time The Patron who stayed Neil Morrissey An actor who still strongly supports War Child. Morrissey was a tearaway who spent much of his teens in care. The 38-year-old actor admits his feelings of anger have subsided \"an awful lot\" since he began working as a goodwill ambassador for the charity War Child: \"Before this job started, I was in Rwanda and Sudan, and before that Kosovo. When you come back you don't have road rage, believe me.\"",

She is one of the lucky ones. Her absence, at least, was noted and she was cut down and eventually revived. </p> <p>\"It was quite easy,\" said Ms Hart, 53, who is diagnosed psychotic but now lives at home in the midlands. Nurses supervising her were chatting about their holidays when she made the suicide attempt seven years ago. She survived a further attempt last summer, on the same ward, when she drank bath cleaner she had smuggled to her room. </p> <p>Others are not so lucky. About 180 psychiatric in-patients commit suicide each year. Almost half the suicides happen on the ward itself, or in hospital grounds, and the rest while patients are on leave, according to the national confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness. Hanging, usually from shower or curtain rails, is the most common method. A quarter of wards where suicides happen have nursing shortages. One in five patients is under special observation - 3% \"constantly\" - at the time they kill themselves. </p> <p>One of them was a friend of Ms Hart's, a 56-year-old man who hanged himself in 1999 from the same pipe Ms Hart had used. The pipe has finally, said Ms Hart, been boxed in. </p> <p>Psychiatric services appear slow to learn the lessons. Since 1971 repeated reports have recommended wards could reduce suicides at a stroke by replacing fixed curtain and shower rails with collapsible versions. Yet data to the ongoing confidential inquiry reveal such deaths are still happening. At the same time, other means of committing suicide are readily available while obvious preventive measures are ignored. </p> <p>Now the government wants all suicides by hanging from non-collapsible rails eliminated by March next year. Mental health lobby groups would like to go further and prevent all suicides on the wards. So is the NHS doing enough to stop psychiatric patients taking their lives? Louis Appleby, director of the confidential inquiry, thinks not. And now, as the recently appointed mental health tsar, he is in the unusual position of implementing his own recommendations. </p> <p>They include removing from wards all structures that could be used for hanging, eliminating obstructions to observing patients and ensuring staff in contact with suicidal patients are trained in recognising, assessing and managing that risk. He finds it \"staggering\" that one in 25 of all suicides takes place on a psychiatric ward - almost twice the rate of suicides in prisons, although these receive far more publicity. </p> <p>And although many psychiatric wards have already removed obvious hanging points, he says reports of deaths from fixed rails continue. Services could do more to reduce suicides through more training, increased vigilance, improved ward design and better assessment of risk, he believes. But eliminating suicides entirely is \"unrealistic\". He said: \"Admission is often because people are suicidal so we are already dealing with a very high risk group. A completely risk-free environment would be stark and oppressive. You always have to balance these issues of safety against the dignity of the surroundings for people.\" </p> <p>Margaret Clayton, who chairs the mental health act commission, agreed: \"Unless you have constant one-to-one observation, which would be totally unacceptable to the patients, it is impossible completely to rule out suicides.\" She backed the inquiry's recommendations, which have been echoed in commission reports. An audit by the commission in 1999 found that 31 people detained under the Mental Health Act, supposedly for their own or others' safety, hanged themselves in the 12 months up to February 1998 and 20 had had ready access to belts or dressing gown cords, as well as the means, such as rails, from which to hang themselves. </p> <p>The key factor - highlighted in a repeat audit out shortly - is assessing risk, argues Ms Clayton. \"If you have more and better trained staff that always helps, but you have to draw a balance somewhere between almost harassing the patient,\" she said.</p> <p>Leading psychiatrists also regard some suicides as inevitable. \"There is always a tension between being oppressive and being safe,\" said Geoff Searle, consultant psychiatrist at St Ann's hospital, Poole. Leaving fixed rails in place is \"stupidity\", he said. But removing all means of committing suicide - including door knobs, pictures and crockery - would turn psychiatric wards into prisons. </p> <p>\"You can end up with an incredibly arid environment,\" he said. Truly determined patients will still find ways to kill themselves. He recalled a patient on a locked ward who propped up his bed, tied a sheet to the rungs and dropped to his knees to hang himself. </p> <p>Tony Maden, professor of forensic psychiatry at Imperial College, London, says all suicides are theoretically preventable but the emotional cost can be too high. While suicides could be stopped through one-to-one, arms-length observation by staff, this would be extremely intrusive. </p> <p>But lobby groups condemn the attitude that suicide is unavoidable on psychiatric wards. \"It should not be seen as an outcome of mental illness.

      "body": "<p>Whenever I hear a patient called a client I shudder, just as I used to when my teacher caught her nail on the blackboard as she was writing on it with chalk. There is something about the term - it is simultaneously unctuous and euphemistic, as if some unpleasant reality were being concealed by its use. I can't help thinking we will soon hear prisoners referred to as \"clients\": even the term \"con\" would be preferable to that. </p> <p>Patients in psychiatric services are now rarely referred to except as clients and the usage is now nearly universal. Indeed, if one still uses \"patient\", one can almost feel the disapproval. One is regarded as a reactionary and almost as an enemy of the people. </p> <p>A paper in the latest Psychiatric Bulletin reports the first (admittedly small) survey of psychiatric patients and terminology: did they prefer to be called patients or clients? Overwhelmingly they preferred patients. Social class didn't matter nor did their diagnosis; in fact there was no identifiable subgroup that preferred to be called clients. </p> <p>As the authors of the survey - psychiatrists at the Royal Free Hospital in London and at the Royal Park Hospital in Melbourne - point out, the two words have quite different connotations. A patient is a suffering person who either seeks or needs care. A client is a person who buys a service.

      "bodyText": "Whenever I hear a patient called a client I shudder, just as I used to when my teacher caught her nail on the blackboard as she was writing on it with chalk. There is something about the term - it is simultaneously unctuous and euphemistic, as if some unpleasant reality were being concealed by its use. I can't help thinking we will soon hear prisoners referred to as \"clients\": even the term \"con\" would be preferable to that. Patients in psychiatric services are now rarely referred to except as clients and the usage is now nearly universal. Indeed, if one still uses \"patient\", one can almost feel the disapproval. One is regarded as a reactionary and almost as an enemy of the people. A paper in the latest Psychiatric Bulletin reports the first (admittedly small) survey of psychiatric patients and terminology: did they prefer to be called patients or clients? Overwhelmingly they preferred patients. Social class didn't matter nor did their diagnosis; in fact there was no identifiable subgroup that preferred to be called clients. As the authors of the survey - psychiatrists at the Royal Free Hospital in London and at the Royal Park Hospital in Melbourne - point out, the two words have quite different connotations. A patient is a suffering person who either seeks or needs care. A client is a person who buys a service. Patients go to doctors, clients go to lawyers (or prostitutes). The authors quote Ben Pimlott's introduction to the Penguin edition of Nineteen Eighty-Four: when Orwell noted the eagerness with which truth evaders shy away from well-known words and substitute their own he was observing it as something as relevant to petty bureaucrats as to dictators. The demand that patients should become clients clearly did not originate with the patients themselves. I have never heard a single one ask to be called a client, though some, who wish to be left alone with their delusions and hallucinations, don't want to be called patients either. Two questions emerge, one historical and one practical. Why did the change in terminology occur, and what happens next? Ostensibly, the term client was introduced to equalise the relationship between the provider and recipient of help and attention. A client, after all, actively chooses his adviser and pays him: his payment stands guarantor of his dignity. In the NHS, no one pays his doctor or even chooses him. The patient gets whom he's given. And a patient is much more passive, even when he does pay. He has things done to him. A patient, but not a client, is worthy of compassion because it is acknowledged that he is, by definition, a sufferer and therefore in need of succour and relief. An involuntary patient is not a contradiction in terms; but an involuntary client is. The real reason for the change was a power struggle between various factions in the psychiatric services. It had nothing to do with the wishes of patients, or even with increasing professional respect for them. Some people who worked in the psychiatric services just felt that doctors needed demoting, or putting in their place: and doctors above all see patients, therefore patients had to be turned into clients, whether they wanted it or not.

Readers complained they couldn't get through to the bonanza phonelines and one man who believed he had hit a minor jackpot was told his scratchcard was a \"misprint\". The Advertising Standards Authority received 16 complaints from the public about the Guaranteed Millionaire game which the paper, and its sister title News of the World, ran back in August. The most serious involved a man who believed he had followed the rules and won \u00a35,000, only to be told by the promoters that his card was invalid because of a printing error. Other complainants claimed the phone lines were so busy they were unable to get through. The ASA upheld the complaints against the Sun saying that it \"was not satisfied that the promotion had been properly administered or that enough had been done to avoid disappointing participants.\" It warned the newspaper to take more care in the future. It was particularly concerned that the \u00a35,000 winner had not been given an explanation as to why his claim had not been honoured. The Sun's marketing director was unavailable for comment on the complaints, but a spokeswoman pointed out that two lucky readers had become millionaires already. In a separate ruling, French Connection is in the dock again for its shock tactics. The authority upheld complaints about for running of an advert in the Evening Standard on the opening of its massive Oxford Street store, headlined \"world's biggest FCUK.\" It considered the advert \"likely to cause serious or widespread offence\" French Connection was told not to use the same crude approach in its advertising again. It also upheld complaints by the Countryside Alliance against The League Against Cruel Sports over \"exaggerated\" claims about the cruelty and impact of the hunting and coursing of hares.

      "body": "<p>Britain's latest pop sensation touches down at New York's JFK airport this afternoon, with his backers hoping for scenes reminiscent of the height of Beatlemania. Around 600 members of the media and hordes of screaming pre-schoolers are expected to meet the star, who will be taken by motorcade to Manhattan for a meeting with former president Jimmy Carter, then on to an appearance on the Rosie O'Donnell chat show. </p> <p>Bob the Builder, the animated DIY expert and idol of the under-fives, arrives in town hoping to make it where several of Britain's biggest acts have failed. </p> <p>He has already \"fixed it\" in every other leading market around the world, from Australia to Japan, but America remains the biggest and most important country to conquer. And not every character has succeeded. Budgie the Helicopter, the Duchess of York's much-hyped childrens' cartoon, failed to live up to expectations and the company that originally owned the rights got into financial difficulty. </p> <p><strong>Imagination</strong><br> </p> <p>Similarly, veteran glove puppet Sooty never really captured the imagination of American children. </p> <p>From Monday, half-hour episodes of Bob the Builder's adventures will be aired five times each week on Nickelodeon, the Viacom-owned television network that reaches an estimated 9m American pre-school children each week. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, toy maker Hasbro will start selling a range of Bob merchandise, while publishers Simon &amp; Schuster and Golden have prepared a range of story and activity books respectively. </p> <p>Yet nobody will be hoping Bob hits the nail on the head more than Peter Orton, chief executive of HIT Entertainment, the children's entertainment firm that created Bob and owns all broadcasting and licensing rights. </p> <p>\"The US market tends to be the acid test that defines whether a childrens' character can become a truly global property,\" explained Mr Orton, who in previous jobs played leading roles in the commercial success of classic shows such as The Muppets and Sesame Street </p> <p>\"I'm optimistic. In the UK, Bob is every bit as big as the Muppets when they were at their most popular. He has a tremendous opportunity to become a major pre-school property over the next 10 years.\" </p> <p>Around $3.5m (\u00a32.5m) is being spent by HIT, its licencees and the network on launching Bob in the US. Much of the cost for HIT has come from knitting together its standard 10-minute Bob slots with new two-and-a-half minute \"bridging\" pieces to make 26 22.5 minute programmes, which - with adverts and credits - fill a half-hour slot. </p> <p>Nickelodeon pays HIT about \u00a3100,000 for each episode it airs, but the most lucrative revenues as far as the British firm is concerned will come from its cut of merchandising and video sales. About 200,000 Bob videos were sold in Britain over the Christmas period alone, taking the total well past the 1m mark. </p> <p>\"The US market is around five times as big as the UK so I'd hope we'd sell around 5m or 6m videos over there for every million we sell here,\" Mr Orton said. Each video retails for about \u00a39.99, with HIT taking about \u00a34.50 of that. Once manufacturing and marketing costs are taken into account, \u00a32 per video is clear profit. </p> <p>Yet Mr Orton is proceeding with caution. \"The size of the US market is significant but how well we do depends on how well we manage it. With Bob we're trying to build a brand which becomes a classic. We want parents to feel the products represent value and quality. Bob's integrity has to be preserved.\" </p> <p>There are 60 licencees to make Bob products; many more were turned down. </p> <p>HIT has decided to take total control of its video sales in the US and set up its own video label which will also sell tapes of Angelina Ballerina, another HIT character. \"It means we control the whole process from the editorial stage right through to publishing. We're not exposed to the vagaries of agents who may oversell,\" said Mr Orton. Sensible management or not, Mr Orton will nervously await the first week's viewing figures. </p> <p>The price of HIT shares has climbed sharply over the past two years, largely due to the success of Bob, which will increase group revenues from \u00a320m now to about \u00a326.5m in 2001. Then the shares traded at about 140p; today they change hands at 407.5p, valuing HIT at \u00a3390m. </p> <p><strong>Favourite</strong><br> </p> <p>Many investors have already bought in anticipation of US success. The States is expected to account for 35% of total group sales in 2001; by 2004 that figure is expected to jump to 60%. </p> <p>Britt Allcroft-owned Thomas the Tank Engine, which is probably the premier British children's property and a big favourite in the US, is thought to be worth \u00a3130m. On that basis analysts believe Bob could eventually be worth more. </p> <p>The Tweenies could also enter that league - if they are a success in the US. </p> <p>Yet some analysts caution that Bob's success could eventually count against HIT. \"If their next big character isn't as successful people are likely to say they have failed,\" said one analyst. </p> <p>HIT's new product pipeline includes Oswald the Octopus and a show set in a bath tub with the title of Splish, Splash, Splosh. </p> <p>A rubber duck claiming the Christmas number one? If Mr Blobby can make it, why not?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's latest pop sensation touches down at New York's JFK airport this afternoon, with his backers hoping for scenes reminiscent of the height of Beatlemania. Around 600 members of the media and hordes of screaming pre-schoolers are expected to meet the star, who will be taken by motorcade to Manhattan for a meeting with former president Jimmy Carter, then on to an appearance on the Rosie O'Donnell chat show. Bob the Builder, the animated DIY expert and idol of the under-fives, arrives in town hoping to make it where several of Britain's biggest acts have failed. He has already \"fixed it\" in every other leading market around the world, from Australia to Japan, but America remains the biggest and most important country to conquer. And not every character has succeeded. Budgie the Helicopter, the Duchess of York's much-hyped childrens' cartoon, failed to live up to expectations and the company that originally owned the rights got into financial difficulty. Imagination Similarly, veteran glove puppet Sooty never really captured the imagination of American children. From Monday, half-hour episodes of Bob the Builder's adventures will be aired five times each week on Nickelodeon, the Viacom-owned television network that reaches an estimated 9m American pre-school children each week. Shortly afterwards, toy maker Hasbro will start selling a range of Bob merchandise, while publishers Simon &amp; Schuster and Golden have prepared a range of story and activity books respectively. Yet nobody will be hoping Bob hits the nail on the head more than Peter Orton, chief executive of HIT Entertainment, the children's entertainment firm that created Bob and owns all broadcasting and licensing rights. \"The US market tends to be the acid test that defines whether a childrens' character can become a truly global property,\" explained Mr Orton, who in previous jobs played leading roles in the commercial success of classic shows such as The Muppets and Sesame Street \"I'm optimistic. In the UK, Bob is every bit as big as the Muppets when they were at their most popular. He has a tremendous opportunity to become a major pre-school property over the next 10 years.\" Around $3.5m (\u00a32.5m) is being spent by HIT, its licencees and the network on launching Bob in the US. Much of the cost for HIT has come from knitting together its standard 10-minute Bob slots with new two-and-a-half minute \"bridging\" pieces to make 26 22.5 minute programmes, which - with adverts and credits - fill a half-hour slot. Nickelodeon pays HIT about \u00a3100,000 for each episode it airs, but the most lucrative revenues as far as the British firm is concerned will come from its cut of merchandising and video sales. About 200,000 Bob videos were sold in Britain over the Christmas period alone, taking the total well past the 1m mark. \"The US market is around five times as big as the UK so I'd hope we'd sell around 5m or 6m videos over there for every million we sell here,\" Mr Orton said. Each video retails for about \u00a39.99, with HIT taking about \u00a34.50 of that. Once manufacturing and marketing costs are taken into account, \u00a32 per video is clear profit. Yet Mr Orton is proceeding with caution. \"The size of the US market is significant but how well we do depends on how well we manage it. With Bob we're trying to build a brand which becomes a classic. We want parents to feel the products represent value and quality. Bob's integrity has to be preserved.\" There are 60 licencees to make Bob products; many more were turned down. HIT has decided to take total control of its video sales in the US and set up its own video label which will also sell tapes of Angelina Ballerina, another HIT character. \"It means we control the whole process from the editorial stage right through to publishing. We're not exposed to the vagaries of agents who may oversell,\" said Mr Orton. Sensible management or not, Mr Orton will nervously await the first week's viewing figures. The price of HIT shares has climbed sharply over the past two years, largely due to the success of Bob, which will increase group revenues from \u00a320m now to about \u00a326.5m in 2001. Then the shares traded at about 140p; today they change hands at 407.5p, valuing HIT at \u00a3390m. Favourite Many investors have already bought in anticipation of US success. The States is expected to account for 35% of total group sales in 2001; by 2004 that figure is expected to jump to 60%. Britt Allcroft-owned Thomas the Tank Engine, which is probably the premier British children's property and a big favourite in the US, is thought to be worth \u00a3130m. On that basis analysts believe Bob could eventually be worth more. The Tweenies could also enter that league - if they are a success in the US. Yet some analysts caution that Bob's success could eventually count against HIT. \"If their next big character isn't as successful people are likely to say they have failed,\" said one analyst. HIT's new product pipeline includes Oswald the Octopus and a show set in a bath tub with the title of Splish, Splash, Splosh. A rubber duck claiming the Christmas number one? If Mr Blobby can make it, why not?",

With both men diplomatically stressing their appreciation for each other, Mr Prodi told reporters that he was delighted with Sweden's focus on enlargement, the environment and employment - a deliberately catchy and alliterative trio of high-priority EU policies. But he added, in a characteristically jokey aside that barely concealed a more serious truth: \"I am only sorry that these three Es are not followed by a fourth - euro.\" Sweden, Britain and Denmark are now the only members of the 15-strong EU not in the single currency zone following Greece's accession on January 1 after it met the Maastricht treaty's tough convergence criteria. Mr Persson repeated that a referendum was a long way off and depended on economic conditions and wage settlements, though his Social Democratic party wants to join. But he acknowledged that last September's Danish \"no\" to the euro was a setback, as is the uncertainty about Tony Blair's position on a British referendum, which is unlikely to be clarified until after a spring general election.

They have paid the tax and they want to know where all the money has gone,\" Mr Hague told a press conference after an attempt to project the new Tory poster on to the Millennium Dome at Greenwich had been thwarted by security staff. Charles Kennedy, the Lib Dem leader, attacked both rival parties for \"pretending you can get something for nothing\" in modernising services and cutting taxes. The GMB leader, John Edmonds, condemned \"Tory hypocrisy\".</p> <p>But some unions were impressed by the Hague posters showing people waiting for trains or NHS operations. \"It's typical Tory black propaganda, but it's effective and needs a swift response,\" conceded one.</p> <p>Ministers criticised the Tory strategy of linking extra taxes with embattled public services, while ignoring the buoyant state of the economy as a whole, and said the Tories were still vulnerable to charges that there is a \u00a316bn hole in Mr Portillo's own tax-and-spend package.</p> <p>Yesterday the shadow chancellor said there was a risk of Labour creating \"a form of boom and bust in the public finances\" which means either spending cuts after three years or even higher taxes to sustain the 3% growth in spending. Voters also suspected that Labour's extra taxes were producing no real benefits, Mr Portillo said.</p> <p>The Tories claim they can cut taxes, protect spending on the NHS and schools at Labour levels and improve efficiency because Labour has wasted money on the dome, on bureaucracy, failure to reform welfare and preparing to join the euro. They have promised to cut \u00a38bn worth of waste, though Mr Portillo is waiting to see Mr Brown's budget before detailing \u00a32bn worth. Outside experts like the Institute for Fiscal Studies are sceptical of his cuts so far. Mr Portillo prefers to call them \"spending changes\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "William Hague and Michael Portillo yesterday accused Labour of raising taxes by the equivalent of 10p in the \u00a3 since 1997 - and of wasting the money instead of improving public services. Under the slogan \"You've paid the tax, so where's all the money gone?\", Mr Hague launched a poster campaign and taunted Tony Blair as the \"great pretender\" who had left schools and hospitals in crisis, streets without enough police and transport at a standstill. \"People aren't fooled any more by Tony Blair, the great pretender. They have paid the tax and they want to know where all the money has gone,\" Mr Hague told a press conference after an attempt to project the new Tory poster on to the Millennium Dome at Greenwich had been thwarted by security staff. Charles Kennedy, the Lib Dem leader, attacked both rival parties for \"pretending you can get something for nothing\" in modernising services and cutting taxes. The GMB leader, John Edmonds, condemned \"Tory hypocrisy\". But some unions were impressed by the Hague posters showing people waiting for trains or NHS operations. \"It's typical Tory black propaganda, but it's effective and needs a swift response,\" conceded one. Ministers criticised the Tory strategy of linking extra taxes with embattled public services, while ignoring the buoyant state of the economy as a whole, and said the Tories were still vulnerable to charges that there is a \u00a316bn hole in Mr Portillo's own tax-and-spend package. Yesterday the shadow chancellor said there was a risk of Labour creating \"a form of boom and bust in the public finances\" which means either spending cuts after three years or even higher taxes to sustain the 3% growth in spending. Voters also suspected that Labour's extra taxes were producing no real benefits, Mr Portillo said. The Tories claim they can cut taxes, protect spending on the NHS and schools at Labour levels and improve efficiency because Labour has wasted money on the dome, on bureaucracy, failure to reform welfare and preparing to join the euro. They have promised to cut \u00a38bn worth of waste, though Mr Portillo is waiting to see Mr Brown's budget before detailing \u00a32bn worth. Outside experts like the Institute for Fiscal Studies are sceptical of his cuts so far. Mr Portillo prefers to call them \"spending changes\".",

      "bodyText": "Prosecution lawyers in the Lockerbie trial yesterday surprised the court by withdrawing two of the charges faced by the defendants and announcing they would concentrate solely on the charge of murder. In an unexpected move, the advocate depute, Alastair Campbell QC, told the Scottish court in the Netherlands the crown would no longer attempt to prove the two accused Libyans were guilty of conspiracy to murder and a breach of the Aviation Security Act. Instead, Mr Campbell said the crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that Abdelbaset Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah were guilty of the murder of the 270 people who died when the jet exploded. \"The decision to delete two of the charges suggests that the prosecution are confident they can prove beyond reasonable doubt the charge of murder,\" said Clare Connelly, of Glasgow University's Lockerbie trial briefing unit. Although the crown continued to maintain Megrahi had carried out the bombing while operating as a member of the Libyan intelligence agency, the JSO, it withdrew the allegation that Fhimah ever had been a member of the JSO. In his closing speech, Mr Campbell told the court that when all the circumstantial evidence surrounding Megrahi and Fhimah was taken together it was enough to prove their guilt. After 232 witnesses, only three of whom were called by the defence, and 77 days of evidence, Mr Campbell made it clear that the crown's case relied on painstaking forensic evidence and the testimony of a handful of star witnesses. In the scenario put forward by prosecutors, the bomb which blew up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie on December 21 1988 began its journey on an Air Malta plane from the island's Luqa airport. It was at that airport that Fhimah worked as a station manager for Libyan Arab Airlines, and, in a diary produced in evidence, Fhimah referred to obtaining Air Malta baggage tags for Megrahi. The baggage tags are alleged to have been used to get a bronze Samsonite suitcase containing the Toshiba RTSF16 radio cassette recorder which housed the bomb on board flight KM180 from Luqa to Frankfurt. At the German airport, it is alleged, the bag was then transferred to the jumbo. The prosecution traces this scenario back to Megrahi and Fhimah through a series of key facts. Around 80% of Toshiba's RTSF16s were sold solely to Libya and the timer used in the bomb inside the cassette recorder was made by a Swiss company, Mebo. Mr Campbell said the evidence proved Mebo had supplied this timer uniquely to Libya and Megrahi would have had easy access to it. Forensic investigators also traced clothing which was contained in the suitcase with the bomb back to Mary's House, a shop owned by Tony Gauci in Malta. During his testimony, Mr Gauci said a Libyan similar to Megrahi had purchased the clothing a few weeks before Christmas 1988. Mr Campbell, however, said Mr Gauci had made a full identification on two previous occasions. The trial continues.",

Alan Milburn, the health secretary, will announce the concession during the second reading of the health and social care bill. He will say he is ready to fund a new body to collect information about patients' experiences of the NHS and use it to fight for improvements. The government had been facing the threat of a mutiny at the bill's committee stage from Labour MPs worried about its plan to abolish community health councils that have served as patient advocates for the past 26 years. David Hinchliffe, Labour chairman of the health select commitee, said yesterday the bill was \"a dog's breakfast that complicates the complaints procedure for patients when it should be simplifying it\". More than 90 Labour MPs signed a motion on the Commons order paper before the Christmas recess raising concerns about abolition of the CHCs. Mr Hinchliffe said he hoped ministers would bring forward amendments to answer their worries. Mr Milburn will respond by backing a plan produced four weeks ago by voluntary and patients' groups. They proposed a national body to support the recruitment and training of local patient representatives. It would assemble information about patients' experiences of the NHS and use it to give them an effective national voice. The government will fund a steering group to work up a detailed plan by March before the bill completes its passage through parliament. Mr Milburn told colleagues: \"If a national patients' organisation proves possible and practical, we will back it and fund it. We believe patient power is the most important way of raising standards of care, cleanliness and convenience across the NHS.\" His concession comes after the Consumers' Association warned yesterday that the bill would have left patients without any organisation to take a national overview of their experience in hospitals and GP surgeries.

      "bodyText": "A mounting furore over George W Bush's nominee as secretary of labour is threatening to overshadow the incoming Republican administration's efforts to fulfil its pledge to \"change the tone in Washington\". At issue is whether Linda Chavez broke US laws by paying an illegal immigrant and accepting household help from her during the early 1990s, and whether the prospective cabinet member was entirely open about the relationship when she was vetted by Mr Bush's advisers before her nomination. Yesterday the controversy took a further turn when the Wall Street Journal, a strongly pro-Bush paper, reported that Ms Chavez may have tried to brief a former neighbour, who had also employed the Guatemalan immigrant, Marta Mercado, about how to answer questions on the subject from the media and FBI investigators. On Monday, Mr Bush was forced on to the defensive over the issue in a succession of questions from reporters. Mr Bush was not told until this week, several days after he nominated Ms Chavez, that she had paid and given a room to Ms Mercado in the early 1990s. Ms Mercado performed chores for Ms Chavez, including tidying the rooms of her two teenage sons, doing the laundry and walking the dog. Ms Chavez said she gave Ms Mercado \"spending money\" but denied employing her. There were increasing signs yesterday that any further revelations could bring the Chavez nomination to an abrupt end, just as similar accusations did to two of Mr Clinton's nominees as attorney general in 1993. At the time, Ms Chavez condemned one of the nominees, Zoe Baird, for employing an illegal immigrant as a nanny. Quoting officials close to Mr Bush, news agencies reported \"increasing concern\" about Ms Chavez, saying that an internal review and FBI interviews had raised questions about the credibility of her answers. The silver lining for the Bush administration is that the row about Ms Chavez has taken the heat off his controversial nomination of the conservative ex-senator, John Ashcroft, as his attorney general. The Ashcroft nomination is nevertheless likely to resume centre-stage when he begins his own confirmation hearings in front of the Senate judiciary committee later this month. Senate Democrats have already made clear that they regard the Ashcroft hearings as a major opportunity to flex their muscles in the new Congress, as well as sending a signal to Mr Bush about the kind of grilling that any nominees to the supreme court may face during his period in office. Yesterday a coalition of liberal pressure groups announced that more than 200 organisations had formed an alliance to fight Mr Ashcroft's nomination. The groups include civil liberties, environmental, gun control and women's organisations. In a further embarrassment for Mr Bush, his nominee for defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, has been accused of agreeing with racist comments about black people made on 1970s White House tape recordings of his conversations with President Richard Nixon. Mr Rumsfeld was an adviser to Mr Nixon at the time.

Socks, the nine-year-old black and white cat brought to Washington eight years ago by the Clintons, is no longer wanted by America's departing first family. Instead, he is to be adopted by Mr Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, who is proposing to take him to live with her in Virginia as a living memento of her White House years. The abandonment of Socks contrasts with the treatment being accorded to his nemesis, Buddy, Mr Clinton's four-year-old chocolate labrador, who will get to live the good life with the shortly to be ex-president. But Socks, who had his own fan club and website, and was shamelessly exploited in one of Mrs Clinton's publishing ventures - a book entitled Dear Socks, Dear Buddy - is now surplus to requirements. As Socks moves out of the White House, India, the Bush family's black cat, is moving in, along with the family's two dogs, Spot and Barney.",

But the two-year experiment has turned into a costly failure, with blackouts, power shortages and consumer prices due to rise high above the inflation rate.</p> <p>For the governor, the most embarrassing moment came last month when he had to order the state capital's Christmas lights to be turned off as an energy-saving measure, just after he had lit them.</p> <p>Mr Davis, a centrist Democrat with an eye on his party's 2004 presidential nomination, chose his \"state of the state\" speech in Sacramento to mount an astonishing attack on deregulation.</p> <p>\"We have literally lost control over our own power,\" he said. \"We have surrendered the decisions about where electricity is sold, and for what price, to private companies with only one objective: maximising unheard of profits.\"</p> <p>Deregulation had been a \"colossal and dangerous failure\", he said. \"It has not lowered consumer prices; it has not increased supply. It has resulted in skyrocketing prices and an unreliable supply of electricity. In short, an energy nightmare.\"</p> <p>Among his proposals is the appointment of 50 new inspectors for the public utilities commission - to monitor and \"if necessary, stand guard at any facility suspected of deliberately withholding power from the grid\". He seeks to make it a crime to \"deliberately withhold power from the grid if it results in an imminent threat to public health or safety\".</p> <p>More dramatically, he said the state attorney general would \"investigate and prosecute possible racketeering, market manipulation, price fixing and other potential violations by generators... If they are illegally manipulating the market, the attorney general will track them down.\"</p> <p>\"Make no mistake,\" he said, \"we will regain control over the power that's generated in California and commit it to the public good... Never again will we allow profiteers to hold Californians hostage.\"</p> <p>Mr Davis has seen his approval rating drop from 67% to 49% in the last year, mainly because of the sharp increase in electricity prices and the inefficiency of the suppliers. But his strong attack on deregulation chimes with the Californian public's attitude to the power companies. A poll last week by the Los Angeles Times found that 54% of the public believe there is no real electricity shortage and blame greedy power producers for manufacturing a crisis.</p> <p>Mr Davis said the public would have to play its part, too, by reducing electricity consumption by 7%. Cash incentives are to be offered to people who replace old refrigerators and air conditioners with \"energy-smart\" ones.</p> <p>His speech, on the eve of an energy summit in Washington, will be seen as a rallying cry by those who feel that the US is facing an energy crisis and that the deregulation of public services is not the way to tackle it. There will also be a backlash. Mr Davis is already being accused by conservative commentators of being a protectionist who will fall foul of a Bush administration committed to deregulation.</p>",

For the governor, the most embarrassing moment came last month when he had to order the state capital's Christmas lights to be turned off as an energy-saving measure, just after he had lit them. Mr Davis, a centrist Democrat with an eye on his party's 2004 presidential nomination, chose his \"state of the state\" speech in Sacramento to mount an astonishing attack on deregulation. \"We have literally lost control over our own power,\" he said. \"We have surrendered the decisions about where electricity is sold, and for what price, to private companies with only one objective: maximising unheard of profits.\" Deregulation had been a \"colossal and dangerous failure\", he said. \"It has not lowered consumer prices; it has not increased supply. It has resulted in skyrocketing prices and an unreliable supply of electricity. In short, an energy nightmare.\" Among his proposals is the appointment of 50 new inspectors for the public utilities commission - to monitor and \"if necessary, stand guard at any facility suspected of deliberately withholding power from the grid\". He seeks to make it a crime to \"deliberately withhold power from the grid if it results in an imminent threat to public health or safety\". More dramatically, he said the state attorney general would \"investigate and prosecute possible racketeering, market manipulation, price fixing and other potential violations by generators... If they are illegally manipulating the market, the attorney general will track them down.\" \"Make no mistake,\" he said, \"we will regain control over the power that's generated in California and commit it to the public good... Never again will we allow profiteers to hold Californians hostage.\" Mr Davis has seen his approval rating drop from 67% to 49% in the last year, mainly because of the sharp increase in electricity prices and the inefficiency of the suppliers. But his strong attack on deregulation chimes with the Californian public's attitude to the power companies. A poll last week by the Los Angeles Times found that 54% of the public believe there is no real electricity shortage and blame greedy power producers for manufacturing a crisis. Mr Davis said the public would have to play its part, too, by reducing electricity consumption by 7%. Cash incentives are to be offered to people who replace old refrigerators and air conditioners with \"energy-smart\" ones. His speech, on the eve of an energy summit in Washington, will be seen as a rallying cry by those who feel that the US is facing an energy crisis and that the deregulation of public services is not the way to tackle it. There will also be a backlash. Mr Davis is already being accused by conservative commentators of being a protectionist who will fall foul of a Bush administration committed to deregulation.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The 1990s was a decade of renaissance in playwriting. That is beyond question to all but the most deliberately obtuse. For a few happy years, plays were popping up all over the place. You never knew where you would next enjoy a new voice and a treasured evening next - it could be in Manchester, in Glasgow, in Dublin, in London; it could be at the Finborough, the Bush, the Royal Court, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Old Red Lion; it could come from the multicultural argot of a south London estate or from an etiolated tradition of Oxbridge erudition. Theatre's greatest asset, its capacity to surprise and to shock you with your own stupidity, was never more in evidence. </p> <p>An extraordinary energy was rolling in, wave after wave of new plays. Many of them were unspeakable, but every seventh wave washed up a gem, and the occasional tsunami bore a revelation. Where that energy came from, nobody knows. My guess is that its source was the world, rather than the theatre, and it could not be unconnected to the upheavals that shook the world at the end of the 1980s. </p> <p>There was a joke at the time about how overearnest theatre people would connect everything they did to something earth-shattering. A couple playing Judith and David Bliss in Hayfever would suddenly turn to each other with a revelatory insight: \"My god, it's just like the Ceasescus!\"; or a director would instruct his Henry IV and Bolingbroke: \"OK - you're Gorbachev and you're Yeltsin. Think coup!\" </p> <p>The comparisons were of course inflated and silly, but they revealed a truth - that theatre felt then and feels now the pressure of the time more acutely than the other arts. The 1990s couldn't fail to bear the fruit of the spirit and rhythms of history's brief quickstep. </p> <p>As tyrants bled into the snow and walls crumbled, a whole collection of our own certainties and rules fell to pieces. Theatre is inherently political - it has to address an audience and share its air - and it must respond to political change. </p> <p>When the world announced to itself that the old politics was a construct, a lie told by bitter old men to create unnecessary division among the young - when those politics effectively ceased to exist - a door swung open to a whole new world. </p> <p>A world to be addressed in new terms - those of the spirit, of identity, of individual morality, of imagination and sensuality. And of course a whole new politics. These are the terms that theatre is ideally placed to use. </p> <p>Plays with a new form, new content and new ideas suddenly emerged. First there was a resistance, later a welcoming, then a blooming and, as the energy waned, a last stage of exploitation. The final - inevitable - stage is the sad one where those who initially scoffed at the new smell the change in fashion, and decide to buy up the innovations of others, softly and cannily diluting them for a wider audience. </p> <p>One of the most exhilarating qualities of the early 1990s was the breadth of origin of the writers. There was a real sense of the enfranchisement of a whole class into the theatre. Rather than one brilliant, surprising and fresh Andrea Dunbar in a year, there would be five, 10 or 20, among them Richard Cameron, Jonathan Harvey, Catherine Johnson, Billy Roche and David Eldridge. There was also a profusion of dark imaginers, of wild spirits: Philip Ridley, David Ashton, James Stock, Anthony Nielsen, Biyi Bandele, Chris Hannan and many others. And there were the historians who brought a breadth of imagination into their large parables, among them Tony Kushner, Helen Edmundson, April de Angelis, Naomi Wallace and David Harrower. </p> <p>Beyond these new voices there is of course a wealth of talent and genius in our theatrical tradition that long pre-dates the 1990s. My book, The Full Room: An A-Z of Contemporary Playwriting, is as ardent about Pinter, Ayckbourn, Stoppard, Arden, Mamet, Miller, Storey, Churchill, Griffiths and many more, as it is about any of the newcomers. Just to write the names above is an act of pleasure. </p> <p>Even with all that it excludes, the book is a record of a time when there were more great playwrights than ever in the history of the craft. We spend far too little time celebrating that simple fact. This must be a golden age by dint of sheer number. </p> <p>\"Yes, there may be many, but where are the few?\" theatre's self-appointed Olympians will always ask. \"Where are the truly great plays?\" The truth is none of us know, and we can only hope that time is a judicious sieve, and will sort out the fakes from the true. Where I do feel fairly certain is in my optimism that time's list of what is great will not concord with fashion's. There are essentially two rivers running through the history of playwriting. </p> <p>Tributaries run between the two, but they remain essentially separate. There are those who write about life, and there are those who write life. If there is one thing that draws together all the writers named above - as diverse a list as you could wish for - it is that they all write life. This has nothing to do with kettles or kitchen sinks. They can write life on the moon, in history, in Wonderland or in Walthamstow, but they write life, they create it, they make it happen anew in front of an audience. </p> <p>If there is anything that coheres the aesthetic of The Full Room (and I hope there isn't - there's too much coherence in the world already), it is that this is the mark of great writing, the ability to write life. It is only life that will always surprise, and only surprise that will always replenish. </p> <p>But the ability to write life is not the entry card to fashion's top 10. That is reserved for the other school of writer, those who write about life. For some reason that mystifies me our culture continues to promote journalists, analysts and essayists above artists. For some reason we prefer to celebrate not the creators, but those who keep life at one remove. </p> <p>One of the greatest plays of the 1990s was a modest piece called Uganda by Judith Johnson, which played for three weeks at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs. One of the greatest of the 1980s was Singer by Peter Flannery. One of the pre-eminent postwar playwrights is David Storey. How often do these authors feature on top 10 lists? Too rarely, and mainly because they don't work for them. Profile, across a wider range than just playwriting, is often thought to be a result of talent. It is not. </p> <p>It is a matter of hard graft by those who want it. It is a matter of hanging about at press nights; joining boards and appearing on endless platforms, panels and television shows; writing books about your own genius and filling in as many \"My Book of the Year\" submissions as you can get your hands on. We all perceive the nakedness of the greed and desire in these self-promoters, but we all eventually give in, just out of exhaustion, as if to a persistent seducer, and wearily relent: \"Yes, all right, you are a great playwright/actress/film director. Now please, be quiet a moment. I'm trying to think.\" </p> <p> There are 112 essays on as many playwrights in my book, of which only nine are on balance negative. Those nine all figure in the ranks of those who write about life. It is unfortunate (in that it encourages snap judgments of the book) that they are also among the best known and the most ardent self-promoters. </p> <p>There is of course an honourable tradition of playwrights who write about life, who promote themselves, and draw the praise of today, if not tomorrow. The river that bears Euripides, Ben Jonson and Shaw is not a bad one to risk your brand-new canoe in, even if others risk the naked night swim in the rougher river that bore Sophocles and Shakespeare and Chekhov. Discursive, digressive, prismatic work has a place, of course. Life has another. </p> <p>But, no matter, negative thoughts aside, there were and are too many truly great new writers to list. The richness, the range, the fancy, the heart and the soul that have been on view have been breathtaking. If the energy has ebbed a little of late, no doubt it will return again soon. It has a newly politicised world to respond to now. And if the results build on the platform of what has been achieved already, we are in for treats. And, most importantly, for surprises. </p> <p>\u0095 The Full Room: An A-Z of Contemporary Playwriting by Dominic Dromgoole is published by Methuen at \u00a318.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The 1990s was a decade of renaissance in playwriting. That is beyond question to all but the most deliberately obtuse. For a few happy years, plays were popping up all over the place. You never knew where you would next enjoy a new voice and a treasured evening next - it could be in Manchester, in Glasgow, in Dublin, in London; it could be at the Finborough, the Bush, the Royal Court, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Old Red Lion; it could come from the multicultural argot of a south London estate or from an etiolated tradition of Oxbridge erudition. Theatre's greatest asset, its capacity to surprise and to shock you with your own stupidity, was never more in evidence. An extraordinary energy was rolling in, wave after wave of new plays. Many of them were unspeakable, but every seventh wave washed up a gem, and the occasional tsunami bore a revelation. Where that energy came from, nobody knows. My guess is that its source was the world, rather than the theatre, and it could not be unconnected to the upheavals that shook the world at the end of the 1980s. There was a joke at the time about how overearnest theatre people would connect everything they did to something earth-shattering. A couple playing Judith and David Bliss in Hayfever would suddenly turn to each other with a revelatory insight: \"My god, it's just like the Ceasescus!\"; or a director would instruct his Henry IV and Bolingbroke: \"OK - you're Gorbachev and you're Yeltsin. Think coup!\" The comparisons were of course inflated and silly, but they revealed a truth - that theatre felt then and feels now the pressure of the time more acutely than the other arts. The 1990s couldn't fail to bear the fruit of the spirit and rhythms of history's brief quickstep. As tyrants bled into the snow and walls crumbled, a whole collection of our own certainties and rules fell to pieces. Theatre is inherently political - it has to address an audience and share its air - and it must respond to political change. When the world announced to itself that the old politics was a construct, a lie told by bitter old men to create unnecessary division among the young - when those politics effectively ceased to exist - a door swung open to a whole new world. A world to be addressed in new terms - those of the spirit, of identity, of individual morality, of imagination and sensuality. And of course a whole new politics. These are the terms that theatre is ideally placed to use. Plays with a new form, new content and new ideas suddenly emerged. First there was a resistance, later a welcoming, then a blooming and, as the energy waned, a last stage of exploitation. The final - inevitable - stage is the sad one where those who initially scoffed at the new smell the change in fashion, and decide to buy up the innovations of others, softly and cannily diluting them for a wider audience. One of the most exhilarating qualities of the early 1990s was the breadth of origin of the writers. There was a real sense of the enfranchisement of a whole class into the theatre. Rather than one brilliant, surprising and fresh Andrea Dunbar in a year, there would be five, 10 or 20, among them Richard Cameron, Jonathan Harvey, Catherine Johnson, Billy Roche and David Eldridge. There was also a profusion of dark imaginers, of wild spirits: Philip Ridley, David Ashton, James Stock, Anthony Nielsen, Biyi Bandele, Chris Hannan and many others. And there were the historians who brought a breadth of imagination into their large parables, among them Tony Kushner, Helen Edmundson, April de Angelis, Naomi Wallace and David Harrower. Beyond these new voices there is of course a wealth of talent and genius in our theatrical tradition that long pre-dates the 1990s. My book, The Full Room: An A-Z of Contemporary Playwriting, is as ardent about Pinter, Ayckbourn, Stoppard, Arden, Mamet, Miller, Storey, Churchill, Griffiths and many more, as it is about any of the newcomers. Just to write the names above is an act of pleasure. Even with all that it excludes, the book is a record of a time when there were more great playwrights than ever in the history of the craft. We spend far too little time celebrating that simple fact. This must be a golden age by dint of sheer number. \"Yes, there may be many, but where are the few?\" theatre's self-appointed Olympians will always ask. \"Where are the truly great plays?\" The truth is none of us know, and we can only hope that time is a judicious sieve, and will sort out the fakes from the true. Where I do feel fairly certain is in my optimism that time's list of what is great will not concord with fashion's. There are essentially two rivers running through the history of playwriting. Tributaries run between the two, but they remain essentially separate. There are those who write about life, and there are those who write life. If there is one thing that draws together all the writers named above - as diverse a list as you could wish for - it is that they all write life. This has nothing to do with kettles or kitchen sinks. They can write life on the moon, in history, in Wonderland or in Walthamstow, but they write life, they create it, they make it happen anew in front of an audience. If there is anything that coheres the aesthetic of The Full Room (and I hope there isn't - there's too much coherence in the world already), it is that this is the mark of great writing, the ability to write life. It is only life that will always surprise, and only surprise that will always replenish. But the ability to write life is not the entry card to fashion's top 10. That is reserved for the other school of writer, those who write about life. For some reason that mystifies me our culture continues to promote journalists, analysts and essayists above artists. For some reason we prefer to celebrate not the creators, but those who keep life at one remove. One of the greatest plays of the 1990s was a modest piece called Uganda by Judith Johnson, which played for three weeks at the Royal Court's Theatre Upstairs. One of the greatest of the 1980s was Singer by Peter Flannery. One of the pre-eminent postwar playwrights is David Storey. How often do these authors feature on top 10 lists? Too rarely, and mainly because they don't work for them. Profile, across a wider range than just playwriting, is often thought to be a result of talent. It is not. It is a matter of hard graft by those who want it. It is a matter of hanging about at press nights; joining boards and appearing on endless platforms, panels and television shows; writing books about your own genius and filling in as many \"My Book of the Year\" submissions as you can get your hands on. We all perceive the nakedness of the greed and desire in these self-promoters, but we all eventually give in, just out of exhaustion, as if to a persistent seducer, and wearily relent: \"Yes, all right, you are a great playwright/actress/film director. Now please, be quiet a moment. I'm trying to think.\" There are 112 essays on as many playwrights in my book, of which only nine are on balance negative. Those nine all figure in the ranks of those who write about life. It is unfortunate (in that it encourages snap judgments of the book) that they are also among the best known and the most ardent self-promoters. There is of course an honourable tradition of playwrights who write about life, who promote themselves, and draw the praise of today, if not tomorrow. The river that bears Euripides, Ben Jonson and Shaw is not a bad one to risk your brand-new canoe in, even if others risk the naked night swim in the rougher river that bore Sophocles and Shakespeare and Chekhov. Discursive, digressive, prismatic work has a place, of course. Life has another. But, no matter, negative thoughts aside, there were and are too many truly great new writers to list. The richness, the range, the fancy, the heart and the soul that have been on view have been breathtaking. If the energy has ebbed a little of late, no doubt it will return again soon. It has a newly politicised world to respond to now. And if the results build on the platform of what has been achieved already, we are in for treats. And, most importantly, for surprises. \u0095 The Full Room: An A-Z of Contemporary Playwriting by Dominic Dromgoole is published by Methuen at \u00a318.99.",

      "body": "<p>Florynce Kennedy - Flo to friend and enemy alike - who has died aged 84, was once called \"the biggest, loudest and, indisputably the rudest, mouth on the battleground where feminist- activists and radical politics join in mostly common cause\".</p> <p>Born in Kansas City, Missouri, she was the second of five daughters of Wiley and Zella Kennedy, who were part of the \"pooristocrats\" of the black community and taught their children to stand up for themselves. Flo finished top of her class at Lincoln high school in 1934, after which she ran a hat shop, performed on a radio show and operated a lift.</p> <p>After her mother died in 1942, she moved to New York to live with her sister, Grayce. She graduated from Columbia University in 1948, but was denied admission to the law school - a decision only reversed after she threatened legal action on grounds of racial discrimination. She was the only black person among just eight women in her class. After graduating in 1951, she established her own practice, eventually representing the estates of Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker, and the black power leader H Rap Brown.</p> <p>Though not a strong supporter of wedlock, she married Charles Dudley Dye in 1957; his alcoholism made it a short-lived union. She never remarried or had children.</p> <p>Kennedy's political involvement took shape as she began to entertain doubts about her profession, and whether justice was possible when courts themselves were bigoted: \"Not only was I not earning a decent living, there began to be a serious question in my mind whether practising law could ever be an effective means of changing society or even of simple resistance to oppression.\" In 1966, she founded the National Organization for Women (Now) and created the Media Workshop to fight media discrimination.</p> <p>The following year, she took to the stage at an anti-Vietnam war convention in Montreal to protest at the refusal to allow the black radical, Bobby Seale, to discuss racism. The action marked the beginning of a speaking career characterised by bluntly effective utterances, whose impact was the greater when combined with her unconventional dress style, which often featured cowboy hat and boots.</p> <p>Kennedy's mission was to tell it like it was, combined with advocacy of direct action. This unfailingly drew attention to her concerns, which, beyond sexism and racism, also included championing the civil liberties of homosexuals, prostitutes and other minorities.</p> <p>\"Don't agonise, organise,\" she proclaimed. \"Niggerisation is the result of oppression - and it doesn't just apply to the black people. Old people, poor people and students can also get niggerised . . . There are very few jobs that actually require a penis or a vagina. All other jobs should be open to everybody.\"</p> <p>In 1971, Kennedy formed the Feminist party, which lent support to Shirley Chisholm as a US presidential candidate, and, in 1975, founded the National Black Feminist Organisation. She was a member of the legal team instrumental in liberalising the New York state abortion laws, and co-authored one of the first books on the topic, Abortion Rap.</p> <p>As leader of the Consumer Coalition, she campaigned to influence the output of US television in favour of women, minorities and better programming: \"These people who programme television for the consumption of the world audience should look around the world and see what's wrong with it. If we are successful in our fight to alter the pattern of television here in America, I would hope that we would come to know as much about the African woman as we know about football, basketball and tennis.\"</p> <p>Kennedy was never afraid to tackle the biggest causes and, though increasing health problems left her bedridden by the late 1990s, her crusading spirit remained undampened. Her autobiography, Color Me Flo: My Hard Life And Good Times (1976), contains this unapologetic self-description: \"I'm just a loud-mouthed, middle-aged, colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestine missing, and a lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe you do too, but I never stop to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Florynce Rae Kennedy, lawyer and activist, born February 11 1916; died December 21 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Florynce Kennedy - Flo to friend and enemy alike - who has died aged 84, was once called \"the biggest, loudest and, indisputably the rudest, mouth on the battleground where feminist- activists and radical politics join in mostly common cause\". Born in Kansas City, Missouri, she was the second of five daughters of Wiley and Zella Kennedy, who were part of the \"pooristocrats\" of the black community and taught their children to stand up for themselves. Flo finished top of her class at Lincoln high school in 1934, after which she ran a hat shop, performed on a radio show and operated a lift. After her mother died in 1942, she moved to New York to live with her sister, Grayce. She graduated from Columbia University in 1948, but was denied admission to the law school - a decision only reversed after she threatened legal action on grounds of racial discrimination. She was the only black person among just eight women in her class. After graduating in 1951, she established her own practice, eventually representing the estates of Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker, and the black power leader H Rap Brown. Though not a strong supporter of wedlock, she married Charles Dudley Dye in 1957; his alcoholism made it a short-lived union. She never remarried or had children. Kennedy's political involvement took shape as she began to entertain doubts about her profession, and whether justice was possible when courts themselves were bigoted: \"Not only was I not earning a decent living, there began to be a serious question in my mind whether practising law could ever be an effective means of changing society or even of simple resistance to oppression.\" In 1966, she founded the National Organization for Women (Now) and created the Media Workshop to fight media discrimination. The following year, she took to the stage at an anti-Vietnam war convention in Montreal to protest at the refusal to allow the black radical, Bobby Seale, to discuss racism. The action marked the beginning of a speaking career characterised by bluntly effective utterances, whose impact was the greater when combined with her unconventional dress style, which often featured cowboy hat and boots. Kennedy's mission was to tell it like it was, combined with advocacy of direct action. This unfailingly drew attention to her concerns, which, beyond sexism and racism, also included championing the civil liberties of homosexuals, prostitutes and other minorities. \"Don't agonise, organise,\" she proclaimed. \"Niggerisation is the result of oppression - and it doesn't just apply to the black people. Old people, poor people and students can also get niggerised . . . There are very few jobs that actually require a penis or a vagina. All other jobs should be open to everybody.\" In 1971, Kennedy formed the Feminist party, which lent support to Shirley Chisholm as a US presidential candidate, and, in 1975, founded the National Black Feminist Organisation. She was a member of the legal team instrumental in liberalising the New York state abortion laws, and co-authored one of the first books on the topic, Abortion Rap. As leader of the Consumer Coalition, she campaigned to influence the output of US television in favour of women, minorities and better programming: \"These people who programme television for the consumption of the world audience should look around the world and see what's wrong with it. If we are successful in our fight to alter the pattern of television here in America, I would hope that we would come to know as much about the African woman as we know about football, basketball and tennis.\" Kennedy was never afraid to tackle the biggest causes and, though increasing health problems left her bedridden by the late 1990s, her crusading spirit remained undampened. Her autobiography, Color Me Flo: My Hard Life And Good Times (1976), contains this unapologetic self-description: \"I'm just a loud-mouthed, middle-aged, colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestine missing, and a lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe you do too, but I never stop to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me.\" \u0095 Florynce Rae Kennedy, lawyer and activist, born February 11 1916; died December 21 2000",

The report by the royal colleges of psychiatrists and physicians said that although there were complex legal and ethical issues concerning companies regularly drug-testing their staff, the technology did exist for such an idea to be a realistic proposition. \"It would provide a record of drug use over the previous three months and could, therefore, have a major impact on the prevalence of drug use in the future,\" the royal colleges' working party concluded in its report for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

The report also warned that the government's ambitious target to cut heroin and cocaine abuse among young people by 50% by 2008 was unlikely to be achieved without a much stronger ministerial commitment to invest in drug prevention programmes. The report echoed the findings of the Police Foundation report into the future of the drugs laws in concluding that cannabis was almost certainly less damaging to health than tobacco or alcohol, and backing the decriminalisation of it for medical purposes. The home secretary, Jack Straw, dismissed one of the Police Foundation's main recommendations - to reclassify cannabis so that those found guilty of possession were no longer sent to prison - within hours of the report's publication last March. Dame Ruth Runciman, one of its authors, said she was disappointed that 10 months later the government had yet to give its considered response to all its recommendations. \"Our proposals are firmly located in the common sense and undogmatic middle ground between unrealistic legislation on one side and an unwinnable war on drugs on the other.

      "body": "<p>In terms of public acclaim and record sales, the career of the bandleader Les Brown, who has died of lung cancer aged 88, took off in the 1940s, towards the end of the dance band era. As musical tastes changed, ballrooms with stages built to contain brass and reed sections would soon disappear, taking from such bands their most obvious source of regular income.</p> <p>Several, however, devised ways of carrying on far beyond what seemed their sell-by dates, and none more so than Brown: in 1996, the Guinness Book Of World Records credited him with having led the longest-lasting musical organisation in popular music history. During 50-plus years as a bandleader, he was, among much else, responsible for launching Doris Day on the road to stardom.</p> <p>Brown was born in Tower City, Pennsylvania. His father, a baker who was also a skilled musician, tried to interest all his sons in music. Les took to the soprano saxophone, and was playing in his father's band before he was 10. With his father's encouragement, he dropped out of school to study at the Ithaca Conservatory of Music, where he played in the orchestra and started a big band, for which he wrote the arrangements.</p> <p>In 1929, he went to the New York Military Academy on a scholarship before switching to Duke University, having been headhunted by their big band, the Duke Blue Devils. He soon became leader, and the band was considered good enough to record commercially.</p> <p>After Duke, Brown settled in New York, arranging for Isham Jones, among others. In 1938, he was invited by Eli Oberstein, of Victor Records, to take a band into a Broadway hotel, from which the music was relayed over national radio. A contract with Victor's subsidiary Bluebird label followed, a deal arranged by Louis Armstrong's agent, Joe Glaser.</p> <p>The band was clearly being groomed for stardom - Glaser recruited the top trumpeter Billy Butterfield, and the drummer Shelley Manne was briefly a member - but the catalyst was the teenage Doris Day, who joined in 1940. Her voice gave the band an audience rapport that continued when she temporarily left.</p> <p>Soon after, Brown had his first big record success, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, named for the baseball star's 1941 achievement of striking at least one base hit for an unprecedented 56 consecutive games. Brown's arranger, Ben Homan, who wrote the number with disc jockey Alan Courtney, later came up with Sentimental Journey, recorded in 1946. Brown himself contributed to the tune and, with Doris Day back to sing the words written by Bud Green, Sentimental Journey became a massive hit, not least with returning war veterans. It topped the hit parade and stayed in the charts for months.</p> <p>That success put the band, now known as Les Brown And The Band Of Renown, into the big time. However, Brown decided to break it up while he relocated to Los Angeles.</p> <p>The break proved shorter than expected: a booking had been arranged for the Hollywood Palladium in 1946 and, the following year, he and his new band were asked to back Bob Hope's radio show. The money involved was less than Brown could earn on tour, but he was tired of travelling and wanted to see more of his family. He made the right choice; the band business, as he had known it, soon collapsed.</p> <p>This association of Hope and Brown lasted to the end, taking in Hope's military tours from 1950; a television documentary was made of their 1966 Christmas show entertaining troops in Vietnam. The band had another hit in Skippy Martin's bouncy arrangement of I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm and, in 1949, Hope reunited Brown with Doris Day, by now a Hollywood star, for a national tour. Brown also backed Dean Martin and Steve Allen on TV shows, and performed annually at Disneyland from its 1955 opening, as well as benefiting from a renewed interest in ballroom dancing.</p> <p>With his son, Les Jr, occasionally filling in, Brown continued to lead in person until very recently. As president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, he engaged the support of Bing Crosby, Hope and Frank Sinatra in getting the Naras's Grammy Awards televised.</p> <p>Brown's appeal ranged from swinging jazz, performed somewhat in the manner of Woody Herman, to ballads, novelties and comedy items involving Butch Stone or the leader's brother Stubby Brown. Among the better-known jazz musicians involved at times were Ted Nash and Dave Pell on saxophones, trombonist Ray Sims, clarinettist Abe Most and drummer Jack Sperling. Singers after Doris Day included Lucy Ann Polk and Jo Ann Greer.</p> <p>Brown is survived by his wife Evelyn and his son and daughter.</p> <p>\u0095 Les Brown, musician and bandleader, born March 14 1912; died January 4 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "In terms of public acclaim and record sales, the career of the bandleader Les Brown, who has died of lung cancer aged 88, took off in the 1940s, towards the end of the dance band era. As musical tastes changed, ballrooms with stages built to contain brass and reed sections would soon disappear, taking from such bands their most obvious source of regular income. Several, however, devised ways of carrying on far beyond what seemed their sell-by dates, and none more so than Brown: in 1996, the Guinness Book Of World Records credited him with having led the longest-lasting musical organisation in popular music history. During 50-plus years as a bandleader, he was, among much else, responsible for launching Doris Day on the road to stardom. Brown was born in Tower City, Pennsylvania. His father, a baker who was also a skilled musician, tried to interest all his sons in music. Les took to the soprano saxophone, and was playing in his father's band before he was 10. With his father's encouragement, he dropped out of school to study at the Ithaca Conservatory of Music, where he played in the orchestra and started a big band, for which he wrote the arrangements. In 1929, he went to the New York Military Academy on a scholarship before switching to Duke University, having been headhunted by their big band, the Duke Blue Devils. He soon became leader, and the band was considered good enough to record commercially. After Duke, Brown settled in New York, arranging for Isham Jones, among others. In 1938, he was invited by Eli Oberstein, of Victor Records, to take a band into a Broadway hotel, from which the music was relayed over national radio. A contract with Victor's subsidiary Bluebird label followed, a deal arranged by Louis Armstrong's agent, Joe Glaser. The band was clearly being groomed for stardom - Glaser recruited the top trumpeter Billy Butterfield, and the drummer Shelley Manne was briefly a member - but the catalyst was the teenage Doris Day, who joined in 1940. Her voice gave the band an audience rapport that continued when she temporarily left. Soon after, Brown had his first big record success, Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, named for the baseball star's 1941 achievement of striking at least one base hit for an unprecedented 56 consecutive games. Brown's arranger, Ben Homan, who wrote the number with disc jockey Alan Courtney, later came up with Sentimental Journey, recorded in 1946. Brown himself contributed to the tune and, with Doris Day back to sing the words written by Bud Green, Sentimental Journey became a massive hit, not least with returning war veterans. It topped the hit parade and stayed in the charts for months. That success put the band, now known as Les Brown And The Band Of Renown, into the big time. However, Brown decided to break it up while he relocated to Los Angeles. The break proved shorter than expected: a booking had been arranged for the Hollywood Palladium in 1946 and, the following year, he and his new band were asked to back Bob Hope's radio show. The money involved was less than Brown could earn on tour, but he was tired of travelling and wanted to see more of his family. He made the right choice; the band business, as he had known it, soon collapsed. This association of Hope and Brown lasted to the end, taking in Hope's military tours from 1950; a television documentary was made of their 1966 Christmas show entertaining troops in Vietnam. The band had another hit in Skippy Martin's bouncy arrangement of I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm and, in 1949, Hope reunited Brown with Doris Day, by now a Hollywood star, for a national tour. Brown also backed Dean Martin and Steve Allen on TV shows, and performed annually at Disneyland from its 1955 opening, as well as benefiting from a renewed interest in ballroom dancing. With his son, Les Jr, occasionally filling in, Brown continued to lead in person until very recently. As president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, he engaged the support of Bing Crosby, Hope and Frank Sinatra in getting the Naras's Grammy Awards televised. Brown's appeal ranged from swinging jazz, performed somewhat in the manner of Woody Herman, to ballads, novelties and comedy items involving Butch Stone or the leader's brother Stubby Brown. Among the better-known jazz musicians involved at times were Ted Nash and Dave Pell on saxophones, trombonist Ray Sims, clarinettist Abe Most and drummer Jack Sperling. Singers after Doris Day included Lucy Ann Polk and Jo Ann Greer. Brown is survived by his wife Evelyn and his son and daughter. \u0095 Les Brown, musician and bandleader, born March 14 1912; died January 4 2001",

      "bodyText": "The Post Office last week suffered its worst delays as a result of rail repairs and floods. Neville Bain, Post Office chairman, said Willesden, its main rail distribution centre, was out of operation for days and even now was only partly functional. As a result, next-day delivery of first class mail had fallen from 91% last year to about 85% now. About a quarter of all mail is usually transported by train. Railtrack initially initially informed the Post Office, the railways' biggest customer, that it would have no access to the Willesden depot between Christmas and the new year. This was changed to 70% access after the Post Office protested. But this plan failed and there was no access on a number of days. The repair work is still going on and some mail trains are being delayed by up to six hours, resulting in first class delivery times being missed. The Post Office is entitled to compensation from English Welsh and Scottish Railways - one of the two rail freight companies - under a performance-related contract. But it also wants payment for the \u00a3500,000 a week cost of additional road and air services and for loss of business and damage to its reputation.",

      "bodyText": "Multi-national companies, including BP and Unilever, yesterday admitted paying small bribes known as \"facilitating payments\" and \"petty dispersals\" to get results in developing countries, but denied it was the slippery slope to full-scale corruption. In evidence to a Commons committee investigating overseas corruption, executives for six leading firms suggested that such payments were \"tolerated, not encouraged\", and were made in line with local practice to get a phone line or similar service installed. Reg Hinkley, group vice president and general auditor of oil company BP Amoco, told the international development select committee that managers often had to make judgments in difficult situations. Such payments may be made sometimes to prevent delays, rather than to gain an unfair advantage over competitors. \"I don't think it's the beginning of a slippery slope - it's not something that we like,\" Mr Hinkley said. Under international law, small payments to officials are not always illegal, although companies should clearly label them in their accounts. The committee, chaired by Tory MP, Bowen Wells, has had difficulty persuading private sector firms to give evidence in public. \"They think the mud will stick to them,\" one frustrated MP said last night. Unilever, the food conglomerate, admitted to the committee yesterday that modest facilitating payments were \"tolerated, not encouraged\" as long as they met specified conditions. The payment must be small, must facilitate something that would happen anyway, is in line with local practice, transparent and in public. Balfour Beatty, which is behind the controversial Ilisu dam project in Turkey, also gave evidence, as did the crown agents whose director, Ian White, admitted he was \"a little shocked\" to hear that BP and Unilever sanctioned payments. His colleague, David Phillips, said companies sometimes included these payments in their accounts under \"petty dispersals\" in the \"customs clearance\" section. Crown agents said its policy was to advise clients to blow the whistle on officials demanding such payments. The MPs, who have been encouraged in their campaign by the international development secretary, Clare Short, believe that corruption inhibits development. The committee hopes to get witnesses from Nigeria to give evidence about the way western firms helped lure the oil-rich state into its current near-bankruptcy, the fault of endemic corruption.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>January in Detroit is nobody's idea of fun, even in the week of the Motor City's normally glitzy annual auto show. There is an unmistakable economic chill in the air. The car industry is sliding inexorably towards a serious slowdown and today even the Tamla Motown museum, where the Supremes recorded \"Where Did Our Love Go?\", is temporarily closed.</p> <p>In the centre of Dearborn, the suburb from which Henry Ford revolutionised the 20th-century world and made Detroit into a byword for industrial modernity, the signs of hard times are easy to spot. Store fronts on Michigan Avenue are boarded up. The only places that look as if they are doing good business are pawnshops and pornshops. The place is scattered with signs saying \"Checks cashed\" and \"Payday advances\".</p> <p>\"Things are slowing down, it's all around us right now,\" says Calvin Willis, as he ducks into the fierce wind outside the Henry Ford Memorial Library. \"We've had it good here for too long. It's hard for some folks to remember that it was going to change some time.\"</p> <p>At the Montgomery Ward store in Dearborn town centre the signs in the windows say it all: \"Going out of business\". The closure of the famous retail chain on December 29 marked the end of an era almost as iconic as the one started by Henry Ford himself. For 128 years, Montgomery Ward's 250 stores - seven in the Detroit area - have been part of America.</p> <p>This was the company which many credit with the invention of mail-order shopping, the pre-internet retail lifeline for rural America. It came up with a slogan that entered the culture: \"Satisfaction guaranteed.\" And it claims to have invented Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. But Christmas was the end of the dream.</p> <p>\"The structure of retail changed faster than Montgomery Ward could keep up,\" says Pat Anderson, a local business watcher. \"Nimbler, lower-cost companies moved in, like Wal-Mart and Target.\"</p> <p>This is one of the many parts of America that the 10-year economic boom never reached. The people who live here are on low wages, they struggle for a living, and they don't have anything in the way of the computers and hi-tech gizmos that have fuelled the good times elsewhere. They are the underside of the America of staggering corporate success, in which economic inequality is rising faster than at any time since the pre-Crash 1920s.</p> <p>But Detroit is still above all the Motor City. The indexes which matter here are those of motor vehicle production and sales. This is the city of Fords, centred in Dearborn, and of troubled Chrysler, a few miles north in Auburn Hills, and of General Motors, whose main production plants are an hour to the north in what is still the classic one-industry town of Flint.</p> <p>And those indexes are looking bad. American car sales fell by 8% in December 2000, the second consecutive month of decline. The big three are suddenly scared, dampening down production in line with reduced demand, putting some plants on short time and warning of closures if things get worse, which most industry analysts expect that they will.</p> <p>\"The edge is clearly off the industry, and the industry is slipping beyond what many of us expected,\" says Paul Ballew of General Motors.</p> <p>\"The economy has definitely transitioned. We know it. Intel knows it and Banana Republic [a clothing company] knows it,\" says Ford spokesman George Pipas.</p> <p>The big question for the car industry - and by extension for American business as a whole - is whether this is a slowdown or a slide. Panic selling in the stock market, beamed into offices around the country on cable television channels, can create an exaggerated effect. In Detroit, where they are well-versed in the business cycle, the mood is less hysterical than it sometimes appears to be in New York.</p> <p>Economists at the big car companies say that sales will be well down in 2001 compared with the past two years.

      "bodyText": "January in Detroit is nobody's idea of fun, even in the week of the Motor City's normally glitzy annual auto show. There is an unmistakable economic chill in the air. The car industry is sliding inexorably towards a serious slowdown and today even the Tamla Motown museum, where the Supremes recorded \"Where Did Our Love Go?\", is temporarily closed. In the centre of Dearborn, the suburb from which Henry Ford revolutionised the 20th-century world and made Detroit into a byword for industrial modernity, the signs of hard times are easy to spot. Store fronts on Michigan Avenue are boarded up. The only places that look as if they are doing good business are pawnshops and pornshops. The place is scattered with signs saying \"Checks cashed\" and \"Payday advances\". \"Things are slowing down, it's all around us right now,\" says Calvin Willis, as he ducks into the fierce wind outside the Henry Ford Memorial Library. \"We've had it good here for too long. It's hard for some folks to remember that it was going to change some time.\" At the Montgomery Ward store in Dearborn town centre the signs in the windows say it all: \"Going out of business\". The closure of the famous retail chain on December 29 marked the end of an era almost as iconic as the one started by Henry Ford himself. For 128 years, Montgomery Ward's 250 stores - seven in the Detroit area - have been part of America. This was the company which many credit with the invention of mail-order shopping, the pre-internet retail lifeline for rural America. It came up with a slogan that entered the culture: \"Satisfaction guaranteed.\" And it claims to have invented Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. But Christmas was the end of the dream. \"The structure of retail changed faster than Montgomery Ward could keep up,\" says Pat Anderson, a local business watcher. \"Nimbler, lower-cost companies moved in, like Wal-Mart and Target.\" This is one of the many parts of America that the 10-year economic boom never reached. The people who live here are on low wages, they struggle for a living, and they don't have anything in the way of the computers and hi-tech gizmos that have fuelled the good times elsewhere. They are the underside of the America of staggering corporate success, in which economic inequality is rising faster than at any time since the pre-Crash 1920s. But Detroit is still above all the Motor City. The indexes which matter here are those of motor vehicle production and sales. This is the city of Fords, centred in Dearborn, and of troubled Chrysler, a few miles north in Auburn Hills, and of General Motors, whose main production plants are an hour to the north in what is still the classic one-industry town of Flint. And those indexes are looking bad. American car sales fell by 8% in December 2000, the second consecutive month of decline. The big three are suddenly scared, dampening down production in line with reduced demand, putting some plants on short time and warning of closures if things get worse, which most industry analysts expect that they will. \"The edge is clearly off the industry, and the industry is slipping beyond what many of us expected,\" says Paul Ballew of General Motors. \"The economy has definitely transitioned. We know it. Intel knows it and Banana Republic [a clothing company] knows it,\" says Ford spokesman George Pipas. The big question for the car industry - and by extension for American business as a whole - is whether this is a slowdown or a slide. Panic selling in the stock market, beamed into offices around the country on cable television channels, can create an exaggerated effect. In Detroit, where they are well-versed in the business cycle, the mood is less hysterical than it sometimes appears to be in New York. Economists at the big car companies say that sales will be well down in 2001 compared with the past two years. General Motors said yesterday that it expects a 10% drop, the worst fall for 10 years. But the gloom has to be seen in perspective. All the industry economists point to the spectacular success of the motor vehicle market over most of the past decade, and believe that a bad 2001 is still likely to be a good year in overall terms. \"Given the state of auto sales in December it's hard not to think we're heading into a recession,\" says Van Bussman, an economist at the DaimlerChrysler company. \"But there's enough strength in the economy to keep us going. By the end of the year, we'll be back on track.\" As the motor industry gathers in downtown Detroit this week for the Auto Show, there is no denying the general sense of anxiety. \"Under Siege\" ran the headline in the show supplement in the Detroit News this weekend. But even if the mega-good times are over, it takes more than a downturn to dampen the American capacity for optimism. Last week, Detroit's mayor, Dennis Archer, opened a copper \"time capsule\" which had been sealed at the end of the 19th century by one of his predecessors, William Maybury. The box contained a letter referring to the great advances which allowed telephone calls to be made across the country and travellers to reach Chicago by train in eight hours. \"How much faster are you travelling? How much farther have you annihilated time and space and what agencies are you employing to which we are strangers?\" Mayor Maybury wrote to Mayor Archer. \"Just think of it. Mayor of Detroit and he'd never heard of Henry Ford,\" Mr Archer's spokesman commented on a local radio show. \"I think the lesson for us is to always expect the unexpected.\"",

      "bodyText": "Families of hundreds of possible victims of the serial murderer Harold Shipman could now seek inquests after a coroner recorded yesterday that one of his patients who had been cremated had been unlawfully killed. Dr Shipman, whose surgery was in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was convicted of murdering 15 patients a year ago. Since then the south Manchester coroner, John Pollard, has recorded that three other patients whose bodies were buried had been unlawfully killed. But yesterday's inquest on 81-year-old Hilda Hibbert was the first of a series of 24 on possible victims who were all cremated. The verdict is bound to give comfort to other families who know Shipman will never return to court to face more murder charges. Many had feared that, without postmortem evidence, the coroner would have been obliged to record an open verdict. Yesterday's hearing followed a Department of Health report which suggested that Shipman, now serving life in Frankland prison, Durham, could have killed up to 300 people. Relatives who packed the hearing at Ashton-under-Lyne gasped with relief as Mr Pollard announced his conclusion on Mrs Hibbert, who was found dead at home in Hyde on January 2 1996. She was found sitting upright in her favourite armchair shortly after a visit from Shipman. \"I have to say, yes, there is some doubt as to whether Mrs Hibbert was unlawfully killed,\" said Mr Pollard. \"But I could no way describe that doubt as reasonable doubt, bearing in mind all the circumstances. It beggars belief to reach any conclusion in this case other than to say she was unlawfully killed.\" Mr Pollard was not permitted by law to name anyone who might have been responsible for Mrs Hibbert's death but her family said they were pleased with the verdict. \"We were hoping for this outcome but didn't expect it,\" said her daughter-in-law Janice Hibbert. Jane Ashton-Hibbert, Mrs Hibbert's granddaughter and leader of a support group for the families of suspected victims, said: \"I know all the other inquests have to be dealt with on an individual basis but I would like to think this verdict has given the other families some hope.\" During the hearing, Mr Pollard was told that Shipman had recorded that Mrs Hibbert had suffered a stroke two days before her death. But Ms Ashton-Hibbert said she had not noticed any signs of a stroke as the family celebrated Christmas.

He has also said he would rather do so by \"forging alliances\" rather than buying a company outright. </p> <p>It is far from clear that a deal is close to being reached and there is nothing to prevent L&amp;G reaching agreements with other leading financial institutions to sell the stakeholder pensions which the government wants the financial community to start selling from April. </p> <p>L&amp;G is regarded as having a head start in this area, and the ability to sell products through Barclays branches would solve the problem it faced after NatWest's takeover attempt failed. </p> <p>Other blue-chip shares, meanwhile, had another rough session yesterday, undermined once more by a poor performance from <strong> Vodafone</strong>. </p> <p>Shares in the market heavyweight, which declined 14.5p on Monday, fell 7.75p to 220p - a 20-month closing low - after Nokia, the world's biggest mobile phone maker, reported lower than expected handset sales for the year 2000. </p> <p>This news, combined with sharp declines for <strong> BP</strong>, off 17 to 526.5p and <strong> Shell</strong>, down 13p to 539p, and a succession of programme trades weighted to the sell side, pulled the FTSE 100 index down 61.5 points to 6,088.1. </p> <p>Elsewhere, things were a lit ter better.

      "bodyText": "The City hates unfinished business and if there is one loose end it would like to see tied up this year it is the future of life assurer Legal &amp; General, down 4p to 180p. Since NatWest failed to buy the company for \u00a310bn last year, the Square Mile has been convinced that its days as a independent company are numbered. With monotonous regularity tales of an \"imminent\" offer for L&amp;G sweep the market, the latest being a 230p-a-share offer from Barclays, off 15p to \u00a321.85. According to well informed market sources, the two sides are indeed talking, but only about a deal that will allow L&amp;G to sell its products through Barclays' branch network. Neither institution would comment last night but it is understood that the negotiations are taking place ahead of planned changes to the \"polarisation\" rules which are used to tie financial institutions into selling only their own products. Matt Barrett, the charismatic Barclays boss, has acknowledged in the past that his bank needs to beef up its presence in the life market. He has also said he would rather do so by \"forging alliances\" rather than buying a company outright. It is far from clear that a deal is close to being reached and there is nothing to prevent L&amp;G reaching agreements with other leading financial institutions to sell the stakeholder pensions which the government wants the financial community to start selling from April. L&amp;G is regarded as having a head start in this area, and the ability to sell products through Barclays branches would solve the problem it faced after NatWest's takeover attempt failed. Other blue-chip shares, meanwhile, had another rough session yesterday, undermined once more by a poor performance from Vodafone. Shares in the market heavyweight, which declined 14.5p on Monday, fell 7.75p to 220p - a 20-month closing low - after Nokia, the world's biggest mobile phone maker, reported lower than expected handset sales for the year 2000. This news, combined with sharp declines for BP, off 17 to 526.5p and Shell, down 13p to 539p, and a succession of programme trades weighted to the sell side, pulled the FTSE 100 index down 61.5 points to 6,088.1. Elsewhere, things were a lit ter better. The FTSE Techmark 100 index eased just 4.95 points to 2,433.34, helped by sharp gains for the likes of Scoot.com, up 10.25p to 74.25p, and Thus, 5.5p higher at 60.5p, both on the back of renewed bid speculation. In spite of the gloomy news from Nokia, not all telecom stocks were heading south. BT moved up 9.5p to 642p with dealers reporting buying from institutional investors impressed by the early efforts of new finance director Philip Hampton to cut group debt. Energis and Colt Telecom both moved higher, advancing 20p to 485p and 65p to \u00a316.75 respectively. Other climbers included advertising outfit WPP, up 19.5p to 872p, with dealers citing positive feedback from a media conference hosted by Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in the US. It was being reported that WPP's finance director, Paul Richardson, told the conference the company remained committed to organic revenue growth of 8% and was targeting a one-point improvement in operating margins this year.

      "body": "<p>Interbrew's Stella Artois lager is supposed to be \"reassuringly expensive\". Chief executive Hugo Powell has certainly proved to be so. The Indian-born Englishman who runs the Belgian company was nowhere to be seen since trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers called time on his attempt to snatch a third of Britain's brewing industry last week. </p> <p>He was last heard of in Florida, but when he resurfaces he needs to do some fast talking. Throughout last year, Mr Powell was beaming with confidence. He was sure Mr Byers would smile on his \u00a32.3bn purchase of Bass Brewers and of the success of the subsequent flotation of the Interbrew business, when investors were persuaded to part with \u00a31.8bn. </p> <p>His advisers point out that the float prospectus warned there was a risk of regulatory intervention. But investors will be interested to hear that there was no space in the document for the cautionary views of Lehman Brothers, which was closer to the Bass deal than anyone. The highly paid investment bank was so concerned it advised Mr Powell to postpone the float. But he pressed on. </p> <p>His reckless gambles have savaged the Interbrew share price and most observers agree the fiasco will cost the company a cool \u00a3800m as it is forced to unload Bass Brewing at a huge loss. </p> <p>Few chief executives could get away with such a glaring misjudgment. Mr Powell is lucky that his future is in the hands of the handful of Belgian families which still hold a majority of Interbrew's shares. Having sold stock, they gained from the company's flotation. If Mr Powell was answerable to the usual crowd of institutional fund managers, he would be spending more time en famille by now. </p> <p><strong>Service charge </strong><br> </p> <p>Europe's single market does not work very well. Who says? The European commission, that's who. </p> <p>True, reforms have brought European consumers cheaper electricity and telephone calls. Price differentials on a range of goods have shrunk. But the concept of free movement of services, one of the main aims of the single market, still has a long way to go, according to the latest evidence. A commission report yesterday said half the service sector companies in the EU earn less than 10% of their revenues in other EU countries. It believes barriers to competition in the postal, energy, transport and communications sectors need to be removed without delay.

      "bodyText": "Interbrew's Stella Artois lager is supposed to be \"reassuringly expensive\". Chief executive Hugo Powell has certainly proved to be so. The Indian-born Englishman who runs the Belgian company was nowhere to be seen since trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers called time on his attempt to snatch a third of Britain's brewing industry last week. He was last heard of in Florida, but when he resurfaces he needs to do some fast talking. Throughout last year, Mr Powell was beaming with confidence. He was sure Mr Byers would smile on his \u00a32.3bn purchase of Bass Brewers and of the success of the subsequent flotation of the Interbrew business, when investors were persuaded to part with \u00a31.8bn. His advisers point out that the float prospectus warned there was a risk of regulatory intervention. But investors will be interested to hear that there was no space in the document for the cautionary views of Lehman Brothers, which was closer to the Bass deal than anyone. The highly paid investment bank was so concerned it advised Mr Powell to postpone the float. But he pressed on. His reckless gambles have savaged the Interbrew share price and most observers agree the fiasco will cost the company a cool \u00a3800m as it is forced to unload Bass Brewing at a huge loss. Few chief executives could get away with such a glaring misjudgment. Mr Powell is lucky that his future is in the hands of the handful of Belgian families which still hold a majority of Interbrew's shares. Having sold stock, they gained from the company's flotation. If Mr Powell was answerable to the usual crowd of institutional fund managers, he would be spending more time en famille by now. Service charge Europe's single market does not work very well. Who says? The European commission, that's who. True, reforms have brought European consumers cheaper electricity and telephone calls. Price differentials on a range of goods have shrunk. But the concept of free movement of services, one of the main aims of the single market, still has a long way to go, according to the latest evidence. A commission report yesterday said half the service sector companies in the EU earn less than 10% of their revenues in other EU countries. It believes barriers to competition in the postal, energy, transport and communications sectors need to be removed without delay. A strategy is promised later this week. To an extent the commission has its own agenda. The more it can dismantle national structures and replace them with pan-European rules and regulations, the greater its own authority. But the commission has persuasive arguments on its side. It reckons that if the EU's service industries employed as many people as those in the US - not too extravagant a comparison, given the similar size of the two economies - that would create an additional 36m jobs, double the number of people out of work in the single market area. Sweden, which holds the EU presidency, has put employment high on its agenda. Yesterday's report provides a more than useful starting point. Post modern What nonsense some chief executives spout. Take yesterday's offering from John Roberts, the country's head postie. Announcing the decision to rebrand the Post Office as Consignia, Mr Roberts explained that it was a \"modern and meaningful\" new moniker and that \"the new name describes the full scope of what the Post Office does in a way that the words 'post' and 'office' cannot\". Frankly, it really describes the full scope of what a specialist brand consultancy can achieve. The words \"money\" and \"old rope\" spring to mind. Consignia is not meaningful.

      "bodyText": "France's widening arms-dealing scandal threatened to embroil more high-ranking figures yesterday as the head of an arms export agency run by the interior ministry claimed his company had for years served as a cover for trafficking. Henri Hurand, managing director of Sofremi, the export company controlled by the interior ministry, alleged that the accused arms dealer Pierre Falcone was Sofremi's sole intermediary for foreign arms sales and that he had \"showered everyone with bribes for years\". Mr Hurand made no specific accusations against past interior ministers responsible for Sofremi, but he alleged that at least two - the centre-rightist Charles Pasqua and the Socialist Pierre Joxe - had \"followed the company's operations extremely closely\". Mr Falcone and his company, Brenco International, are at the centre of a huge money-laundering and arms-trafficking scandal involving the illicit sale to Angola of some \u00a3350m-worth of Russian-made helicopters, tanks, weapons and other military equipment in 1993 and 1994. Besides Mr Falcone, those in jail on suspicion of involvement in the deals are Bernard Poussier, Mr Hurand's predecessor at Sofremi, and Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, the son of the former French president Fran\u00e7ois. Mr Mitterrand, who was for several years his father's chief adviser on African affairs, has admitted receiving some \u00a31.3m from Brenco in the late 1990s, but denied that the money was related to arms deals. He last night reluctantly paid his Fr5m (\u00a3480,000) bail. Investigators believe that the privileged relations between the late president's elder son and a number of African leaders may have helped Mr Falcone - who was on Sofremi's books as an \"adviser\" - to win the two Angolan contracts and possibly several others. Mr Hurand, who has radically overhauled Sofremi and severed its relations with Mr Falcone since his appointment in 1997, said the accused arms dealer was \"omnipresent\" in the company's activities from 1992 onwards. \"As a general rule, a private intermediary was called on for every deal,\" he said in an interview with Le Figaro. \"In fact, from 1992, Falcone was Sofremi's sole and unique intermediary. \"It was completely abnormal. He received exorbitant commissions on every sale.\" Mr Hurand said Sofremi, which was set up by the French government to oversee the export of security-related technology and services, mainly to developing countries, was \"quite plainly used by Mr Falcone as a cover for his personal activities\". \"...this could not have been done without the approval of the company's bosses\", he said, adding \"[it was] evident, too, that the managing directors of Sofremi have always had to report to the interior minister\". The name of Mr Pasqua, interior minister from 1986 to 1988 and from 1993 to 1995, had already been linked to the scandal. The investigating magistrate, Phillippe Courroye, has searched Mr Pasqua's home and offices, and last week ordered the seizure of the 1999 European election campaign accounts of his party, Rally for France (RPF).

      "bodyText": "Lithuanian officials confirmed yesterday that they plan to seek the extradition of a suspected Nazi war criminal who has been living in Britain since 1947. Anton Gecas, 85, who runs a guest house in Edinburgh, is alleged to have taken part in the mass murder of Jews by Nazi death squads in Lithuania in 1941. Eight years ago Mr Gecas was branded a war criminal by a Scottish judge after he lost a libel case against Scottish Television over a documentary that alleged he led atrocities against Jews in his native country and Belarus as the head of a special police battalion during the second world war. At the time, the judge, Lord Milligan, at the court of session in Edinburgh, said he was \"clearly satisfied\" Mr Gecas had \"committed war crimes against innocent civilians\". The claims were investigated by Scottish prosecution authorities, but no action was taken against Mr Gecas, who denied involvement in the massacres. Yesterday, the Lithuanian prosecutor general's office said it planned to approach the Home Office to ask for Mr Gecas's extradition, although no date had been set. \"The plans are for the nearest future,\" said Rimvydas Valentukevicius, head of the department of special investigations. The crown office, the Scottish prosecution service, said it had yet to receive a formal request for extradition, while the Home Office said it could not confirm or deny the details of any request received from other states. But the moves by Lithuania were welcomed by Lord Janner, secretary of the parliamentary all-party war crimes group. He said he would be surprised if Mr Gecas was not extradited. \"What's happened now is that the Lithuanians have said we have got new evidence,\" he said. \"Our legal authorities will look at that evidence and will consider whether or not to accept the request. I would be surprised if they don't, if there is sufficient evidence.\" A crown office spokeswoman said allegations made against Mr Gecas in the early 1990s had been investigated. \"At the close of those inquiries a decision was taken that proceedings could not be taken on the evidence available at that time,\" she said. \"The case does remain open.\" At the family home in Edinburgh, Mr Gecas's wife Astrid would not comment. But in an interview last month, Mr Gecas said the trauma of being deported would probably kill him. He said he was in poor health and wanted to spend his final days with his children and 18-month-old grandson. He said he had fought with the Nazis to protect his homeland and joined the allies after the Germans betrayed Lithuania. \"It makes me very cross that I am being accused of murdering these people after all these years,\" he said. \"I was an officer in the Lithuanian auxiliary police battalion with the Germans in Lithuania but never did these terrible things. We just wanted our independence from both the Germans and the Russians.\" After the war, Mr Gecas settled in the UK and worked with the national coal board as a mining engineer. He became a British citizen in the 1950s. In 1992, he launched Scotland's biggest defamation trial after an STV documentary accused him of killing innocent civilians when he was a platoon commander of the 12th auxiliary police battalion in Lithuania and then Belarus. Yesterday, Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, said: \"I have been working on this case for 14 years and I cannot think of a happier event than to go to Vilnius (the Lithuanian capital) and see Gecas in a courtroom.\"",

Transport aid for disabled Families of severely disabled children are to be helped to buy specially adapted cars, the social security minister, Hugh Bayley, told the Commons yesterday. The lower age limit for eligibility for mobility payments is being reduced from five to three. Pay boost for pathology staff Pathology workers are to get pay rises of up to 13% in an attempt to cure staff shortages that have been blamed for delays in processing hospital test results. It is part of an offer covering 400,000 NHS staff outside the pay review bodies that will trigger inflation-busting awards across the service.",

OECD tax plan under fire Offshore financial centres in the Caribbean and Pacific yesterday branded crackdown by industrialised nations on tax evasion as an assault on their livelihoods. Meeting representatives of the OECD in Barbados, the offshore centres complained that wealthy nations were trampling on their sovereignty by threatening sanctions against them without proper consultation. The two sides agreed on the need for transparency in tax regimes and effective exchange of information but clashed about the way forward. MG Rover deal to replace BMW MG Rover is near to completing a deal which will enable its 300 strong dealer network to replace BMW as the main source of funding for new and used cars.

An investigation was launched after a man whose 40sq ft mugshot was beamed on to the side of the force's headquarters was found dead on a Birmingham river bank. He was the second man from the rogues' gallery to die in two months since their pictures were put on the internet and displayed in public places, including bus stops, billboards and near a motorway exit. Detectives had been hunting Damian Vernon, 23, since he jumped bail last year while facing five criminal charges. On Monday afternoon his body was found beneath the M6 next to the river Tame in the Bromford area of Birmingham. An autopsy proved inconclusive and more tests are being carried out on the body, which police said showed evidence of minor injuries. The matter has been referred to the police complaints authority. Less than two months ago Glen Foster, a street robber, whose picture also featured in the rogues' gallery, was found stabbed to death in London. At the launch of Operation Safer Streets, fears were voiced that the campaign could spark vigilante attacks, or lead to cases being thrown out by judges because trials might be prejudiced by the publicity. The police have vowed to carry on with the project and dismissed local suggestions that vigilantes might be targeting those on the wanted list. Vernon was one of three suspected street robbers whose photos were projected on to the side of Birmingham police headquarters. Police described the images as the city's \"alternative Christmas lights\". Vernon's family has made an official complaint to the police complaints authority about his appearance on the wanted list. Yesterday police said they had been making inquiries about Vernon in Bromford the previous day. Because of the the force's involvement in the case, they were voluntarily referring the matter to the complaints authority. A spokesman, Jon Clarke, said: \"An outside force will be asked to examine the circumstances of Mr Vernon's death.\" He added: \"This is not currently being treated as a murder inquiry.\" Vernon was due to appear before magistrates more than eight months ago to face three counts of robbery and two of theft of a motor vehicle. The police spokesman said: \"Our decision to publicise the names and faces of wanted criminals is not affected. We remain of the view that this is a logical and appropriate tactic.\" But Malcolm Fowler of Birmingham's Law Society warned that lawyers defending clients would seek to get cases thrown out.

There is no punishment that can resolve their grief because it cannot bring back the dead. But a life sentence served in prison is an exception in our criminal justice system. Those who have killed and been punished are released and live among us. Two young men, when boys, committed the terrible crime of the murder of James Bulger. In order to be considered for parole they will have to have demonstrated that they feel remorse, and as lifers they will be under supervision for the rest of their lives. The energy that would go into hounding Thompson and Venables could be better employed while, we can only hope, they do their best to justify their second chance. Anne Day Woodbridge, Suffolk \u0095 Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss was right in her ruling in the Bulger case, and right for more reasons than anyone has yet outlined. The original purpose of the criminal law, as the earliest surviving English laws illustrate, was to prevent vendettas by putting a stop to private vengeance. It is essential to keeping the peace that the state should defend its monopoly on the use of force. Any threat to that monopoly has potentially anarchist implications. It is the state's duty to prevent private vengeance by all means in its power.

      "bodyText": "A prosecutor told a jury yesterday that it would feel \"utter respect and admiration for the strength and integrity\" of the beliefs of two defendants accused of conspiring to damage a nuclear submarine. There was \"no doubt\" that Sylvia Boyes, 57, from Keighley in West Yorkshire, and River (formerly Keith Harold Wright), 45, an Open University tutor from Manchester, \"hold very strong opinions as to the evils of nuclear weapons\", Elizabeth Nicholls told Manchester crown court. They were found, dressed in wetsuits and carrying an axe, hammer and other tools, near HMS Vengeance in Barrow-in-Furness docks on November 23 1999, she added. As members of the direct action group Trident Ploughshares, they planned to damage the Trident submarine at the Cumbrian shipyard, one of four submarines that carry Britain's nuclear deterrent. Ms Nicholls added: \"Both accepted that they had entered the docks with the intention of damaging the submarine.\" Boyes was found first, the court heard. She had a hammer and screwdriver attached to her wetsuit belt, bearing anti-nuclear slogans. River was then found in the water, equipped with hammers, a small axe and wire cutters. He also had six cans of aerosol varnish. Ms Nicholls said the pair believed they were acting lawfully because they believed that being in possession of a nuclear submarine was a crime. She added that the two had read out prepared statements to the police, declaring their intention to \"dismantle\" the submarine. Documents found in their possession, she said, included a pamphlet with instructions on how to dismantle a nuclear submarine safely, a CND newsletter, and signed statements of intent to \"enter any Trident nuclear facility\". River was carrying a document which said, \"Now the time has come to take action myself to do whatever I can\", the jury was told. A security guard, Hugh Crawford, told the court that Boyes told him she \"intended to commit criminal damage\". She called the submarine - which was at the shipyard for a refit - \"a weapon of mass destruction\". Terry Munyard, defending Boyes, told the jury that although the submarine had no warheads on board, it was still \"a floating nuclear reactor\". The submarine was \"very close\" to residential areas of Barrow-in-Furness. Both defendants deny the charge of conspiracy to commit criminal damage. The trial continues.",

      "body": "<p>\"And the two words for this evening are?\" Sue Lancaster shouts into the jumble of laughing, lolling teenagers. It's a break from rehearsals for a new musical to be performed in a worryingly short time. \"Energy and volume\" they shout back. \"No!\" she roars, laughing herself now. \"Volume and freeze. We need to sort out exits and when to freeze. Everyone's just flopping around at the end of a scene at the moment.\" </p> <p>This is the only time director and choreographer Ms Lancaster does shout, and then only to make herself heard. Despite provocation - people fluffing lines, forgetting stage directions, talking in corners, or just not being there when they should be - she is good humoured throughout. For the most part, these young people are not professional actors, but part of a unique community arts project which is bringing together two very different inner city areas of Liverpool - areas that don't usually mix. </p> <p>The teenagers will perform The Longest Night Alone later this month at Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall, the city's classical music hall and poshest venue, and they are taking it in their stride. They only started rehearsing a matter of weeks ago, and, despite appearances, only a couple of them knew each other beforehand. </p> <p>The project has been organised by The Greenhouse, a children's arts and play centre based in Toxteth which grew out of the European year against racism in 1997. The centre's activities were originally aimed at pre-school children, but to stitch together the ever-expanding patchwork quilt of funding, Greenhouse director Debbie Wright found herself extending her own boundaries and ambitions. \"This particular project is funded by the Liverpool central urban initiative and the criteria stipulated that we target the four electoral wards deemed to be the poorest,\" she said. These were the four closest to the city centre: Vauxhall and Everton to the north, and the more racially mixed Abercromby and Granby to the south, all with unemployment rates markedly higher than the national - and Liverpool's - average. </p> <p>To advertise for participants, Greenhouse dropped flyers through every letterbox in the four wards. \"We wanted to attract young adults sitting at home who fancied having a go but had no experience, rather than professionals,\" Ms Wright said. \"Our aim was that it could be the starting point for a professional career, but it's mainly about increasing self-confidence and the motivation to succeed. And of course they are being trained.\" </p> <p>The play is not overtly about race issues; rather, it's the existence of the project itself that is challenging preconceptions. Writer Curtis Watt wanted to make an original musical about modern times, using the ubiquitous mobile phone and pager culture to twist and turn events instead of a more traditional narrative. \"There is a classical thread running through the story; I wanted a theme of death and rebirth but it's basically one day in the life of an inner city housing estate that's awaiting demolition, and the pressures that throws up,\" he said. It's a raw look at the issues and choices urban British teenagers and young adults have to face - debt, drugs, death, love and loyalties, on a mobile phone merry-go-round of misunderstandings, malice and misery. And it's a timely reminder of how society is failing them. </p> <p>Mr Watt, who also wrote the score, was happy to introduce extra characters to showcase as much talent as possible. \"We looked at people's skills and juggled them about. For instance we have a girl rapper who performs her own rap, but this moves the story along rather than just being incidental.\" </p> <p>The musical style ranges from hip hop to operatic, he explains, because he wanted to reflect the all-inclusiveness of the project. \"There aren't many cities in my experience where the natural balance is properly represented in a project like this,\" he said, though he does point out that it was difficult to persuade boys to audition. \"It seems theatre isn't macho at the moment and we need to work on that.\" </p> <p>Mr Watt himself joined the local youth theatre at 15 \"to stay out of trouble\", he says. And it worked. He has been involved in a lot of projects for black and other communities who don't usually access theatre, and he also performs around the country as poet and rapper C Zero. </p> <p>Michael Ryan, who plays two parts in the play, knows all about the peer pressure that requires you to dismiss something that's not cool. \"I was told I had a talent for acting at school but I was put off by my scally mates,\" he says. \"But then I decided to take the stick.\" At 20, Michael is something of an old pro, having already landed the part of John Lennon's schoolfriend in a new film about the Beatle. He is one of the few members of the cast who has worked professionally. \"There are a lot of first-time performers here and it's an excellent project for them because it's so supportive. The script is brilliant and there's a great atmosphere, but we've still got to reach the peaks it's demanding.\" </p> <p>Michelle Barrett and Vicki Clarke, at 14 and 15 the youngest members of the cast, picked up the Greenhouse leaflets and braved the bus to the auditions. They didn't know each other before but are now friends. \"You have to get on with each other here and there's no bitching,' said Michelle. Vicki added: \"You have to cope with getting to rehearsals and you have to leave your social life and your problems at home. This isn't the place for that because it affects everybody.\" </p> <p>Two older girls, Samira Saeed, 19, and Ruth Cullen, 18, are both unemployed after completing performing arts diplomas. They felt slightly disillusioned after college until they got parts in The Longest Night Alone. \"My confidence was knocked a bit; we weren't getting any parts,\" said Ruth. Both girls learned to sing and dance as well as act because they believed it would enhance their career prospects. Now with renewed confidence and energy they can't wait to get to rehearsals. \"It's the best part of the day,\" said Samira. </p> <p>Watt thinks one of the hardest things has been instilling a sense of commitment into the cast. But only a couple of people have dropped out. </p> <p>The actors are not paid, though they can claim expenses, and the writer, director and choreographer team of Mr Watt, Ms Lancaster and her partner Stephen Mulrooney, have all been touched by the energy, attitude and dedication the cast has brought to the project. Ms Lancaster said: \"I knew a couple of people had the discipline of college performances behind them but not the exposure, and some had been in small shows or dance sketches but all had to learn how to take direction.\" </p> <p>\"I wanted to create a safe environment so they could express themselves, and they've been amazing. They may live in two totally separate communities but the issues they have to face as teenagers and young adults, and which the play addresses, are the same. They all believe in what they are doing, they understand that they are only as strong as the weakest link, and that they alone are responsible for getting the story across, and also to entertain the audience.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Like many bosses, Bradford home care manager Jenny Hardy usually comes face to face with service users only when things have gone wrong and she's dealing with complaints. So when she left her office to visit elderly community care users in their own homes, she expected the pensioners to use the opportunity to list the service's shortcomings. To her surprise, however, many of them took the chance to say how much they appreciated the home help staff. </p> <p>Unexpected praise was just one of the surprises to emerge from a ground-breaking experiment in user consultation when Ms Hardy and 10 fellow managers were sent \"back to the floor\" to find out what some of the city's most elderly citizens think of home care, day centres and other services on offer. The move came out of a joint project between Bradford social services and York University's social policy research unit (Spru), part of a department of health programme looking at service outcomes. </p> <p>Charles Patmore, Spru research fellow, believes the Bradford experiment is a first for social services. Involving community care recipients in service development has become a key management goal, but tried and tested methods such as questionnaires and focus groups are less appropriate for the oldest clients. When asked by researchers for the trial scheme, many of this group said they would much rather give feedback from the comfort of their own homes and would like to do so direct to those in charge of the services. </p> <p>Their reasons were straight-forward, says Mr Patmore, in that they wanted to show the decision-makers the problems they faced in everyday life. \"They also believed that the involvement of senior managers would prove the consultation was more than a token gesture.\" </p> <p>For their part, the managers overcame reservations about how much time the exercise would take and 11 managers, from two area offices, interviewed 30 randomly selected home care clients (half of whom were over 85) using an interview script drawn up by Spru. </p> <p>It had been 10 years since John Howarth, area service manager for older people in the south of the Bradford district, had worked directly with clients (although his managerial duties include regular visits to care homes on his patch). He said the visits helped him get a more rounded view of clients' lives: \"You get to see them not just in terms of being a service user but as a person. You see how the service fits in with their overall needs and aspirations.\" </p> <p>The interviews helped the team learn the importance of recognising clients' previous lifestyles, said Mr Howarth, whose varied brief includes a large council estate and a small Pennine village. \"If someone lived as part of a close family unit, there may be fundamental issues about the emotional support they need alongside help with daily tasks. Others may have had a lifestyle where they had been fairly self-sufficient and may not need or want the same level of support.\" </p> <p>Celia Waller, who runs the care management team in the town of Keighley, said the interviews reminded her of the need for staff to communicate effectively. \"You forget how important it is to service users to be told if someone such as a home help or meal deliverer is delayed. If they're housebound, they get terribly anxious if someone's late.\" </p> <p>Mr Patmore admits that some managers feared meeting dissatisfied clients. And although the latter may have been fewer and less fierce than the managers feared, they still had plenty to say about where the service fell short of their expectations. Many of the elderly people Ms Hardy visited wanted a more thorough cleaning service, rather than the basic \"hygiene clean\" on offer now owing to spending constraints. </p> <p>\"They said no one dusts in out of the way places such as along the tops of pictures,\" she said. \"I've been in the service for a long time and I remember when we could provide that level of domestic help. Help with the lighter tasks can be important psychologically. Frustration at not being able to maintain your home can make users depressed.\" </p> <p>Some problems could be fixed, though, and the researchers found the managers took swift action to rectify a problem identified in an interview - something less senior personnel would probably have struggled to do. Mr Patmore recalled: \"One interviewer was struck by how depressed someone was by their arthritis, a condition that was aggravated by a badly-designed flat. So they had them moved.\" </p> <p>In another case, an interviewer met a man who relied heavily for company upon a failing television. The manager arranged for the set to be fixed. And the researchers found that some of the interventions, such as improving a day centre's activity programme, benefited many clients, not just the interviewees who prompted the moves. </p> <p>Ms Waller found that interviewees sometimes disagreed about service shortcomings, however. \"Some people said they wanted to see the same home help every visit; others said they liked a variety of helpers. Some said they liked the day centre activities; others said there weren't enough. The important thing is to respond to individual need,\" she said. </p> <p>The interview programme resulted in 16 recommendations for change, some relating to the care of specific individuals, others pertaining more broadly to the direction the service should take. The department is in the process of integrating the recommendations into service plans. </p> <p>The Spru researchers concluded that manager interviewers were a promising means of reaching older community care clients. And for at least some of the managers, \"the fundamental purpose and value of their work was confirmed\". </p> <p>But it is being stressed that these interviews are something to be deployed occasionally - not an alternative to monitoring services through a review system - although there may be room to develop interviews by senior staff generally as a routine management tool. </p> <p>Ms Hardy said the interviews taught her a great deal. \"I started out at the bottom in home care,\" she said. \"It was fascinating to go back to see how the service has altered and grown - and to see what has dropped off the end in the process.\" </p> <p>Mr Howarth also found the experience rewarding. \"Ideally it is something we could do on an annual basis,\" he said, \"linking it into development and business planning.\" Ms Waller warns that departments may struggle to marry the clients' agenda with that of the social services department, driven by government. But even she agrees that going back to the floor was an exercise well worth repeating.</p>",

It had been 10 years since John Howarth, area service manager for older people in the south of the Bradford district, had worked directly with clients (although his managerial duties include regular visits to care homes on his patch). He said the visits helped him get a more rounded view of clients' lives: \"You get to see them not just in terms of being a service user but as a person. You see how the service fits in with their overall needs and aspirations.\" The interviews helped the team learn the importance of recognising clients' previous lifestyles, said Mr Howarth, whose varied brief includes a large council estate and a small Pennine village. \"If someone lived as part of a close family unit, there may be fundamental issues about the emotional support they need alongside help with daily tasks. Others may have had a lifestyle where they had been fairly self-sufficient and may not need or want the same level of support.\" Celia Waller, who runs the care management team in the town of Keighley, said the interviews reminded her of the need for staff to communicate effectively. \"You forget how important it is to service users to be told if someone such as a home help or meal deliverer is delayed. If they're housebound, they get terribly anxious if someone's late.\" Mr Patmore admits that some managers feared meeting dissatisfied clients. And although the latter may have been fewer and less fierce than the managers feared, they still had plenty to say about where the service fell short of their expectations. Many of the elderly people Ms Hardy visited wanted a more thorough cleaning service, rather than the basic \"hygiene clean\" on offer now owing to spending constraints. \"They said no one dusts in out of the way places such as along the tops of pictures,\" she said. \"I've been in the service for a long time and I remember when we could provide that level of domestic help. Help with the lighter tasks can be important psychologically. Frustration at not being able to maintain your home can make users depressed.\" Some problems could be fixed, though, and the researchers found the managers took swift action to rectify a problem identified in an interview - something less senior personnel would probably have struggled to do. Mr Patmore recalled: \"One interviewer was struck by how depressed someone was by their arthritis, a condition that was aggravated by a badly-designed flat. So they had them moved.\" In another case, an interviewer met a man who relied heavily for company upon a failing television. The manager arranged for the set to be fixed. And the researchers found that some of the interventions, such as improving a day centre's activity programme, benefited many clients, not just the interviewees who prompted the moves. Ms Waller found that interviewees sometimes disagreed about service shortcomings, however. \"Some people said they wanted to see the same home help every visit; others said they liked a variety of helpers. Some said they liked the day centre activities; others said there weren't enough. The important thing is to respond to individual need,\" she said. The interview programme resulted in 16 recommendations for change, some relating to the care of specific individuals, others pertaining more broadly to the direction the service should take. The department is in the process of integrating the recommendations into service plans. The Spru researchers concluded that manager interviewers were a promising means of reaching older community care clients. And for at least some of the managers, \"the fundamental purpose and value of their work was confirmed\". But it is being stressed that these interviews are something to be deployed occasionally - not an alternative to monitoring services through a review system - although there may be room to develop interviews by senior staff generally as a routine management tool. Ms Hardy said the interviews taught her a great deal. \"I started out at the bottom in home care,\" she said. \"It was fascinating to go back to see how the service has altered and grown - and to see what has dropped off the end in the process.\" Mr Howarth also found the experience rewarding. \"Ideally it is something we could do on an annual basis,\" he said, \"linking it into development and business planning.\" Ms Waller warns that departments may struggle to marry the clients' agenda with that of the social services department, driven by government. But even she agrees that going back to the floor was an exercise well worth repeating.",

      "body": "<p>When the bent spines and exhausted covers of battered library books need repair, the Remploy book-binding factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme is one of the places they are sent. Here in the unit's low-rise blocks, 80 or so partially-sighted, deaf and wheelchair-using staff work by hand, stitching together the pages of rare works, or use machines to glue and press hardback covers. </p> <p>They are engaged in supported employment where devices such as wheelchair ramps, wide doors, induction loops and Braille signs have been used to make working life easier. But under a new government scheme called Workstep, supported employment is due for a radical shake-up from April. Its architects hail the restructuring as a long overdue modernisation of a neglected area. </p> <p>Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, said: \"For years we have accepted that disabled people should be included in mainstream education. We've accepted care in the community instead of people being locked up in Victorian institutions, but no one has yet tackled disabled people in the workplace. There is an ethos that disabled people shouldn't work alongside the able-bodied, which is outrageous.\" </p> <p>At the moment, the government gives a \u00a3156m subsidy to supported employment, enabling employers such as Remploy, Mencap and local authorities to compete on a level playing field with mainstream outfits. Remploy, Britain's largest supported employer, was established in 1945 to provide work for returning war veterans who had lost limbs in combat. </p> <p>Today, a total of 10,358 - nearly half the 23,000 disabled people in supported employment - work either in the company's 87 factories, with 7,397 assembling mobile phones, car parts for Rover, furniture and textiles, or on its Interwork scheme, where it acts as an agent contracting out a further 2,961 disabled people to host companies such as Asda and Tesco, while contributing one third of their salary. </p> <p>Under the government's new plans, the Interwork scheme would be further developed. Proponents of Workstep argue that it will \"progress\" disabled people through extensive training in supported employment and out into the mainstream where they may take on meaningful work in callcentres and supermarkets. \"At the moment we have a static workforce in disabled people because no one has offered them opportunities to move on and develop,\" said an employment department spokesperson. \"Our aim is to get 5,000 people progressed within three years and, as an incentive, payments will be made to companies based on the number of progressions they have. Obviously if people are severely disabled and want to stay within a supported environment we won't force them to move. We are simply providing opportunities to do more interesting work for people who can use them.\" </p> <p>Among those with physical and mental impairments, however, there is concern that progression is simply a byword for turfing them on to the scrapheap and anger at the subtext that Remploy is thought to be merely an expensive form of social service. They feel that the government stance of treating the future of disabled employment as a civil rights issue is far wide of the mark. </p> <p>The GMB general union calls it \"insulting\" to imply that disabled people have nothing commercially viable to offer. \"Remploy's Clydebank factory produces radiation suits,\" said a union official. \"The Ministry of Defence started using a company in Scandinavia because of cost, but in the end sent the suits back to Clydebank because the quality was better.\" </p> <p>Pam Tinsley, 56, works at Remploy's Newcastle-under-Lyme factory. Severe osteoarthritis and a damaged spine from a work-related accident 10 years ago mean that she has to wear surgical shoes and she uses a wheelchair to move herself over distances. </p> <p>She sent off 385 job applications and had 182 interviews before arriving at Remploy. \"Before I came here I thought Remploy was just a place full of badly disabled people sitting doing nothing and getting pocket money,\" said Ms Tinsley, who was awarded an MBE in 1999 for services to disabled people. \"But apart from the serious work that goes on, it's actually a lifeline for many of the people here who wouldn't speak to anyone outside their home from one month to the next otherwise. Remploy employs people with a whole range of disabilities who can care for each other in practical ways that might never occur to an able-bodied person.\" </p> <p>Ms Tinsley's other hat is mother of chapel for the Graphical Paper and Media Union (GPMU), which means some of her time is spent helping other employees figure out what benefits they are entitled to and how to claim them. \"Some of the forms are so complicated you need a degree to fill them in - and the person who can most help someone with a disability, is someone else with a disability,\" she said. \"There is a sense of community within many of the factories. All too often in mainstream factories the disabled employee will be treated like the village idiot.\" </p> <p>The fear is that the Workstep scheme is simply a backdoor means to cut jobs at the factories instead of a route to fulfilling work. People joining the new scheme will be moved on after two years, which could mean the commercial viability of the factories will be gradually undermined. There is also the suspicion that employers, when given the choice of someone with a disability and someone without, will choose the easiest option. Further, those employers who do take up the challenge may do so only because employing someone at a subsidised rate will make them a cheap source of labour, without having the burden of responsibility for them. </p> <p>Phil Davies, chairman of the Remploy consortium of trade unions, said: \"This is all being done in the name of desegregation, but what's wrong with disabled people working together? If you are profoundly deaf, and there are no other signers around and you can't lip read, you're in an alien world. Assimilation can be progression into isolation. We're not against integration, but there is a requirement for both. Disabled people are entitled to a choice and to the dignity of working in a safe environment. If a working business like Remploy can supply both, then why not?\" </p> <p>Ms Tinsley is dead against the move. She said: \"The people within the Remploy system want to stay there. It is a nice idea that we should be integrated into mainstream industry, but the harsh fact is, it doesn't want us. There are too many able-bodied people out of work. We need sheltered employment and protection. There are some working here who would never get a job anywhere else because their disabilities are too severe.\" </p> <p>Ms Hodge counters that the needs of the 400,000 disabled people ready to work but unable to find it, would be best served by restructuring companies such as Remploy to develop their agency function and put greater emphasis on skills training. </p> <p>\"Nobody likes change and if you're coping with a disability it's even harder,\" the minister said. \"We have to make sure that new people come into a properly defined programme. This is all about reconfiguring to create greater opportunities.\" </p> <p>Part of the government's supported employment review will take on the task of changing perceptions about disability among employers. A recent initiative, called Dining with a Difference, involved getting together a group of owners of small businesses for dinner and making them feel disabled by supplying forks but no knives, and having chairs at an awkward height. </p> <p>However, those within and working on behalf of supported employment would like to see recruitment of disabled people into senior management positions. It is a source of continuing grievance that none of Remploy's current paid board members has a disability. \"It creates a culture of able bodies saying they know best,\" said Mr Davies. \"We want to see active recruitment of disability throughout the hierarchy. At the moment there is a glass ceiling where if you come in as a shop floor worker, you may get to the level of supervisor but progress stops there. What disabled people want are quality, long-term jobs. If we're not going to have a charitable attitude towards them then what are we saying?\" </p> <p> <strong>Disability and the job market</strong><br> David Brindle<br></p> <p> Disabled people are almost seven times as likely as others to be out of work and claiming benefits, according to official figures. </p> <p>More than 6.6m people of working age are defined as \"long-term disabled\"in the government's labour force survey. This represents 19% of the workforce. </p> <p>A smaller number, almost 5.4m or 15% of the workforce, are said to have a \"work-limiting\" disability. Of these, only 40% are in work, compared to 82% of non-disabled people of working age. </p> <p>Workers with a limiting disability are more likely to be self-employed (14%, as against 10% of non-disabled workers) and typically earn less (an average \u00a37.64 an hour, compared to \u00a38.84). But they stay longer in their jobs, having completed an average 8.3 years in their current positions in contrast to 7.4 years among the non-disabled. </p> <p>Among all long-term disabled people of working age, 52% are out of work and 40% are receiving state benefits. But 17% - more than 1.1m - say they would like to work and 6% - almost 400,000 - say they are available. </p> <p>Employment rates vary considerably according to type of disability, being lowest for people with mental illness (17%) or learning disability (24%) and highest for those with diabetes (68%), skin conditions and allergies (also 68%) or hearing difficulty (65%). </p> <p>The government is introducing nationally the New Deal for disabled people, by which \"job brokers\" will help find training and work for claimants of incapacity benefit. One pilot scheme in part of Wales found jobs for 750 people.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the bent spines and exhausted covers of battered library books need repair, the Remploy book-binding factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme is one of the places they are sent. Here in the unit's low-rise blocks, 80 or so partially-sighted, deaf and wheelchair-using staff work by hand, stitching together the pages of rare works, or use machines to glue and press hardback covers. They are engaged in supported employment where devices such as wheelchair ramps, wide doors, induction loops and Braille signs have been used to make working life easier. But under a new government scheme called Workstep, supported employment is due for a radical shake-up from April. Its architects hail the restructuring as a long overdue modernisation of a neglected area. Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, said: \"For years we have accepted that disabled people should be included in mainstream education. We've accepted care in the community instead of people being locked up in Victorian institutions, but no one has yet tackled disabled people in the workplace. There is an ethos that disabled people shouldn't work alongside the able-bodied, which is outrageous.\" At the moment, the government gives a \u00a3156m subsidy to supported employment, enabling employers such as Remploy, Mencap and local authorities to compete on a level playing field with mainstream outfits. Remploy, Britain's largest supported employer, was established in 1945 to provide work for returning war veterans who had lost limbs in combat. Today, a total of 10,358 - nearly half the 23,000 disabled people in supported employment - work either in the company's 87 factories, with 7,397 assembling mobile phones, car parts for Rover, furniture and textiles, or on its Interwork scheme, where it acts as an agent contracting out a further 2,961 disabled people to host companies such as Asda and Tesco, while contributing one third of their salary. Under the government's new plans, the Interwork scheme would be further developed. Proponents of Workstep argue that it will \"progress\" disabled people through extensive training in supported employment and out into the mainstream where they may take on meaningful work in callcentres and supermarkets. \"At the moment we have a static workforce in disabled people because no one has offered them opportunities to move on and develop,\" said an employment department spokesperson. \"Our aim is to get 5,000 people progressed within three years and, as an incentive, payments will be made to companies based on the number of progressions they have. Obviously if people are severely disabled and want to stay within a supported environment we won't force them to move. We are simply providing opportunities to do more interesting work for people who can use them.\" Among those with physical and mental impairments, however, there is concern that progression is simply a byword for turfing them on to the scrapheap and anger at the subtext that Remploy is thought to be merely an expensive form of social service. They feel that the government stance of treating the future of disabled employment as a civil rights issue is far wide of the mark. The GMB general union calls it \"insulting\" to imply that disabled people have nothing commercially viable to offer. \"Remploy's Clydebank factory produces radiation suits,\" said a union official. \"The Ministry of Defence started using a company in Scandinavia because of cost, but in the end sent the suits back to Clydebank because the quality was better.\" Pam Tinsley, 56, works at Remploy's Newcastle-under-Lyme factory. Severe osteoarthritis and a damaged spine from a work-related accident 10 years ago mean that she has to wear surgical shoes and she uses a wheelchair to move herself over distances. She sent off 385 job applications and had 182 interviews before arriving at Remploy. \"Before I came here I thought Remploy was just a place full of badly disabled people sitting doing nothing and getting pocket money,\" said Ms Tinsley, who was awarded an MBE in 1999 for services to disabled people. \"But apart from the serious work that goes on, it's actually a lifeline for many of the people here who wouldn't speak to anyone outside their home from one month to the next otherwise. Remploy employs people with a whole range of disabilities who can care for each other in practical ways that might never occur to an able-bodied person.\" Ms Tinsley's other hat is mother of chapel for the Graphical Paper and Media Union (GPMU), which means some of her time is spent helping other employees figure out what benefits they are entitled to and how to claim them. \"Some of the forms are so complicated you need a degree to fill them in - and the person who can most help someone with a disability, is someone else with a disability,\" she said. \"There is a sense of community within many of the factories. All too often in mainstream factories the disabled employee will be treated like the village idiot.\" The fear is that the Workstep scheme is simply a backdoor means to cut jobs at the factories instead of a route to fulfilling work. People joining the new scheme will be moved on after two years, which could mean the commercial viability of the factories will be gradually undermined. There is also the suspicion that employers, when given the choice of someone with a disability and someone without, will choose the easiest option. Further, those employers who do take up the challenge may do so only because employing someone at a subsidised rate will make them a cheap source of labour, without having the burden of responsibility for them. Phil Davies, chairman of the Remploy consortium of trade unions, said: \"This is all being done in the name of desegregation, but what's wrong with disabled people working together? If you are profoundly deaf, and there are no other signers around and you can't lip read, you're in an alien world. Assimilation can be progression into isolation. We're not against integration, but there is a requirement for both. Disabled people are entitled to a choice and to the dignity of working in a safe environment. If a working business like Remploy can supply both, then why not?\" Ms Tinsley is dead against the move. She said: \"The people within the Remploy system want to stay there. It is a nice idea that we should be integrated into mainstream industry, but the harsh fact is, it doesn't want us. There are too many able-bodied people out of work. We need sheltered employment and protection. There are some working here who would never get a job anywhere else because their disabilities are too severe.\" Ms Hodge counters that the needs of the 400,000 disabled people ready to work but unable to find it, would be best served by restructuring companies such as Remploy to develop their agency function and put greater emphasis on skills training. \"Nobody likes change and if you're coping with a disability it's even harder,\" the minister said. \"We have to make sure that new people come into a properly defined programme. This is all about reconfiguring to create greater opportunities.\" Part of the government's supported employment review will take on the task of changing perceptions about disability among employers. A recent initiative, called Dining with a Difference, involved getting together a group of owners of small businesses for dinner and making them feel disabled by supplying forks but no knives, and having chairs at an awkward height. However, those within and working on behalf of supported employment would like to see recruitment of disabled people into senior management positions. It is a source of continuing grievance that none of Remploy's current paid board members has a disability. \"It creates a culture of able bodies saying they know best,\" said Mr Davies. \"We want to see active recruitment of disability throughout the hierarchy. At the moment there is a glass ceiling where if you come in as a shop floor worker, you may get to the level of supervisor but progress stops there. What disabled people want are quality, long-term jobs. If we're not going to have a charitable attitude towards them then what are we saying?\" Disability and the job market David Brindle Disabled people are almost seven times as likely as others to be out of work and claiming benefits, according to official figures. More than 6.6m people of working age are defined as \"long-term disabled\"in the government's labour force survey. This represents 19% of the workforce. A smaller number, almost 5.4m or 15% of the workforce, are said to have a \"work-limiting\" disability. Of these, only 40% are in work, compared to 82% of non-disabled people of working age. Workers with a limiting disability are more likely to be self-employed (14%, as against 10% of non-disabled workers) and typically earn less (an average \u00a37.64 an hour, compared to \u00a38.84). But they stay longer in their jobs, having completed an average 8.3 years in their current positions in contrast to 7.4 years among the non-disabled. Among all long-term disabled people of working age, 52% are out of work and 40% are receiving state benefits. But 17% - more than 1.1m - say they would like to work and 6% - almost 400,000 - say they are available. Employment rates vary considerably according to type of disability, being lowest for people with mental illness (17%) or learning disability (24%) and highest for those with diabetes (68%), skin conditions and allergies (also 68%) or hearing difficulty (65%). The government is introducing nationally the New Deal for disabled people, by which \"job brokers\" will help find training and work for claimants of incapacity benefit. One pilot scheme in part of Wales found jobs for 750 people.",

Involving community care recipients in service development has become a key management goal, but tried and tested methods such as questionnaires and focus groups are less appropriate for the oldest clients.

He says the visits helped him get a more rounded view of clients' lives. \"You get to see them not just in terms of being a service user but as a person. You see how the service fits in with their overall needs and aspirations.\" </p> <p>The interviews helped the team learn the importance of recognising clients' previous lifestyles, says Howarth, whose varied brief includes a large council estate and a small Pennine village. \"If someone lived as part of a close family unit, there may be fundamental issues about the emotional support they need alongside help with daily tasks. Others may have had a lifestyle where they had been fairly self-sufficient and may not need or want the same level of support.\" </p> <p>Celia Waller, who runs the care management team in the town of Keighley, says the interviews reminded her of the need for staff to communicate effectively. \"You forget how important it is to service users to be told if someone such as a home help or meal deliverer is delayed. If they're housebound, they get terribly anxious if someone's late.\" </p> <p>Patmore admits that some managers feared meeting dissatisfied clients. And although the latter may have been fewer and less fierce than the managers feared, they still had plenty to say about where the service fell short of their expectations. Many of the elderly people Hardy visited wanted a more thorough cleaning service, rather than the basic \"hygiene clean\" on offer now owing to spending constraints. </p> <p>\"They said no one dusts in out of the way places such as along the tops of pictures,\" she says. \"I've been in the service for a long time and I remember when we could provide that level of domestic help. Help with the lighter tasks can be important psychologically. Frustration at not being able to maintain your home can make users depressed.\" </p> <p>Some problems could be fixed, though, and the researchers found the managers took swift action to rectify a problem identified in an interview - something less senior personnel would probably have struggled to do. Patmore recalls: \"One interviewer was struck by how depressed someone was by their arthritis, a condition that was aggravated by a badly-designed flat. So they had them moved.\" </p> <p>In another case, an interviewer met a man who relied heavily for company upon a failing television. The manager arranged for the set to be fixed. And the researchers found that some of the interventions, such as improving a day centre's activity programme, benefited many clients, not just the interviewees who prompted the moves. </p> <p>Waller found that interviewees sometimes disagreed about service shortcomings, however. \"Some people said they wanted to see the same home help every visit; others said they liked a variety of helpers. Some said they liked the day centre activities; others said there weren't enough. The important thing is to respond to individual need,\" she says. </p> <p>The interview programme resulted in 16 recommendations for change, some relating to the care of specific individuals, others pertaining more broadly to the direction the service should take. The department is in the process of integrating the recommendations into service plans. </p> <p>The Spru researchers concluded that manager interviewers were a promising means of reaching older community care clients. And for at least some of the managers, \"the fundamental purpose and value of their work was confirmed.\" </p> <p>But it is being stressed that these interviews are something to be deployed occasionally - not an alternative to monitoring services through a review system - although there may be room to develop interviews by senior staff generally as a routine management tool. </p> <p>Hardy says the interviews taught her a great deal. \"I started out at the bottom in home care,\" she says. \"It was fascinating to go back to see how the service has altered and grown - and to see what has dropped off the end in the process.\" </p> <p>Howarth also found the experience rewarding. \"Ideally it is something we could do on an annual basis,\" he says, \"linking it into development and business planning.\" Waller warns that departments may struggle to marry the clients' agenda with that of the social services department, driven by government. But even she agrees that going back to the floor was an exercise well worth repeating. </p> <p>\u0095 Further information is available in a short report, Learning from Older Community Care Clients, obtainable free from Lindsey Myers, Social Policy Research Unit, University of York, York YO10 5DD, tel: 01904-433608.

      "trailText": "<p>Linda Hart has twice tried to commit suicide on a psychiatric ward.  Wendy Moore  looks at the dilemmas faced by the NHS in reducing the risks to patients</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Nobody was watching when Linda Hart went to her room, took the cord from her dressing gown, stuffed it up her jumper, then went to the bathroom. Nobody saw her tie the cord around her neck, throw the other end around a waste pipe then stand on a box. And nobody saw her jump. </p> <p>Yet Linda was a patient on an NHS psychiatric ward, compulsorily detained for her own safety because she was known to be suicidal and supposedly under constant supervision by staff. She is one of the lucky ones. Her absence, at least, was noted and she was cut down and eventually revived. </p> <p>\"It was quite easy,\" says Linda, 53, who is diagnosed psychotic but now lives at home in the midlands. Nurses supervising her were chatting about their holidays when she made the suicide attempt seven years ago. She survived a further attempt last summer, on the same ward, when she drank bath cleaner she had smuggled to her room. </p> <p>Others are not so lucky. About 180 psychiatric in-patients commit suicide each year. Almost half the suicides happen on the ward itself, or in hospital grounds, and the rest while patients are on leave, according to the national confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness. Hanging, usually from shower or curtain rails, is the most common method. A quarter of wards where suicides happen have nursing shortages. One in five patients is under special observation - 3% \"constantly\" - at the time they kill themselves. </p> <p>One of them was a friend of Linda's, a 56-year-old man who hanged himself in 1999 from the same pipe Linda had used. The pipe has finally, says Linda, been boxed in. </p> <p>Psychiatric services appear slow to learn the lessons. Since 1971 repeated reports have recommended wards could reduce suicides at a stroke by replacing fixed curtain and shower rails with collapsible versions. Yet data to the ongoing confidential inquiry reveal such deaths are still happening. At the same time, other means of committing suicide are readily available while obvious preventive measures are ignored. </p> <p> Now the government wants all suicides by hanging from non-collapsible rails eliminated by March next year. Mental health lobby groups would like to go further and prevent all suicides on the wards. So is the NHS doing enough to stop psychiatric patients taking their lives? Louis Appleby, director of the confidential inquiry, thinks not. And now, as the recently appointed mental health tsar, he is in the unusual position of implementing his own recommendations. </p> <p> They include removing from wards all structures which could be used for hanging, eliminating obstructions to observing patients and ensuring staff in contact with suicidal patients are trained in recognising, assessing and managing that risk. He finds it \"staggering\" that one in 25 of all suicides takes place on a psychiatric ward - almost twice the rate of suicides in prisons, although these receive far more publicity. </p> <p>And although many psychiatric wards have already removed obvious hanging points, he says reports of deaths from fixed rails continue. Services could do more to reduce suicides through more training, increased vigilance, improved ward design and better assessment of risk, he believes. But eliminating suicides entirely is \"unrealistic\". He says: \"Admission is often because people are suicidal so we are already dealing with a very high risk group. A completely risk-free environment would be stark and oppressive. You always have to balance these issues of safety against the dignity of the surroundings for people.\" </p> <p>Margaret Clayton, who chairs the mental health act commission, agrees, adding: \"Unless you have constant one-to-one observation, which would be totally unacceptable to the patients, it is impossible completely to rule out suicides.\" She backs the inquiry's recommendations, which have been echoed in commission reports. An audit by the commission in 1999 found that 31 people detained under the Mental Health Act, supposedly for their own or others' safety, hanged themselves in the 12 months up to February 1998 and 20 had had ready access to belts or dressing gown cords, as well as the means, such as rails, from which to hang themselves. </p> <p>The key factor - highlighted in a repeat audit out shortly - is assessing risk, argues Clayton. \"If you have more and better trained staff that always helps, but you have to draw a balance somewhere between almost harassing the patient,\" she says. </p> <p>Leading psychiatrists also regard some suicides as inevitable. \"There is always a tension between being oppressive and being safe,\" says Geoff Searle, consultant psychiatrist at St Ann's hospital, Poole. Leaving fixed rails in place is \"stupidity\", he says. But removing all means of committing suicide - including door knobs, pictures and crockery - would turn psychiatric wards into prisons. </p> <p>\"You can end up with an incredibly arid environment,\" he says. Truly determined patients will still find ways to kill themselves. He recalls a patient on a locked ward who propped up his bed, tied a sheet to the rungs and dropped to his knees to hang himself. </p> <p>Tony Maden, professor of forensic psychiatry at Imperial College, London, says all suicides are theoretically preventable but the emotional cost can be too high. While suicides could be stopped through one-to-one, arms-length observation by staff, this would be extremely intrusive. </p> <p>But lobby groups condemn the attitude that suicide is unavoidable on psychiatric wards. \"It should not be seen as an outcome of mental illness. It is not inevitable,\" says Gary Hogman, head of policy at the National Schizophrenic Fellowship, which has been campaigning since 1993 to reduce suicide rates. </p> <p>An estimated one in 10 people with schizophrenia kill themselves - far more than kill anyone else, despite the media circus this generates. \"Many families think their son is in hospital and they can sleep at night then two days later he has managed to kill himself,\" says Hogman. He blames a combination of factors, including increased pressure on wards from over-occupied beds, under-staffing, more violence and more detained patients. Poor ward conditions also do not help. </p> <p>Research last autumn by the mental health charity, Mind, concluded that depressing ward conditions were hindering patients' recovery. Its survey found that more than one in two ex-patients described wards as \"untherapeutic\" with complaints about dirty bathrooms, insufficient food and drink, lack of contact with staff and sexual harassment. </p> <p>Angela Hampton (not her real name) has been in and out of hospital for the past eight years with various mental health problems. The 45-year-old has attempted suicide four times in the past year, the last time after being sent home when refused a bed at her local unit because it was full. </p> <p>When she is admitted, she says staff are demoralised and overworked. \"We are left on our own to sit around and smoke,\" she says. Last time she smuggled in scissors, a penknife, a mirror and sewing needles which she kept hidden until discharged three weeks later. \"I used the penknife to scratch myself and I did think about committing suicide.\" Talk among patients frequently centres on means to commit suicide, she says. \"We are like prisoners learning about crime.\" </p> <p><strong> Taking their lives in their hands</strong><br></p> <p> \u0095 A quarter of the 2,370 people who committed suicide in England and Wales between April 1996 and March 1998 had had contact with mental health services in the previous year. </p> <p> \u0095 Of these 16% - about 180 a year - were psychiatric in-patients. </p> <p> \u0095 A third of suicides took place on the wards, 13% on hospital premises and just over half on leave. </p> <p> \u0095 Hanging was the means of suicide in 68% of ward deaths. </p> <p> \u0095 Nursing shortages and difficulties observing patients were reported in a quarter of in-patient suicides. </p> <p> \u0095 Mental health teams believed that one in five suicides could have been prevented. </p> <p> \u0095 Linda Hart has written a book describing her experiences on a psychiatric ward. Phone at Nine Just to Say You're Alive is published by Pan at \u00a36.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nobody was watching when Linda Hart went to her room, took the cord from her dressing gown, stuffed it up her jumper, then went to the bathroom. Nobody saw her tie the cord around her neck, throw the other end around a waste pipe then stand on a box. And nobody saw her jump. Yet Linda was a patient on an NHS psychiatric ward, compulsorily detained for her own safety because she was known to be suicidal and supposedly under constant supervision by staff. She is one of the lucky ones. Her absence, at least, was noted and she was cut down and eventually revived. \"It was quite easy,\" says Linda, 53, who is diagnosed psychotic but now lives at home in the midlands. Nurses supervising her were chatting about their holidays when she made the suicide attempt seven years ago. She survived a further attempt last summer, on the same ward, when she drank bath cleaner she had smuggled to her room. Others are not so lucky. About 180 psychiatric in-patients commit suicide each year. Almost half the suicides happen on the ward itself, or in hospital grounds, and the rest while patients are on leave, according to the national confidential inquiry into suicide and homicide by people with mental illness. Hanging, usually from shower or curtain rails, is the most common method. A quarter of wards where suicides happen have nursing shortages. One in five patients is under special observation - 3% \"constantly\" - at the time they kill themselves. One of them was a friend of Linda's, a 56-year-old man who hanged himself in 1999 from the same pipe Linda had used. The pipe has finally, says Linda, been boxed in. Psychiatric services appear slow to learn the lessons. Since 1971 repeated reports have recommended wards could reduce suicides at a stroke by replacing fixed curtain and shower rails with collapsible versions. Yet data to the ongoing confidential inquiry reveal such deaths are still happening. At the same time, other means of committing suicide are readily available while obvious preventive measures are ignored. Now the government wants all suicides by hanging from non-collapsible rails eliminated by March next year. Mental health lobby groups would like to go further and prevent all suicides on the wards. So is the NHS doing enough to stop psychiatric patients taking their lives? Louis Appleby, director of the confidential inquiry, thinks not. And now, as the recently appointed mental health tsar, he is in the unusual position of implementing his own recommendations. They include removing from wards all structures which could be used for hanging, eliminating obstructions to observing patients and ensuring staff in contact with suicidal patients are trained in recognising, assessing and managing that risk. He finds it \"staggering\" that one in 25 of all suicides takes place on a psychiatric ward - almost twice the rate of suicides in prisons, although these receive far more publicity. And although many psychiatric wards have already removed obvious hanging points, he says reports of deaths from fixed rails continue. Services could do more to reduce suicides through more training, increased vigilance, improved ward design and better assessment of risk, he believes. But eliminating suicides entirely is \"unrealistic\". He says: \"Admission is often because people are suicidal so we are already dealing with a very high risk group. A completely risk-free environment would be stark and oppressive. You always have to balance these issues of safety against the dignity of the surroundings for people.\" Margaret Clayton, who chairs the mental health act commission, agrees, adding: \"Unless you have constant one-to-one observation, which would be totally unacceptable to the patients, it is impossible completely to rule out suicides.\" She backs the inquiry's recommendations, which have been echoed in commission reports. An audit by the commission in 1999 found that 31 people detained under the Mental Health Act, supposedly for their own or others' safety, hanged themselves in the 12 months up to February 1998 and 20 had had ready access to belts or dressing gown cords, as well as the means, such as rails, from which to hang themselves. The key factor - highlighted in a repeat audit out shortly - is assessing risk, argues Clayton. \"If you have more and better trained staff that always helps, but you have to draw a balance somewhere between almost harassing the patient,\" she says. Leading psychiatrists also regard some suicides as inevitable. \"There is always a tension between being oppressive and being safe,\" says Geoff Searle, consultant psychiatrist at St Ann's hospital, Poole. Leaving fixed rails in place is \"stupidity\", he says. But removing all means of committing suicide - including door knobs, pictures and crockery - would turn psychiatric wards into prisons. \"You can end up with an incredibly arid environment,\" he says. Truly determined patients will still find ways to kill themselves. He recalls a patient on a locked ward who propped up his bed, tied a sheet to the rungs and dropped to his knees to hang himself. Tony Maden, professor of forensic psychiatry at Imperial College, London, says all suicides are theoretically preventable but the emotional cost can be too high. While suicides could be stopped through one-to-one, arms-length observation by staff, this would be extremely intrusive. But lobby groups condemn the attitude that suicide is unavoidable on psychiatric wards. \"It should not be seen as an outcome of mental illness. It is not inevitable,\" says Gary Hogman, head of policy at the National Schizophrenic Fellowship, which has been campaigning since 1993 to reduce suicide rates. An estimated one in 10 people with schizophrenia kill themselves - far more than kill anyone else, despite the media circus this generates. \"Many families think their son is in hospital and they can sleep at night then two days later he has managed to kill himself,\" says Hogman. He blames a combination of factors, including increased pressure on wards from over-occupied beds, under-staffing, more violence and more detained patients. Poor ward conditions also do not help. Research last autumn by the mental health charity, Mind, concluded that depressing ward conditions were hindering patients' recovery. Its survey found that more than one in two ex-patients described wards as \"untherapeutic\" with complaints about dirty bathrooms, insufficient food and drink, lack of contact with staff and sexual harassment. Angela Hampton (not her real name) has been in and out of hospital for the past eight years with various mental health problems. The 45-year-old has attempted suicide four times in the past year, the last time after being sent home when refused a bed at her local unit because it was full. When she is admitted, she says staff are demoralised and overworked. \"We are left on our own to sit around and smoke,\" she says. Last time she smuggled in scissors, a penknife, a mirror and sewing needles which she kept hidden until discharged three weeks later. \"I used the penknife to scratch myself and I did think about committing suicide.\" Talk among patients frequently centres on means to commit suicide, she says. \"We are like prisoners learning about crime.\" Taking their lives in their hands \u0095 A quarter of the 2,370 people who committed suicide in England and Wales between April 1996 and March 1998 had had contact with mental health services in the previous year. \u0095 Of these 16% - about 180 a year - were psychiatric in-patients. \u0095 A third of suicides took place on the wards, 13% on hospital premises and just over half on leave. \u0095 Hanging was the means of suicide in 68% of ward deaths. \u0095 Nursing shortages and difficulties observing patients were reported in a quarter of in-patient suicides. \u0095 Mental health teams believed that one in five suicides could have been prevented. \u0095 Linda Hart has written a book describing her experiences on a psychiatric ward.

      "body": "<p>If anyone doubted British farming was in deep mire, they need only have dropped into the Oxford farming conference last week. The mood at this gathering of the country's leading conventional farmers was bleak. In the past year more than 22,000 farmworkers have been made unemployed, following 18,000 in 1999. Incomes are down, many farms are trading at a record loss, and thousands more are expected to founder. When Graham Wynne, the head of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, called on the delegates to be more \"environmentally conscious\", he was heckled. \"Never mind the birds, what about the farmers,\" was the angry cry from the hall. </p> <p>Meanwhile, 450 of Britain's 3,000 organic famers were meeting at the Soil Association's bi-annual conference near Circencester. The contrast could not have been greater. The organic market, which just six years ago was barely measurable, has been growing exponentially by up to 40% a year since 1993, and is not slowing. British farmers can barely keep up with demand, 80% of shoppers have at some time bought organic foods, it is widely associated with quality and health, it attracts the young and next year UK sales should reach \u00a3500m. </p> <p>On the surface all is well in the fields where food is grown and animals are reared without pesticides, where land is rotated and manures are heavily used to increase soil fertility. Some 3.5m acres have now been converted, and as much again is in the pipeline. </p> <p>Politically, too, organic farming is on Downing Street's radar as something positive, radical and popular, to be supported if not with targets and cash then with vague promises of more research and enthusiasm. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, and Michael Meacher, the environment minister, together with trade unions, are in favour, and groups like the RSPB, with its one million members, are warming. Joan Ruddock's proposed private members' bill, which would commit Britain to convert 30% of all farmland to organics within 10 years, has attracted more than 200 MPs. </p> <p>But organic food is now a global industry. It may have been pioneered here after the war, but like wave and wind power, we have been overtaken by others. The Nordic countries, Austria and Italy, Holland, the US, Australia and others are all pouring research, conversion and support money into organics and the EU is debating how to get behind it. In Germany, where the first three BSE cases have been found in recent weeks, Chancellor Schr\u00f6der has declared that \"industrial agriculture in the country must end\", and next week Germany is expected to set a target of 20% organic within 10 years. Denmark, with an eye on the export market, has gone organic ballistic. </p> <p>More than that, organic farming, from being a system practised by and sold to a few cranks and foodies, has become fashionable to the point of being seen as utopian. \"To be in favour of organic farming is now the same as wanting a better health service or education system\", Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys told delegates. So what could possibly be wrong with a popular \"sustainable\" farming system which employs more people, leads to better management of the land, helps conservation, and is regarded as healthier for humans and animals? </p> <p>Plenty. The widespread fear is that \"organic\" could become no more than a global \"brand\" and that the philosophy behind it, which implied small-scale, local production and support for local economies, will collapse as the mass market is unleashed and if everyone gets their snout in the trough. </p> <p>Organic farmers can be just as gloomy as conventional ones and there are real fears that standards are starting to be eroded, the quality of the foods will drop, and that the hope of a more locally-based farming system to underpin rural regeneration will founder. And because the foodstuffs are bought by a small group (62% of all sales in Britain by just 7% of the population), the fear is that fashion may turn. </p> <p>The problems concentrate around the role of the supermarkets. On the one hand, organic farming has depended on them to reach a mass market, but their strength also threatens to wound the grassroots who have developed the farming system. With prices high and demand outstripping supply, as now, there is room for everyone to profit, but when the market becomes flooded, as it will, so the supermarkets will dictate price, production methods and standards. </p> <p>\"As ever, it will mean the small producers will not be able to compete,\" said one delegate at Cirencester. Like others, he fears that unless organic farmers group together into co-operatives or associations to counter the supermarkets, they will go the same way as almost every small, conventional farm in the land. </p> <p>Robert Duxbury of Sainsbury's, shares the fears. He sees pressure building to lower standards as farmers flock to organics in the hope of saving their livelihoods and inter- national food groups with no commitment to the founding principles move in. \"Pressure to lower standards is increasing all the time,\" he said. \"Newcomers do not always understand why you have strict standards, or that if you lose the philosophy, you lose the integrity. Customers buy organic on trust.\" </p> <p> But Sainsbury's, which predicts its sales will rise 65% in the next year, mostly fears that Asda/Walmart and Iceland will undermine the market by trying to drive prices down to the same as conventional food by squeezing the small growers and importing massively. \"Customers should be aware of the full cost of organic food\", said Duxbury \"The worst scenario is that that Asda will overwhelm [small farmers]. We sense a real danger to the integrity of organic foods.\" </p> <p> But Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose, who dominate the British market, are themselves accused of \"stealing the story\" of the grass roots and taking over the \u00a365m market of local organic sales from box schemes, farmers' markets and specialist organic and farm shops. Box schemes, which led the organics surge before the supermarkets got in on the act, are now levelling off or contracting by 15%. \"People are going down the road to get their organics at a supermarket\", said Guy Watson, who runs one of Britain's largest schemes. </p> <p>Most worrying for some of the greener growers is that the market is becoming an end in itself and consumers are being given the wrong message. Organic food has the cachet of being healthy and environmentally benign, but because the food is increasingly processed into convenience foods, or sent halfway round the world at massive hidden environmental expense, there is little or no social, nutritional, or ecological benefit and it is only a matter of time before people cotton on. \"How can you call swedes flown in from Australia, or long-life milk from Sweden 'organic'? How can organic tobacco or organic pineapples grown by giant multinationals in the third world countries by people just above starvation wages be seen as beneficial?\" asked one delegate. Another stressed: \"Organics was always about more than the food or produce itself. It must have a social content, too.\" </p> <p>Whether organic standards should be linked to \"food miles\" or social or environmental standards, as with fair trade, divides the Soil Association and its 15,000 members. It is a fraught argument and hard to see how to resolve except by education of consumers. Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association, warned: \"Unless there is education into organics, much of the potential wider benefits for society and the development of local economies will be lost. It would be a tragedy.\"</p>",

Customers buy organic on trust.\" But Sainsbury's, which predicts its sales will rise 65% in the next year, mostly fears that Asda/Walmart and Iceland will undermine the market by trying to drive prices down to the same as conventional food by squeezing the small growers and importing massively. \"Customers should be aware of the full cost of organic food\", said Duxbury \"The worst scenario is that that Asda will overwhelm [small farmers]. We sense a real danger to the integrity of organic foods.\" But Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose, who dominate the British market, are themselves accused of \"stealing the story\" of the grass roots and taking over the \u00a365m market of local organic sales from box schemes, farmers' markets and specialist organic and farm shops. Box schemes, which led the organics surge before the supermarkets got in on the act, are now levelling off or contracting by 15%. \"People are going down the road to get their organics at a supermarket\", said Guy Watson, who runs one of Britain's largest schemes. Most worrying for some of the greener growers is that the market is becoming an end in itself and consumers are being given the wrong message. Organic food has the cachet of being healthy and environmentally benign, but because the food is increasingly processed into convenience foods, or sent halfway round the world at massive hidden environmental expense, there is little or no social, nutritional, or ecological benefit and it is only a matter of time before people cotton on. \"How can you call swedes flown in from Australia, or long-life milk from Sweden 'organic'? How can organic tobacco or organic pineapples grown by giant multinationals in the third world countries by people just above starvation wages be seen as beneficial?\" asked one delegate. Another stressed: \"Organics was always about more than the food or produce itself. It must have a social content, too.\" Whether organic standards should be linked to \"food miles\" or social or environmental standards, as with fair trade, divides the Soil Association and its 15,000 members. It is a fraught argument and hard to see how to resolve except by education of consumers. Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association, warned: \"Unless there is education into organics, much of the potential wider benefits for society and the development of local economies will be lost. It would be a tragedy.\"",

A home had been found for me in Nelson and I was put on a train at Euston station, knowing virtually no English and having no idea where Nelson was or when I would get there. </p> <p>In Burnley, an extended family of mill workers got into my compartment and it took them no time at all to find out where I was going. Their own destination was Colne, but they got out of the train with me at Nelson, carried my suitcase and, having located my adoptive family on the platform, escorted us to the family's house. Some months later, two of them saw me walking in the road and ran after me, shook me by the hand and told me how pleased they were to see me again. </p> <p>What could have been a sad and miserable year for me in a strange country, without parents or family, was made one of the happiest periods of my life by the universal warmth, kindness and sympathy from everybody I met - at home, at school, in shops, church and everywhere else. </p> <p>In fact, the kindness shown to me was wonderful. In Nelson, where unemployment and hardship had been rife until the cotton mills opened again shortly before the war, there was a wonderful spirit of community and sharing. There was also a burning desire for knowledge among families where fathers and mothers had sometimes had to start work at age 12 because their earnings were so badly needed. The majority of pupils in my class at school were the children of mill workers on a scholarship, and their determination to do well was an eye-opener to me. </p> <p>I have often regretted that I could not thank the people of Nelson, but I am so happy to see that their spirit of tolerance and compassion is alive and well.

I feel sure that the young asylum seekers who are beneficiaries from it today will remember their stay with as much gratitude and affection as I do. Karl Roome London Playing for time The requirement to submit complaints within 12 months (A fatal flaw, January 3) applies to local government as well as the NHS. My past experience as a councillor asked, often after considerable delay, for help in the presentation of such cases, is that council officers - like their health service counterparts - are frequently (and I believe deliberately) slow in answering complaints and supplying reliable, relevant information. This can make it virtually impossible to prepare a case for presentation to the ombudsman within the prescribed time limit. I believe that the specified period within which unresolved complaints can be referred to an ombudsman should be extended to two years and that the authorities concerned be required, at an early stage, to notify complainants of this regulation. Bob Heys Halifax Missing a point Rodney Hedley made a number of thought-provoking points in his article about homelessness (Home begins at charity, December 20) but did not touch on a major issue which would help thousands of young people avoid life on the streets \u00d1 greater access to educational opportunities. Half of all homeless young people have no qualifications at all. Does this mean they lack potential? No, rather that when their contemporaries were completing course work and sitting exams, they were often already preoccupied with finding somewhere to sleep for the night. Without financial backing or connections into the world of work from their family, homeless young people struggle to achieve a normal adult lifestyle. Getting worthwhile qualifications is one of the few routes off the street and out of poverty. So why does a government committed to reducing rough sleeping make it well nigh impossible for homeless young people to gain these qualifications after age 19? Young people over 19 are no longer allowed to study full time while claiming housing benefit. Yet research we carried out recently showed a wide range of reasons - ill health, substance dependency, emotional and family conflicts, or plain lack of confidence and motivation - why many homeless young people are past their teens before they feel ready to return to studying. I'm not sure whether the Foyer Federation is one of the homelessness charities alluded to in Hedley's article, but we will continue to drive home the message that when you are young and homeless you need more than a roof over your head, crucial though this is. Carolyn Hayman Chief executive, Foyer Federation Stepping in Malcolm Dean calls for \"more systematic auditing of accounts\" and asks for the charity commission to \"please step in\" when a charity's fundraising costs are higher than average (Cheques and balances, January 3). We have done just that on 3,289 occasions in response to unusually high fundraising costs since we started routine monitoring of charities' annual returns more than three years ago. Our new accountancy framework makes charities' accounts and returns more transparent, and requires trustees to clarify and explain the cost and benefits of fundraising activities.

      "body": "<p>\"And the two words for this evening are?\" Sue Lancaster shouts into the jumble of laughing, lolling teenagers. It's a break from rehearsals for a new musical to be performed in a worryingly short time. \"Energy and volume\" they shout back. \"No!\" she roars, laughing herself now. \"Volume and freeze. We need to sort out exits and when to freeze. Everyone's just flopping around at the end of a scene at the moment.\" </p> <p>This is the only time director and choreographer Lancaster does shout, and then only to make herself heard. Despite provocation - people fluffing lines, forgetting stage directions, talking in corners, or just not being there when they should be - she is good humoured throughout. For the most part, these young people are not professional actors, but part of a unique community arts project which is bringing together two very different inner city areas of Liverpool - areas that don't usually mix. </p> <p>The teenagers will perform The Longest Night Alone later this month at Liverpool's Philharmonic Hall, the city's classical music hall and poshest venue, and they are taking it in their stride. They only started rehearsing a matter of weeks ago, and, despite appearances, only a couple of them knew each other beforehand. </p> <p>The project has been organised by The Greenhouse, a children's arts and play centre based in Toxteth which grew out of the European year against racism in 1997. The centre's activities were originally aimed at pre-school children, but to stitch together the ever-expanding patchwork quilt of funding, Greenhouse director Debbie Wright found herself extending her own boundaries and ambitions. \"This particular project is funded by the Liverpool central urban initiative and the criteria stipulated that we target the four electoral wards deemed to be the poorest,\" she says. These were the four closest to the city centre: Vauxhall and Everton to the north, and the more racially mixed Abercromby and Granby to the south, all with unemployment rates markedly higher than the national - and Liverpool's - average. </p> <p>To advertise for participants, Greenhouse dropped flyers through every letterbox in the four wards. \"We wanted to attract young adults sitting at home who fancied having a go but had no experience, rather than professionals,\" Wright says. \"Our aim was that it could be the starting point for a professional career, but it's mainly about increasing self-confidence and the motivation to succeed. And of course they are being trained.\" </p> <p>The play is not overtly about race issues; rather, it's the existence of the project itself that is challenging preconceptions. Writer Curtis Watt wanted to make an original musical about modern times, using the ubiquitous mobile phone and pager culture to twist and turn events instead of a more traditional narrative. \"There is a classical thread running through the story; I wanted a theme of death and rebirth but it's basically one day in the life of an inner city housing estate that's awaiting demolition, and the pressures that throws up,\" he says. It's a raw look at the issues and choices urban British teenagers and young adults have to face - debt, drugs, death, love and loyalties, on a mobile phone merry-go-round of misunderstandings, malice and misery. And it's a timely reminder of how society is failing them. </p> <p>Watt, who also wrote the score, was happy to introduce extra characters to showcase as much talent as possible. \"We looked at people's skills and juggled them about. For instance we have a girl rapper who performs her own rap, but this moves the story along rather than just being incidental.\" </p> <p>The musical style ranges from hip hop to operatic, he explains, because he wanted to reflect the all-inclusiveness of the project. \"There aren't many cities in my experience where the natural balance is properly represented in a project like this,\" he says, though he does point out that it was difficult to persuade boys to audition. \"It seems theatre isn't macho at the moment and we need to work on that.\" </p> <p>Watt himself joined the local youth theatre at 15 \"to stay out of trouble\", he says. And it worked. He has been involved in a lot of projects for black and other communities who don't usually access theatre, and he also performs around the country as poet and rapper C Zero. </p> <p>Michael Ryan, who plays two parts in the play, knows all about the peer pressure that requires you to dismiss something that's not cool. \"I was told I had a talent for acting at school but I was put off by my scally mates,\" he says. \"But then I decided to take the stick.\" At 20, Ryan is something of an old pro, having already landed the part of John Lennon's schoolfriend in a new film about the Beatle. He is one of the few members of the cast who has worked professionally. \"There are a lot of first-time performers here and it's an excellent project for them because it's so supportive. The script is brilliant and there's a great atmosphere, but we've still got to reach the peaks it's demanding.\" </p> <p>Michelle Barrett and Vicki Clarke, at 14 and 15 the youngest members of the cast, picked up the Greenhouse leaflets and braved the bus to the auditions. They didn't know each other before but are now friends. \"You have to get on with each other here and there's no bitching,' says Barrett. Clarke adds: \"You have to cope with getting to rehearsals and you have to leave your social life and your problems at home. This isn't the place for that because it affects everybody.\" </p> <p>Two older girls, Samira Saeed, 19, and Ruth Cullen, 18, are both unemployed after completing performing arts diplomas. They felt slightly disillusioned after college until they got parts in The Longest Night Alone. \"My confidence was knocked a bit; we weren't getting any parts,\" says Cullen. Both girls learned to sing and dance as well as act because they believed it would enhance their career prospects. Now with renewed confidence and energy they can't wait to get to rehearsals. \"It's the best part of the day,\" says Saeed. </p> <p>Watt thinks one of the hardest things has been instilling a sense of commitment into the cast. But only a couple of people have dropped out. </p> <p>The actors are not paid, though they can claim expenses, and the writer, director and choreographer team of Watt, Lancaster and her partner Stephen Mulrooney, have all been touched by the energy, attitude and dedication the cast has brought to the project. Lancaster says: \"I knew a couple of people had the discipline of college performances behind them but not the exposure, and some had been in small shows or dance sketches but all had to learn how to take direction.\" </p> <p>\"I wanted to create a safe environment so they could express themselves, and they've been amazing.

      "body": "<p>Ray Cochrane will be presented on Tuesday with a Royal Humane Society silver medal, its top domestic award, for saving the life of his friend and fellow jockey, Frankie Dettori, when their light aircraft crashed on June 1 just after take-off at Newmarket. </p> <p>Despite suffering burns to his head, Cochrane dragged the injured Dettori out of the plane and also tried, unsuccessfully, to save the pilot. When Cochrane's name is added to the distinguished roll of award winners, it will mark the first silver medal the society has given for more than two years, but it has a tradition going back more than two centuries. </p> <p>The most famous of these remarkable volunteers is probably Grace Darling who, in 1838 at age 22, rowed through the North Sea with her father to rescue nine survivors of a shipwreck. Both Darlings won specially struck gold medals. </p> <p>It was a desire to save life, rather than reward bravery, that brought the Royal Humane Society (RHS) into being in 1774. Two young London doctors, William Hawes and Thomas Cogan, were convinced that too many people were wrongly presumed dead and consigned to an early grave. Supported by a group of medical friends, the pair formed The Institution for Affording Immediate Relief to Persons Apparently Dead from Drowning. This soon became the more manageable Humane Society and, in 1787 under the patronage of George III, the RHS. </p> <p>The new institution offered financial rewards, paid for initially by Hawes but later by public subscription, to anyone producing a body - dead or alive. The top rate was a generous four guineas (about \u00a3250 in today's money). This tantalising offer, however, led to a widespread scam: down-and-outs in London started working in pairs - one claiming to have rescued the other and both sharing the prize money. Largely because of this, awards gradually replaced rewards. </p> <p> The society did not rely solely on passers-by to help their fellow citizens, however. It organised a team of medical assistants - doctors and apothecaries - who were effectively on 24-hour call. They were not paid, but from time to time were awarded honorary medals. The society also built up a network of \"receiving houses\" in and around London, where the half-dead could be taken for treatment. The most famous of these was in Hyde Park, central London. Otherwise, publicans were encouraged to open their doors to those in need of more than just a drink and each time they did so, they were paid a guinea. </p> <p>From the outset, the society offered advice on what we now call first aid. Some of it still holds good: mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and keeping the body warm, for instance (though in 1774, \"the skin of a sheep fresh killed\" was thought ideal for this purpose). Other recommended techniques today sound more life-threatening than life-saving. \"The smoke of tobacco thrown up the fundament [rectum] should be ranked among the earliest applications,\" said the society, and \"if a fumigator should not be at hand, the common pipe will answer the purpose of applying this vapor to the bowels.\" </p> <p>The treatment went beyond first aid. The pioneering doctors advised that it was \"to be continued with spirit for two hours, or upwards, although there should not be the least symptoms of returning life.\" Nowadays, St John Ambulance recommends that first aid should be administered only until medical help arrives. </p> <p>From the beginning, many of those rescued were people attempting to commit suicide. Their \"black designs\" and the welfare of their souls were a matter of great concern to the Christian founders of the society, who decided to give every saved person \"approved books of piety and devotion.\" In 1830, the British and Foreign Bible Society made an annual gift of 50 Bibles. Sadly, attempted suicide still features prominently in the RHS cases. </p> <p>By the time of its centenary in 1874, the society reckoned it had helped save 38,056 lives - in other words, more than one person every day since its foundation. Salvation in the 20th century continued at much the same rate - Cochrane's award will be logged as case number 84,081. </p> <p>Cochrane, who raced again after the crash but has now retired to be Dettori's agent, is as modest about his bravery as are many of the society's winners. \"I just happened to be there,\" he says. \"One man was unconscious and the other injured, so I had to do something.\" And his pleasure at the award is tempered by the death of the pilot, Patrick Mackey. \"It's hard to be enthusiastic when somebody you know lost his life,\" he says. </p> <p>While Cochrane acted to try to save two friends, many RHS award winners intervene to help total strangers. From its inception, the society has encouraged people to be aware of the needs of their fellow men - an aim that today chimes with government plans for lessons in citizenship. </p> <p>Bernard Crick, who chaired the cross-party committee advising the government, thinks the society's cases are \"good examples of practical citizenship and civic spirit\" although he stresses that children should not be coerced into taking unnecessary risks. </p> <p>Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Ian Johnston sees no incompatibility in rewarding bravery and, at the same time, advising caution. \"Everybody obviously has to make their own choices in particular situations,\" he says, \"but I think we should always celebrate the courage of those who put their own lives at risk in an effort to help others in distress.\" A view that Frankie Dettori would undoubtedly endorse. </p> <p><strong>Prompt action that saved a life</strong><br></p> <p>One drizzly evening in January 1998, Trudi Plumb, 36, was driving along a country lane in Essex on her way to an evening class. </p> <p>Plumb, who comes from Burnham-on-Crouch, noticed that the car ahead was being driven erratically and, a little further on, she found it in a ditch on the opposite side of the road. Flames were rising from the bonnet and the male driver was slumped at the wheel. </p> <p>After calling the emergency services on her mobile phone, Plumb scrambled into the ditch and, with what she calls \"popping and hissing noises\" coming from the car, opened the driver's door to free the unconscious man who was strapped in by his seat belt. </p> <p>With flames coming through the windscreen, she managed to release the belt and pull the man partially on to the bank. But his feet were still trapped under the pedals and, with the flames now forcing their way through the dashboard, she leaned in once more to push his feet clear. This time, with the help of another passerby, she dragged him to the top of the bank.

      "body": "<p>When the bent spines and exhausted covers of battered library books need repair, the Remploy book-binding factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme is one of the places they are sent. Here in the unit's low-rise blocks, 80 or so partially-sighted, deaf and wheelchair-using staff work by hand, stitching together the pages of rare works, or use machines to glue and press hardback covers. </p> <p>They are engaged in supported employment where devices such as wheelchair ramps, wide doors, induction loops and Braille signs have been used to make working life easier. But under a new government scheme called Workstep, supported employment is due for a radical shake-up from April. Its architects hail the restructuring as a long overdue modernisation of a neglected area. </p> <p>Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, says: \"For years we have accepted that disabled people should be included in mainstream education. We've accepted care in the community instead of people being locked up in Victorian institutions, but no one has yet tackled disabled people in the workplace. There is an ethos that disabled people shouldn't work alongside the able-bodied, which is outrageous.\" </p> <p>At the moment, the government gives a \u00a3156m subsidy to supported employment, enabling employers such as Remploy, Mencap and local authorities to compete on a level playing field with mainstream outfits. Remploy, Britain's largest supported employer, was established in 1945 to provide work for returning war veterans who had lost limbs in combat. </p> <p>Today, a total of 10,358 - nearly half the 23,000 disabled people in supported employment - work either in the company's 87 factories, with 7,397 assembling mobile phones, car parts for Rover, furniture and textiles, or on its Interwork scheme, where it acts as an agent contracting out a further 2,961 disabled people to host companies such as Asda and Tesco, while contributing one third of their salary. </p> <p>Under the government's new plans, the Interwork scheme would be further developed. Proponents of Workstep argue that it will \"progress\" disabled people through extensive training in supported employment and out into the mainstream where they may take on meaningful work in callcentres and supermarkets. \"At the moment we have a static workforce in disabled people because no one has offered them opportunities to move on and develop,\" says an employment department spokesperson. \"Our aim is to get 5,000 people progressed within three years and, as an incentive, payments will be made to companies based on the number of progressions they have. Obviously if people are severely disabled and want to stay within a supported environment we won't force them to move. We are simply providing opportunities to do more interesting work for people who can use them.\" </p> <p>Among those with physical and mental impairments, however, there is concern that progression is simply a byword for turfing them on to the scrapheap and anger at the subtext that Remploy is thought to be merely an expensive form of social service. They feel that the government stance of treating the future of disabled employment as a civil rights issue is far wide of the mark. </p> <p>The GMB general union calls it \"insulting\" to imply that disabled people have nothing commercially viable to offer. \"Remploy's Clydebank factory produces radiation suits,\" says a union official. \"The Ministry of Defence started using a company in Scandinavia because of cost, but in the end sent the suits back to Clydebank because the quality was better.\" </p> <p>Pam Tinsley, 56, works at Remploy's Newcastle-under-Lyme factory. Severe osteoarthritis and a damaged spine from a work-related accident 10 years ago mean that she has to wear surgical shoes and she uses a wheelchair to move herself over distances. </p> <p>She sent off 385 job applications and had 182 interviews before arriving at Remploy. \"Before I came here I thought Remploy was just a place full of badly disabled people sitting doing nothing and getting pocket money,\" says Tinsley, who was awarded an MBE in 1999 for services to disabled people. \"But apart from the serious work that goes on, it's actually a lifeline for many of the people here who wouldn't speak to anyone outside their home from one month to the next otherwise. Remploy employs people with a whole range of disabilities who can care for each other in practical ways that might never occur to an able-bodied person.\" </p> <p>Tinsley's other hat is mother of chapel for the Graphical Paper and Media Union (GPMU), which means some of her time is spent helping other employees figure out what benefits they are entitled to and how to claim them. \"Some of the forms are so complicated you need a degree to fill them in - and the person who can most help someone with a disability, is someone else with a disability,\" she says. \"There is a sense of community within many of the factories. All too often in mainstream factories the disabled employee will be treated like the village idiot.\" </p> <p>The fear is that the Workstep scheme is simply a backdoor means to cut jobs at the factories instead of a route to fulfilling work. People joining the new scheme will be moved on after two years, which could mean the commercial viability of the factories will be gradually undermined. There is also the suspicion that employers, when given the choice of someone with a disability and someone without, will choose the easiest option. Further, those employers who do take up the challenge may do so only because employing someone at a subsidised rate will make them a cheap source of labour, without having the burden of responsibility for them. </p> <p>Phil Davies, chairman of the Remploy consortium of trade unions, says: \"This is all being done in the name of desegregation, but what's wrong with disabled people working together? If you are profoundly deaf, and there are no other signers around and you can't lip read, you're in an alien world. Assimilation can be progression into isolation. We're not against integration, but there is a requirement for both. Disabled people are entitled to a choice and to the dignity of working in a safe environment. If a working business like Remploy can supply both, then why not?\" </p> <p>Tinsley is dead against the move. She says: \"The people within the Remploy system want to stay there. It is a nice idea that we should be integrated into mainstream industry, but the harsh fact is, it doesn't want us. There are too many able-bodied people out of work. We need sheltered employment and protection.

      "bodyText": "When the bent spines and exhausted covers of battered library books need repair, the Remploy book-binding factory in Newcastle-under-Lyme is one of the places they are sent. Here in the unit's low-rise blocks, 80 or so partially-sighted, deaf and wheelchair-using staff work by hand, stitching together the pages of rare works, or use machines to glue and press hardback covers. They are engaged in supported employment where devices such as wheelchair ramps, wide doors, induction loops and Braille signs have been used to make working life easier. But under a new government scheme called Workstep, supported employment is due for a radical shake-up from April. Its architects hail the restructuring as a long overdue modernisation of a neglected area. Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, says: \"For years we have accepted that disabled people should be included in mainstream education. We've accepted care in the community instead of people being locked up in Victorian institutions, but no one has yet tackled disabled people in the workplace. There is an ethos that disabled people shouldn't work alongside the able-bodied, which is outrageous.\" At the moment, the government gives a \u00a3156m subsidy to supported employment, enabling employers such as Remploy, Mencap and local authorities to compete on a level playing field with mainstream outfits. Remploy, Britain's largest supported employer, was established in 1945 to provide work for returning war veterans who had lost limbs in combat. Today, a total of 10,358 - nearly half the 23,000 disabled people in supported employment - work either in the company's 87 factories, with 7,397 assembling mobile phones, car parts for Rover, furniture and textiles, or on its Interwork scheme, where it acts as an agent contracting out a further 2,961 disabled people to host companies such as Asda and Tesco, while contributing one third of their salary. Under the government's new plans, the Interwork scheme would be further developed. Proponents of Workstep argue that it will \"progress\" disabled people through extensive training in supported employment and out into the mainstream where they may take on meaningful work in callcentres and supermarkets. \"At the moment we have a static workforce in disabled people because no one has offered them opportunities to move on and develop,\" says an employment department spokesperson. \"Our aim is to get 5,000 people progressed within three years and, as an incentive, payments will be made to companies based on the number of progressions they have. Obviously if people are severely disabled and want to stay within a supported environment we won't force them to move. We are simply providing opportunities to do more interesting work for people who can use them.\" Among those with physical and mental impairments, however, there is concern that progression is simply a byword for turfing them on to the scrapheap and anger at the subtext that Remploy is thought to be merely an expensive form of social service. They feel that the government stance of treating the future of disabled employment as a civil rights issue is far wide of the mark. The GMB general union calls it \"insulting\" to imply that disabled people have nothing commercially viable to offer. \"Remploy's Clydebank factory produces radiation suits,\" says a union official. \"The Ministry of Defence started using a company in Scandinavia because of cost, but in the end sent the suits back to Clydebank because the quality was better.\" Pam Tinsley, 56, works at Remploy's Newcastle-under-Lyme factory. Severe osteoarthritis and a damaged spine from a work-related accident 10 years ago mean that she has to wear surgical shoes and she uses a wheelchair to move herself over distances. She sent off 385 job applications and had 182 interviews before arriving at Remploy. \"Before I came here I thought Remploy was just a place full of badly disabled people sitting doing nothing and getting pocket money,\" says Tinsley, who was awarded an MBE in 1999 for services to disabled people. \"But apart from the serious work that goes on, it's actually a lifeline for many of the people here who wouldn't speak to anyone outside their home from one month to the next otherwise. Remploy employs people with a whole range of disabilities who can care for each other in practical ways that might never occur to an able-bodied person.\" Tinsley's other hat is mother of chapel for the Graphical Paper and Media Union (GPMU), which means some of her time is spent helping other employees figure out what benefits they are entitled to and how to claim them. \"Some of the forms are so complicated you need a degree to fill them in - and the person who can most help someone with a disability, is someone else with a disability,\" she says. \"There is a sense of community within many of the factories. All too often in mainstream factories the disabled employee will be treated like the village idiot.\" The fear is that the Workstep scheme is simply a backdoor means to cut jobs at the factories instead of a route to fulfilling work. People joining the new scheme will be moved on after two years, which could mean the commercial viability of the factories will be gradually undermined. There is also the suspicion that employers, when given the choice of someone with a disability and someone without, will choose the easiest option. Further, those employers who do take up the challenge may do so only because employing someone at a subsidised rate will make them a cheap source of labour, without having the burden of responsibility for them. Phil Davies, chairman of the Remploy consortium of trade unions, says: \"This is all being done in the name of desegregation, but what's wrong with disabled people working together? If you are profoundly deaf, and there are no other signers around and you can't lip read, you're in an alien world. Assimilation can be progression into isolation. We're not against integration, but there is a requirement for both. Disabled people are entitled to a choice and to the dignity of working in a safe environment. If a working business like Remploy can supply both, then why not?\" Tinsley is dead against the move. She says: \"The people within the Remploy system want to stay there. It is a nice idea that we should be integrated into mainstream industry, but the harsh fact is, it doesn't want us. There are too many able-bodied people out of work. We need sheltered employment and protection. There are some working here who would never get a job anywhere else because their disabilities are too severe.\" Hodge counters that the needs of the 400,000 disabled people ready to work but unable to find it, would be best served by restructuring companies such as Remploy to develop their agency function and put greater emphasis on skills training. \"Nobody likes change and if you're coping with a disability it's even harder,\" the minister says. \"We have to make sure that new people come into a properly defined programme.

War Child was set up in 1993 by two friends, David Wilson, a former teacher and art agent, and Bill Leeson, a film maker. The rock musician Brian Eno describes both as \"heroic figures\" for being brave enough to go to Bosnia when bullets and bombs were flying and ethnic cleansing was at its height. It was launched at the Royal Festival Hall, London, during a three-day event at which the playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, its first patron, gave a reading.</p> <p>The charity's first big project was a mobile bakery in Bosnia that was feeding 15,000 people a week in east Mostar and frontline villages.</p> <p>Stoppard also describes their work as heroic: \"Here it was a bakery in the centre of the war zone - feeding people whether they were Muslims or orthodox Christians. It was a tremendous thing to do - when it was really needed in an area where nobody would go.\"</p> <p>The success of the bakery also led to their first contact with the world of pop. A radio report of the work of the mobile bakery persuaded Eno's partner, Anthea Norman-Taylor, to take a \u00a32,000 cheque to War Child's office.</p> <p>From those small beginnings, the charity's development snowballed. The music business became increasingly alarmed at the unfolding crisis in war-torn former Yugoslavia which led to the launch of a fundraising CD, Help.</p> <p>Brian Eno persuaded his megastar friends, like U2's Bono and the Edge, to stage a concert to raise money to get musical instruments and tapes to Sarajevo. But his biggest breakthrough was to convince the world-famous tenor, Luciano Pavarotti, to sing in the same concert as Bono at Modena in Italy in 1995. It was the first of three Modena concerts inspired by War Child.</p> <p>War Child's plans were upgraded. Instead of supplying musical instruments to Sarajevo, the charity decided to build a \u00a33m music therapy centre. \"It was like a dream come true,\" said David Wilson.</p> <p>But as the dream was realised, the problems began. The charity began to lose control of its new-found wealth.

      "bodyText": "It started as a daring and innovative charity that was prepared to give practical help in places where no-one else would go. War Child was set up in 1993 by two friends, David Wilson, a former teacher and art agent, and Bill Leeson, a film maker. The rock musician Brian Eno describes both as \"heroic figures\" for being brave enough to go to Bosnia when bullets and bombs were flying and ethnic cleansing was at its height. It was launched at the Royal Festival Hall, London, during a three-day event at which the playwright Sir Tom Stoppard, its first patron, gave a reading. The charity's first big project was a mobile bakery in Bosnia that was feeding 15,000 people a week in east Mostar and frontline villages. Stoppard also describes their work as heroic: \"Here it was a bakery in the centre of the war zone - feeding people whether they were Muslims or orthodox Christians. It was a tremendous thing to do - when it was really needed in an area where nobody would go.\" The success of the bakery also led to their first contact with the world of pop. A radio report of the work of the mobile bakery persuaded Eno's partner, Anthea Norman-Taylor, to take a \u00a32,000 cheque to War Child's office. From those small beginnings, the charity's development snowballed. The music business became increasingly alarmed at the unfolding crisis in war-torn former Yugoslavia which led to the launch of a fundraising CD, Help. Brian Eno persuaded his megastar friends, like U2's Bono and the Edge, to stage a concert to raise money to get musical instruments and tapes to Sarajevo. But his biggest breakthrough was to convince the world-famous tenor, Luciano Pavarotti, to sing in the same concert as Bono at Modena in Italy in 1995. It was the first of three Modena concerts inspired by War Child. War Child's plans were upgraded. Instead of supplying musical instruments to Sarajevo, the charity decided to build a \u00a33m music therapy centre. \"It was like a dream come true,\" said David Wilson. But as the dream was realised, the problems began. The charity began to lose control of its new-found wealth. Money began pouring in from CD royalties and one of the co-founders, Bill Leeson, accepted a gift from the contractors of the music centre. The taking of the bribe - detailed on page one - shocked trustees. One, Elizabeth Huhne, said: \"It was anathema for me. I know this happens sometimes in business but we are running a charity. We must be completely above board.\" Berry Ritchie, a former chairman of trustees, said: \"I was appalled. It staggered me that anybody involved in a charitable exercise, particularly one of the founders, should actually consider that he was justified in taking the money.\" The fall-out was worse. After agreeing that Mr Leeson could stay, the trustees found themselves increasingly kept out of the picture. War Child UK was becoming increasingly ambitious, with sister organisations established in Holland, West Africa, Italy and the United States. Mr Ritchie said: \"It took us some time to realise we didn't know how much money was coming in. We certainly didn't know how much was being spent.\" Mrs Huhne said: \"It concerned me that at every meeting we had, we didn't have full financial reports. We could see the costs going up and up. It was like uncovering a can of worms every time you heard something.\" There were complaints about Lynne Kuschel - then a member of the management committee and now chief executive - taking trips to Sarajevo and flying club class to attend an embassy cocktail party, and Mike Terry, a consultant to the charity's Mostar music centre, flying club class to meet the Croatian deputy prime minister. War Child said its policy for both aid and fundraising trips has always been to spend as little as possible on flights and accommodation. The biggest row broke out over plans to send 19 employees to a concert for Liberian children organised by Pavarotti at Modena in 1998. Khawar Qureshi, a barrister in the chambers of Lord Neill (later to become chairman of the committee for standards in public life) who had taken over as chairman of trustees, warned at the time that this was excessive. \"We are working with public money for the public and are accountable to the public,\" he said in a memo sent on June 2 to Bill Leeson.

Problems were exacerbated when the patrons were belatedly informed in 1999 about the bribe and demanded action. Pavarotti demanded to see how much money had been spent on the Liberian project and accounts of all the money that had been ringfenced for the Mostar project. He was not happy and neither was Brian Eno. Figures supplied by Amela Saric, the music centre's present director in Mostar might explain why.

There was nothing half-hearted about the way he set about the Beethoven or the Etudes Symphoniques; it was take-it-or-leave-it stuff. I would rather have left most of it, or more positively have encouraged Saitkoulov to ponder late Beethoven for a bit longer before exploring it so publicly. After a nicely poised opening, the sonata fell apart, lacking a grasp of structure and any real comprehension of what the music is doing; the scherzo proceeded in disjointed flurries, the finale simply prosaically. There were no insights, original or second hand. The Schumann was equally unprepossessing - confined to a narrow dynamic range between mezzo-forte and fortissimo, and often muddled by over-pedalling. </p> <p>There were hopes that the Russian second half would be more idiomatic, and Saitkoulov's best playing of the evening did come in a couple of the Scriabin Studies, where he caught the febrile flickering perfectly, though in others he failed to give the floating, Chopin-esque lines full weight. </p> <p>But even here, and more pertinently in Stravinsky's Four Studies from 1908 - fascinating, rarely heard pre-Firebird pieces - the lack of a grip on tempo and how the speed of one section should relate to another was a serious flaw. In the Petrushka pieces that proved disastrous, as each of these magnificent showpieces was dismembered. One wonders whether Saitkoulov has heard Stravinsky's original orchestral score - had he done so he might have realised that some of the details he consigned to near inaudibility are actually important, and that getting round the notes (which was not convincingly achieved either) is not enough, especially when other considerations of phrasing, texture and coherence are ignored.</p>",

Without a record deal since their only single, the well-regarded Nothing, failed to breach radio playlists last summer, they have expanded into a quintet about whom something of a groundswell is developing. It is not hard to see why and, in their only moment of hubris, they elect not to play their sole familiar song. </p> <p>Always thoughtful, McCabe's other songs are endearingly frail, with well-toned melodies to the fore. Stepping Stones carries the weight of a less murky 4AD band and Complete Yourself could be the work of the late-1980s artpoppers Frazier Chorus. But the lovelorn 24-7, Only In Love (with its heavenly \"la-la\" interlude) and Nostalgia Rules, the first encore, are distinct. </p> <p>Jones performs the latter accompanied only by Booth's piano and looks terrified at having to present it in so unadorned a setting, but the quality of this tricky tale of life-ruining lost love carries her through. It all goes a little T'Pau on the floor-clearing Truth or Dare, but the defiant I'm Not Sorry is the sort of song Aimee Mann has been aspiring to since Whatever. </p> <p>Rather gauche, Jones has something of the nervous presence of Hazel O'Connor about her. Between songs she is lost, creating the awkward silences of the unpolished. Before Truth or Dare, she stands and sucks her thumb for want of something to do. </p> <p>Indeed, she never seems to relax until the final song, the anthemic No One's No One. Then she stops hunching and begins to soar, and the songs finally get the performance they deserve. Perhaps it should be their first song. </p> <p>Jones gets little visual help from her four backers (although the guitarist Sam Lewis would relish the opportunity to extend himself); having the rhythm section slouching at the back when their services are not called upon is as unfortunate as the synth-drums that dominate Complete Yourself. </p> <p>Still, these are early days for McCabe. The songs are there, the performances will evolve and with the right producer they will sell a lot of records.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost at the bottom of the pile are McCabe, based around the Warwick University dropouts Jill Jones and Matt Booth. Without a record deal since their only single, the well-regarded Nothing, failed to breach radio playlists last summer, they have expanded into a quintet about whom something of a groundswell is developing. It is not hard to see why and, in their only moment of hubris, they elect not to play their sole familiar song. Always thoughtful, McCabe's other songs are endearingly frail, with well-toned melodies to the fore. Stepping Stones carries the weight of a less murky 4AD band and Complete Yourself could be the work of the late-1980s artpoppers Frazier Chorus. But the lovelorn 24-7, Only In Love (with its heavenly \"la-la\" interlude) and Nostalgia Rules, the first encore, are distinct. Jones performs the latter accompanied only by Booth's piano and looks terrified at having to present it in so unadorned a setting, but the quality of this tricky tale of life-ruining lost love carries her through. It all goes a little T'Pau on the floor-clearing Truth or Dare, but the defiant I'm Not Sorry is the sort of song Aimee Mann has been aspiring to since Whatever. Rather gauche, Jones has something of the nervous presence of Hazel O'Connor about her. Between songs she is lost, creating the awkward silences of the unpolished. Before Truth or Dare, she stands and sucks her thumb for want of something to do. Indeed, she never seems to relax until the final song, the anthemic No One's No One. Then she stops hunching and begins to soar, and the songs finally get the performance they deserve. Perhaps it should be their first song. Jones gets little visual help from her four backers (although the guitarist Sam Lewis would relish the opportunity to extend himself); having the rhythm section slouching at the back when their services are not called upon is as unfortunate as the synth-drums that dominate Complete Yourself. Still, these are early days for McCabe. The songs are there, the performances will evolve and with the right producer they will sell a lot of records.",

      "body": "<p>It was 11.30pm on a cold Sunday evening when the phone rang. It had been a long shift, and the lone warehouse security guard was glad to hear a friendly voice. \"Hello, mate. What time do you open in the morning for deliveries?\" Just an HGV driver, obviously, probably working for himself. The security guard gave him directions to the warehouse. </p> <p>\"Is it better to get there early to beat the queue,\" asked the caller, \"or are there enough loading bays to cope with demand?\" The two fell into friendly conversation. \"I suppose things get busy in the mornings. How many loading bays have you got? And just out of interest, who else delivers to the warehouse?\" </p> <p>After a few more minutes of idle chat the caller hung up, and the security guard returned to his cup of tea and his newspaper. And in a small office in north London, the delivery driver replaced the receiver with satisfaction. Bingo. </p> <p>It is unlikely that the security guard ever realised the significance of the chat, or the value of the information he had so casually given away. Because the \"delivery driver\" was no such thing: he was, instead, an operative from Aware, an investigative consultancy hired by a competitor of the warehouse firm to find out its loading-bay capacity and the names of its major clients. </p> <p>The firm knew that demand for warehouse space in the area was likely to increase, but wanted to find out its competitors' capabilities before building an extension to its own premises. And all it took was one brief, friendly chat with a junior employee. </p> <p>Forget market research, strategic planning, supply chain management or whatever it was you thought made your company successful. Chances are - particularly if you work in telecommunications, or pharmaceuticals, or manufacturing, or just about any competitive environment - that your company is increasingly pinning its success on trying to work out exactly what its rivals are up to. And a growing number of consultants skilled in getting hold of that information are ready and willing to offer their services to give your company the competitive edge, by fair means or - occasionally - foul. </p> <p>This is the world of competitive intelligence, once seen as a rather shady side to corporate affairs, but increasingly viewed as a legitimate tool to help firms steal a march on their rivals. Most big American companies now have an internal CI unit, dedicated to analysing the competitive marketplace; they are likely also to use external investigators to complement this function. Fuld and Co, one of the oldest CI consultancies in the US, says it has advised more than half the Fortune 500 companies. </p> <p>The once whispered-about world of CI is increasingly overground and - like all good American innovations - over here. The Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP) now has 200 members in the UK - a fraction of its global membership of 7,000, but a figure which is steadily on the increase.

      "bodyText": "It was 11.30pm on a cold Sunday evening when the phone rang. It had been a long shift, and the lone warehouse security guard was glad to hear a friendly voice. \"Hello, mate. What time do you open in the morning for deliveries?\" Just an HGV driver, obviously, probably working for himself. The security guard gave him directions to the warehouse. \"Is it better to get there early to beat the queue,\" asked the caller, \"or are there enough loading bays to cope with demand?\" The two fell into friendly conversation. \"I suppose things get busy in the mornings. How many loading bays have you got? And just out of interest, who else delivers to the warehouse?\" After a few more minutes of idle chat the caller hung up, and the security guard returned to his cup of tea and his newspaper. And in a small office in north London, the delivery driver replaced the receiver with satisfaction. Bingo. It is unlikely that the security guard ever realised the significance of the chat, or the value of the information he had so casually given away. Because the \"delivery driver\" was no such thing: he was, instead, an operative from Aware, an investigative consultancy hired by a competitor of the warehouse firm to find out its loading-bay capacity and the names of its major clients. The firm knew that demand for warehouse space in the area was likely to increase, but wanted to find out its competitors' capabilities before building an extension to its own premises. And all it took was one brief, friendly chat with a junior employee. Forget market research, strategic planning, supply chain management or whatever it was you thought made your company successful. Chances are - particularly if you work in telecommunications, or pharmaceuticals, or manufacturing, or just about any competitive environment - that your company is increasingly pinning its success on trying to work out exactly what its rivals are up to. And a growing number of consultants skilled in getting hold of that information are ready and willing to offer their services to give your company the competitive edge, by fair means or - occasionally - foul. This is the world of competitive intelligence, once seen as a rather shady side to corporate affairs, but increasingly viewed as a legitimate tool to help firms steal a march on their rivals. Most big American companies now have an internal CI unit, dedicated to analysing the competitive marketplace; they are likely also to use external investigators to complement this function. Fuld and Co, one of the oldest CI consultancies in the US, says it has advised more than half the Fortune 500 companies. The once whispered-about world of CI is increasingly overground and - like all good American innovations - over here. The Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP) now has 200 members in the UK - a fraction of its global membership of 7,000, but a figure which is steadily on the increase. Most major telecoms and pharmaceuticals companies in Britain are now believed to have their own intelligence departments, while smaller firms in a competitive marketplace are likely to have a lone CI worker who keeps an eye on what other players are up to. In the knowledge economy, information is the commodity that really matters. \"The fundamental is that there are huge amounts at stake when you make business decisions these days,\" says Bill Waite, managing director and senior counsel at the Risk Advisory Group, which claims to be the biggest CI consultancy in Europe. \"The more you know, not only about your own strengths but about your competitors', the more likely it is that you will reach a positive business transaction rather than a negative one. So the pressure to obtain good information is increasing. It is becoming a very big business. More and more companies are starting to do this kind of work, including the major consultancy firms, who wouldn't have touched this area five years ago.\" There are good reasons why respected firms thought twice about developing intelligence-gathering wings, since activities falling into the broad category of competitive intelligence have not always earned the practice the most honourable of reputations. In May last year an executive from car giant General Motors was indicted on charges that in 1996 he stole secret GM documents, including plans for new car models, supplier prices and details of a new assembly operation called \"Plant X\", and turned them over to Volkswagen. The German manufacturer paid GM $100m in compensation three years ago. An employee working for a Canadian distributor of Gillette also paid heavily for sharing confidential information: he sold plans for Gillette's Mach-3 razor to arch-rivals Bic - and was jailed for 27 months for his efforts. CI practitioners scramble to distance themselves from this kind of behaviour, more accurately described as corporate espionage and unequivocally illegal in most countries. Nonetheless, they are still called upon frequently to defend themselves against charges that the practice inhabits the slightly grubby margins of ethical business dealings. This is doubtless because the juiciest examples of corporate information warfare - the ones that hit the headlines - invariably involve a level of intrigue that most chief executives would be embarrassed to admit to their shareholders. In the late 1980s, for instance, British Airways commissioned Kroll Associates, one of the biggest US-based corporate investigators, to look into rivals Air Europe as part of their well-documented \"dirty tricks\" against Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic. The larger airline was later forced to pay record libel damages to the entrepreneur. Larry Ellison, the chairman of software giant Oracle, felt no compunction in admitting in June that his company had used private detectives to snoop on contractors working for Microsoft. Ellison argued that it had been his \"civic duty\" to set investigators rummaging through the rubbish of the lobby group the Association for Competitive Technology, looking for evidence that Microsoft was paying the lobby group to influence its antitrust case.
