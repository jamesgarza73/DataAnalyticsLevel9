The idyll of the summer job abroad has powerful currency, especially during a dismal British July when the sun rarely shines. </p> <p>Then there is the reality.\"People don't realise that fruit picking is actually very painful,\" complains Bill Mayes, an accountant who spent five months orange-farming on a kibbutz. \"I wouldn't recommend it. Orange trees have thorns about three inches long.\" </p> <p>There it is, the glaring gap between the expectations of the uninitiated summer worker who imagines his three-month contract to be some kind of paid holiday in the sun and his employer who regards him as someone who is, well, there to work. It is inevitable that even the most interesting overseas job will be complicated by the realities of day-to-day living. Thorns, heatstroke and other practicalities tend to be overlooked in the early stages of grand conceptualisation. </p> <p>\"We worked half in English and half in Icelandic,\" says Abigail Webb-Sear, a medical student who spent part of last summer on work experience in Reykjavik. \"The main problem in theatre was that the Icelandic word for scissors is 'klips', so I never knew whether to cut or clip. One nasty moment ended with me getting what seemed like litres of blood in my eye.\" </p> <p>If life is the pursuit of good anecdotes, however, the joy of reliving them afterwards compensates for the difficulties of working abroad. \"It gives people the chance to experience a different way of life,\" says David Woodworth, editor of Summer Jobs Abroad. \"If all you want is to make money, you should get a job at McDonald's and have your parents feed you for nothing. But working abroad you can experience a different culture, taste different foods, meet new people and get a bit of sunshine along the way.\" </p> <p>This is the advice Woodworth dispenses to students, although more than half of migrant workers are fully fledged adults. \"There is one employer I know of who specifically asks for retired couples,\" he says. \"There are people who make their careers out of doing shift work around the world, spending the winters in ski resorts and the summers on cruise liners.\" </p> <p>Veterans of the circuit learn to read between the lines of the job advertisements. To the less experienced, it is more a matter of luck. Simon Shaw, a law student, realised that his employers hadn't been entirely truthful almost as soon as he began his job at a summer camp in Pennsylvania. \"We were told that we would be working six to eight hours a day, but we ended up working 14-hour days. And they wouldn't let us out of the camp until 9.30pm. The manager was only interested in making money. He told us that we meant nothing to him, that we were pieces of shit and that he could replace us any time he wanted.\" </p> <p>The treatment of deserters was similarly harsh: \"If anyone decided to leave, they were locked in an isolation room and forbidden to talk to anyone. They were then driven out of the camp and summarily dumped somewhere along the road - they had to make their own way on from there.\" </p> <p>Working in a first-world country otherwise renowned for generally high standards of employee care is no guarantee of job satisfaction. \"There was no hygiene supervision in the kitchens,\" says Shaw. \"We weren't trained how to use the kitchen equipment. One worker was using the meat slicer to chop cucumbers and got his fingers too close to the blade. He sliced about half a centimetre off the end of his finger, which then fell into the pile of cucumbers. It stayed there for a good 10 minutes before anyone thought to take it out. Then they picked it out and served up the cucumbers anyway.\" </p> <p>Many of the most enticing summer jobs abroad entail charity work in far-flung corners of the globe. They offer the advantage of knowing that your six weeks working for pennies in a flea-ridden death trap is for the greater good of mankind. It's mere detail if the greater good of mankind actually involves teaching Vietnamese schoolchildren the names of the Manchester United squad. \"We were only there for a few weeks,\" says Zara Jay, who spent a summer at a children's shelter in Zimbabwe, \"so it was easier for us to do things creatively and imaginatively. The teachers were quite happy to sit back and let us run the show - we would come in the morning and they would say: 'Right, you're doing this class. Now, go!'\" </p> <p>\"All the men kept coming up to me and expecting me to sleep with them,\" says Jay. \"I think Hollywood cinema has given them this image of all westerners as sex-crazed. People were constantly asking me for sex. It was very unnerving.\" </p> <p>At least she was able to get to know Zimbabweans. \"I thought that the best way to experience a country would be to work with the locals,\" says Simon Shaw, of his three-month culinary nightmare at the Pennsylvania summer camp. \"But most of the people I was working with were English. There were only two Americans. One had just come out of prison for armed robbery, and the other kept a gun in his bunk.\" </p> <p>Meeting and working with local people is more difficult than might be imagined. Working behind a bar in Ibiza has great appeal for the die-hard hedonist, but is likely to offer decidedly few opportunities for cross-cultural understanding (of the intellectual variety). \"Go off the beaten track,\" suggests Bill Mayes. \"The further out you are, the fewer English people there are likely to be.\" </p> <p>Mayes, a seasoned overseas worker, believes that the benefits of an overseas job are more easily gained through speculative job-hunting than pre-arranged employment. \"I had a return ticket, a work visa, enough money to keep me going, and an idea that I wanted to work in the desert, and I ended up with a wonderful job cleaning boats in Utah. I was living in an unbelievably beautiful place and working alongside disaffected Mormons and Navajo Indians from a nearby reserve.\" But, he warns, prospective workers should have some idea of what sort of work they are looking for. </p> <p>\"The year before that, I ended up working on the worst mini-golf course in South Carolina. It looked so unappealing we would have only three people playing during the first three hours of the day. The only entertainment came when every so often someone would get knocked on the head by baseballs from the nearby batting cage, and had to be rushed to hospital.\" </p> <p>As with any job at home, luck is a factor in how well things go. \"The best practical advice if you're looking for overseas work,\" recommends David Woodworth, \"is to obtain as many details from employers as you can. Speak to someone who has done the job before, to find out what it's really like.\" </p> <p>If all else fails, you can console yourself with the fact that no one back home knows that waiting tables in Marseille is about as exciting as waiting tables in Margate.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Composers' Ensemble<br> ***</strong><br> Hoxton Hall, London</p> <p>There is a wilful abrasiveness about the music of Dutch composer Louis Andriessen that produces some of his most memorable work - but it is also responsible for some of its most perplexing aspects. In the ensemble piece Zilver, performed at the first of the Hoxton New Music Days' Andriessen showcase, a tune is played slowly and smoothly by a clarinet, flute, cello and violin. At the same time, tuned percussion and piano create a completely opposed texture of loud, short chords that steadily become faster. The piece is about the interaction of these two kinds of material, which fuse together shortly before the end before drifting into their own, individual worlds. </p> <p>Zilver magnifies one of Andriessen's central concerns: the investigation of how time flows in music. The speeding-up process of the percussion group is simple, but it produces complex rhythmic relationships. Meanwhile, it is the texture of music of the wind and string instruments that is problematic. The particular sound of these four solo instruments is liable to seem uncomfortable, their combined timbre positively disconcerting. </p> <p>Andriessen's choice of forces turns Zilver into a listening experience that eschews comfort at all costs. It is as if he wants to make his audience forcefully aware of his techniques of construction, rather than creating an artful or beautiful surface result. </p> <p>At that level, Andriessen's music is fascinatingly anti-bourgeois, something emphasised through a wonderful moment of audience participation in the second concert of the showcase. Together, audience and performers sang an unforgettably catchy street-song, which Andriessen wrote as an effort to reclaim the right to busk in Amsterdam. </p> <p>The rest of the concert featured piano pieces that Andriessen composed as gifts for friends. Paradoxically, in the intimacy and unforced artistry of these menuets, romances and berceuses, Andriessen seemed to speak with as much - if not more - directness than in the works of the earlier programme. There was a distilled magic in the beautiful chiming of Andriessen's Deuxi\u00e8me Chorale for music box: precisely the quality that seemed so consciously suppressed in Zilver.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Composers' Ensemble *** Hoxton Hall, London There is a wilful abrasiveness about the music of Dutch composer Louis Andriessen that produces some of his most memorable work - but it is also responsible for some of its most perplexing aspects. In the ensemble piece Zilver, performed at the first of the Hoxton New Music Days' Andriessen showcase, a tune is played slowly and smoothly by a clarinet, flute, cello and violin. At the same time, tuned percussion and piano create a completely opposed texture of loud, short chords that steadily become faster. The piece is about the interaction of these two kinds of material, which fuse together shortly before the end before drifting into their own, individual worlds. Zilver magnifies one of Andriessen's central concerns: the investigation of how time flows in music. The speeding-up process of the percussion group is simple, but it produces complex rhythmic relationships. Meanwhile, it is the texture of music of the wind and string instruments that is problematic. The particular sound of these four solo instruments is liable to seem uncomfortable, their combined timbre positively disconcerting. Andriessen's choice of forces turns Zilver into a listening experience that eschews comfort at all costs. It is as if he wants to make his audience forcefully aware of his techniques of construction, rather than creating an artful or beautiful surface result. At that level, Andriessen's music is fascinatingly anti-bourgeois, something emphasised through a wonderful moment of audience participation in the second concert of the showcase. Together, audience and performers sang an unforgettably catchy street-song, which Andriessen wrote as an effort to reclaim the right to busk in Amsterdam. The rest of the concert featured piano pieces that Andriessen composed as gifts for friends. Paradoxically, in the intimacy and unforced artistry of these menuets, romances and berceuses, Andriessen seemed to speak with as much - if not more - directness than in the works of the earlier programme. There was a distilled magic in the beautiful chiming of Andriessen's Deuxi\u00e8me Chorale for music box: precisely the quality that seemed so consciously suppressed in Zilver.",

I weigh 17st and I've kept it at that for the past year or so ... My back injury is something I've had since I was 14 when I was skinny as a rake.\" </p> <p>But David Lloyd, who signed him for Lancashire and knows him better than most, felt compelled to write: \"The time is fast approaching when he sits down with the people who matter and goes through a self-assessment of what he wants to achieve and how to go about it.

Two winters ago, before the England A tour to Kenya and Sri Lanka, Flintoff failed an undemanding fitness test and was forced into the humiliation of retesting. He just scraped through, but the board's displeasure was communicated in writing. </p> <p>Then last winter he broke his left foot while bowling in the fourth test in Cape Town. No warning, it just went. Now, for the second time in a couple of weeks, his back has gone. </p> <p>Saying that excess weight has no bearing on these injuries is as fatuous as it is fanciful. No one has suggested that the back injury was directly caused by being fat (although the jury is out on the fractured foot) but ask any orthopaedic surgeon whether carrying too much weight affects the chances of such an injury recurring and see what the response is. </p> <p>There has been effort. In the aftermath of the foot injury Flintoff underwent a training programme under Steve Hampson, the former Great Britain rugby league full-back. His fitness levels rose and his weight fell. </p> <p>This season, however, his weight has reportedly increased again by up to a stone, and that is unacceptable both in terms of fitness and conveying his desire and commitment to becoming a successful international sportsman. </p> <p>Lancashire's protective stance is doing him no favours. Everyone recognises a massive talent but to fulfil it he needs to be helped, not defended. </p> <p>The England management are trying to be proactive and might resort to making his fitness records public, in the hope that it will shame him into laying off the beer and fast food.

The computer-generated image is the likeness of a man seen with a young girl fitting Sarah's description at a service station, and police believe it could be the most significant lead yet in the ten-day inquiry. Chief inspector Mike Alderson, the inquiry team spokesman, said he believed it would narrow down the search for the man, who was spotted with the girl at the Granada Services, Knutsford, on the M6 motorway. Earlier today a police helicopter was called out after an unconfirmed sighting of the youngster with a man in south Wales. The police search in South Wales centred around the village of Cilfynydd, just north of Pontypridd following a call from a member of the public this morning. A spokeswoman for South Wales police said: \"We're carrying out local inquiries in the area. Officers are going house to house, speaking to local shopkeepers and schools. The police helicopter was launched but a sweep of the area proved negative. We would like to stress at this point it is still just a possible sighting of Sarah.\" Detectives revealed earlier that they had received 800 calls from the public since another possible sighting at a service station in Cheshire. At a press conference at Littlehampton police station, officers also said there had been some possible sightings as far afield as Greece and Israel. Assistant chief constable Nigel Yeo said of the Cheshire sighting that they had so far not been contacted by the man who was seen with the \"upset\" young girl or any of his friends or relatives. Meanwhile, a 14-year-old boy charged with wasting the time of police officers involved in the search for missing eight-year-old Sarah Payne has been remanded in care. The boy, who cannot be named, has appeared at Chichester magistrates court charged with causing the wasteful employment of the police by pretending to have information relevant to a police inquiry. It is alleged the boy made a malicious phone call to the police inquiry team leading the hunt for Sarah in which he claimed to have seen the youngster. He was remanded in the care of the local authority until Thursday, when he is due back at Chichester magistrates court.",

When we went to university in Britain in the 1970s, only one in 15 people did so. Now more than a quarter of the youth population does. Yet public funding per student has collapsed. It is down nearly 50% in real terms since 1980. This is unsustainable. </p> <p>Second, British universities are no longer world-leaders. They do not pay remotely competitive salaries, and morale is low. Being an academic in Britain is now, in many universities, a pretty rotten job. The best and the brightest in our land can no longer afford to become a university lecturer. One option is to quit academia; another is to join the brain drain and move abroad (as one of us decided to do), usually to the United States, where universities are well funded and where both salaries and job satisfaction are high. This is bad news for Britain. </p> <p>Third, and perhaps the worst of all, the taxpayer does not care. The reason is that the beneficiaries of higher education are the students themselves. Having good primary schooling and a better health service helps everyone in society. That is not true - repeat not true - of higher education. </p> <p>The people who get degrees are the ones who benefit. Yet, currently, they are massively cross-subsidised by the rest of society. It is simply not reasonable to ask the carpenters and secretaries to stump up. Students should pay for themselves. </p> <p>So the question is: what do we do next? The Greenaway report considers the options. It is particularly keen to foster wide access to higher education - in other words, to think of a way to get clever children from poor backgrounds into higher education. The report points out that at the moment Britain is very bad at that. </p> <p>Our current system produces a huge transfer of money from poor people (though many of them are unaware of it) to rich people. It is grossly regressive. As in America, Britain should do the reverse and make rich students cross-subsidise the poor - the most obvious way is to have generous scholarship funds and even subsidised loan schemes. We strongly support that. Far too much talent is wasted at the moment in this country. How do you fund these scholarships and provide the universities with additional funding to recruit and retain high-quality staff? </p> <p>The only viable option, in our view, is to make the beneficiaries pay the true cost of their education. Universities should be allowed to set whatever fees the market will bear - some will be able to set fees high - perhaps even as high as \u00a310,000 per annum - because of the high quality of their product. If the price is too high for the product on offer, the students will not show up. Most fees will be much lower. </p> <p>The Greenaway report recommends that we move to such a system, and we must. Big chunks of the money raised this way from those who can afford to pay could then be used to encourage children from the lowest social class groups, who attend ordinary state schools, to go to university. This is what happens in US Ivy League schools such as Dartmouth. </p> <p>An indication of the level of the fees likely to emerge is to be found in the US, where a large and diverse private market exists alongside a (subsidised) public system. Undergraduate tuition fees (excluding board and lodging) in US private Ivy League universities such as Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth and Yale are around \u00a316,000 per annum for a four-year degree. </p> <p>What is probably less well known in the UK is that, in the US, high fees are not confined to the elite Ivy League universities. Literally hundreds of other colleges and universities in the United States charge high fees. </p> <p>For example, in the state of Massachusetts, which is home to both Harvard and MIT, 41 universities charge tuition of more than \u00a310,000 per annum. Such students could have attended the University of Massachusetts, which is public, at any of its five main campuses for a fee of around \u00a33,000 per annum. Yet they are investing wisely in themselves. </p> <p>There is no reason why the bus drivers and lathe operators of Britain should have to pay for university funding. Fairness and common sense dictate that students should pay their own bills - supplemented by scholarships for children who come from low-income homes.</p> <p>\u0095 David Blanchflower, professor of Economics and associate dean of the social sciences, Dartmouth College, US, and Andrew Oswald, professor of economics, Warwick University, UK.

It is particularly keen to foster wide access to higher education - in other words, to think of a way to get clever children from poor backgrounds into higher education. The report points out that at the moment Britain is very bad at that. Our current system produces a huge transfer of money from poor people (though many of them are unaware of it) to rich people. It is grossly regressive. As in America, Britain should do the reverse and make rich students cross-subsidise the poor - the most obvious way is to have generous scholarship funds and even subsidised loan schemes. We strongly support that. Far too much talent is wasted at the moment in this country. How do you fund these scholarships and provide the universities with additional funding to recruit and retain high-quality staff? The only viable option, in our view, is to make the beneficiaries pay the true cost of their education. Universities should be allowed to set whatever fees the market will bear - some will be able to set fees high - perhaps even as high as \u00a310,000 per annum - because of the high quality of their product. If the price is too high for the product on offer, the students will not show up. Most fees will be much lower. The Greenaway report recommends that we move to such a system, and we must. Big chunks of the money raised this way from those who can afford to pay could then be used to encourage children from the lowest social class groups, who attend ordinary state schools, to go to university. This is what happens in US Ivy League schools such as Dartmouth. An indication of the level of the fees likely to emerge is to be found in the US, where a large and diverse private market exists alongside a (subsidised) public system. Undergraduate tuition fees (excluding board and lodging) in US private Ivy League universities such as Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth and Yale are around \u00a316,000 per annum for a four-year degree. What is probably less well known in the UK is that, in the US, high fees are not confined to the elite Ivy League universities. Literally hundreds of other colleges and universities in the United States charge high fees. For example, in the state of Massachusetts, which is home to both Harvard and MIT, 41 universities charge tuition of more than \u00a310,000 per annum. Such students could have attended the University of Massachusetts, which is public, at any of its five main campuses for a fee of around \u00a33,000 per annum. Yet they are investing wisely in themselves. There is no reason why the bus drivers and lathe operators of Britain should have to pay for university funding. Fairness and common sense dictate that students should pay their own bills - supplemented by scholarships for children who come from low-income homes. \u0095 David Blanchflower, professor of Economics and associate dean of the social sciences, Dartmouth College, US, and Andrew Oswald, professor of economics, Warwick University, UK.

Setting aside one school which has been merged, we looked at the remaining 50 for the signs of success which are celebrated by the education secretary.</p> <p>We found that in the year before they went into special measures, on average only 13.24% of pupils were scoring at least five A to C grades at GCSE, the government's chosen measure of academic success. This was seriously low. Mr Blunkett announced in March that he would consider closing any school which failed to deliver at least 15% A to C grades.

Among the 50, there are some who have moved upwards sharply: St Mary and St Joseph's in Bexley was scoring 35% A to Cs and now scores 45%; Hayes Manor in Hillingdon was scoring 18% and now scores 27%; Fairham in Nottingham has moved from 17% to 25%. Almost all of the 50 schools now have fewer students who fail to pass a single GCSE at any level (only six have deteriorated in this respect). Clearly, there is some genuine improvement.</p> <p>However, the signs of continuing failure are striking. On Mr Blunkett's own 15% benchmark, 21 of these success stories are liable to be closed down: 14 of them are not even scoring 10% (one school scores only 2%, two others score 4%). Nearly a third of them have actually declined: 16 are turning in results for A to C grades which are worse than they were before they went in.</p> <p>The signs of failure touch even the most renowned success story. Northicote school in Wolverhampton was the first secondary school ever put into special measures, in November 1993, and when it emerged two years later, it was greeted with a chorus of official acclaim.

Phoenix school in Hammersmith has done everything which Mr Blunkett could ask to improve its teaching and management. Last year, Ofsted reported that five years after the school went into special measures, the leadership of its headteacher was \"excellent\" and 60% of the lessons were either good, very good or excellent. And yet despite this, the number of children at the school who scored five A to C grades at GCSE last year was only 5%. In the year before the school went into special measures, it was more than three times higher at 17%.</p> <p>Anyone at Phoenix school can tell Mr Blunkett that this happened because the school was damaged directly by being put into special measures in 1994. This triggered a rash of publicity which created an immediate flight of teachers and of parents of motivated children. This left classes to be taught by supply teachers and drained many of the most able children from the new intake in September. The school's results immediately started to slide, from 17% to 11% in 1994 and then 5% in 1995.</p> <p>For those schools which fare particularly badly in special measures, Mr Blunkett has created the Fresh Start programme, in which the school is closed and its entire staff is sacked before it is re-opened with a new name, a new head and a new staff. In March, he declared that \"our Fresh Start policy is already being used by LEAs to tackle failing schools and is beginning to have an impact\". A month later, he referred to the scheme again as an example of \"rapid progress\" in tackling failure and added: \"A successful example of this is Firfield school in Newcastle\".</p> <p>However, Firfield has since been caught out by Channel 4 News and its \"superhead\" has resigned. Our understanding is that the LEA is now planning to take this \"successful example\" and close it down.</p> <p>Most of the nine other Fresh Starts have also run into trouble. In Hull, Kingswood has seen 23 of its 50 teachers, including four heads of department, hand in their notice since the school went into Fresh Start last September. Riverdeen in Nottingham is expecting only half of their Year Seven places to be filled in September. Bishopsford in Merton, south London, has recruited only 60% of the new pupils it hoped for.</p> <p>In Brighton, the new College of Media Arts similarly lost 18 of its 58 staff within two terms of its Fresh Start, before also losing its headteacher and its chair of governors.</p> <p>None of this failure should surprise Mr Blunkett.

In December of that year, the American Federation of Teachers described the initiative as \"politically popular but educationally bankrupt\". Even Gary Orfield, who chaired the committee of experts which launched the San Francisco experiment, now recognises the limits of reconstitution.

All of them had three things in common: they were all studying Macbeth for GCSE English; they had all turned in essays to be assessed as part of their GCSE; and not one of them had written a single word of any of the essays, because their teacher (with a little help from her husband) had spent the weekend writing the whole lot for them.</p> <p>This teacher says that routinely she writes her students' coursework and that a lot of her colleagues do the same. \"I do it for two reasons. First, you give the kid a chance and second, you don't get beaten over the head. Otherwise, you get the blame for the fact that the kids don't do any work, or don't even turn up, and for the fact that the national curriculum is crap and doesn't do anything for a load of kids. You are bullied. The bullying of staff by senior management in schools is appalling.\"</p> <p>Welcome to the other side of David Blunkett's drive for higher standards, to the world of tests and targets, where the career prospects of a teacher or the future of a school can be broken by one bad set of statistics, a world where teachers have been taught to fear failure with such an intensity that they have learned to cut corners to survive. Welcome to the Big Cheat.</p> <p>We have spoken to teachers, headteachers, local education authority (LEA) advisers, Ofsted inspectors, officials and leaders of teacher unions, and we have not found a single one of them who has not heard of some kind of cheating to deliver the figures required.</p> <p>The cheating goes far beyond GCSE coursework - to multiple fiddles on standard assessment tasks (Sats) and GCSEs, to the wholesale fabrication of figures on truancy and attendance, to the falsification of records on excluded children. It is certain that not all teachers have been driven to cheat; equally, our evidence suggests the fiddling is widespread.</p> <p>The significance of the Big Cheat is not simply that the official figures are infected with fiction. Beneath the fiddling, there is little doubt that in the last 10 years there has been some real advance in the standards achieved in Britain's state schools. The more important point is that it is yet another sign of the enduring weakness of Labour's attack on poor standards, that its underlying analysis of failure is mistaken, with the result that its strategy repeatedly evades the real problems and imposes the entire burden of change on teachers and managers.</p> <p>As this Guardian series has previously shown, the most important single factor in a school's failure to hit academic targets is its intake of children and, in particular, of the 30% of Britain's children who live with the damaging effects of poverty. The government swats this aside with its mantra that \"poverty is no excuse\" and continues with Kenneth Baker's [the former education secretary] market in school places, even though it penalises the schools with the most impoverished intake.</p> <p>Beyond that, school failure reflects financial limits - large classes, scarce equipment, poor buildings, stressed teachers. As we revealed in March, this government has lied about the amount of extra money which it is investing in schools. Failing effectively to tackle these underlying problems, the government has inflicted overwhelming pressure on teachers and managers to deliver all the necessary change themselves.</p> <p>There is no doubt that there was room for teachers and managers to improve - but they alone cannot deliver a change on the scale demanded. And so, some of those who have the most difficult intakes of children and/or the most stifling financial problems have learned to cheat to survive. As one West Country teacher put it: \"We all know the system is ridiculous but we don't do anything about it. It's just a game we play.\" Or, to be precise, a collection of games.</p> <p>Take, for example, the Truancy Game. The object is to make your attendance figures look good. This has been important since the mid 1990s when Ofsted (the Office for Standards in Education) started to log attendance as an indicator of a school's progress and the Department for Education and Employment (DFEE) started to publish annual figures. Now it has become an even higher priority: David Blunkett has announced that by the year 2002, schools must reduce the number of days lost to truancy by 30%. Schools who fail to hit their targets are liable to lose funds.</p> <p>In the truancy game, points are scored by obliterating the evidence of unauthorised absences, and players can score these points in two simple ways: by pretending that an absent child was really in the school, or by admitting that the child was absent but pretending that there was a legitimate reason.</p> <p>There are some who like to wait for the end of term and then spend a whole day on the figures, like this senior teacher at a secondary school in an inner city area: \"At the end of term, if you've got less than, say, 92%, which is your attendance target, then you go right back through the register and you start putting in 'present'. You can do it with the new electronic registers just the same. Sometimes it's the head who says to the person who's doing the returns, to work on the figures, sort of 'we need our attendance at such and such, so make sure we get there'.</p> <p>\"It's a lot of work; you have to write in loads of 'presents'. You think about it: if the school has been doing two registers a day, it comes to about 150,000 attendances in one term, and if you find out you've only got 87% and you need 92 or 93%, you've got to put in about 7,000 extra 'presents'. It takes ages.\"</p> <p>Other players prefer to keep the ball rolling all through the term, with a little fiddling each day, usually by pretending that somebody like a parent or a doctor has authorised a child to be absent, as numerous teachers explained: \"You just write 'letter sent' or 'letter received', or it could have been a phone call ... You can use religious holidays ... No one checks, you just say the absence was authorised.\" Other fiddles are opportunistic. \"We had to close the school for the day, because the heating broke down so we put it down as 100% attendance ... We have children in the behaviour unit who often only get taught for half the day but it gets put down as a whole day.\"</p> <p><b> No control</b><br></p> <p>The game is so widespread that it is scarcely secret at all. Here is a former headteacher, now a nationally respected expert on the improvement of schools: \"I know that schools have fixed the attendance figures and I believe the government cannot be unaware of it.\" Or here is one of Ofsted's registered inspectors, formerly a senior LEA official: \"Fiddling attendance figures is dead common. It's easy.\" Or this school clerk from the East Midlands: \"We fiddle them because we have absolutely no control over how many children come to school.\" Or the deputy head from east London: \"I don't feel any shame about it at all. There is no other way to do it. And that's the truth. Everybody does it.\"</p> <p>For those who prefer something with a little more skill and imagination, the government has also organised the Great Exclusion Game. Just as with truancy, Mr Blunkett has set a target for the number of excluded children to be cut by 30% by 2002 with the threat of financial penalties for those who fail.</p> <p>So, the trick here is to exclude children without admitting it. \"It's 'jump before you're pushed'. You get hold of the parent and you say 'If you leave him here, we're going to have to kick him out, it'll be on his record for ever and he'll never get a job, so why don't you take him out yourself before it happens?' It usually works.\" Some headteachers call this 'cleansing': just about nobody admits that they are doing it, but just about everybody knows somebody else who has.</p> <p>Jenny Price, of the Association for Education Welfare Managers, told us: \"Children whose faces don't fit, children who will never get the required number of A to C grades or whose behaviour is disruptive: these children are removed off rolls. You cannot believe how easy it is. Nobody follows it up, nobody chases it.\"</p> <p>It is, in fact, the oldest trick in the current Big Cheat book, and officials in the education department and the social exclusion unit admit that it has been happening. A few players show signs of real ingenuity, like Firfield School in Newcastle which was caught out by Channel 4 News last year arranging for the parents of regular truants to sign letters offering to educate their children at home. The parents had no such intention and said they signed the letters simply because they were told to.</p> <p>A temporary exclusion is just as easy and, by all accounts, just as widespread: \"You just phone the parents up and say 'We're sending him home and we don't want him back till Tuesday'. They just accept it. It's usually because there's been some pretty bad incident, so they're not going to argue about it. We don't log it as an exclusion, so it doesn't count as one. The only problem is that if we want to go for a 45-day exclusion, we can't do it, because we haven't recorded all the others.\" As a variation, children are told to come in for half days only.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the most demanding play is seen in the Exam Games. Sats have become a central part of school life, the raw material for the league tables which, despite widespread acknowledgement of their failure to tell the truth about schools, have become firmly lodged as the key indicator of a school's success with critical implications for future enrolment and funding. The pressure from the DFEE has been intense since the secretary of state announced that he would resign if by 2002 he could not get 80% of 11-year-olds to reach level four in English and 75% of them in maths. There is almost no pattern to the play in Sats, more like an orgy of improvisation as different teachers slip through different loopholes in search of ways to meet the pressure.</p> <p><b> Loopholes</b><br></p> <p>Some of the loopholes are more or less legitimate, encouraged even: extra classes to prepare children for the tests; practice work on last year's papers, which are be ing sold in increasing quantities; the teaching of specific test-related skills, such as the layout and style for writing a letter, which is a regular question in English tests. The DFEE says much of this is simply part of improving literacy and numeracy, and they supply \u00a342m for \"booster classes\" for children approaching Sats. However, in a narrow distinction, they also say that they do not recommend \"cramming or teaching to the test\" and there are many teachers who say that this whole focus on Sats is a perversion of education.</p> <p>Some of the loopholes are more controversial, albeit they fall short of outright cheating: teachers who tell children that Sats are \"the most important exams you'll ever take\" and that their future sets will depend on them; the headteacher who wanders around the exam room, suggesting \"You might want to have another look at that answer\"; the English teacher who supplies a list of \"wizard words\" - sophisticated, unusual words - for the children to memorise so they can scatter them throughout their English answers; invigilators who ignore the clock and let children have as much time as they want to complete the test.</p> <p>Then there are the loopholes which everyone knows amount to cheating. We spoke to some of those who mark Sats and who see the clues in the answers: the school where every single child used almost exactly the same form of words to describe how shadows are made; the incorrect answers which have been crossed out and replaced with correct ones; the school whose children reproduced the wording from an official answer sheet; the papers where tick boxes are filled out in a hand that is stronger and neater than that on the written parts of the paper.</p> <p>The markers say they are supposed to report evidence of malpractice. They all said they didn't: too much hassle; their own marking would then have to be checked; they felt some solidarity with the classroom teachers. Some said they had made reports but that their anxieties had been dismissed.</p> <p>Then we spoke to teachers and headteachers who explained how it is done. Mostly, they talked about the Main Trick, the numerous different ways in which teachers can get an early sight of the test papers. This turns out to be rather simple. Eighty per cent of the 11,000 Sats markers are teachers and, in order to standardise the marking, the examination boards have to give them access to the papers 10 days before the exam. In the same way, the exam boards also employ a further 1,100 teachers as team leaders who tour the country lecturing markers and who get to see the papers 24 days before they are officially revealed; others work as consultants who help the qualifications and curriculum agency (QCA) to set the papers and who know the rough contents of the papers 12 months in advance.</p> <p>The QCA and the DFEE both told us emphatically that this causes no problem. There is no system for checking the behaviour of markers, team leaders or consultants. \"We don't see this as a loophole,\" a QCA spokesman said. The teachers who see the advance papers beg to differ. Some said simply that it took a will of iron to say nothing to their colleagues or to their students; others admitted priming their pupils and some that they had applied for these positions precisely so that they would be able to get early sight of the papers and prepare their children accordingly.</p> <p>At the conference of the National Union of Teachers in April, there was open talk in the bars about the (supposedly secret) contents of the papers to be sat in May. We were told, for example: \"Everyone's been told the key stage two children have to know all about walls - Vietnam Wall, Great Wall of China and so on. Apparently, there's a whole section on that.\" Sure enough, the English Sats paper which was unveiled in mid-May included a section where children had to absorb and reproduce information about famous walls, Vietnam, China etc.</p> <p>Armed with this information, teachers can simply prime their children or even persuade them to memorise set answers. A school governor in Yorkshire wrote to us that his headteacher had \"heard stories about schools teaching pupils the answers to the actual questions; schools that put up the answers on classroom walls in the guise of educational aids; schools where teachers check papers as they are being written and make sure that answers are correct before they are handed in.\"</p> <p>Beyond this, every headteacher in the country is sent the Sats papers a week or 10 days before their students are due to sit them. Headteachers told us there was little chance of being caught if they did open papers in advance.</p> <p><b> Spot checks</b><br></p> <p>Barry Dawson, chair of the National Primary Headteachers' Association, which supports the use of Sats but opposes league tables, said: \"Heads and teachers are under such pressure that inevitably some will be tempted to bend the rules, and the current system is not rigorous enough to stop this. There is not anything like a rigorous system to check whether the tests have been opened or whether the tests are administered fairly.\"</p> <p>LEAs carry out spot checks to make sure that the papers are not opened in advance, and the DFEE told us that \"the incidence of the QCA finding anything untoward is so low as to be inexpressible\". However, the LEAs are short of inspectors, and the QCA acknowledges that the reality is that 90% of schools receive no spot check when they sit Sats. Heads have to sign a declaration that they will keep the Sats papers secure, but there is no set punishment for a head who is caught out, and the QCA has dealt with cases where the LEA decided to take no action against heads who broke the declaration.</p> <p>A headteacher in Sheffield has just been suspended after a colleague accused her of \"irregularities in the administration of Sats exams\". Another in Essex felt so guilty after talking to pupils about the contents of the papers which they were to sit, that he reported himself to the chair of governors and resigned. In Devon, a headteacher resigned last year after being accused by a colleague of similar behaviour (although the LEA there has done its best to conceal the incident). Just as with the truancy game, there is a strong suggestion that this is an open secret.</p> <p>An HM inspector who retired last year after some 20 years in the job said he had seen \"ridiculous and dishonest pursuits\" to improve Sats results. An Ofsted-registered inspector said: \"Secondary heads usually know which primary heads are fiddling because the children arrive and cannot work to the level of their Sats results. Fiddling at key stage two is probably pretty widespread. The policing is very weak.\"</p> <p>The difficulty is that fiddling is contagious, like steroids among athletes: if one teacher does well by cheating, the straight teacher looks worse than ever and is under more pressure than ever to conform to the new line.</p> <p>GCSEs are better policed than Sats and the evidence is that cheating by teachers is less common. Nevertheless it happens. We found secondary school teachers who are routinely writing the coursework which counts towards their students' GCSE results. If there are drawings to do, they produce them, and the children stencil or copy them; if there are essays, the teachers produce them and either print them up with different typefaces or ask children to write them out in long hand. \"Some of them know why I'm asking them to write things out. With some of them, I just say 'Can you do me a favour? Write this out, I want to put it on the wall'.\"</p> <p>Teachers put long hours into doing their students' work for them: \"I taught GNVQ business and admin to 11 kids, the average attendance for the class was 63%. I'm between a rock and a hard place. If I don't do the coursework, I'm going to get zero passes. And no one is going to say 'Oh, that's understandable'. So I did everything I could; I bit the bullet. They had to do three different elements with three different modules: I was creating itineraries for them, I made up interviews they had done with people in business, wrote letters they were supposed to have sent to businesses, everything I could.\"</p> <p>And there are some subtle manipulations. A recently retired secondary head told us: \"If you are clever, you can improve your GCSE results by picking the right exam board for the right subjects. There are different pass rates and you can make quite a difference to your outcomes without making any difference at all to the children's education.\" Apparently on the same logic, more schools are taking drama GCSEs because they are said to be easy route to an A to C grade; and some are dropping German and Spanish as their second modern language and starting to teach Mandarin Chinese as an easier grade-scoring option.</p> <p>The DFEE and the QCA both assured us that there was no problem with the exam results, paradoxically producing a cacophony of confessors admitting their \"crimes\" while the police insist that they are innocent. This may reflect the further new conflict of interest, that these exams now test not only the schools as well as the students, but also the performance of the DFEE, whose secretary of state has staked his career on raising standards.</p> <p><b> Conflicting evidence</b><br></p> <p>Finally, there is conflicting evidence on whether the government is not merely enjoying the results of this cheating but actively stimulating it by making exams less demanding.</p> <p>James Sabben-Clare, the head of Winchester college, told last year's conference of head teachers that he had no doubt that, despite government denials, A levels had become easier. Statisticians have queried last year's improvement in key stage two results which, they say, is so uniformly consistent across every part of the country as to invite the suspicion that the threshold marks were lowered. GCSE improvements, they say, look far more genuine since they vary from area to area.</p> <p>Sats markers have some worrying stories about instructions which they say they have been given by team leaders appointed by the QCA to conduct one-day training sessions.</p> <p>In one example, a group of experienced markers all agreed that a test paper should be given a level three, below the expected standard for 11-year-olds. The team leader reportedly seemed embarrassed and suggested that if they looked more carefully, they might like to agree it was a level four.</p> <p>The same group of markers report that they were told that when children were asked in their English Sats to list in order the dates when famous walls were built, they could pass if they got the dates right, even if they were in the wrong order; and that when children were told to write a letter or diary about moving house, it would be all right if the children simply wrote a story, regardless of whether it had the form of a letter or a diary. One of the markers says she told the team leader: \"We might just as well say to the children 'Write whatever you like, dear, and you'll get the marks'.\"</p> <p>Other markers report that last year's requirement that answers in maths and science Sats should be correctly spelled in order to gain a pass, has now been dropped; and that children can pass English Sats by answering the section which requires them to tick multiple choice boxes without having to produce any written answers at all. Senior QCA officials privately agree that there have been changes like this.</p> <p>However, while this evidence clearly suggests that the goal posts have been moved in a direction which favours the government's targets, it is a matter of record that David Blunkett was furious last year to find that the QCA had lowered the threshold marks for some Sats. Chief markers do carry out a \"reality test\" with a sample of live papers as a result of which they may move the threshold, but the QCA insist that even the chief markers cannot tell what percentage will then pass this threshold and their concern is solely to maintain standards over different years. In support of this, one of the senior consultants who is helping the QCA to draft next year's Sats and who was willing to acknowledge weaknesses in the system, told us he had been urged repeatedly to make sure that standards stayed high.</p> <p>The real problem here is that, just as academics have forecast, there is a limit to the amount of improvement which can be generated in schools without dealing with the underlying problems of intake and resource. A spokesman for Mr Blunkett's department told us: \"There is not an issue about cheating in schools, and teachers are professional in these matters.\"</p> <p>Additional research by Helene Mulholland</p>",

The bullying of staff by senior management in schools is appalling.\" Welcome to the other side of David Blunkett's drive for higher standards, to the world of tests and targets, where the career prospects of a teacher or the future of a school can be broken by one bad set of statistics, a world where teachers have been taught to fear failure with such an intensity that they have learned to cut corners to survive. Welcome to the Big Cheat. We have spoken to teachers, headteachers, local education authority (LEA) advisers, Ofsted inspectors, officials and leaders of teacher unions, and we have not found a single one of them who has not heard of some kind of cheating to deliver the figures required. The cheating goes far beyond GCSE coursework - to multiple fiddles on standard assessment tasks (Sats) and GCSEs, to the wholesale fabrication of figures on truancy and attendance, to the falsification of records on excluded children. It is certain that not all teachers have been driven to cheat; equally, our evidence suggests the fiddling is widespread. The significance of the Big Cheat is not simply that the official figures are infected with fiction. Beneath the fiddling, there is little doubt that in the last 10 years there has been some real advance in the standards achieved in Britain's state schools. The more important point is that it is yet another sign of the enduring weakness of Labour's attack on poor standards, that its underlying analysis of failure is mistaken, with the result that its strategy repeatedly evades the real problems and imposes the entire burden of change on teachers and managers. As this Guardian series has previously shown, the most important single factor in a school's failure to hit academic targets is its intake of children and, in particular, of the 30% of Britain's children who live with the damaging effects of poverty. The government swats this aside with its mantra that \"poverty is no excuse\" and continues with Kenneth Baker's [the former education secretary] market in school places, even though it penalises the schools with the most impoverished intake. Beyond that, school failure reflects financial limits - large classes, scarce equipment, poor buildings, stressed teachers. As we revealed in March, this government has lied about the amount of extra money which it is investing in schools. Failing effectively to tackle these underlying problems, the government has inflicted overwhelming pressure on teachers and managers to deliver all the necessary change themselves. There is no doubt that there was room for teachers and managers to improve - but they alone cannot deliver a change on the scale demanded. And so, some of those who have the most difficult intakes of children and/or the most stifling financial problems have learned to cheat to survive. As one West Country teacher put it: \"We all know the system is ridiculous but we don't do anything about it. It's just a game we play.\" Or, to be precise, a collection of games. Take, for example, the Truancy Game. The object is to make your attendance figures look good. This has been important since the mid 1990s when Ofsted (the Office for Standards in Education) started to log attendance as an indicator of a school's progress and the Department for Education and Employment (DFEE) started to publish annual figures. Now it has become an even higher priority: David Blunkett has announced that by the year 2002, schools must reduce the number of days lost to truancy by 30%. Schools who fail to hit their targets are liable to lose funds. In the truancy game, points are scored by obliterating the evidence of unauthorised absences, and players can score these points in two simple ways: by pretending that an absent child was really in the school, or by admitting that the child was absent but pretending that there was a legitimate reason. There are some who like to wait for the end of term and then spend a whole day on the figures, like this senior teacher at a secondary school in an inner city area: \"At the end of term, if you've got less than, say, 92%, which is your attendance target, then you go right back through the register and you start putting in 'present'. You can do it with the new electronic registers just the same. Sometimes it's the head who says to the person who's doing the returns, to work on the figures, sort of 'we need our attendance at such and such, so make sure we get there'. \"It's a lot of work; you have to write in loads of 'presents'. You think about it: if the school has been doing two registers a day, it comes to about 150,000 attendances in one term, and if you find out you've only got 87% and you need 92 or 93%, you've got to put in about 7,000 extra 'presents'. It takes ages.\" Other players prefer to keep the ball rolling all through the term, with a little fiddling each day, usually by pretending that somebody like a parent or a doctor has authorised a child to be absent, as numerous teachers explained: \"You just write 'letter sent' or 'letter received', or it could have been a phone call ... You can use religious holidays ... No one checks, you just say the absence was authorised.\" Other fiddles are opportunistic. \"We had to close the school for the day, because the heating broke down so we put it down as 100% attendance ... We have children in the behaviour unit who often only get taught for half the day but it gets put down as a whole day.\" No control The game is so widespread that it is scarcely secret at all. Here is a former headteacher, now a nationally respected expert on the improvement of schools: \"I know that schools have fixed the attendance figures and I believe the government cannot be unaware of it.\" Or here is one of Ofsted's registered inspectors, formerly a senior LEA official: \"Fiddling attendance figures is dead common. It's easy.\" Or this school clerk from the East Midlands: \"We fiddle them because we have absolutely no control over how many children come to school.\" Or the deputy head from east London: \"I don't feel any shame about it at all. There is no other way to do it. And that's the truth. Everybody does it.\" For those who prefer something with a little more skill and imagination, the government has also organised the Great Exclusion Game. Just as with truancy, Mr Blunkett has set a target for the number of excluded children to be cut by 30% by 2002 with the threat of financial penalties for those who fail. So, the trick here is to exclude children without admitting it. \"It's 'jump before you're pushed'. You get hold of the parent and you say 'If you leave him here, we're going to have to kick him out, it'll be on his record for ever and he'll never get a job, so why don't you take him out yourself before it happens?' It usually works.\" Some headteachers call this 'cleansing': just about nobody admits that they are doing it, but just about everybody knows somebody else who has. Jenny Price, of the Association for Education Welfare Managers, told us: \"Children whose faces don't fit, children who will never get the required number of A to C grades or whose behaviour is disruptive: these children are removed off rolls. You cannot believe how easy it is. Nobody follows it up, nobody chases it.\" It is, in fact, the oldest trick in the current Big Cheat book, and officials in the education department and the social exclusion unit admit that it has been happening. A few players show signs of real ingenuity, like Firfield School in Newcastle which was caught out by Channel 4 News last year arranging for the parents of regular truants to sign letters offering to educate their children at home. The parents had no such intention and said they signed the letters simply because they were told to. A temporary exclusion is just as easy and, by all accounts, just as widespread: \"You just phone the parents up and say 'We're sending him home and we don't want him back till Tuesday'. They just accept it. It's usually because there's been some pretty bad incident, so they're not going to argue about it. We don't log it as an exclusion, so it doesn't count as one. The only problem is that if we want to go for a 45-day exclusion, we can't do it, because we haven't recorded all the others.\" As a variation, children are told to come in for half days only. There is no doubt that the most demanding play is seen in the Exam Games. Sats have become a central part of school life, the raw material for the league tables which, despite widespread acknowledgement of their failure to tell the truth about schools, have become firmly lodged as the key indicator of a school's success with critical implications for future enrolment and funding. The pressure from the DFEE has been intense since the secretary of state announced that he would resign if by 2002 he could not get 80% of 11-year-olds to reach level four in English and 75% of them in maths. There is almost no pattern to the play in Sats, more like an orgy of improvisation as different teachers slip through different loopholes in search of ways to meet the pressure. Loopholes Some of the loopholes are more or less legitimate, encouraged even: extra classes to prepare children for the tests; practice work on last year's papers, which are be ing sold in increasing quantities; the teaching of specific test-related skills, such as the layout and style for writing a letter, which is a regular question in English tests. The DFEE says much of this is simply part of improving literacy and numeracy, and they supply \u00a342m for \"booster classes\" for children approaching Sats. However, in a narrow distinction, they also say that they do not recommend \"cramming or teaching to the test\" and there are many teachers who say that this whole focus on Sats is a perversion of education. Some of the loopholes are more controversial, albeit they fall short of outright cheating: teachers who tell children that Sats are \"the most important exams you'll ever take\" and that their future sets will depend on them; the headteacher who wanders around the exam room, suggesting \"You might want to have another look at that answer\"; the English teacher who supplies a list of \"wizard words\" - sophisticated, unusual words - for the children to memorise so they can scatter them throughout their English answers; invigilators who ignore the clock and let children have as much time as they want to complete the test. Then there are the loopholes which everyone knows amount to cheating. We spoke to some of those who mark Sats and who see the clues in the answers: the school where every single child used almost exactly the same form of words to describe how shadows are made; the incorrect answers which have been crossed out and replaced with correct ones; the school whose children reproduced the wording from an official answer sheet; the papers where tick boxes are filled out in a hand that is stronger and neater than that on the written parts of the paper. The markers say they are supposed to report evidence of malpractice. They all said they didn't: too much hassle; their own marking would then have to be checked; they felt some solidarity with the classroom teachers. Some said they had made reports but that their anxieties had been dismissed. Then we spoke to teachers and headteachers who explained how it is done. Mostly, they talked about the Main Trick, the numerous different ways in which teachers can get an early sight of the test papers. This turns out to be rather simple. Eighty per cent of the 11,000 Sats markers are teachers and, in order to standardise the marking, the examination boards have to give them access to the papers 10 days before the exam. In the same way, the exam boards also employ a further 1,100 teachers as team leaders who tour the country lecturing markers and who get to see the papers 24 days before they are officially revealed; others work as consultants who help the qualifications and curriculum agency (QCA) to set the papers and who know the rough contents of the papers 12 months in advance. The QCA and the DFEE both told us emphatically that this causes no problem. There is no system for checking the behaviour of markers, team leaders or consultants. \"We don't see this as a loophole,\" a QCA spokesman said. The teachers who see the advance papers beg to differ. Some said simply that it took a will of iron to say nothing to their colleagues or to their students; others admitted priming their pupils and some that they had applied for these positions precisely so that they would be able to get early sight of the papers and prepare their children accordingly. At the conference of the National Union of Teachers in April, there was open talk in the bars about the (supposedly secret) contents of the papers to be sat in May. We were told, for example: \"Everyone's been told the key stage two children have to know all about walls - Vietnam Wall, Great Wall of China and so on. Apparently, there's a whole section on that.\" Sure enough, the English Sats paper which was unveiled in mid-May included a section where children had to absorb and reproduce information about famous walls, Vietnam, China etc. Armed with this information, teachers can simply prime their children or even persuade them to memorise set answers. A school governor in Yorkshire wrote to us that his headteacher had \"heard stories about schools teaching pupils the answers to the actual questions; schools that put up the answers on classroom walls in the guise of educational aids; schools where teachers check papers as they are being written and make sure that answers are correct before they are handed in.\" Beyond this, every headteacher in the country is sent the Sats papers a week or 10 days before their students are due to sit them. Headteachers told us there was little chance of being caught if they did open papers in advance. Spot checks Barry Dawson, chair of the National Primary Headteachers' Association, which supports the use of Sats but opposes league tables, said: \"Heads and teachers are under such pressure that inevitably some will be tempted to bend the rules, and the current system is not rigorous enough to stop this. There is not anything like a rigorous system to check whether the tests have been opened or whether the tests are administered fairly.\" LEAs carry out spot checks to make sure that the papers are not opened in advance, and the DFEE told us that \"the incidence of the QCA finding anything untoward is so low as to be inexpressible\". However, the LEAs are short of inspectors, and the QCA acknowledges that the reality is that 90% of schools receive no spot check when they sit Sats. Heads have to sign a declaration that they will keep the Sats papers secure, but there is no set punishment for a head who is caught out, and the QCA has dealt with cases where the LEA decided to take no action against heads who broke the declaration. A headteacher in Sheffield has just been suspended after a colleague accused her of \"irregularities in the administration of Sats exams\". Another in Essex felt so guilty after talking to pupils about the contents of the papers which they were to sit, that he reported himself to the chair of governors and resigned. In Devon, a headteacher resigned last year after being accused by a colleague of similar behaviour (although the LEA there has done its best to conceal the incident). Just as with the truancy game, there is a strong suggestion that this is an open secret. An HM inspector who retired last year after some 20 years in the job said he had seen \"ridiculous and dishonest pursuits\" to improve Sats results. An Ofsted-registered inspector said: \"Secondary heads usually know which primary heads are fiddling because the children arrive and cannot work to the level of their Sats results. Fiddling at key stage two is probably pretty widespread. The policing is very weak.\" The difficulty is that fiddling is contagious, like steroids among athletes: if one teacher does well by cheating, the straight teacher looks worse than ever and is under more pressure than ever to conform to the new line. GCSEs are better policed than Sats and the evidence is that cheating by teachers is less common. Nevertheless it happens. We found secondary school teachers who are routinely writing the coursework which counts towards their students' GCSE results. If there are drawings to do, they produce them, and the children stencil or copy them; if there are essays, the teachers produce them and either print them up with different typefaces or ask children to write them out in long hand. \"Some of them know why I'm asking them to write things out. With some of them, I just say 'Can you do me a favour? Write this out, I want to put it on the wall'.\" Teachers put long hours into doing their students' work for them: \"I taught GNVQ business and admin to 11 kids, the average attendance for the class was 63%. I'm between a rock and a hard place. If I don't do the coursework, I'm going to get zero passes. And no one is going to say 'Oh, that's understandable'. So I did everything I could; I bit the bullet. They had to do three different elements with three different modules: I was creating itineraries for them, I made up interviews they had done with people in business, wrote letters they were supposed to have sent to businesses, everything I could.\" And there are some subtle manipulations. A recently retired secondary head told us: \"If you are clever, you can improve your GCSE results by picking the right exam board for the right subjects. There are different pass rates and you can make quite a difference to your outcomes without making any difference at all to the children's education.\" Apparently on the same logic, more schools are taking drama GCSEs because they are said to be easy route to an A to C grade; and some are dropping German and Spanish as their second modern language and starting to teach Mandarin Chinese as an easier grade-scoring option. The DFEE and the QCA both assured us that there was no problem with the exam results, paradoxically producing a cacophony of confessors admitting their \"crimes\" while the police insist that they are innocent. This may reflect the further new conflict of interest, that these exams now test not only the schools as well as the students, but also the performance of the DFEE, whose secretary of state has staked his career on raising standards. Conflicting evidence Finally, there is conflicting evidence on whether the government is not merely enjoying the results of this cheating but actively stimulating it by making exams less demanding. James Sabben-Clare, the head of Winchester college, told last year's conference of head teachers that he had no doubt that, despite government denials, A levels had become easier. Statisticians have queried last year's improvement in key stage two results which, they say, is so uniformly consistent across every part of the country as to invite the suspicion that the threshold marks were lowered. GCSE improvements, they say, look far more genuine since they vary from area to area. Sats markers have some worrying stories about instructions which they say they have been given by team leaders appointed by the QCA to conduct one-day training sessions. In one example, a group of experienced markers all agreed that a test paper should be given a level three, below the expected standard for 11-year-olds. The team leader reportedly seemed embarrassed and suggested that if they looked more carefully, they might like to agree it was a level four. The same group of markers report that they were told that when children were asked in their English Sats to list in order the dates when famous walls were built, they could pass if they got the dates right, even if they were in the wrong order; and that when children were told to write a letter or diary about moving house, it would be all right if the children simply wrote a story, regardless of whether it had the form of a letter or a diary. One of the markers says she told the team leader: \"We might just as well say to the children 'Write whatever you like, dear, and you'll get the marks'.\" Other markers report that last year's requirement that answers in maths and science Sats should be correctly spelled in order to gain a pass, has now been dropped; and that children can pass English Sats by answering the section which requires them to tick multiple choice boxes without having to produce any written answers at all. Senior QCA officials privately agree that there have been changes like this. However, while this evidence clearly suggests that the goal posts have been moved in a direction which favours the government's targets, it is a matter of record that David Blunkett was furious last year to find that the QCA had lowered the threshold marks for some Sats. Chief markers do carry out a \"reality test\" with a sample of live papers as a result of which they may move the threshold, but the QCA insist that even the chief markers cannot tell what percentage will then pass this threshold and their concern is solely to maintain standards over different years. In support of this, one of the senior consultants who is helping the QCA to draft next year's Sats and who was willing to acknowledge weaknesses in the system, told us he had been urged repeatedly to make sure that standards stayed high. The real problem here is that, just as academics have forecast, there is a limit to the amount of improvement which can be generated in schools without dealing with the underlying problems of intake and resource. A spokesman for Mr Blunkett's department told us: \"There is not an issue about cheating in schools, and teachers are professional in these matters.\" Additional research by Helene Mulholland",

Lifelong learning minister Malcolm Wicks will present the post-16 awards. </p> <p>Over 300 institutions entered their websites this year, trebling last year's entry and showing that websites have become more a part of the business of schools. </p> <p>\"Last year, sites tended to point to learning resources elsewhere,\" says Becta's director of schools, Niel McLean, who chaired the judging panel. \"But now there is real content - teachers' ideas, lesson plans - and the sites have become more of a working tool for teachers rather than just a showcase for children.\" </p> <p>But brochure-type sites have not gone away. Roger Blamire, now innovation manager at European SchoolNet and chair of last year's awards panel, found far too many when helping to draw up this year's shortlist. </p> <p>\"Most entries were prospectuses for prospective parents, with little for existing pupils and parents,\" Blamire says. And few site designers had considered access for those with special needs. Even so, he feels the pace of the internet has been so fast that what was deemed good enough last year is being seen as poor this year.</p> <p>So fast, in fact, that some of the technically advanced schools have reached a crossroads. \"It's make-your-mind-up-time,\" says McLean. \"They've got as far as they can with a hand-knitted way of doing things. You can see sites now that have a lot of 'spaghetti' content. In two years' time it will be worse than useless. You start off with a bunch of enthusiasts, grow the site and all of a sudden people start forgetting links. Some material may not get used for two years. It can be left like a Stonehenge on the net. So for bigger schools it may mean investing more money, getting someone in to build a foundation for them.\" </p> <p>But schools that are falling behind are not forgotten. The 2001 awards, due to be launched this autumn, will have a new category linked to the Comic Relief charity. This is to encourage beginners, particularly children, to submit entries. \"You need a category to avoid people becoming dispirited,\" says McLean. \"And also, as schools get slicker, kids will no longer be allowed to run the main site but just do bits.\" </p> <p>Becta is hoping for a bumper crop of entries. \"A big percentage of schools now have websites,\" says McLean. \"It's an indication of confidence, so we're expecting nearer a thousand entries next year!\" </p> <p><strong> Primary winners</strong></p> <p>Like last year's entries, the primary sites have proved the most entertaining, packed with colour, excitement and resources. The best ones have been generally more ambitious this year, several using \"flash\" graphics technology to liven up their pages. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.langstone-jun.portsmouth.sch.uk\"> Langstone Junior School</a> from Portsmouth wins the whole site category for its wide mix of resources and clear navigation, which more than compensated for a slightly cluttered front page.</p> <p>It draws the visitor into the school's activities, carrying a wide selection of photographs. Then a click on a hot spot in pictures taken during a British Museum trip brings up a second layer of photograph flashing up on screen to uncover more detail. And, refreshingly, pictures of the children with a visiting poet show pupils' actual hand-writing - not a font in sight. Add to that a minibeast quiz using graphics to inform about insects and a useful list of linked sites - particularly for parents - and Langstone leads the field in both showcasing school activities and keeping parents and grandparents bang up-to-date in true local newspaper fashion. </p> <p>But it's hard to better the display of children's work on <a href=\"http://edleston.primaryresources.co.uk \" target=\"_NEW\">Edleston Primary School</a>'s site which carried off the Learners award. Don't miss the impressive array of artwork on a black background. The colours come to life; animations leap across the page, literally in the shape of a tiger turning the tables on its hunter in a beautifully done animation (older children animated younger children's work). Poetry is spoken in audio clips and the whole site is a walking, talking example of the children's learning.</p> <p>For sheer rarity value, apart from anything else, the teaching resources award has to go to the small, rural <a href=\"http://www.westfield-nursery.co.uk\">Westfield Day Nursery</a> at York - a real \"incentive\" site for small schools. The site offers a treasure trove for four-year-olds, parents, students of childcare and other professionals.</p> <p>A simple but clear home page, built with Frontpage 2000, draws in visitors to the site, which aims to extend the school's open-door policy of allowing anyone to visit without an appointment. A digital camera constantly used by staff and children, a site search engine, and plans to allow pupils to search the net for pictures and add their own websites show what can be done at this age. Nurseries, take heart.</p> <p><strong> Secondary winners</strong></p> <p>Judges' responses to the secondary school sites varied widely, but in the end there was near unanimous agreement. </p> <p>Although the sites had distinct and different characters, there were clear factors the winning sites held in common. Perhaps the most important was that, on the best sites, you could see that the site-builders had clearly worked out who the site was aimed at; in consequence they succeeded in pitching their content attractively to their audience. The second was that the best sites used straightforward design and were simple to find your way around. </p> <p>In the whole school category, <a href=\"http://www.thorntongrammar.bradford.sch.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Thornton Grammar</a>'s site stood out for all those reasons. The front page is a simple picture, but supplemented with effective roll-over graphics, leading into a home page full of life, where each link nevertheless carries a crystal-clear summary of where it's going to take you. And it's easy to find your way back.</p> <p>Most schools attempt to display students' work, and a few encourage students to build their own web pages. <a href=\"http://www.denbigh.net\"> Denbigh School</a>, Milton Keynes, won the learners' category because it enabled students to show off their own web efforts: the presentation of art work, with clickthrough thumbnails, was particularly well-executed. </p> <p>The teachers' resources category was hardest to judge, principally because one of the shortlisted entries, <a href=\"http://www.kevinsplayroom.co.uk\">kevinsplayroom.co.uk</a>, proved to be a brilliant and eminently usable web guide. But <a href=\"http://www.cornwallis.kent.sch.uk\"> Cornwallis School in Kent</a> narrowly won the day by offering a rich selection of original content to which I, for one, would happily lead my teenage children.</p> <p><strong>Post-16 winners</strong></p> <p>Further education websites have come a long way, but many opportunities are still waiting to be taken. That was the judges' verdict for the post-16 category. The sector has much to gain from getting to grips with the web - not just because ICT skills are an increasingly popular option at this level, nor because potential students increasingly turn to the net to choose a course - but because FE students often research essays and projects online for the first time and need all the help they can get from their college. </p> <p>The judges were a little disappointed that so few college sites had thought about displaying their students' work online. <a href=\"http://www.candi.ac.uk\"> City &amp; Islington College</a>, the winner of the Learners' Award, was an outstanding exception. Professional and engaging, it also gives visitors a vivid sense of students' achievements and college life. The gallery section includes writing by students of English as a second language and - importantly for many students - the chance to place CVs online.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.uxbridge.ac.uk/spelthorne/spelhome.htm\">Spelthorne Farm</a>'s vivid, albeit rudimentary, site shows a little of what can be achieved when students with special needs contribute to a web project. </p> <p>While it was good to see so many institutions with a web presence, the judges were looking for evidence of provision for students, too. The <a href=\"http://www.adultedbucks.org.uk\">Buckinghamshire Adult Education</a> site has made excellent efforts to attract rural would-be students with a course search engine, but it was just beaten into second place by the accomplished <a href=\"http://www.southgate.ac.uk\">Southgate</a>. This north London college offers staff and students webspace, a chat room and message boards as well as admissions information. It was also one of the few to provide a search engine.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.sheffcol.ac.uk/links\" target=\"_NEW\">Sheffield College</a>'s directory of almost 2,000 hand-picked links - recommended and reviewed by staff and students - carried off the Teachers' Award. Updated almost daily, it loads quickly, is easy to search and shows Sheffield's commitment to sharing knowledge across the curriculum. </p> <p>Links directories are an excellent beginning for any online FE resource. Next year, it is to be hoped that teaching resources, shared advice and real cooperation with other institutions will all feature widely. Do it now - before a rival college steals your thunder. </p> <p> \u0095 Ros Taylor</p> <p>\u0095 Guardian journalists Ros Taylor, Colin Hughes and Richard Doughty were on the awards judging panel.</p>",

Roger Blamire, now innovation manager at European SchoolNet and chair of last year's awards panel, found far too many when helping to draw up this year's shortlist. \"Most entries were prospectuses for prospective parents, with little for existing pupils and parents,\" Blamire says. And few site designers had considered access for those with special needs. Even so, he feels the pace of the internet has been so fast that what was deemed good enough last year is being seen as poor this year. So fast, in fact, that some of the technically advanced schools have reached a crossroads. \"It's make-your-mind-up-time,\" says McLean. \"They've got as far as they can with a hand-knitted way of doing things. You can see sites now that have a lot of 'spaghetti' content. In two years' time it will be worse than useless. You start off with a bunch of enthusiasts, grow the site and all of a sudden people start forgetting links. Some material may not get used for two years. It can be left like a Stonehenge on the net. So for bigger schools it may mean investing more money, getting someone in to build a foundation for them.\" But schools that are falling behind are not forgotten. The 2001 awards, due to be launched this autumn, will have a new category linked to the Comic Relief charity. This is to encourage beginners, particularly children, to submit entries. \"You need a category to avoid people becoming dispirited,\" says McLean. \"And also, as schools get slicker, kids will no longer be allowed to run the main site but just do bits.\" Becta is hoping for a bumper crop of entries. \"A big percentage of schools now have websites,\" says McLean. \"It's an indication of confidence, so we're expecting nearer a thousand entries next year!\" Primary winners Like last year's entries, the primary sites have proved the most entertaining, packed with colour, excitement and resources. The best ones have been generally more ambitious this year, several using \"flash\" graphics technology to liven up their pages. Langstone Junior School from Portsmouth wins the whole site category for its wide mix of resources and clear navigation, which more than compensated for a slightly cluttered front page. It draws the visitor into the school's activities, carrying a wide selection of photographs. Then a click on a hot spot in pictures taken during a British Museum trip brings up a second layer of photograph flashing up on screen to uncover more detail. And, refreshingly, pictures of the children with a visiting poet show pupils' actual hand-writing - not a font in sight. Add to that a minibeast quiz using graphics to inform about insects and a useful list of linked sites - particularly for parents - and Langstone leads the field in both showcasing school activities and keeping parents and grandparents bang up-to-date in true local newspaper fashion. But it's hard to better the display of children's work on Edleston Primary School's site which carried off the Learners award. Don't miss the impressive array of artwork on a black background. The colours come to life; animations leap across the page, literally in the shape of a tiger turning the tables on its hunter in a beautifully done animation (older children animated younger children's work). Poetry is spoken in audio clips and the whole site is a walking, talking example of the children's learning. For sheer rarity value, apart from anything else, the teaching resources award has to go to the small, rural Westfield Day Nursery at York - a real \"incentive\" site for small schools. The site offers a treasure trove for four-year-olds, parents, students of childcare and other professionals. A simple but clear home page, built with Frontpage 2000, draws in visitors to the site, which aims to extend the school's open-door policy of allowing anyone to visit without an appointment. A digital camera constantly used by staff and children, a site search engine, and plans to allow pupils to search the net for pictures and add their own websites show what can be done at this age. Nurseries, take heart. Secondary winners Judges' responses to the secondary school sites varied widely, but in the end there was near unanimous agreement. Although the sites had distinct and different characters, there were clear factors the winning sites held in common. Perhaps the most important was that, on the best sites, you could see that the site-builders had clearly worked out who the site was aimed at; in consequence they succeeded in pitching their content attractively to their audience. The second was that the best sites used straightforward design and were simple to find your way around. In the whole school category, Thornton Grammar's site stood out for all those reasons. The front page is a simple picture, but supplemented with effective roll-over graphics, leading into a home page full of life, where each link nevertheless carries a crystal-clear summary of where it's going to take you. And it's easy to find your way back. Most schools attempt to display students' work, and a few encourage students to build their own web pages. Denbigh School, Milton Keynes, won the learners' category because it enabled students to show off their own web efforts: the presentation of art work, with clickthrough thumbnails, was particularly well-executed. The teachers' resources category was hardest to judge, principally because one of the shortlisted entries, kevinsplayroom.co.uk, proved to be a brilliant and eminently usable web guide. But Cornwallis School in Kent narrowly won the day by offering a rich selection of original content to which I, for one, would happily lead my teenage children. Post-16 winners Further education websites have come a long way, but many opportunities are still waiting to be taken. That was the judges' verdict for the post-16 category. The sector has much to gain from getting to grips with the web - not just because ICT skills are an increasingly popular option at this level, nor because potential students increasingly turn to the net to choose a course - but because FE students often research essays and projects online for the first time and need all the help they can get from their college. The judges were a little disappointed that so few college sites had thought about displaying their students' work online. City &amp; Islington College, the winner of the Learners' Award, was an outstanding exception. Professional and engaging, it also gives visitors a vivid sense of students' achievements and college life. The gallery section includes writing by students of English as a second language and - importantly for many students - the chance to place CVs online. Spelthorne Farm's vivid, albeit rudimentary, site shows a little of what can be achieved when students with special needs contribute to a web project. While it was good to see so many institutions with a web presence, the judges were looking for evidence of provision for students, too. The Buckinghamshire Adult Education site has made excellent efforts to attract rural would-be students with a course search engine, but it was just beaten into second place by the accomplished Southgate. This north London college offers staff and students webspace, a chat room and message boards as well as admissions information. It was also one of the few to provide a search engine. Sheffield College's directory of almost 2,000 hand-picked links - recommended and reviewed by staff and students - carried off the Teachers' Award. Updated almost daily, it loads quickly, is easy to search and shows Sheffield's commitment to sharing knowledge across the curriculum. Links directories are an excellent beginning for any online FE resource. Next year, it is to be hoped that teaching resources, shared advice and real cooperation with other institutions will all feature widely. Do it now - before a rival college steals your thunder. \u0095 Ros Taylor \u0095 Guardian journalists Ros Taylor, Colin Hughes and Richard Doughty were on the awards judging panel.",

It has taken her four years to get the project off the ground and only now has the Beeb had the nerve to agree the time may finally be right.</p> <p>You can't blame them for feeling jittery. After all, look what happened to Ellen, the American sitcom that infamously pulverised its own ratings by allowing the star, Ellen DeGeneres, to come out as a lesbian mid-series. She has never repeated her earlier success, though her girlfriend, Anne Heche, has become a huge star in the wake of the furore.</p> <p>But it looks as though the Beeb has little to worry about. For a start, Cameron claims Rhona is not a gay sitcom. \"Sure, it informs who she is, but it is not the point of the show. Ellen was a show that gradually built up to her 'coming out', while Rhona is about a woman who just happens to be gay.\" Just to make sure we've got the message, she cites her main influences as Rhoda and Seinfeld, carefully avoiding any reference to Queer As Folk, the series that must surely have paved the way for her show getting the green light.</p> <p>In any case, how gay the series turns out to be is hardly of much consequence; in fact, in many ways, the gayer it is, the higher the ratings may turn out to be. Lesbians are chic, everyone knows this, even this week's National Enquirer, with its Hollywood Lesbians Special. The big question is why? Is it to do with an enlightened sexual consciousness or a global breaking down of taboos? Maybe - but there's another, more significant reason. It's one we should have suspected all along, from the moment Vogue cheerfully endorsed the joys of \"bi-try\" and from recent snaps of newly-minted Sapphic superstars Drew Barrymore and Liv Tyler coyly puckering up together.</p> <p>The real reason has been unearthed by the University of Maryland in America. It pays to be gay - particularly if you're a top-ranking star in the film or entertainment industry. A study of 100 top female stars reveals that gay women earn on average $7.9m while other stars take home a mere $6m. Perhaps this is the reason why actors such as Angelina Jolie are currently flirting with lesbianism - never mind that they're married: they know it will capture the stunted imaginations of male studio executives. Brooke Shields recently posed for US gay magazine Advocate, saying she expected to marry again but in the meantime \"found women very attractive\". Laura Dern was photographed kissing fellow actor Amy Yasbeck and her act was applauded by singer Melissa Etheridge.</p> <p>So is going gay a good career move? Actor Sophie Ward, who came out as lesbian four years ago, laughs wryly at the suggestion. \"After I came out, I certainly noticed that people were a bit wary of casting me, particularly for television parts. I think there was a feeling that I wasn't safe. Even now, I get the impression with some of the more commercial roles I'm up for that they still think I'm a bit risky. But it's very hard to tell if you don't get a job just because of your sexuality. Luckily most people in the business are strong-minded and don't get swayed by it, but I think it will take time for people to relax about me.\"</p> <p>She points out that there may be one reason why lesbians earn more money, although there are no statistics to back this up in the UK: \"You have to fight very hard to get where you are as a lesbian in this business. You have to be even more assertive and I think that might be reflected in how much you ask to be paid.\"</p> <p>Jess Search, deputy commissioning editor for independent film and video at Channel 4, believes there's a mystique about being a lesbian that may reflect in success and earning power, particularly in creative arts and the media. \"It's nothing new that a male audience will find a good-looking girl more interesting if they know she's a lesbian. In general, gay women used to be seen as subcultural, something that went on behind closed doors. Now we're no longer in the ghetto, we're more socially acceptable. Men find lesbians sexy, it creates a buzz around you.\"</p> <p>Rhona Cameron, though, is not a typical example. \"Most lesbians, especially those in the public eye, suffer from Navratilova syndrome,\" Search says, \"where you can risk coming out only when you're at the top of your game. Then you can afford to do it. That may be the reason why the women surveyed in America were seen to be earning at high levels.\"</p> <p>Madeleine Sheahan, a lesbian and business affairs executive with a TV company, believes gay women are not usually fantasy figures. \"Most lesbians live smaller, more ordinary lives than anyone else. Men aren't really interested in us, unless there's a prospect that they might get sexually involved with two women. Otherwise it's boring to them. They tend to think women who end up with women do that because they are somehow disappointed in love or, worse, can't get anyone else. That's why they love Anne Heche - she defies all that. In reality, though, most lesbians aren't like that and they are not advantaged by their sexuality.\"</p> <p>The University of Maryland study also examined the earning power of women employed in all sectors and found that lesbians in their mid-40s earned a third more than their straight counterparts. Seth Sanders, the economics professor who led the research, asserts that the reason for this imbalance is that lesbians will have known from an early age that they will have to be economically self-sufficient and also that they will not have children.</p> <p>\"This is absolute rubbish,\" counters Jo Monroe, a lesbian who runs a website for the television industry. \"Many, many lesbians I know have children and many of them were married and had kids before they were confident enough to come out. Also, the childless lesbians I know tend to conform to the stereotype of being social workers or teachers, earning \u00a320,000 per year. It's true that there are women like me who have set up our own businesses but that doesn't mean just because we're lesbians we're somehow going to be earning loads of money.\"</p> <p>Jocelyn Watson is the lesbian caseworker for employment at the Lesbian and Gay Alliance, which provides help and advice for the gay and lesbian community. She claims she takes calls from women experiencing discrimination difficulties over parity of pay in many different sectors, including the film and TV industries. \"I would strongly refute that the earning power of lesbians in this country is higher than that of their colleagues. Women are discriminated against across the pay scales and opportunities are limited. There's still a problem for women to be out and open with their sexuality. It may be fine for Hollywood stars and women in America for whom there are lots of opportunities, but here the big issue for lesbians is how they are going to get a job in the first place.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "William Hague last night embarked on the biggest u-turn of his career when he bowed to intense pressure and abandoned his flagship guarantee to cut taxes, regardless of the state of the economy. In a humiliating climbdown forced on him by the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, Mr Hague pledged that a Tory government would place spending on health and education above his ' tax guarantee'. The dramatic u-turn by the Tory leader was seized on by the government as a sign of weak leadership in the face of relentless criticism of Mr Hague's pledge to cut taxes even if the economy enters a recession. It will also be seen as a victory for Mr Portillo who has already forced Mr Hague to reverse Tory opposition to the minimum wage and Bank of England independence. Mr Hague did not mince his words as he announced the abolition of the central plank of his common sense revolution - launched amid great fanfare at last year's party conference - in which he pledged that 'taxes will fall as a share of the nation's income'. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Hague said: 'We are being clear - in the event of severe recession, unexpected acts of God or war that our commitments to health, our commitment to prudent economic management will come first. People can be assured that our commitment to reduce taxation does not over-ride prudent economic management or our vital public services.' Ministers reacted with glee last night to Mr Hague's u-turn, describing it as a significant victory for Tony Blair. At their weekly Commons clashes, the prime minister regularly taunts Mr Hague over his tax guarantee, saying that the Tory leader would never be able to match Labour spending on health and education because of his commitment to cut taxes. But the u-turn was also being seen last night as a significant boost to Mr Portillo, who cast doubt over the tax policy as soon as he was appointed shadow chancellor his year. Mr Portillo told Mr Hague that the Tories had made themselves vulnerable to Labour attacks by guaranteeing key public spending while pledging to cut taxes. Mr Hague's camp initially tried to hold the line on the tax guarantee, saying that they could match Labour's spending on health and education by cutting \u00a34 billion from the welfare budget and from government bureaucracy and regulation.

      "bodyText": "Loyalists attempted to block roads across Northern Ireland today as Drumcree Orangemen continued protesting against being barred from marching down the mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown. Police said today's protests on roads in Belfast, Ballymoney, Kilrea, Coleraine, Portadown, Downpatrick and Lisburn had been peaceful. But many believed that a repeat of last night's violence, which saw security forces fired at, cars hijacked and set alight and property attacked, was inevitable. Chief superintendent Brian McCargo, who was on central command duty last night, said: \"Anyone in the present circumstances, particularly during Drumcree week, who brings these people out on to the road by way of peaceful protest are bound to realise that it is going to degenerate into disorder in some areas because they're just bringing thugs out on to the road.\" He also rejected accusations from the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, among others, that security forces were not doing enough to stem the trouble. Mr McCargo said that officers were engaged in a \"fine balancing act\" of allowing peaceful protest and enforcing the law without further aggravating circumstances. \"The people of this province can rest assured that we will be looking for these people who have been disrupting traffic and burning vehicles and burning shops,\" he said. The Royal Ulster Constabulary today revealed that there have been 280 attacks on security forces since July 1. They include 288 petrol bombing incidents and 13 shooting incidents. A total of 57 RUC officers and five soldiers have been injured, with 77 homes, 55 commercial premises and 358 vehicles damaged. There have been 146 arrests with 72 people charged. Two councillors told today how they were halted and threatened at the loyalist roadblocks. Oran Keenan said he had been stopped, surrounded and threatened in Antrim town while independent unionist Andrew Davidson said youths had leaped on to his car after he tried to move through a blockade on the outskirts of Londonderry. \" It's what you might call a hooligan element being stirred up, Mr Davidson said. \"I don't give it credence as a political movement of any sort.\" Dawson Baillie, the Orange county grand master for Belfast, said that the blame for the trouble lay with Tony Blair and the parades commission - the body which rules on disputed parades. He claimed that commission rulings which restricted parades because of the danger of public disorder sent out the message that the threat of trouble could win. Tomorrow Mr Baillie plans to lead thousands of Orangemen gathering in Belfast for the main July 12 demonstrations. They are to march to Ormeau Park, in the south of the city, beside the bridge at which members of the Ballynafeigh lodge will be blocked from entering the mainly nationalist Lower Ormeau Road.",

      "body": "<p>I was a single mother, working full-time as an administrator when, three and a half years ago, I discovered I had osteoporosis. I had fallen off a chair while painting my son's bedroom; it was a one foot drop to the floor, yet I broke my back in two places. </p> <p>The doctors could not believe how easily my back had broken; it wasn't normal at my age. It was bad enough suffering the back injury, but eight days later a test revealed that my bone density was severely low. My bones were thinning. I had heard about osteoporosis, but knew little about it: I thought it only affected the elderly. I never knew you could get it so young: I was 36 and my bones were crumbling. I was also at risk of developing a severe form of the condition. </p> <p>Doctors initially thought I would never walk again, that I would have to use a wheelchair for the rest of my life. With two children (aged eight and 10) to look after, the prospect of trying to raise a family with a condition that could leave me dependent on others was terrifying. At one point a doctor mentioned foster parents for the children - I panicked. I had visions of them being taken away. </p> <p>At first, I felt I wasn't getting the right support or any constructive advice. It felt very isolating and was a particularly lonely experience. But I'm strong willed, and I was determined to pull through. I asked doctors to draw a diagram of exactly where the breaks were in my back. Every day I meditated, something I had previously only dabbled in, and within a fortnight I was discharged from hospital. </p> <p>For the next three months, I wore a body plaster-cast, then after that a metal brace during the day. I was still meditating intensely and swallowing an enriched vitamin D supplement taken by many post-menopausal women with osteoporosis. My GP also prescribed the contraceptive pill Marvelon to keep my oestrogen levels high. </p> <p>Six months after the accident, I started going to the gym once a week just to strengthen my back muscles. I used to loathe sport, but I realised concentrated exercise would be of great benefit. Gradually, I built up to exercising four times a week, specifically working on parts of my back. From the shoulder-press and weight-bearing exercises to stretching, skipping and boxercise - boxing, aerobics and circuit training. </p> <p>A second bone density scan a year after the accident revealed that my density levels had increased. I then started taking Alendronate - a non-hormonal treatment for osteoporosis. By now I was such a regular at the gym that when a fitness instructor failed to turn up one day I was invited to teach a class for the over-60s. It was such a success that I started an NVQ course in sports and recreation to qualify as a full-time fitness instructor. I now teach anyone under the age of 100, and the majority suffer from hip or back problems and weak bones. The youngest is 17. </p> <p>A big problem with osteoporosis is that many people don't realise they suffer from it until it's too late. It usually takes an accident - a break or a fracture, before most people actually have a bone density scan. Diet is of great importance. Calcium levels high need to be kept high - especially in young mothers. Now I'm very aware of what vitamins and minerals are included or excluded in my diet. I take semi-skinned milk, which is much higher in calcium than full-fat. Pilchards, sardines and whitebait are also extremely rich in it, as is sesame seed paste (tahini). Vitamin D, iron, magnesium and a host of other minerals also need to be absorbed by the body. </p> <p>I'm also more aware of the risks of participating in certain activities, in case of accidental fractures. I do most things, but I wouldn't go ice-skating, skiing or roller-blading with my children. By continuing to strengthen my bones, I hope to reverse the progression. </p> <p>Although osteoporosis tends to be hereditary or hormone-induced, I had no history of the condition in my family. Today, more younger women are being diagnosed with it. And per haps more disturbingly, so are children. So I am quite conscious that my daughter could have a predisposition towards it. For anyone who is worried that she might have osteoporosis because her mother or grandmother suffers from it, my advice is to ask your GP for a bone density test. I know a 14-year-old girl who is crippled and wheelchair bound by it, one woman who broke her wrist pressing a lift button and another who broke a bone shaking her toothbrush. </p> <p>The earlier osteoporosis is detected, the greater the chance of controlling it. You can live a normal life. My life today is totally different. I'm so much more aware of how diet can affect us. I feel healthier and fitter now than ever. The accident and diagnosis were a turning point. I was just young enough to be able to build up bone mass for the future. Young women call me all the time to say they suffer from it and ask: \"Is that it now?\" But so much can be done. It's not all doom and gloom. It may be a clich\u00e9, but diet, exercise and positive thinking hold the greatest benefits. </p> <p> \u0095 It affects people of all ages, including children and teenagers - one in three women and one in 12 men in the UK. </p> <p>\u0095 Every three minutes someone has a fracture as a result of osteoporosis. </p> <p>\u0095 Each year doctors will see osteoporosis sufferers for 70,000 hip fractures, 50,000 wrist fractures and 40,000 spinal fractures. </p> <p>\u0095 Osteoporosis costs the NHS more than \u00a31.5bn each year. </p> <p>\u0095 In most cases it can be prevented by eating a calcium-rich well balanced diet, taking regular weight-bearing exercise, and avoiding too much smoking and alcohol. </p> <p>\u0095 For more information on osteoporosis contact the National Osteoporosis Society (PO Box 10, Radstock, Bath, BA3 3YB; helpline: 01761 472721; <a href=\"http://www.nos.org.uk),\">www.nos.org.uk),</a> the British Nutrition Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.nutrition.org.uk),\">www.nutrition.org.uk),</a> the </p> <p>Complementary Medical Association (020-8305 9871) or the Carer's National Association (0808 808 7777).</p>",

      "body": "<p> It is midnight on a Friday night at the Sainsbury's in Chiswick, west London. The car park is dead and the shop is not much livelier. The number of customers barely outweighs the number of staff, who are pottering about between storerooms, aisles and checkout points. Somewhere in the grocery section, sandwiched between the bananas and the peaches, is Andrew, busying himself stacking grapefruits. He is one of the night shift workers on the supermarket's new 24-hour opening slot. He's been here three hours and has another seven to go. </p> <p>\"It has its moments,\" he says (and he gets paid more than he would for day work, of course). \"I try and get into the swing of it but it's still tough on my days off. When I get home in the morning I usually sleep until midday. I manage to catch about four or five hours a night.\" Beneath glaring white lights, I ask whether he's noticed any changes in himself since he's been doing the night shift. He says he still feels tired all the time, even though he has been doing nights for almost four years now. </p> <p>Four years of feeling tired... As Britain goes headlong down the 24-7, open-all-hours road, experts are becoming increasingly concerned by the number of people working unsocial hours - whether very early or very late. Last week a new exhibition, Rhythms of Life, opened at the Natural History Museum. The message there is that we are meant to sleep at night - from about 10.30pm onwards, for about six to eight hours - and anything else can be harmful. </p> <p>\"We have an internal clock that is hard-wired into our brains and tells us that we're just not supposed to be awake at night,\" says Mike Rosekind, whose American company, Alertness Solutions, advises businesses on the risks of tinkering with our natural timetabling. \"Every 24 hours we are programmed to be hungry at certain points, alert at certain points and sleepy at certain points. Critical to the clock is that we're awake in the day and asleep at night.\" </p> <p>Our internal clock, says Rosekind, is kept in sync by the natural cycles of light and dark. \"People always say to me, 'Won't my body adjust?' Well, it could do, but as soon as someone leaves work to drive home they get that trigger of light that says it's time to be awake.\" </p> <p>Sleep researcher Barbara Stone, at the centre for human sciences in Farnborough, Hampshire, says: \"It's very rare someone can totally turn around their 24-hour clock and get a good day of sleep. Studies on night nurses show that as soon as they have time off they quickly go back to being diurnal.\" </p> <p>Research suggests that cheating this basic programming can seriously damage your health. Long-term shift-working can cause cardiac problems and a greater incidence of depression, although researchers admit that both effects could be caused by the fact that the workers' unsocial hours have left their family and social life in tatters. </p> <p>Studies on a variety of animals indicate that being kept awake at night may lower life expectancy. \"The long shifts can also affect people's immunity to illnesses and damage nutritional intake,\" says Stone. \"It seems people who work night shifts also have more problems with ulcers, though that may be to do with the wrong sort of diet since night workers tend to snack on things like chips.\" </p> <p>That rings true for Tarq, a barman who used to work the all-night shifts. \"I just felt really unhealthy all the time. Because of my hours I'd be having dinner really early and another snack in the middle of the night. And when I woke up I just didn't know whether to eat breakfast or lunch or what. And the weird hours also meant it was virtually impossible to keep the proper exercise routine which I was used to, so I just ended up feeling really greasy and horrible,\" he says. </p> <p>\"What you're hit with,\" says Rosekind, \"is a kind of double whammy. As well as disrupting the clock, a person is lucky if they can get more than 5 or 6 hours sleep during the day. So all the time they are night-working, they are building up a sleep debt that makes them twice as vulnerable to mental and physical problems.\" </p> <p>Laura used to work through the night to prepare for a morning television show. She describes the experience of doing regular night shifts - and these were pretty much from dusk until dawn - as nothing short of awful. \"I just couldn't sleep during the day and was getting colds and coughs and chest infections when I had basically never got ill before,\" she says. \"Only now that I've stopped doing it do I realise that it can really impact on you and that it could cause long-term sleep and energy problems and really make people depressed. I think if you've got a vaguely sensitive constitution it's a really tough thing to do.\" </p> <p>Professor Neil Douglas, chairman of the British Sleep Foundation, argues that while the physical impact may be severe, the real strain of night shifts is on our mental capabilities. \"People who work nights are jeopardising their decision-making, their planning - and they are more likely to have accidents, simply because they are too sleepy. Just coming home from work is a high-risk activity since car accidents are much, much more common for night shift workers than day shift workers.\" The evidence is cast in both statistics and history.

      "bodyText": "It is midnight on a Friday night at the Sainsbury's in Chiswick, west London. The car park is dead and the shop is not much livelier. The number of customers barely outweighs the number of staff, who are pottering about between storerooms, aisles and checkout points. Somewhere in the grocery section, sandwiched between the bananas and the peaches, is Andrew, busying himself stacking grapefruits. He is one of the night shift workers on the supermarket's new 24-hour opening slot. He's been here three hours and has another seven to go. \"It has its moments,\" he says (and he gets paid more than he would for day work, of course). \"I try and get into the swing of it but it's still tough on my days off. When I get home in the morning I usually sleep until midday. I manage to catch about four or five hours a night.\" Beneath glaring white lights, I ask whether he's noticed any changes in himself since he's been doing the night shift. He says he still feels tired all the time, even though he has been doing nights for almost four years now. Four years of feeling tired... As Britain goes headlong down the 24-7, open-all-hours road, experts are becoming increasingly concerned by the number of people working unsocial hours - whether very early or very late. Last week a new exhibition, Rhythms of Life, opened at the Natural History Museum. The message there is that we are meant to sleep at night - from about 10.30pm onwards, for about six to eight hours - and anything else can be harmful. \"We have an internal clock that is hard-wired into our brains and tells us that we're just not supposed to be awake at night,\" says Mike Rosekind, whose American company, Alertness Solutions, advises businesses on the risks of tinkering with our natural timetabling. \"Every 24 hours we are programmed to be hungry at certain points, alert at certain points and sleepy at certain points. Critical to the clock is that we're awake in the day and asleep at night.\" Our internal clock, says Rosekind, is kept in sync by the natural cycles of light and dark. \"People always say to me, 'Won't my body adjust?' Well, it could do, but as soon as someone leaves work to drive home they get that trigger of light that says it's time to be awake.\" Sleep researcher Barbara Stone, at the centre for human sciences in Farnborough, Hampshire, says: \"It's very rare someone can totally turn around their 24-hour clock and get a good day of sleep. Studies on night nurses show that as soon as they have time off they quickly go back to being diurnal.\" Research suggests that cheating this basic programming can seriously damage your health. Long-term shift-working can cause cardiac problems and a greater incidence of depression, although researchers admit that both effects could be caused by the fact that the workers' unsocial hours have left their family and social life in tatters. Studies on a variety of animals indicate that being kept awake at night may lower life expectancy. \"The long shifts can also affect people's immunity to illnesses and damage nutritional intake,\" says Stone. \"It seems people who work night shifts also have more problems with ulcers, though that may be to do with the wrong sort of diet since night workers tend to snack on things like chips.\" That rings true for Tarq, a barman who used to work the all-night shifts. \"I just felt really unhealthy all the time. Because of my hours I'd be having dinner really early and another snack in the middle of the night. And when I woke up I just didn't know whether to eat breakfast or lunch or what. And the weird hours also meant it was virtually impossible to keep the proper exercise routine which I was used to, so I just ended up feeling really greasy and horrible,\" he says. \"What you're hit with,\" says Rosekind, \"is a kind of double whammy. As well as disrupting the clock, a person is lucky if they can get more than 5 or 6 hours sleep during the day. So all the time they are night-working, they are building up a sleep debt that makes them twice as vulnerable to mental and physical problems.\" Laura used to work through the night to prepare for a morning television show. She describes the experience of doing regular night shifts - and these were pretty much from dusk until dawn - as nothing short of awful. \"I just couldn't sleep during the day and was getting colds and coughs and chest infections when I had basically never got ill before,\" she says. \"Only now that I've stopped doing it do I realise that it can really impact on you and that it could cause long-term sleep and energy problems and really make people depressed. I think if you've got a vaguely sensitive constitution it's a really tough thing to do.\" Professor Neil Douglas, chairman of the British Sleep Foundation, argues that while the physical impact may be severe, the real strain of night shifts is on our mental capabilities. \"People who work nights are jeopardising their decision-making, their planning - and they are more likely to have accidents, simply because they are too sleepy. Just coming home from work is a high-risk activity since car accidents are much, much more common for night shift workers than day shift workers.\" The evidence is cast in both statistics and history. The highest number of errors and accidents on the road is between 3am and 5am - our body's most naturally sleepy time - and disruption of the body clock has also been implicated as one of the root causes of the Chernobyl and Challenger disasters. \"This is the downside to the invention of the light bulb,\" says Douglas. \"Before it existed people got their eight hours sleep in total darkness. Now people can stay up all night, but it's all to the detriment of their performance and to their health.\" But surely there must be simple of ways of tricking your body into thinking everything's all right? Going for a run when you get home, say, or having a quick nap during the night? \"Nothing helps,\" says Laura. \"It's just wrong and you can't fool your body into thinking it's right. There do seem to be a handful of people, largely men, who seem to adapt well to nights and are happy to do them for years, seeing their family in the mornings, but they are a tiny minority. \"You'll hear advice about breaking up your sleep - snatching four hours here and four hours there - but it's basically rubbish. The bottom line is that we should be tucked up in bed at night, and anything else will start to feel like torture after a while. And it takes a long time to get over - it can be months before you feel you've really recovered from a long run of nights.\" If you do have be awake at night, the best thing to do is avoid the triggers that tell you you are supposed to be awake \u0095 Try and leave work before it gets light.

In one of these lakes, on the busy Mathura Road, our third-hand Ambassador car chugged to a halt, leaving us stranded in the rain with a fretful two-year-old. </p> <p>We were on our way to an antenatal appointment at the Apollo hospital, 7kms away, at which the doctor was to tell me how much longer it was safe to let my pregnancy continue. By the time we arrived, my blood pressure was so high she refused to let me go home. I was to stay and be induced the next day. </p> <p>The mechanics of induction and acceleration of labour don't differ greatly from the processes in the UK. But it is the seemingly incidental details that make all the difference. Practices that were abandoned in most British hospitals at least 10 years ago, such as routine shaves and enemas, are still standard. Traditionally, Indian husbands stay out of the delivery room, although there was no objection to my husband Luke staying with me throughout. And unlike in the UK, where you might find beanbags, birthing pools and darkened rooms with CD players, at the prestigious Apollo hospital in New Delhi women are compelled to deliver in the operating theatre on a high narrow bed with lithotomy stirrups. </p> <p>After two days of \"latent phase\" labour pains, I began to dilate. When I asked whether it was possible for the labour to proceed naturally, my consultant replied curtly that she had come in specially on her day off and she thought we could get on with it. At 9.30am on a Sunday morning she broke my waters and the labour proceeded with agonising swiftness. </p> <p>Towards the end of the first stage, the gas and air cylinder ran out. The hospital staff had trouble locating a replacement, since their well-heeled clients almost universally opt for full epidurals. There was an excruciating delay while they found me another (and, worringly, the last) cylinder. After three hours, I was wheeled into the delivery theatre on a trolley. Baby Ruskin arrived 17 minutes later, to be whisked almost immediately to the hospital nursery. </p> <p>The postnatal advice from the Apollo seemed enlightened. I was encouraged to feed Ruskin at least 10 times a day and sleep with him in the same bed. In the Chelsea and Westminster hospital, where our daughter Tilly was born in 1997, the nurse vetoed this as a dangerous practice. Baby massage is also common across India. </p> <p>In the hours after the birth, our \"private\" room was periodically invaded by floor-sweepers, floor-washers, bedmakers, loo-roll changers (jobs being strictly demarcated), surface-wipers, and mosquito-sprayers. The security guards wandered in and smilingly demanded that we should give them \"sweets for a boy\", ie money to celebrate our miraculous good fortune in not giving birth to another unwanted girl-child. </p> <p>Faced with frequent interruptions to Ruskin's early feeds, we discharged ourselves the following morning and went home. The servants downstairs greeted us with delighted murmurings of \"laraka, laraka\" (a boy, a boy) and clearly word was already spreading. Within hours, two stubbly apparitions in saris turned up on our doorstep. The local eunuchs had heard about Ruskin's arrival. It is an auspicious Indian tradition for eunuchs to appear at births, where they bless the child in exchange for a large fee. In the case of new-borns, the eunuchs also inspect the child. If its gender is unclear, they take it away. </p> <p>We didn't give them any money. A day later, our phone line was cut through. We had the line repaired only for the same thing to happen again the following day. Asking around it seemed we got off lightly: another British expat who had just given birth had to barricade herself in while seven burly eunuchs tried to break down her door.

As I fed him I could watch the striped palm squirrels run along the top of the wall between the potted frangipani trees and bougainvillaea, look out at the Mughal tomb next door and hear the early evening muezzin.

This is not advice I follow very closely myself, but then, as la Rochefoucauld so wisely remarked, it is easier to give good advice than to take it.",

Try not to go outdoors in the evening when counts are high. To prevent symptoms building up, start using a nasal steroid spray, such as Beconase, two weeks before you expect symptoms to start and use it regularly while pollen counts are high. This prevents the nasal lining becoming sensitised to the pollen. Delaying treatment makes the hayfever more difficult to treat and last longer. If even liberal use of nasal steroids isn't enough, take an oral antihistamine, too. They are all much of a muchness, but Clarityn and Zirtek are particularly fashionable this year. Telfast is the least sedating and probably best choice for drivers and exam-takers. Eye drops containing nedocromil (Rapitil, Tilade) are good for streaming, itchy eyes. Oral or intramuscular steroid injections are available for those in dire straits.

But Mr Gerbeau promised today: \"I will not go back to the Millennium Commission for more grants, and the dome will be open until December 31. \"Based on the experience of the first few months, we now have realistic and credible forecasts for visitor numbers and the business.\" The government is expected to make a decision soon on which consortium will take over the dome when the Millennium Experience exhibition closes at the end of the year. The Japanese finance house Nomura wants to retain the attraction as a leisure site. The rival group Legacy plans to turn the dome into offices and workshops, creating a hi-tech residential campus.",

      "bodyText": "Two charity workers jailed for failing to stop heroin dealing at a Cambridge hostel for the homeless were freed on bail today pending the full hearing of their appeal against conviction. Loud cheers from the London court of appeal's packed public gallery greeted the verdict, although Lord Justice Rose warned that granting of bail and permission to appeal was no indication of the ultimate outcome of the controversial case, which will be heard again in October. After being found guilty of knowingly permitting the supply of heroin at the centre under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, Ruth Wyner, director of the Wintercomfort charity, was jailed for five years, while John Brock, manager of its Cambridge day centre, was sentenced to four years last December. There were scenes of jubilation outside the court cells as the pair were released. Hugging her husband, Gordon, and clutching a bunch of flowers from well-wishers, Mrs Wyner said: \"I am absolutely delighted. I'm looking forward to spending some precious time with my children and private time with my husband. The past seven months have been very tough indeed.\" Mr Brock said: \"I'm just overjoyed to be with my family again. I'm just looking forward to being with them. It's a cause for celebration.\" At the original King's Lynn crown court trial the jury had heard that police mounted a lengthy surveillance operation in 1998 which showed that the centre was regularly used by drug dealers. Judge Haworth said Wyner and Brock had created a \"haven for heroin dealers\" and their reliance on the confidentiality policy had effectively made them responsible for what was happening. The law, he said, did not permit them to operate their own private policy to provide themselves with a defence. But renowned human rights lawyer Michael Mansfield QC today won Wyner and Brock leave to appeal on the ground that Judge Haworth wrongly barred the jury from considering subjectively a major plank of the defence case. The charity had operated a policy of confidentiality under which information about the homeless and vulnerable people who attended the centre would not generally be passed on to outside agencies, including the police. Mr Mansfield said today that the policy was well-known to everyone involved in the charity, from the trustees down through the management council. And the police themselves, who were actively engaged in the homeless project, knew about it. There was no evidence that Wyner and Brock were ever expressly advised by the police that the policy was wrong, said Mr Mansfield. \"The policy, although physically written in part by Wyner, involved the council of management as well, so on that basis they also would be guilty,\" he said. \"That cannot be right. The jurors should have been told: 'You may look at that policy to decide whether it is a sham or a front. If you decide it was a genuine policy being pursued bona fide, was it reasonable not to take the step of giving names to the police?\"' Mr Mansfield said the case was of considerable importance to many people in similar management positions - including prison governors. It was unrealistic to expect a manager to report every instance of unlawful behaviour, otherwise \"open door\" hostels like Wintercomfort would be closed down and the homeless would be back on the streets. Charity workers like Wyner and Brock were trying, where others feared to tread, to restore the dignity and self-respect of vulnerable people who were often involved in drug and alcohol abuse, Mr Mansfield argued. Those objectives were extremely difficult to pursue on a \"purist\" basis. The jailing of Wyner and Brock angered many charity workers, and supporters staged marches, organised petitions and held vigils backing their appeal. Homeless charities are concerned that potential care workers will be deterred by the fear that they could end up in prison for failing to prevent an activity which is prevalent in many hostels.",

      "body": "<b>What does the latest report say?</b> <br> The Office for National Statistics says that the number of households with access to the internet in the first three months of 2000 was 6.5m, or one in four homes. That is twice as many as a year ago. The report is the first in a planned series of studies which will aim to monitor levels of internet access in Britain as part of the government's campaign to promote a \"new knowledge economy\". <p><b>Where does the digital divide come in?</b><br> The report exposes a divide between regions and between income groups. In Northern Ireland just 11% of people have access to the internet, and only 14% in Scotland and the north-east. London, the south-east and the east of England enjoy the highest levels of access, with 25%, 24% and 22% respectively.</p> <p><b>What about incomes?</b><br> Only 3% of the poorest households have access to the net, while 48% of the richest households are online. More middle income groups are getting online, but the largest increase came in the wealthiest households.</p> <p><b>What are the reasons for the digital divide?</b><br> High phone charges discourage people from going online and computer prices are still relatively high, although they are falling. A significant number of people remain sceptical about the supposed benefits of the internet.</p> <p><b>How does the government propose to get people wired up?</b><br> The government's UK Online project aims to put online facilities in all Britain's schools and libraries by 2002. It says the programme is on course to meet that target. But net experts say that in order to achieve the government's stated aim of universal internet access, people must be provided with the skills to do more than just consume information.</p> <p><b>Is there resistance to the net?</b><br> Apparently so. The latest annual internet survey from Which? Online, released today, says 15m Britons will not be going online because they feel the internet is irrelevant to their needs, with cost also being a significant barrier. But more than one in 10 of those people intended to get internet access within the next year. People with children were more likely to become connected.</p> <p><b>Why do people dislike the net?</b><br> Which? says 30% of the public were concerned that the internet represents a threat to high street shopping. Only 14% of internet users said they received better customer service online, and 51% were concerned about using a credit card online. However, seven out of 10 internet users had no qualms about forwarding their bank details into cyberspace.</p> <p><b>How may attitudes change?</b><br> The Which? survey says that internet service and content providers need to come up with a clear message as to how net sceptics can benefit from online activity. New methods of access such as interactive television and mobile phones, offering access without the expense of a PC, may change attitudes. But if they fail to do so, Which? warns that the digital divide may become a real problem. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/press_Release/CurrentReleases.asp\" target=\"_new\">National Office for Statistics</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.which.com/whatsnew/pr/jul00/general/survey.html\" target=\"_new\">Which?

Only 3% of the poorest households have access to the net, while 48% of the richest households are online. More middle income groups are getting online, but the largest increase came in the wealthiest households. What are the reasons for the digital divide? High phone charges discourage people from going online and computer prices are still relatively high, although they are falling. A significant number of people remain sceptical about the supposed benefits of the internet. How does the government propose to get people wired up? The government's UK Online project aims to put online facilities in all Britain's schools and libraries by 2002. It says the programme is on course to meet that target. But net experts say that in order to achieve the government's stated aim of universal internet access, people must be provided with the skills to do more than just consume information. Is there resistance to the net? Apparently so. The latest annual internet survey from Which? Online, released today, says 15m Britons will not be going online because they feel the internet is irrelevant to their needs, with cost also being a significant barrier. But more than one in 10 of those people intended to get internet access within the next year. People with children were more likely to become connected. Why do people dislike the net? Which? says 30% of the public were concerned that the internet represents a threat to high street shopping. Only 14% of internet users said they received better customer service online, and 51% were concerned about using a credit card online. However, seven out of 10 internet users had no qualms about forwarding their bank details into cyberspace. How may attitudes change? The Which? survey says that internet service and content providers need to come up with a clear message as to how net sceptics can benefit from online activity. New methods of access such as interactive television and mobile phones, offering access without the expense of a PC, may change attitudes. But if they fail to do so, Which? warns that the digital divide may become a real problem. Useful links National Office for Statistics Which? Online Are the money men killing the net?

That's the oxygen of democracy. We want to believe that politics will produce wonderful results. Looking at the Blair government now, you don't see the dirigible crashing to the ground. It is still quite airworthy. But much of the promise - our own passion to believe - has been exhaled. The government turns out to be an imperfect, struggling enterprise. It straddles the public instinct for cynicism as against optimism, for realism against aspiration. It has become a normal government.</p> <p>At the start, ridiculous expectations were understandable. The feeling of optimism was backed by certain facts. One party had been in power for 18 years. It was thrown out with exaltation. The country showed two fingers to Thatcher-Major, as was said in this space the day after the election. New Labour and Tony Blair would carry all before them. Whatever they did would improve on the recent past, but the optimism was greater than that. The election spoke to a common belief that all problems had solutions, and the right people would now find them.</p> <p>Mr Blair experienced this feeling, was aware that he personified it. Why act, and why vote, unless for something big? Actually he was cautious, promising no change for two years in the money spent on the things that mattered. But this was explained, and tolerated, as serious politics. While Blair has never had the media allegiance Mrs Thatcher enjoyed for her unpopular crusades, he was understood to be starting something that was new. It was to be revival- therapy for the nation. When he talked about fresh starts and new eras, and the erasing of important aspects of history, his hyperbole exceeded the cliches that normally attend such moments, but was forgiven because, to an extent not seen for two decades, people wanted it to be true.</p> <p>The other big fact was the size of the majority: 179. The contrast with Major could not have been larger. Whatever else Blair turned out to be, he would certainly be strong. He wouldn't be battered by his backbenchers. New Labour could do what it had told us it wanted. A new mandate, uniquely huge, would see off all enemies.</p> <p>And this is what started to happen. The government did do important things. It changed the constitution. It began to reform public services. It had no political trouble of the kind the country had grown used to over the last five Tory years. Its leader was a maestro of popular opinion, conducting it from the centre according to the score he had written. The other side became a voice unheard. The marginalisation of the Tories, which the nation had apparently decided on that May Day, duly occurred. The demand for two years of patience was agreed.</p> <p>In fact, though, the uniqueness had its limitations. Though the parliamentary effect was sweeping, the vote was not a national statement that exempted Blair from normal politics. Half a million fewer people voted for him than gave Major his hair's-breadth victory in 1992. The accidents of the voting system produced the illusion of a landslide. Time, it became clear, would not produce a landslide of gratitude for New Labour solutions after all. For the most part, time has only made clearer the scale of the difficulties. Having ridden in on such extraordinary expectations - part cultivated by them, part by us - ministers find they cannot meet them. The majority remains, but the politics of optimism are now resoundingly finished.</p> <p>We see, instead, the intransigence of problems. No matter where you look, this tends to be true. The latest episode of Nick Davies's ground-breaking reportage on education at the bottom end reveals crises which are amenable only to imperfect social responses, whichever party is in power. Under Labour as under the Tories, crime figures continue to rise. Whoever is running the country, the NHS will remain a marvellous idea that never gets enough resources. And so on. It is not that New Labour has failed, but that problems are even half-soluble only by tenacity, drudgery and an appetite for extremely slow results. Not just Britain but every advanced country in the world harbours social malfunctions that are at odds with the triumphalist rhythm of politicians' rhetoric.</p> <p>Facing another election, the two main British parties address this in their own ways, both of them out of sync with the public. The Labour way is to insist the balloon is not in any way deflated. Every problem must still have its answer. The impression of success must be sustained, whatever the evidence to the contrary. Where the problems are inextricably stubborn, such as over law and order, the solutions get more reckless. The prime minister goes abroad and suddenly promises to haul every drunken hooligan to a cash machine. Or he appoints Lord Birt, the ultimate miscast crony, as his personal brainstormer. Panic grips him. It is the panic of someone who fears being fatally punished for not making good on the mirage of May Day 1997.</p> <p>The Conservatives take the opposite tack, towards the politics of total cynicism. It is understandable, indeed traditional. They smack the government for every failure. They want to prick the balloon and empty it. But their opportunism under Mr Hague is more than usually obvious. Their education policy, announced last week, is the latest example. It seizes on public discontent, but its own answers are insultingly defective: no credible costings, no consideration of the issues around selection, not a word addressed to the agenda which Nick Davies can hardly be said to have invented. That is the other side of the politics that began on that famous day when we gulled ourselves into thinking we had voted to change the world.</p> <p>We now know different. It is the lesson of the deflated balloon. The public has the sense to see that many problems are intractably hard. There are no easy answers, perhaps no answers whatever, except palliatives. The flashier the response, the less trusted it rightly is. The further we get from 1997, the better we understand that the expectations which that election unleashed must be replaced by different virtues.</p> <p>What the public wants is not excitement and instant promise, but competence and simple honesty. The government can't at present be relied on for either. Its frantic law-and-order thrashing about shows abject incompetence. Its playing around with figures, trying to make the right impression come what may, means that next week's public spending review risks being greeted with an incredulous yawn. The high on which it started has shown us how little we should expect. But we can live with that. We are grown-ups. We can still be sure it will play an impossible hand better than the other lot.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

In fact, though, the uniqueness had its limitations. Though the parliamentary effect was sweeping, the vote was not a national statement that exempted Blair from normal politics. Half a million fewer people voted for him than gave Major his hair's-breadth victory in 1992. The accidents of the voting system produced the illusion of a landslide. Time, it became clear, would not produce a landslide of gratitude for New Labour solutions after all. For the most part, time has only made clearer the scale of the difficulties. Having ridden in on such extraordinary expectations - part cultivated by them, part by us - ministers find they cannot meet them. The majority remains, but the politics of optimism are now resoundingly finished. We see, instead, the intransigence of problems. No matter where you look, this tends to be true. The latest episode of Nick Davies's ground-breaking reportage on education at the bottom end reveals crises which are amenable only to imperfect social responses, whichever party is in power. Under Labour as under the Tories, crime figures continue to rise. Whoever is running the country, the NHS will remain a marvellous idea that never gets enough resources. And so on. It is not that New Labour has failed, but that problems are even half-soluble only by tenacity, drudgery and an appetite for extremely slow results. Not just Britain but every advanced country in the world harbours social malfunctions that are at odds with the triumphalist rhythm of politicians' rhetoric. Facing another election, the two main British parties address this in their own ways, both of them out of sync with the public. The Labour way is to insist the balloon is not in any way deflated. Every problem must still have its answer. The impression of success must be sustained, whatever the evidence to the contrary. Where the problems are inextricably stubborn, such as over law and order, the solutions get more reckless. The prime minister goes abroad and suddenly promises to haul every drunken hooligan to a cash machine. Or he appoints Lord Birt, the ultimate miscast crony, as his personal brainstormer. Panic grips him. It is the panic of someone who fears being fatally punished for not making good on the mirage of May Day 1997. The Conservatives take the opposite tack, towards the politics of total cynicism. It is understandable, indeed traditional. They smack the government for every failure. They want to prick the balloon and empty it. But their opportunism under Mr Hague is more than usually obvious. Their education policy, announced last week, is the latest example. It seizes on public discontent, but its own answers are insultingly defective: no credible costings, no consideration of the issues around selection, not a word addressed to the agenda which Nick Davies can hardly be said to have invented. That is the other side of the politics that began on that famous day when we gulled ourselves into thinking we had voted to change the world. We now know different. It is the lesson of the deflated balloon. The public has the sense to see that many problems are intractably hard. There are no easy answers, perhaps no answers whatever, except palliatives. The flashier the response, the less trusted it rightly is. The further we get from 1997, the better we understand that the expectations which that election unleashed must be replaced by different virtues. What the public wants is not excitement and instant promise, but competence and simple honesty. The government can't at present be relied on for either. Its frantic law-and-order thrashing about shows abject incompetence. Its playing around with figures, trying to make the right impression come what may, means that next week's public spending review risks being greeted with an incredulous yawn. The high on which it started has shown us how little we should expect. But we can live with that. We are grown-ups. We can still be sure it will play an impossible hand better than the other lot. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

Who are these dissidents who say the HIV virus is not the cause of Aids? There are quite a number of them now. The chief dissident, whose ideas are said to influence Thabo Mbeki, is Peter Duesberg, the professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Berkeley, California. What are the implications if HIV is not the cause of Aids? Prof Duesberg says that Aids is not infectious. If that is so, there is no need for safe sex. There is also no need for drugs to prevent mothers transmitting HIV to their babies. How is it possible for the dissidents to dispute the scientific evidence? Prof Duesberg argues that there are people carrying the HIV virus who develop no symptoms of disease and that HIV has not been shown to induce Aids. Is he right on either count? Not according to the conventional scientists.They say that the simian immuno-deficiency virus (SIV), a close relative of HIV, has been proven to cause Aids in monkeys, even if the direct proof of HIV causing Aids is not yet available. Does Prof Duesberg have other arguments? Yes. He says HIV cannot be infectious, because viruses and bacteria work fast. HIV may not cause Aids for five to 10 years. International scientists say he is plain wrong. The laboratory evidence for HIV causing Aids is clearly incomplete. What else do the scientists rely on? The epidemiological evidence. In every country where Aids has appeared, says viral oncologist Robin Weiss, HIV has preceded it. \"HIV is the singular common factor that is shared between Aids cases in gay men in San Francisco, well-nourished young women in Uganda, haemophiliacs in Japan and children in Romanian orphanages,\" he wrote in a demolition of the Duesberg hypothesis in Nature magazine, 10 years ago.

      "body": "<p>Schlu\u00df mit der Atomenergie. Deutschland steigt aus. In 32 Jahren. Endg\u00fcltig. Endg\u00fcltig? Diese Frage wird wohl offen bleiben. Vor wenigen Tagen haben sich Bundesregierung und Stromwirtschaft auf einen Kompromi\u00df im Ausstieg aus der Atomkraft geeinigt. Noch rund 30 Jahre sollen die Kernkraftwerke laufen - moderne Anlagen etwas l\u00e4nger, \u00e4ltere etwas k\u00fcrzer. </p> <p>Doch was Rot-Gr\u00fcn in harten Debatten durchgesetzt hat, will Schwarz nicht gelten lassen: Eine unionsgef\u00fchrte Bundesregierung werde den Ausstieg auf keinen Fall fortsetzen, hat CDU-Chefin Angela Merkel bereits angek\u00fcndigt. Atomkraft ja, Atomkraft nein, Atomkraft ja . . . Erinnert ein wenig an das Spiel, das Verliebte spielen, wenn sie Blatt um Blatt von einer Blume rei\u00dfen, um herauszufinden, ob der oder die Liebste sie mag. </p> <p>Kritik an den Kernpunkten des Ausstiegs gibt es genug. Noch ein Vierteljahrhundert lang soll Atomm\u00fcll produziert werden, ohne da\u00df es bereits eine vern\u00fcnftige L\u00f6sung f\u00fcr die Lagerung des Atomm\u00fclls gebe. \"Wenn uns das als Ausstieg verkauft wird, ist das ein Hohn\", betonten die Sprecher von Umweltinitiativen. Halbherzig nennen es andere, selbst die Atommeiler abzuschalten, um dann aus Nachbarl\u00e4ndern Atomstrom zu importieren. Und sogar besagte Nachbarn sind ver\u00e4ngstigt. Wo sollen die Mitarbeiter der Wiederaufbereitungsanlage La Hague in Frankreich arbeiten, wenn es aus Deutschland bald gar nichts mehr zur Aufbereitung geben wird? Wir haben uns bei Jugendlichen erkundigt, wie sie den Einstieg in den Ausstieg beurteilen. </p> <p> <strong> Deutschland will seine Atommeiler herunterfahren. Was haltet Ihr vom Ausstieg aus der Kernkraft?</strong></p> <p><strong>Iris (16): </strong> Ich finde es gut, da\u00df wir diesen Schritt machen wollen. Gleichzeitig ist es aber eine Farce, wenn wir danach Atomstrom aus dem Ausland importieren, nur weil wir feststellen, da\u00df wir unseren Bedarf nicht mehr selbst decken k\u00f6nnen. Und ich bef\u00fcrchte, dazu k\u00f6nnte es kommen. </p> <p> <strong> Fritz (15): </strong> Ich habe zwar keine Angst vor Atomenergie, bin einem Ausstieg aber nicht abgeneigt. Es gibt gen\u00fcgend Alternativen. Wind-, Solar-, Wasserenergie. Jetzt mu\u00df man eben einen Ausweg suchen. </p> <p> <strong> Sabrina (17): </strong> Deutschland ist ein kleines Land, das diesen Schritt wagt. Der Ausstieg sollte aber noch viel weiter gehen. Alle anderen L\u00e4nder m\u00fc\u00dften sich auch nach anderen M\u00f6glichkeiten umsehen. Man sieht doch, was mit Kernkraftwerken passieren kann. Wenn ich nur an Tschernobyl zur\u00fcckdenke... Da haben wir mehr abgekriegt, als wir immer gedacht haben. Leider mu\u00df wahrscheinlich wie so oft erst etwas passieren, bevor auch die anderen Schlu\u00df machen. </p> <p> <strong> Welche Alternativen zur Atomenergie seht ihr?</strong></p> <p><strong>Claudia (18): </strong> Ich denke da vor allem an Sonnen- und Windenergie. Auf jeden Fall sollte man nicht wieder auf Kohle zur\u00fcckgreifen. Ich gehe sogar soweit: Die L\u00e4nder, die im Moment noch Strom aus Kohlekraftwerken gewinnen, sollten gar nicht mehr den Schritt zur Atomenergie wagen, sondern ihn einfach \u00fcberspringen. Regenerative Rohstoffe m\u00fc\u00dften auf der ganzen Welt viel mehr zur Energiegewinnung genutzt werden. </p> <p> <strong> Markus (14): </strong> Ich setze vor allem auf eine Energiegewinnung, die nicht so viele Abfallstoffe hinterl\u00e4\u00dft. All die Transporte von gebrauchten Brennelementen, all die Endlager . . .

Auf Kosten der Sicherheit darf der Atomausstieg doch nicht gehen, oder? </p> <p> <strong> Claudia: </strong> Ich denke, da\u00df vor allem die Gr\u00fcnen ihr Gesicht verloren haben. Ein Ausstieg nach \u00fcber 30 Jahren kann f\u00fcr sie kein befriedigender Kompromi\u00df sein. Ich glaube, sie haben einfach zugestimmt, um die Koalition nicht zu gef\u00e4hrden.

      "body": "<p>In the least surprising move since Patsy Kensit left Liam Gallagher, the Lawn Tennis Association has announced that it wants to employ Venus and Serena Williams to promote tennis in Britain's inner-city areas. </p> <p>The last black woman to win Wimbledon was Evonne Goolagong Cawley, in 1971 and 1980. Then a 20-year drought \u0096 though Zina Garrison made the final (and inspired Richard Williams) in 1990. Now the LTA, a body so conservative that it makes the MCC look like the SWP, has been handed two evangelists on a plate.</p> <p> The Williams may rub people up the wrong way in the locker room but on court they win points, plaudits and passion. The sight of Venus bounding around Centre Court like Tigger was enough to bring a wobbly lower-lip to even the most sceptical watcher in the Royal Box. And that semi-final, though it didn't live up to its billing, was the most eagerly anticipated match of Wimbledon 2000 - even more than Henman v Philippoussis or Rafter v Sampras. Not bad for a tournament in which the male champion's prize money still outweighs the women's by \u00a347,500 (though the gap is closing), ostensibly because people would rather watch men play.</p> <p>That cricket could do with a similar Billy Graham figure has been said, and dreamt about, endlessly. Many all-time greats have been black, but no black English player has ever completely captured the public's imagination. Devon Malcolm perhaps came closest. Otherwise: Chris Lewis? Gladstone Small? Norman Cowans? Nice men, yes; Wisden Cricketers of the Century, no. However this roll call is sparkling when compared to the women's game. </p> <p>Since England's women began playing international cricket in 1934-35, no black woman has ever played for them. Never in a Test, never in a one-day international.</p> <p>The reasons are fairly obvious. Until the 1990s cricket was dying in most state schools. Even now, in times of Kwik cricket and praiseworthy ECB initiatives, a quick glance at the list of girls' secondary schools that play cricket reveals them to be almost exclusively private.</p> <p>A recent survey of 465 adults with children at school by Brand and Issues for sportscore.co.uk has shown that parents spend 25% less on sports gear for their daughters than for their sons.

      "bodyText": "In the least surprising move since Patsy Kensit left Liam Gallagher, the Lawn Tennis Association has announced that it wants to employ Venus and Serena Williams to promote tennis in Britain's inner-city areas. The last black woman to win Wimbledon was Evonne Goolagong Cawley, in 1971 and 1980. Then a 20-year drought \u0096 though Zina Garrison made the final (and inspired Richard Williams) in 1990. Now the LTA, a body so conservative that it makes the MCC look like the SWP, has been handed two evangelists on a plate. The Williams may rub people up the wrong way in the locker room but on court they win points, plaudits and passion. The sight of Venus bounding around Centre Court like Tigger was enough to bring a wobbly lower-lip to even the most sceptical watcher in the Royal Box. And that semi-final, though it didn't live up to its billing, was the most eagerly anticipated match of Wimbledon 2000 - even more than Henman v Philippoussis or Rafter v Sampras. Not bad for a tournament in which the male champion's prize money still outweighs the women's by \u00a347,500 (though the gap is closing), ostensibly because people would rather watch men play. That cricket could do with a similar Billy Graham figure has been said, and dreamt about, endlessly. Many all-time greats have been black, but no black English player has ever completely captured the public's imagination. Devon Malcolm perhaps came closest. Otherwise: Chris Lewis? Gladstone Small? Norman Cowans? Nice men, yes; Wisden Cricketers of the Century, no. However this roll call is sparkling when compared to the women's game. Since England's women began playing international cricket in 1934-35, no black woman has ever played for them. Never in a Test, never in a one-day international. The reasons are fairly obvious. Until the 1990s cricket was dying in most state schools. Even now, in times of Kwik cricket and praiseworthy ECB initiatives, a quick glance at the list of girls' secondary schools that play cricket reveals them to be almost exclusively private. A recent survey of 465 adults with children at school by Brand and Issues for sportscore.co.uk has shown that parents spend 25% less on sports gear for their daughters than for their sons. When decent cricket bats aren't exactly cheap, you can see why girls from poorer families will not be encouraged to play. The same survey shows that parents spend 15% more on books for their daughters than their sons, but as it is likely that this extra allowance is being spent on Judy Blume and Sweet Valley High rather than the Art of Cricket or Beyond A Boundary, this doesn't offer much relief to the ECB. There are young black players coming through. And not everybody needs a role model in exactly the same mould as them. Women idolise men, white men idolise black men, and the other way round. But to have a figure of the Williams' exuberance and star quality emerging in the England Women's team would do more for England's prospects than all the ECB special initiatives in the world.

      "body": "<p>In June 1982 a little-known Eurocrat, Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, delivered a little-noticed speech to the second symposium of European banks. It was the month when the Argentinians surrendered the Falkland Islands, the Israelis invaded Lebanon and the late Princess Diana gave birth to Prince William. But Padoa-Schioppa, the then director of economic and financial affairs at the European commission, had other things on his mind. Expounding and expanding his views on the liberalisation of capital, he started by quoting article 67 of the Treaty of Rome; he ended by calling for a single currency. \"Fully fledged European monetary union is the high road to policy coordination and economic convergence,\" he said. \"It would be sufficient to realise one major achievement: monetary union.\" </p> <p>The speech was never going to make the headlines. Talks entitled Capital Mobility: Why is the Treaty not Implemented? rarely do. Moreover, 18 years ago, advocating a single currency was much like calling for the world to speak Esperanto - idealism masquerading as common sense. An intellectual house of cards which would collapse at the first whiff of reality. Now it is a reality, albeit a faltering and controversial one. And Padoa-Schioppa, who is now a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB), has been key to making it one. The Financial Times has described him as: \"One of a small group of people who can claim that they invented the single currency.\" Sir David Walker, the chairman and chief executive of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter Europe, who worked alongside Padoa-Schioppa over several decades, goes further, describing him as: \"The central figure in the thinking that lead to a new Europe.\" </p> <p>At a time when the issue in Britain is wrapped up in evasions, distortions and semantic arguments, might a visit to the man who started it all cast a little light on a debate which often feels as though it is being held in semi-darkness? Perhaps this quintessential European, this Italian who lives in Germany, spent his childhood in France and thinks in English, can offer us a glimpse of the European ideal in its purest form? </p> <p>You will find him amid the alphabet soup of acronyms which make up the European lexicon, in between Pace (Programme of Advanced Continuing Education) and Palabre (a project con cerned with the integration of artificial intelligence). In Britain he is as little known as ever. But among the relatively small circles who follow the twist sand turns of EU development, he is the brains behind the project which has united much of Europe, is dividing the present UK government and brought down the last one. </p> <p>He was the secretary of the Delors committee whose report in 1989 returned the issue of monetary union to centre stage and provided a blueprint for the Maastricht Treaty. The man who drew up the initial draft of the Rome Extraordinary Summit of October 1990; one of the \"Gang of Four\" who prepared all the technical and diplomatic stages which led to the \"Rome conclusions\". These, in turn, declared January 1994 as the beginning of the second stage of a more intensive economic and monetary coordination before the creation of a central bank. He was there when the vital documents were passed from the civil servants to elected premiers to sign; he is there in Frankfurt supporting the euro on the world stage. </p> <p>But back in 1982, when he delivered his speech, such progress seemed a long way off. \"There is a difference between what you think is necessary and what you think is possible,\" he says. \"In the early 80s I was convinced that European monetary union was necessary. This was not a Damascene conversion but something that occurred to me over a period of time.\" His role in its construction was not upfront at the despatch boxes of individual European parliaments, where the political battles were being waged, but in the thinking, crafting and drafting behind the scenes. </p> <p>\"We all have a range of activities at our disposal which go from participating in intellectual debate into more concrete policy statements and positions,\" he says referring to his speech in 1982. \"I regarded this idea as a part of an intellectual debate.\" His versatility and discipline in this regard, says Walker, is awesome. \"He has an extraordinary capacity to see both the wood and the trees at the same time. He can see the big vision from the top down and the details from the bottom up. He sits with a blank piece of paper and maps out an entire strategy. He'll say 'There are 24 steps here', and then he'll go through them all systematically.\" </p> <p>This is also how he talks: in precise measured sentences often punctuated by numbers. There are \"three\" reasons why the euro has been a success; \"two\" conflicting problems with speaking a foreign language; and \"two\" strands to Britain's negotiating techniques. </p> <p>It is a degree of precision which does not just stop at his speech but which is clear from his clothes and general appearance. He keeps himself fit - he is a very young 59 - with a daily exercise regime which lasts exactly 11 minutes. His suit, like his hair, is a well-cut grey. A small man with a large brain rattling around in a huge office on the 34th of the European central bank. It is a vast plot in the middle of the Frankfurt skyline with space enough for a badminton court and a few table-tennis tables. The enormous windows offer an impressive view of a rather unimpressive, anodyne city. </p> <p>He is very much the product of both his age and his upbringing, brought up in the north-east of Italy by a father who worked in insurance and a mother who raised four children. \"Both my parents were intellectuals. My father had been a teacher. We were a cultivated family.\" </p> <p>Born in 1940, he is part of the generation of continental Europeans whose views on the future of Europe were shaped by the aftermath of the second world war. With despair just behind them, they were intoxicated with optimism that in an age of reason they could construct a better world than their parents. </p> <p>\"I first met my father when I was five when he came back from the war. It was a time not so much of poverty but real indigence. People of this generation grew up with a strong conviction that the unity of Europe was the only way out.\" </p> <p>He became a model European. He learned German at school and during a gap year in Bremen, English as a graduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and French during holidays in the Alps. He dreams in Italian and thinks in either Italian, French or English. \"I tend to think in the language in which I'm working at the time. But for most things I very much like to use English even though it is not my mother tongue because it is more concise, more precise, more concrete. It's like being an artisan. I have to weigh up how refined the tool is in my hands and how much I like to use it.\" </p> <p>Economics was not the obvious conduit for all these talents. As a young man he was far more taken with history and philosophy, but felt the need to apply those disciplines in the real world: \"I needed to do something closer to reality. </p> <p>\"Economics was the compromise, but in a way it was quite painful for me to be an economist.\" When his contemporaries were taking to the streets to bring down capitalism throughout the western world, Padoa-Schioppa was helping to shore it up with a job at the Italian Central Bank. After that came various high-level jobs related to banking, economics and finance, both in Italy and the European Commission. </p> <p>He was not the first person to have proposed a single currency. There are several people who could make that claim to fame, although the chief responsibility sits on the fragile shoulders of Pierre Werner, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, who is now 87 and recently suffered a stroke. In 1970 he put his name to the report which called for the establishment of EMU and a European Central Bank by 1980. But the economic slump of the 70s jettisoned Werner's plans and they were not to be fully considered again until the Delors committee got together in the late 80s. </p> <p>If anything, Padoa-Schioppa likes to play down his role. It was not until the late 80s that he started to think that a single currency had gone from a necessity to a possibility. \"There was no single moment when it went from a dream to a reality,\" he says. \"But there were several decisive moments. The Delors committee, the inter-governmental conference, the agreement of the heads of state were among them.\" And throughout there was always the possibility of failure. \"There were moments when the whole thing could have fallen apart. The positive additions were always partial developments; but any negative developments would have been total. The biggest risk came with the currency crisis of 1992 - most people at that stage thought the likelihood of us achieving EMU was very low.\" </p> <p>Even though he doesn't say it, chief among the headaches throughout this time were the recalcitrant British. He seems quite bemused and not a little impressed by Britain's negotiating strategy. \"They did it in a masterful way. First they influenced the substance of the project so that it would be more suitable to them if they did want to sign up to it. And then they carve out a special status for themselves which means they do not have to sign up to it.\" </p> <p>He is not worried by Britain's decision to stay out of the euro. In fact he thinks that unless Britain emerges with a pro-European consensus its inclusion could damage Britain and destabilise the entire project. \"In most European countries a shift in politics does not fundamentally change the country's European policy,\" he says. \"There is not much difference between Kohl and Schroeder or Juppe and Jospin when it comes to supporting the EU process. But there are some countries where this is not the case, such as the United Kingdom, where the fundamental attitude of the population is not united behind the European Union. So long as they are not members of Euroland this fragility of support does not worry me. I would be concerned if this fragility remained and they were part of Euroland.\" </p> <p> That said, from the outset Euroland has seemed to have done a pretty good job of exuding fragility all on its own. No sooner had the euro been released than the market took it by the scruff of the neck and threw it down so hard it sank below the dollar and has yet to surface. \"I did take it as a sign of a bad start but not as a crisis,\" Padoa-Schioppa says. \"To some extent in the financial world perceptions are a reality and even misperceptions can be a reality and so its decline was significant in that sense. But the day it actually fell below the dollar was not important to me. I remember what I was doing the day Kennedy was assassinated [studying English on a course in Britain] or when man first walked on the moon [on a trip to Maine from Boston]. But I don't remember the day the Euro fell below the pound. </p> <p>\"British people are worried by the strong pound and we were concerned about a weak Euro. The real sign of success, or lack of success, is that the euro is accepted as a reality . . . that it is here to stay in Euroland. Nobody, not the financial system, the market, the unions, business sectors, questions the fact that the euro is a fait accompli .\" Unless, that is, you happen to live in Britain, where almost everybody questions that very fact. Most people still do not want it, and a referendum (when and if it comes) is as likely to split families and friends as parties and governments. To some it represents a threat to our sovereignty; to others the most potent symbol of our xenophobic insularity. But to Padoa-Schioppa it is money that can be used from \"Lisbon to Leipzig\". Something that started as necessary, became possible and now, he believes, is unavoidable.</p>",

An intellectual house of cards which would collapse at the first whiff of reality. Now it is a reality, albeit a faltering and controversial one. And Padoa-Schioppa, who is now a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank (ECB), has been key to making it one. The Financial Times has described him as: \"One of a small group of people who can claim that they invented the single currency.\" Sir David Walker, the chairman and chief executive of Morgan Stanley and Dean Witter Europe, who worked alongside Padoa-Schioppa over several decades, goes further, describing him as: \"The central figure in the thinking that lead to a new Europe.\" At a time when the issue in Britain is wrapped up in evasions, distortions and semantic arguments, might a visit to the man who started it all cast a little light on a debate which often feels as though it is being held in semi-darkness? Perhaps this quintessential European, this Italian who lives in Germany, spent his childhood in France and thinks in English, can offer us a glimpse of the European ideal in its purest form? You will find him amid the alphabet soup of acronyms which make up the European lexicon, in between Pace (Programme of Advanced Continuing Education) and Palabre (a project con cerned with the integration of artificial intelligence). In Britain he is as little known as ever. But among the relatively small circles who follow the twist sand turns of EU development, he is the brains behind the project which has united much of Europe, is dividing the present UK government and brought down the last one. He was the secretary of the Delors committee whose report in 1989 returned the issue of monetary union to centre stage and provided a blueprint for the Maastricht Treaty. The man who drew up the initial draft of the Rome Extraordinary Summit of October 1990; one of the \"Gang of Four\" who prepared all the technical and diplomatic stages which led to the \"Rome conclusions\". These, in turn, declared January 1994 as the beginning of the second stage of a more intensive economic and monetary coordination before the creation of a central bank. He was there when the vital documents were passed from the civil servants to elected premiers to sign; he is there in Frankfurt supporting the euro on the world stage. But back in 1982, when he delivered his speech, such progress seemed a long way off. \"There is a difference between what you think is necessary and what you think is possible,\" he says. \"In the early 80s I was convinced that European monetary union was necessary. This was not a Damascene conversion but something that occurred to me over a period of time.\" His role in its construction was not upfront at the despatch boxes of individual European parliaments, where the political battles were being waged, but in the thinking, crafting and drafting behind the scenes. \"We all have a range of activities at our disposal which go from participating in intellectual debate into more concrete policy statements and positions,\" he says referring to his speech in 1982. \"I regarded this idea as a part of an intellectual debate.\" His versatility and discipline in this regard, says Walker, is awesome. \"He has an extraordinary capacity to see both the wood and the trees at the same time. He can see the big vision from the top down and the details from the bottom up. He sits with a blank piece of paper and maps out an entire strategy. He'll say 'There are 24 steps here', and then he'll go through them all systematically.\" This is also how he talks: in precise measured sentences often punctuated by numbers. There are \"three\" reasons why the euro has been a success; \"two\" conflicting problems with speaking a foreign language; and \"two\" strands to Britain's negotiating techniques. It is a degree of precision which does not just stop at his speech but which is clear from his clothes and general appearance. He keeps himself fit - he is a very young 59 - with a daily exercise regime which lasts exactly 11 minutes. His suit, like his hair, is a well-cut grey. A small man with a large brain rattling around in a huge office on the 34th of the European central bank. It is a vast plot in the middle of the Frankfurt skyline with space enough for a badminton court and a few table-tennis tables. The enormous windows offer an impressive view of a rather unimpressive, anodyne city. He is very much the product of both his age and his upbringing, brought up in the north-east of Italy by a father who worked in insurance and a mother who raised four children. \"Both my parents were intellectuals. My father had been a teacher. We were a cultivated family.\" Born in 1940, he is part of the generation of continental Europeans whose views on the future of Europe were shaped by the aftermath of the second world war. With despair just behind them, they were intoxicated with optimism that in an age of reason they could construct a better world than their parents. \"I first met my father when I was five when he came back from the war. It was a time not so much of poverty but real indigence. People of this generation grew up with a strong conviction that the unity of Europe was the only way out.\" He became a model European. He learned German at school and during a gap year in Bremen, English as a graduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and French during holidays in the Alps. He dreams in Italian and thinks in either Italian, French or English. \"I tend to think in the language in which I'm working at the time. But for most things I very much like to use English even though it is not my mother tongue because it is more concise, more precise, more concrete. It's like being an artisan. I have to weigh up how refined the tool is in my hands and how much I like to use it.\" Economics was not the obvious conduit for all these talents. As a young man he was far more taken with history and philosophy, but felt the need to apply those disciplines in the real world: \"I needed to do something closer to reality. \"Economics was the compromise, but in a way it was quite painful for me to be an economist.\" When his contemporaries were taking to the streets to bring down capitalism throughout the western world, Padoa-Schioppa was helping to shore it up with a job at the Italian Central Bank. After that came various high-level jobs related to banking, economics and finance, both in Italy and the European Commission. He was not the first person to have proposed a single currency. There are several people who could make that claim to fame, although the chief responsibility sits on the fragile shoulders of Pierre Werner, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, who is now 87 and recently suffered a stroke. In 1970 he put his name to the report which called for the establishment of EMU and a European Central Bank by 1980. But the economic slump of the 70s jettisoned Werner's plans and they were not to be fully considered again until the Delors committee got together in the late 80s. If anything, Padoa-Schioppa likes to play down his role. It was not until the late 80s that he started to think that a single currency had gone from a necessity to a possibility. \"There was no single moment when it went from a dream to a reality,\" he says. \"But there were several decisive moments. The Delors committee, the inter-governmental conference, the agreement of the heads of state were among them.\" And throughout there was always the possibility of failure. \"There were moments when the whole thing could have fallen apart. The positive additions were always partial developments; but any negative developments would have been total. The biggest risk came with the currency crisis of 1992 - most people at that stage thought the likelihood of us achieving EMU was very low.\" Even though he doesn't say it, chief among the headaches throughout this time were the recalcitrant British. He seems quite bemused and not a little impressed by Britain's negotiating strategy. \"They did it in a masterful way. First they influenced the substance of the project so that it would be more suitable to them if they did want to sign up to it. And then they carve out a special status for themselves which means they do not have to sign up to it.\" He is not worried by Britain's decision to stay out of the euro. In fact he thinks that unless Britain emerges with a pro-European consensus its inclusion could damage Britain and destabilise the entire project. \"In most European countries a shift in politics does not fundamentally change the country's European policy,\" he says. \"There is not much difference between Kohl and Schroeder or Juppe and Jospin when it comes to supporting the EU process. But there are some countries where this is not the case, such as the United Kingdom, where the fundamental attitude of the population is not united behind the European Union. So long as they are not members of Euroland this fragility of support does not worry me. I would be concerned if this fragility remained and they were part of Euroland.\" That said, from the outset Euroland has seemed to have done a pretty good job of exuding fragility all on its own. No sooner had the euro been released than the market took it by the scruff of the neck and threw it down so hard it sank below the dollar and has yet to surface. \"I did take it as a sign of a bad start but not as a crisis,\" Padoa-Schioppa says. \"To some extent in the financial world perceptions are a reality and even misperceptions can be a reality and so its decline was significant in that sense. But the day it actually fell below the dollar was not important to me. I remember what I was doing the day Kennedy was assassinated [studying English on a course in Britain] or when man first walked on the moon [on a trip to Maine from Boston]. But I don't remember the day the Euro fell below the pound. \"British people are worried by the strong pound and we were concerned about a weak Euro. The real sign of success, or lack of success, is that the euro is accepted as a reality . . . that it is here to stay in Euroland. Nobody, not the financial system, the market, the unions, business sectors, questions the fact that the euro is a fait accompli .\" Unless, that is, you happen to live in Britain, where almost everybody questions that very fact. Most people still do not want it, and a referendum (when and if it comes) is as likely to split families and friends as parties and governments. To some it represents a threat to our sovereignty; to others the most potent symbol of our xenophobic insularity. But to Padoa-Schioppa it is money that can be used from \"Lisbon to Leipzig\". Something that started as necessary, became possible and now, he believes, is unavoidable.",

      "bodyText": "An armed gangster who took a woman hostage and shot five people during a 50-mile car chase was given eight life sentences yesterday. Olatunde Adetoro repeatedly fired a Kalashnikov AK47 assault rifle and a Smith and Wesson pistol as he attempted to shake off his police pursuers. Mr Justice Douglas Brown said the gangster's disregard for human life placed him in a special category of dangerousness. He said he should be released only when he was no longer considered a danger. The judge told Adetoro, 30, of no fixed address, and his two co-defendants that they had brought real terror to people. Adetoro was convicted at Manchester crown court of 21 charges including the attempted murder of a police officer, a motorist and cyclist, kidnap, using firearms to resist arrest and threatening to kill a motorist. Francis Dixon, 24, from Newton Heath, Manchester, was given life for carrying firearms with intent to commit robbery. Andrew Dennis, 24, of Failsworth, Manchester, was given 15 years for the same offence. During a seven-week trial, the jury heard that the episode was one of the most remarkable in recent criminal history. Adetoro decided to shoot passers-by in a desperate attempt to stop police following the gang through Lancashire and Greater Manchester. The car chase had begun after a chance discovery by a plainclothes policeman of three men kitted out for armed robbery on a slip road of the M6 near Lancaster. Adetoro and Dennis were chased in one car and Dixon escaped separately. Adetoro put on a balaclava and fired a handgun at police officers who stopped them on the motorway. At traffic lights near Bolton, they ordered Melanie Williams out of her car at gunpoint and drove off in her car. When they reached Bolton they hijacked a silver BMW and took pedestrian Amanda Ryan hostage - forcing her into the back of the vehicle at gunpoint. She heard Adetoro suggest to Dennis that they should shoot someone. Their first victim was Peter Hayles, a cable installer, who was shot in the leg by Adetoro as he worked on the main Bury to Rochdale road. A mile later community doctor Saranth Senerath-Yapa was shot as he drove to work - fracturing his arm. Martin McKay Smith, a solicitor, was shot in the leg on his motorcycle as he passed the car. Pensioner James Gallagher was shot in the leg at a bus stop and cyclist David Hassall was hit by a bullet in the back. Other shots narrowly missed police officers. When Adetoro and Dennis were arrested in Rochdale they were carrying guns, balaclavas and boilersuits. Dixon was caught in Bolton. Adetoro, who is well connected in the Manchester underworld and is believed to have connections with the West Indian Yardie gangs, said he did not realise it was the police chasing him and he was unable to remember shooting any civilians. He claimed to be in fear of his life. After the case ended, Detective Superintendent Dave Brown praised the courage of police who were fired on. \"They dealt with it with great courage. It is a matter of deep regret that so many innocent people were injured, but we are thankful that no one was killed,\" he said. PC Dave Bentley was shot at when he stopped the gunman's car on the motorway. \"It was an extremely frightening experience,\" he said. \"I was lucky in that I just ducked and felt the bullet part my hair. If I hadn't ducked, it would have hit me straight in the chest.\" He has since been unable to work on outside duties.

Her rise to fame - due largely to her unfailing ability to talk about make-up in the face of adversity - always seemed to me a puzzle. One minute she was writing emails about the latest lip gloss for her dying friend Ruth Picardie, the next she was being offered untold funds to write about it for the Sunday Times. Her uniquely defiant stance on why, as a Clever Woman, she should not be prevented from drivelling on about mules, won her a lot of admirers among men who like to hear women going on like that. I've never heard a good thing about India Knight from a woman.</p> <p>For the people it is actually aimed at, My Life On a Plate is set to be a big disappointment. Unlike Bridget Jones, it isn't funny, charming or familiar. There's nothing to identify with. Its heroine, Clara, is too much India to make it as Everywoman. No one's going to think, \"My god, that's me\", just a no one else would live in a house like India's or holiday with the Self family. In its every detail, India's life and outlook is unique. Which might have been OK if it had gained something in the translation. As it is, reading My Life is a little like looking at the holiday slides of someone you don't give a fig for. Uninteresting themselves and less appealing than a postcard of the locations they cover, you wonder why they thought that anyone would want to follow their progress through this market and that tourist attraction. You get the same feeling for India's ouevre. You're never going to go there, so why bother?</p>",

Her rise to fame - due largely to her unfailing ability to talk about make-up in the face of adversity - always seemed to me a puzzle. One minute she was writing emails about the latest lip gloss for her dying friend Ruth Picardie, the next she was being offered untold funds to write about it for the Sunday Times. Her uniquely defiant stance on why, as a Clever Woman, she should not be prevented from drivelling on about mules, won her a lot of admirers among men who like to hear women going on like that. I've never heard a good thing about India Knight from a woman. For the people it is actually aimed at, My Life On a Plate is set to be a big disappointment. Unlike Bridget Jones, it isn't funny, charming or familiar. There's nothing to identify with. Its heroine, Clara, is too much India to make it as Everywoman. No one's going to think, \"My god, that's me\", just a no one else would live in a house like India's or holiday with the Self family. In its every detail, India's life and outlook is unique. Which might have been OK if it had gained something in the translation. As it is, reading My Life is a little like looking at the holiday slides of someone you don't give a fig for. Uninteresting themselves and less appealing than a postcard of the locations they cover, you wonder why they thought that anyone would want to follow their progress through this market and that tourist attraction. You get the same feeling for India's ouevre. You're never going to go there, so why bother?",

      "body": "<p>A chill wind has blown through the technology sector since the collapse of the Nasdaq index in the spring but certain sectors remain hot. One is optical networking, and news of a mega-merger in the US was enough to bring further gains for Oxford's <strong> Bookham Technology</strong> yesterday. </p> <p>Shares in the optical technology specialist, \u00a310.00 on flotation in April, surged 440p to \u00a346.60 in the wake of the $41bn all-stock merger of fibre optics makers JDS Uniphase and SDL. </p> <p>Dealers said it was good news for Bookham on two fronts. Bookham supplies JDS with arrayed wave guides, crucial in the transmission of data along fibre optic cables. Merger with SDL means a bigger potential market for AWD. The deal also gives a pointer to Bookham's worth. </p> <p>\"There aren't too many companies is this area and evidence of consolidation can only be good news,\" one sector specialist said. </p> <p>Bookham is due to report second-quarter results on August 9 and strong figures are expected. </p> <p>Despite the fine performance of Bookham, the FTSE 100 closed the session down 31.3 points lower at 6,466.2. Volume was a meagre 950m by the official close of trade as institutional investors sat on their hands. </p> <p>London's equity market faces a number of tests this week starting with figures from internet group Yahoo! today and ending with US producer price figures on Friday. </p> <p>Dealers fear that weak figures from Yahoo! or Motorola on Wednesday could see valuations of new economy stocks questioned again. This was reflected in the Techmark closing down 41.88 at 3,404.75. </p> <p>A weak performance from the Nasdaq hit accountancy software specialist <strong> Sage</strong>, down 27.5p at 522p, Anglo-Dutch software group <strong> CMG</strong>, 56p lower at 932p, and <strong> Misys</strong>, off 20p at 540p. </p> <p> <strong> HSBC</strong> and <strong> Standard Chartered</strong> offered some support for the market. Both prospered after a trip to Hong Kong by a leading broker triggered a reappraisal of their prospects. Citing improving operating conditions, loan volumes and margins in the former colony, Deutsche Bank lifted its rating on HSBC to \"market perform\" and on Standard to \"buy\". </p> <p>Deutsche said its preference for Standard reflected its higher exposure to the region (70% of Standard's pre-provision profit comes from Asia Pacific as opposed to 46% at HSBC) and its attractive valuation (Standard is on a forward p/e ratio of 12.6). Shares in Standard finished up 33p at 888p and HSBC closed 18.5p better at 767p. </p> <p>But <strong> Lloyds TSB</strong> continued to suffer, falling 25.5p to 584p. Expectations that interim figures on July 28 will prove disappointing were to blame. </p> <p> <strong> Telewest</strong> improved 8p to 242p as Nomura and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson reportedly reiterated their \"buy\" stances on the stock after Microsoft's decision to limit its investment in the cable group to a minority stake. </p> <p> <strong> Nycomed Amersham</strong> was the FTSE 100's worst performer, down 32p to 668p after HSBC Securities lowered its rating to \"hold\" from \"buy\". </p> <p>Among second-tier stocks, communications and marketing group <strong> Aegis</strong>, down 0.5p at 189p, attracted attention following a block trade of 27.9m shares.

      "bodyText": "A chill wind has blown through the technology sector since the collapse of the Nasdaq index in the spring but certain sectors remain hot. One is optical networking, and news of a mega-merger in the US was enough to bring further gains for Oxford's Bookham Technology yesterday. Shares in the optical technology specialist, \u00a310.00 on flotation in April, surged 440p to \u00a346.60 in the wake of the $41bn all-stock merger of fibre optics makers JDS Uniphase and SDL. Dealers said it was good news for Bookham on two fronts. Bookham supplies JDS with arrayed wave guides, crucial in the transmission of data along fibre optic cables. Merger with SDL means a bigger potential market for AWD. The deal also gives a pointer to Bookham's worth. \"There aren't too many companies is this area and evidence of consolidation can only be good news,\" one sector specialist said. Bookham is due to report second-quarter results on August 9 and strong figures are expected. Despite the fine performance of Bookham, the FTSE 100 closed the session down 31.3 points lower at 6,466.2. Volume was a meagre 950m by the official close of trade as institutional investors sat on their hands. London's equity market faces a number of tests this week starting with figures from internet group Yahoo! today and ending with US producer price figures on Friday. Dealers fear that weak figures from Yahoo! or Motorola on Wednesday could see valuations of new economy stocks questioned again. This was reflected in the Techmark closing down 41.88 at 3,404.75. A weak performance from the Nasdaq hit accountancy software specialist Sage, down 27.5p at 522p, Anglo-Dutch software group CMG, 56p lower at 932p, and Misys, off 20p at 540p. HSBC and Standard Chartered offered some support for the market. Both prospered after a trip to Hong Kong by a leading broker triggered a reappraisal of their prospects. Citing improving operating conditions, loan volumes and margins in the former colony, Deutsche Bank lifted its rating on HSBC to \"market perform\" and on Standard to \"buy\". Deutsche said its preference for Standard reflected its higher exposure to the region (70% of Standard's pre-provision profit comes from Asia Pacific as opposed to 46% at HSBC) and its attractive valuation (Standard is on a forward p/e ratio of 12.6). Shares in Standard finished up 33p at 888p and HSBC closed 18.5p better at 767p. But Lloyds TSB continued to suffer, falling 25.5p to 584p. Expectations that interim figures on July 28 will prove disappointing were to blame. Telewest improved 8p to 242p as Nomura and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson reportedly reiterated their \"buy\" stances on the stock after Microsoft's decision to limit its investment in the cable group to a minority stake. Nycomed Amersham was the FTSE 100's worst performer, down 32p to 668p after HSBC Securities lowered its rating to \"hold\" from \"buy\". Among second-tier stocks, communications and marketing group Aegis, down 0.5p at 189p, attracted attention following a block trade of 27.9m shares. However, brokers quickly dismissed talk of stake-building, pointing out that the trade related to a big shareholder switching stake between funds. Aegis' two biggest shareholders are Deutsche Bank and Putnam, with stakes of 11.2% and 8.21% respectively. Strong full-year figures from set-top box maker Pace Micro Technology were overshadowed by concerns over margins and news that two directors are to sell 13m shares. It fell 78.5p to 896p. But Independent Energy topped the FTSE 250 performance table.

Dealers played down merger speculation, pointing out that real reason behind the strong performance was a surge in the group's US-listed shares on Friday. Navan on the move Long-standing Irish metals exploration punt Navan Resources is changing its name to Navan Mining and shifting its domicile from Dublin to London. While the stock has burnt the fingers of careless investors in the past, there are genuine hopes that the price will make headway when trading starts this morning on the official lists of the London and Irish stock exchanges.

      "body": "<p>The oil price matters. A good rule of thumb is that when the cost of black gold goes shooting up, the world economy comes crashing down. That was true in the wake of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, it was true when the conflict between Iraq and Iran flared up in the late 70s and it was true when Saddam Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait in the summer of 1990. </p> <p>Bill Clinton has been sufficiently concerned about the possible consequences of a fourth oil shock to put diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest producer, to break ranks with the rest of the Opec cartel and start pumping more crude. But, as yesterday's British producer price data showed, the effects of demand outstripping supply are already being felt by industry. Fuel and raw material costs for manufacturers are up by 14% over the past year. </p> <p>Traditionally, producer prices are a harbinger of prices in the shops. Manufacturers pass increased costs on to their customers - retailers - who in turn make consumers pay through the nose. Higher inflation leads to higher interest rates, and before you know it firms are going bust. </p> <p>So is history about to repeat itself? The answer, tentatively but for a number of different reasons, is no. First, the oil price is not that high in real terms. </p> <p>Despite the 14% increase over the past year, industry's fuel and raw material costs are still more than 6% down on 1995 levels, and there would need to be a further 14% increase over the coming 12 months - and then some - for the price to reach the same level as it hit after the Iran-Iraq war. </p> <p>Second, a combination of a slowing US economy and restraint by Opec producers (who know that their long-term interests are not served by a recession in the West) should mean that oil prices will hold steady or even fall back slightly over the coming months. </p> <p>Finally, the transmission mechanism between factory gate and retail prices is less powerful than it once was. While fuel and raw material costs are up by 14% over the past year, industry's output prices have risen 2.9% and the cost of goods to retail consumers was 2.3% lower in April than a year earlier. Consumer mentality has changed, and manufacturers know it. </p> <p>The impact of dearer fuel will be felt on profit margins rather than in the high street. </p> <p><strong> Accountability </strong><br> </p> <p> Big shareholders in Vodafone AirTouch appear unanimous in their irritation over the \u00a310m cash and shares bonus meted out to chief executive Chris Gent, as reward for pulling off the takeover of Mannesmann of Germany. </p> <p>What appears to be causing the controversy now, however, is quite what can be done about it. One senior fund manager was horrified last night at the recommendation by the National Association of Pension Funds that shareholders should abstain in the vote at this month's annual general meeting on Mr Gent's re-election to the board. </p> <p>The advice is seen as trivial, if only because the institutions are very happy with Mr Gent's work turning the mobile company into a communications powerhouse. </p> <p>What is clear is that the real cause of shareholder angst is the way fund managers heard about the bonus: according to one fund manger, letters detailing plans to alter the share-based performance schemes went out in May and the details of Mr Gent's special deal emerged during subsequent discussions with the company on stopping performance-based awards to non-executive directors. </p> <p>So Vodafone might have not have got into this mess in the first place if it had told shareholders about the bonus earlier - and putting the detail in the reams of documents associated with the Mannesmann takeover would have been sensible, despite the hostile timing. However awkward, Mr Gent and his team should remember that the people who own the business he is running do actually matter. </p> <p><strong> Bubble burst </strong><br> </p> <p> Oxygen, the internet investment shell company which sucked in more amateur punters than many of its kind during the market's six months of dottiness, has come up with a new wheeze which threatens to reduce the wealth of its shareholders further. They will be able to act as parallel investors in the start-up ventures which Oxygen's \"young expert team\" identifies, essentially buying shares directly in Oxygen's investments in relation to the number of Oxygen shares they already hold. But the effect of this is to magnify shareholders' risk, since they will simply be buying a bigger stake in each new-fangled venture. Any Oxygen shareholders who bought during the bubble phase of this company's development probably know how destructive risk can be: the shares have fallen from a high of 65p to 5.5p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The oil price matters. A good rule of thumb is that when the cost of black gold goes shooting up, the world economy comes crashing down. That was true in the wake of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, it was true when the conflict between Iraq and Iran flared up in the late 70s and it was true when Saddam Hussein's troops invaded Kuwait in the summer of 1990. Bill Clinton has been sufficiently concerned about the possible consequences of a fourth oil shock to put diplomatic pressure on Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest producer, to break ranks with the rest of the Opec cartel and start pumping more crude. But, as yesterday's British producer price data showed, the effects of demand outstripping supply are already being felt by industry. Fuel and raw material costs for manufacturers are up by 14% over the past year. Traditionally, producer prices are a harbinger of prices in the shops. Manufacturers pass increased costs on to their customers - retailers - who in turn make consumers pay through the nose. Higher inflation leads to higher interest rates, and before you know it firms are going bust. So is history about to repeat itself? The answer, tentatively but for a number of different reasons, is no. First, the oil price is not that high in real terms. Despite the 14% increase over the past year, industry's fuel and raw material costs are still more than 6% down on 1995 levels, and there would need to be a further 14% increase over the coming 12 months - and then some - for the price to reach the same level as it hit after the Iran-Iraq war. Second, a combination of a slowing US economy and restraint by Opec producers (who know that their long-term interests are not served by a recession in the West) should mean that oil prices will hold steady or even fall back slightly over the coming months. Finally, the transmission mechanism between factory gate and retail prices is less powerful than it once was. While fuel and raw material costs are up by 14% over the past year, industry's output prices have risen 2.9% and the cost of goods to retail consumers was 2.3% lower in April than a year earlier. Consumer mentality has changed, and manufacturers know it. The impact of dearer fuel will be felt on profit margins rather than in the high street. Accountability Big shareholders in Vodafone AirTouch appear unanimous in their irritation over the \u00a310m cash and shares bonus meted out to chief executive Chris Gent, as reward for pulling off the takeover of Mannesmann of Germany. What appears to be causing the controversy now, however, is quite what can be done about it. One senior fund manager was horrified last night at the recommendation by the National Association of Pension Funds that shareholders should abstain in the vote at this month's annual general meeting on Mr Gent's re-election to the board. The advice is seen as trivial, if only because the institutions are very happy with Mr Gent's work turning the mobile company into a communications powerhouse. What is clear is that the real cause of shareholder angst is the way fund managers heard about the bonus: according to one fund manger, letters detailing plans to alter the share-based performance schemes went out in May and the details of Mr Gent's special deal emerged during subsequent discussions with the company on stopping performance-based awards to non-executive directors. So Vodafone might have not have got into this mess in the first place if it had told shareholders about the bonus earlier - and putting the detail in the reams of documents associated with the Mannesmann takeover would have been sensible, despite the hostile timing. However awkward, Mr Gent and his team should remember that the people who own the business he is running do actually matter. Bubble burst Oxygen, the internet investment shell company which sucked in more amateur punters than many of its kind during the market's six months of dottiness, has come up with a new wheeze which threatens to reduce the wealth of its shareholders further. They will be able to act as parallel investors in the start-up ventures which Oxygen's \"young expert team\" identifies, essentially buying shares directly in Oxygen's investments in relation to the number of Oxygen shares they already hold. But the effect of this is to magnify shareholders' risk, since they will simply be buying a bigger stake in each new-fangled venture. Any Oxygen shareholders who bought during the bubble phase of this company's development probably know how destructive risk can be: the shares have fallen from a high of 65p to 5.5p.",

The scheme, similar to those adopted in the US, is also raising concern at the Association of British Insurers, another large representative body for shareholders, as it contravenes its guidelines which stipulate that options awards should be related to performance. The concerns by the NAPF come as the pension advisory body is raising its profile in the City by issuing its first recommendations to shareholders on how to vote at annual general meetings of companies. In what may prompt a wave of fresh shareholder activism in the City, the NAPF has also recommended to shareholders that they take action against a \u00a310m bonus awarded to Chris Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone AirTouch as a reward for clinching the takeover of Mannesmann. While the \u00a310m bonus was paid to Mr Gent earlier this year, the NAPF, which has the potential to influence share holders representing up to 25% of the stock market, is telling investors to abstain in protest on the vote for his re-election to the board at the AGM on July 27.

In Madrid they closed at \u20ac17. Eads co-chief executives Rainer Hertrich and Philippe Camus put a brave face on the slump in the \u20ac3bn (\u00a31.9bn) initial public offering, blaming market conditions and insisting the stock had long-term growth potential. But its fortunes contrasted sharply with those of BAE Systems, the British group which turned its back on European consolidation and is seeking strategic alliances with US groups such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. BAE was among the day's biggest gainers in London, its shares rising 2.16%, closing 9p up at 425p.

In their 80s, they cleaned away and mended five year's of neglect. Neighbours, tentative at first, came to help, doing the heavy lifting and painting.</p> <p>Sipping coffee on his porch at sunset this week, Sacir expressed no surprise. \"My father and his father were born here. We have always lived among Serbs. They have been good to us since we returned.</p> <p>\"I had to come back. This is my land.

Fashionable new names for long established watering holes were destroying the links between public houses and local history, he said, and he called on pubs to consult their regular customers and the wider community before consigning old favourites like the Royal Oak and the King's Arms to history. Pubs were an \"integral part of the local heritage\" in many parts of the country, he told MPs in the Commons, yet figures for London show that an average of 11 pubs have seen a name change each month in the past five years. Mr Smith's comments were the highest profile support yet for a growing campaign to save traditional pub names, but he resisted calls for legislation. Last year MPs on all sides backed a private member's bill brought by Ann Winterton, Tory MP for Congleton, aiming to bring in a law protecting pubs from being renamed as part of \"themed\" refurbishments by big chains. Mr Smith said: \"It does appear to me that there is a growing fashion for rebranding pubs with names like the Dog 'n' Donut or the Goose and Granite which, I have to say, would appear to have little relevance to the history of any area. We are surely in danger here of losing an important part of local history. \"While it is up to the owners of a business to choose the name they give it, I hope breweries will bear in mind the unique historic role many of our public houses have and think twice before destroying that link with the past.

In 1961, Richardson was a founder member of the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis big band in New York, something of a jazz haven for studio players. \"It's a band of enthusiasts, and an opportunity to cleanse our souls,\" he explained.</p> <p>After 20 years as a freelance musician, he moved to California, where his worklist included television and concert credits, and playing with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Lena Horne and Peggy Lee. He made many recordings and peformed myriad sessions with musicians of the quality of Louis Armstrong, Charles Mingus and Miles Davis.</p> <p>He had, in fact, been something of a youthful prodigy and become a professional musician (and member of the Musicians' Union) at the age of 14. Word of his prowess spread quickly. The Los Angeles saxophonist Jack Kelso remembers a trumpeter named Winnow Allen \"raving about this saxophone player up in Oakland, and insisting that we drive in his car to hear Jerome Richardson. So we knocked on his door and Jerome said later: 'You guys scared the shit out of me.'\"</p> <p>Richardson himself was for long unsure about his background. He was, in fact, adopted, a fact he only discovered in mid-life. Early on, he assumed he had been born in Oakland, on Christmas Day 1920; it turned out his birthplace was Sealey, Texas, and that he was six weeks older than he thought. He was, of course, the product of a mixed-raced relationship, then taboo.</p> <p>His adoptive parents bought him an alto saxophone when he was eight, and he was soon proficient enough to give radio recitals and play in churches. He liked the big bands he heard, and local bandleader Ben Watkins liked what he heard of Richardson. He was soon in the thick of the Oakland jazz scene, and began to tour with bluesman Saunders King, the local equivalent to T-Bone Walker.</p> <p>Club work, a cruelly brief engagement with the Jimmie Lunceford orchestra, and college followed before Richardson volunteered for the US navy in 1941, or, more accurately, its pre-flight school orchestra, based at Moraga, California. The all-black station big band was packed with jazz stars and masterminded by saxophonist Marshal Royal, later with the Count Basie orchestra. This congenial sinecure endured until December 1945, and allowed Richardson ample opportunity to moonlight at bay areas clubs.</p> <p>After demobilisation, he tried day-jobs, but was happy to accept an offer to tour with the Lionel Hampton orchestra from 1949 onwards. Like others, Richardson enjoyed Hampton's music, but found the pay insufficient to support a family. After two years with the pianist Earl Hines, which left him stranded in Los Angeles, he made for New York in the mid-1950s. He led his own bands and played for Cootie Williams and in Broadway pit orchestras, while breaking into the commercial studio scene.</p> <p>Richardson's visits to Britain were infrequent; there was a 1969 season at Ronnie Scott's with the Jones-Lewis band, a well-received solo gig at Peter Ind's Bass Clef, and, most recently, an appearance at Brecon Jazz in 1997 with the prestigious Carnegie Hall Jazz Band.</p> <p>Companionable, if under-appreciated, Richardson is survived by his wife, Rowena, two daughters and two grandchildren.</p> <p>\u0095 Jerome Richardson, jazz musician, born November 15 1920; died June 23 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jerome Richardson, who has died aged 79, was an exceptionally versatile jazz wood- wind player. A superb technician and rewarding soloist on alto and tenor saxophones, he could surprise audiences with the drive and verve of his performances. He played on more than 4,000 jazz and popular recordings, and the producer Quincy Jones was especially enamoured of his flute (and piccolo) playing, so much so that he hired Richardson for his touring orchestras, including a nine-month stint with Free and Easy, a musical show which performed in Europe in 1959. Later, there were several tours of Japan with Jones. In 1961, Richardson was a founder member of the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis big band in New York, something of a jazz haven for studio players. \"It's a band of enthusiasts, and an opportunity to cleanse our souls,\" he explained. After 20 years as a freelance musician, he moved to California, where his worklist included television and concert credits, and playing with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Lena Horne and Peggy Lee. He made many recordings and peformed myriad sessions with musicians of the quality of Louis Armstrong, Charles Mingus and Miles Davis. He had, in fact, been something of a youthful prodigy and become a professional musician (and member of the Musicians' Union) at the age of 14. Word of his prowess spread quickly. The Los Angeles saxophonist Jack Kelso remembers a trumpeter named Winnow Allen \"raving about this saxophone player up in Oakland, and insisting that we drive in his car to hear Jerome Richardson. So we knocked on his door and Jerome said later: 'You guys scared the shit out of me.'\" Richardson himself was for long unsure about his background. He was, in fact, adopted, a fact he only discovered in mid-life. Early on, he assumed he had been born in Oakland, on Christmas Day 1920; it turned out his birthplace was Sealey, Texas, and that he was six weeks older than he thought. He was, of course, the product of a mixed-raced relationship, then taboo. His adoptive parents bought him an alto saxophone when he was eight, and he was soon proficient enough to give radio recitals and play in churches. He liked the big bands he heard, and local bandleader Ben Watkins liked what he heard of Richardson. He was soon in the thick of the Oakland jazz scene, and began to tour with bluesman Saunders King, the local equivalent to T-Bone Walker. Club work, a cruelly brief engagement with the Jimmie Lunceford orchestra, and college followed before Richardson volunteered for the US navy in 1941, or, more accurately, its pre-flight school orchestra, based at Moraga, California. The all-black station big band was packed with jazz stars and masterminded by saxophonist Marshal Royal, later with the Count Basie orchestra. This congenial sinecure endured until December 1945, and allowed Richardson ample opportunity to moonlight at bay areas clubs. After demobilisation, he tried day-jobs, but was happy to accept an offer to tour with the Lionel Hampton orchestra from 1949 onwards. Like others, Richardson enjoyed Hampton's music, but found the pay insufficient to support a family. After two years with the pianist Earl Hines, which left him stranded in Los Angeles, he made for New York in the mid-1950s. He led his own bands and played for Cootie Williams and in Broadway pit orchestras, while breaking into the commercial studio scene. Richardson's visits to Britain were infrequent; there was a 1969 season at Ronnie Scott's with the Jones-Lewis band, a well-received solo gig at Peter Ind's Bass Clef, and, most recently, an appearance at Brecon Jazz in 1997 with the prestigious Carnegie Hall Jazz Band. Companionable, if under-appreciated, Richardson is survived by his wife, Rowena, two daughters and two grandchildren. \u0095 Jerome Richardson, jazz musician, born November 15 1920; died June 23 2000",

All this is in sharp contrast to the previous administration, whose ministers did pick and choose publication dates to suit their partisan ends. Jack Straw MP Home secretary \u0095 Clearly, Lord Birt's appointment as the government's adviser on crime is based on New Labour's belief in the sanctity of transferable skills in their globalised world. I therefore look forward to the call from Tony Blair offering me, a criminologist, the chance to transfer my skills to the BBC for one day a week. I feel sure that I can bring an \"outsider's view\" to the corporation's work and stem the tide of criticism directed at it. Prof Joe Sim John Moores University Liverpool \u0095 Will the onerous duties now to be shouldered by Lord Birt cover crimes against public service broadcasting? Dermot Carley Chichester \u0095 Marcel Berlins (Jack plays the blame game, July 10) summed up very accurately the concern of magistrates on hearing proposals by the Home Secretary to name and shame magistrates for wrong bail decisions. It must be remembered that in general everyone has a right to be released on bail when they have not been convicted of the charge and it is up to the prosecution to object to that right. Bail decisions are not taken lightly and magistrates have to rely on information laid before the court and, indeed, have to state why bail is not granted in open court Harry Mawdsley Chairman, Magistrates' Association",

Peter Green, 49, was yesterday sentenced to eight years in jail for nine counts of indecent assault against young patients at his Loughborough surgery. He denied all the charges. Green, of Oakham, Rutland, picked his victims like a \"burglar picks a house\" - because they were vulnerable and unlikely to tell, Nottingham crown court heard. Some of his victims had been referred after routine school check-ups. The judge, Mr Justice Astill, told him: \"You are an utter disgrace to a noble profession. You were using the privacy of your consulting room to satisfy your own sexual wishes. \"You started along this course not long after you had qualified and carried on for a number of years.\" During the seven-and-a-half week trial, witnesses said they had felt compelled to bow to Green's greater medical knowledge. Green was cleared of a further nine indecency charges against male patients and their female partners. Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, asked that a further 21 counts, alleging indecent assaults on men and administering a drug with intent to assault, should be left on file. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, yesterday requested an investigation by the commission for health improvements (CHI) into how Green's assaults went undetected for so long. The health minister, John Denham, said: \"I am saddened by the fact that the public's trust in the medical profession may be shaken once again by an individual who was very clearly out of control. \"This case shows very clearly how difficult it was in the old NHS to spot and take action in cases such as this, because of the lack of proper systems for monitoring and regulating medical practice.\" Green's case brings to a total of four the number of ongoing official investigations into health professionals in England and Wales. Peter Homa, CHI director, said: \"When things go wrong in the health service, it is vital to find out why so that lessons can be learned for the whole NHS. \"The reports of our investigations will, at times, make uncomfortable reading for people inside and outside the health service.\" He added: \"We will not flinch at that.\"",

The Equal Opportunity Commission has at least 20 such cases on its books, but the it says that this represents only part of the problem, because it handles only a fraction of the allegations and many companies settle out of court. A noose may be left on a worker's chair, on a door or in a locker, but the culprit is hard to find because he or she invariably acts anonymously. \"What I see as alarming is not just that employers are fighting us in courts but that they're also making statements implying that such incidents are just horseplay,\" said Ida Castro, the commission's chairwoman. Lynch mobs killed thousands of black people between 1865, when the civil war ended, and 1968, and memories of those years have been stirred this year by Beyond Sanctuary, a photographic exhibition at the New York Historical Society. \"[Nooses are] a sign that something serious is going on in the workplace,\" said David Bennet Ross, a partner in a Chicago law firm which represents employers. Some lawyers believe that the practice of using a noose to intimidate employees is a reflection of the bigotry of young white workers who were either not alive or have no knowledge of the civil rights campaigns of the 1960s. The success of affirmative action in winning jobs for minorities in areas that were previously closed to them is also put forward. Jeff Lanza, an FBI agent in Kansas City, where two cases are being investigated, said nooses appeared to be replacing burning crosses as icons of hatred. \"I've been here 12 years and I can't remember any other noose cases that preceded the two we now have,\" Mr Lanza said.

For a long time the question did not pose itself - even though I frequently came to Austria, both professionally as a journalist and on holiday. Alienation was too profound. Now something has changed. Researching and writing this book [Guilty Victim] has brought me closer to Austria. It has been a kind of homecoming.</p> <p>If others are surprised that I could reach such a conclusion, I am even more surprised myself. How to explain the paradox: that someone who was uprooted at a young age from Hitler's Ostmark - as it was called after its annexation by Nazi Germany - and who reached Britain in 1939 in a kindertransport (evacuation of children) as a bewildered refugee, could ever again come to feel comfortable and at ease in Austria?</p> <p>I have always felt that the wounds of being uprooted all those years ago can never heal entirely. However well integrated into British life, some damage remains. I have virtually no memory of life before coming to Britain, and only the vaguest recollection of arriving in London and huddling in a big hall with the other children on my kindertransport , as we waited to be claimed by British families prepared to take care of us. I knew no English, and remember nothing of my first term at school.</p> <p>I was fortunate that my mother managed to reach Britain just before war broke out, and I was able to live with her in the Lake District where she worked as a cook. Even as a schoolchild I had to carry documents describing me as an enemy alien. For several years I refused to speak German. Nor could I bring myself to acknowledge that I was Jewish until my first visit to New York, when it dawned on me that it was possible for large numbers of Jews to assimilate into a national culture and lead unmolested lives.</p> <p>Unlike many other Austrian and German refugees, my mother did not develop a dislike or hatred of her former countrypeople, and she never encouraged me to reject Austria after the war. Eventually she even started taking holidays there, although she never went back to Vienna.</p> <p>Still, it is no accident that the title of my book qualifies Austria as a \"guilty victim\". While I was writing it, I learned a great deal that shocked me profoundly. I had not fully understood the extent to which far too many Austrians still cultivate their big lie - the delusion that as a country and as individuals they were Hitler's victims, and only exceptionally Hitler's willing executioners. Or again, the extent to which anti-semitism manifested itself among the first generation of Austria's postwar leaders, even though several had themselves been in concentration camps. There were more uncomfortable questions. How endemic is Austria's anti-semitism? How could it elect Kurt Waldheim as head of state? How could almost a third of Austria's electorate vote for J\u00f6rg Haider, and how could the others countenance a coalition that gave Haider's Freedom party a major role in government this year?</p> <p>Many would argue that Austria is beyond redemption and must remain alien territory for victims lucky enough to have survived the Nazi era. But Austria does not conform to the stereotypes in which it is so often perceived. It is not a neo-Nazi state. The sinister cloak-and-dagger impression of Vienna belongs to history. It has become a prosperous country with an enviable quality of life. As a society, even though it is conformist and its elites are cynical, it does not suffer from political apathy - on the contrary, there is political argument wherever two or more are gathered. It may not solve anything; but at least people at all levels feel involved.</p> <p>Haider is abhorrent to me, but he does not personify Austria. One of the heartening byproducts of his electoral success has been a far-reaching debate that contains the seeds of a much needed rejuvenation of the two mainstream parties, and a strengthening of the admirable Green party.</p> <p>When I first returned to Vienna, soon after the 1955 state treaty (under which the allies agreed their withdrawal from Austria), there was an overwhelming sense of being a stranger, an outsider; or at best a tourist. This feeling persisted in later visits, when I was working for the Guardian. But a sort of watershed came in 1980, when I was invited to the celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the state treaty. Bruno Kreisky, who was then chancellor, was trying to persuade Auslandsoesterreicher (Austrians living abroad, as the Austrians prefer to portray Nazi victims who had escaped as refugees) to associate themselves more closely with their former country.</p> <p>In the company of ex-Austrians who had made a distinguished life for themselves in Europe or the US, I experienced for the first time an odd sense of association with a national entity called Austria. Yet, not long afterwards, when Kreisky asked me if I wanted to have my Austrian nationality restored, I turned it down: I had no wish for dual nationality.</p> <p>My relationship with Austria remained uncertain until the early 90s, when two things happened. Close friends, Auslandsoesterreicher who have moved back to Vienna and have a house in the mountains, invited me to stay with them. I have been back almost every summer and made to feel part of an extended family and circle of friends. At about the same time I was working on a biography of Simon Wiesenthal, the so-called Nazi-hunter, who has made his home in Vienna. I spent a lot of time there, again expanding my circle of friends. I began to appreciate the range of views that existed and the extent to which many people were grappling with their consciences and that of their country.</p> <p>Later, as I researched the new book, a long string of interviews brought home to me that among the younger, postwar generations, the need to take cover behind the big lie - the victim syndrome - is not as pronounced as it is among their elders. Instead there is well-founded cynicism about a democratic process that keeps tired politicians in power and seems unable to break the coalition monopoly of Austria's two big mainstream parties.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Haider was better able to exploit the sense of impotence among Austria's grassroots than anyone else around.</p> <p>Of course, it is possible to argue that Haider can do this because he expresses far-right views that appeal to Austria's inbred Nazi instincts. I believe that this is only a very small part of the story. In sum, I need not cover my head in shame for confessing that Austria, and not only Britain, now increasingly counts for me as home. <br><br> Guilty Victim - Austria from the Holocaust to Haider, by Hella Pick is published by IB Tauris, priced \u00a324.50</p>",

Eventually she even started taking holidays there, although she never went back to Vienna. Still, it is no accident that the title of my book qualifies Austria as a \"guilty victim\". While I was writing it, I learned a great deal that shocked me profoundly. I had not fully understood the extent to which far too many Austrians still cultivate their big lie - the delusion that as a country and as individuals they were Hitler's victims, and only exceptionally Hitler's willing executioners. Or again, the extent to which anti-semitism manifested itself among the first generation of Austria's postwar leaders, even though several had themselves been in concentration camps. There were more uncomfortable questions. How endemic is Austria's anti-semitism? How could it elect Kurt Waldheim as head of state? How could almost a third of Austria's electorate vote for J\u00f6rg Haider, and how could the others countenance a coalition that gave Haider's Freedom party a major role in government this year? Many would argue that Austria is beyond redemption and must remain alien territory for victims lucky enough to have survived the Nazi era. But Austria does not conform to the stereotypes in which it is so often perceived. It is not a neo-Nazi state. The sinister cloak-and-dagger impression of Vienna belongs to history. It has become a prosperous country with an enviable quality of life. As a society, even though it is conformist and its elites are cynical, it does not suffer from political apathy - on the contrary, there is political argument wherever two or more are gathered. It may not solve anything; but at least people at all levels feel involved. Haider is abhorrent to me, but he does not personify Austria. One of the heartening byproducts of his electoral success has been a far-reaching debate that contains the seeds of a much needed rejuvenation of the two mainstream parties, and a strengthening of the admirable Green party. When I first returned to Vienna, soon after the 1955 state treaty (under which the allies agreed their withdrawal from Austria), there was an overwhelming sense of being a stranger, an outsider; or at best a tourist. This feeling persisted in later visits, when I was working for the Guardian. But a sort of watershed came in 1980, when I was invited to the celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the state treaty. Bruno Kreisky, who was then chancellor, was trying to persuade Auslandsoesterreicher (Austrians living abroad, as the Austrians prefer to portray Nazi victims who had escaped as refugees) to associate themselves more closely with their former country. In the company of ex-Austrians who had made a distinguished life for themselves in Europe or the US, I experienced for the first time an odd sense of association with a national entity called Austria. Yet, not long afterwards, when Kreisky asked me if I wanted to have my Austrian nationality restored, I turned it down: I had no wish for dual nationality. My relationship with Austria remained uncertain until the early 90s, when two things happened. Close friends, Auslandsoesterreicher who have moved back to Vienna and have a house in the mountains, invited me to stay with them. I have been back almost every summer and made to feel part of an extended family and circle of friends. At about the same time I was working on a biography of Simon Wiesenthal, the so-called Nazi-hunter, who has made his home in Vienna. I spent a lot of time there, again expanding my circle of friends. I began to appreciate the range of views that existed and the extent to which many people were grappling with their consciences and that of their country. Later, as I researched the new book, a long string of interviews brought home to me that among the younger, postwar generations, the need to take cover behind the big lie - the victim syndrome - is not as pronounced as it is among their elders. Instead there is well-founded cynicism about a democratic process that keeps tired politicians in power and seems unable to break the coalition monopoly of Austria's two big mainstream parties. Unfortunately, Haider was better able to exploit the sense of impotence among Austria's grassroots than anyone else around. Of course, it is possible to argue that Haider can do this because he expresses far-right views that appeal to Austria's inbred Nazi instincts. I believe that this is only a very small part of the story. In sum, I need not cover my head in shame for confessing that Austria, and not only Britain, now increasingly counts for me as home.

And when you are passionate, contrasts become strongly marked. And when you have passion, you have disillusionment.\" </p> <p>Passionate, sorrowful and joyous it may be, yet most Brazilian classical music is almost unknown overseas - a fact that may now be about to change. This month, Brazil's rarely heard composers are the basis of the Wigmore Hall's series Rhythm, Romance and Remembrance, the classical component of this summer's Brazil 500 festival. The concerts feature some of Brazil's most celebrated musicians: Cohen, fellow pianists Cristina Ortiz and Nelson Freire, and the guitarist Fabio Zanon. </p> <p>Carving out their national identity in their music, classical composers such as Heitor Villa-Lobos, Lorenzo Fernandez, Camargo Guarnieri, Fructoso Vianna filtered European forms through the same seething mix of cultures that makes Brazilian popular music so exciting: Amer-indian music, the African influence from Brazil's history of slavery and the sounds of the Spanish guitar. </p> <p>Villa-Lobos (1887-1959) travelled around Brazil collecting traditional folk music, making extensive use of it in his own work and becoming Brazil's greatest composer. There's a pride in this musical nationalism, and nostalgia, too; as pianist Ortiz says: \"Villa-Lobos used his heritage. He set down the sounds of his country, so his music is incredibly evocative. When I play it, I can almost smell my favourite Brazilian dishes and see the green of the jungle.\" </p> <p>Villa-Lobos is world famous, but while Fernandez, Guarnieri and Vianna achieved successful careers in their day, they are not exactly household names here. Guarnieri was well known in the USA, as a conductor. Fernandez founded the music conservatory in Rio de Janeiro. Ortiz describes Vianna, whom she met when she was 12, as \"a Brazilian Schumann\". Meanwhile, Cohen recently discovered that Eduardo Dutra, composer of one of his favourite piano pieces, actually owned a chemical lab and only scribbled music in his spare time. </p> <p>Why has it taken so long for them to gain any recognition abroad? Partly because Brazilian composers faced an uphill struggle in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Brazil, now officially 500 years old, is a relatively young nation and came late to classical music. Geographically, it was isolated, even within South America, being the continent's only Portuguese-speaking country. Without the long European traditions of established conservatories and fine teaching, opportunities to study music in Brazil were limited. For a real musical education, Villa-Lobos and his contemporaries gravitated to Paris, where they absorbed powerful influences from the luxuriant colours of Debussy and Ravel. </p> <p>Cohen and Ortiz, who both settled overseas years ago, point regretfully at the vast musical talent in Brazil that has gone undeveloped. \"You had to be wealthy to learn music in Brazil,\" says Ortiz. \"And in my day there was no chance to do it at school.\" Cohen adds: \"You wonder how many people could have become first-class composers but never had the chance.\" </p> <p>Additionally, Brazilian musicians, eager for mainstream acceptance, have often passed over Brazilian works in favour of European classics. Ortiz's July 26 recital consists entirely of Brazilian music but, wary of being pigeonholed, she had never given an all-Brazilian recital until last year. Now she has fallen in love with Brazilian music all over again: \"I'm glad to return to my roots. To communicate this music, you have to swing, be free and unashamed; when you are young, you're afraid to do that. Now, when I play this repertoire, I love the chance it brings to develop a real contact with the audience.\" </p> <p>It has taken the worldwide craze for Brazilian popular music, and the shrunken globe of the air travel and internet age, to help raise the profile of Brazil's soulful composers. Ortiz's recordings of Villa-Lobos's piano concertos have already aroused interest here; Cohen is currently recording a solo disc which he describes as a \"mosaic\" of the country's piano music.

Now she has fallen in love with Brazilian music all over again: \"I'm glad to return to my roots. To communicate this music, you have to swing, be free and unashamed; when you are young, you're afraid to do that. Now, when I play this repertoire, I love the chance it brings to develop a real contact with the audience.\" It has taken the worldwide craze for Brazilian popular music, and the shrunken globe of the air travel and internet age, to help raise the profile of Brazil's soulful composers. Ortiz's recordings of Villa-Lobos's piano concertos have already aroused interest here; Cohen is currently recording a solo disc which he describes as a \"mosaic\" of the country's piano music. Brazil is no longerRhythm, Romance and Remembrance is at the Wigmore Hall, London W1 from Thursday. Details: 020-7935 2141. For details of Brazil 500 call 020-7399 9265. so far away. As Cohen says: \"Now we measure the hours, not the miles.\"",

Since his 1978 exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery, in the wake of the controversy surrounding the Tate's purchase of those bricks, Andre has had two museum-quality exhibitions in Britain: at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, in 1996; and at Edinburgh's Inverleith House in 1998. </p> <p>The bricks, Andre's Equivalent VIII, are now on show at Tate Modern, alongside a Jasper Johns' White Numbers painting, an Agnes Martin and a backdrop wall-drawing by Sol Lewitt. This cramped display does none of the works much of a service and, looking at Andre's bricks now, it is salutory to note that all sense of outrage has gone. They look just like classical modern art of the minimal persuasion, which is exactly what they are and what they represent. Other Andre works are scattered about Tate Modern, and this exhibition feels like a historical footnote. Now, a big Lewitt show would be timely - there has just been a touring retrospective in the US - but Andre's return to the Whitechapel after 22 years, a period in which stasis rather than development has marked the artist's career, appears redundant. </p> <p>But then Andre has never really developed, or changed, or altered his position as an artist. That is part of the point of his work. He arranges hunks of wood, sheets and cubes of metal or stone, in a given space. The work attunes you not only to the materials and their order, but also to the space itself and their place in it. </p> <p>I'm beginning to feel that vague irritation theatre critics must feel when their remarks are lifted onto posters to promote works they've written about. The Whitechapel's press release quotes me saying: \"Andre's work is about being a body in the world, and about measuring that world against ourselves.\" Without being too revisionist about it, one might add that one can have this kind of relationship without recourse to art. But maybe we needed art to show us the way. </p> <p>Andre's current Whitechapel exhibition contains works from his whole career, including early typewriter poems (a kind of severe concrete poetry much better read in a book than looked at on walls) and photographs of early works, many now destroyed. As documentary souvenirs of minimalism's origins, from 1958-63, they hold our interest, but it feels a bit pedagogic. The poems, too, have been better presented elsewhere, and the selection of extant small early works are displayed in too museological a manner. </p> <p>Aside from this, what? Grids of metal plates, shunting out at angles from the wall. Narrower metal plates skittering along the floor next to a wall. Shiny ingots of bis muth, indium and cadmium catch the eye with their different qualities of reflectivity and sheen. A copper spiral that looks super-elegant on a wooden floor, a large layout of horizontal and vertical chunks of cedar. </p> <p> Smaller presentations of individual works, or groups of works, suit Andre and the spaces he works with better. A leaner show would have been problematic, but truer to the spirit of his art, and a more thorough retrospective would have demanded an even bigger space. Whether we need either right now is more the issue.

      "body": "<p>If writing a batch of rock's most exhilarating hit singles is a good way to gain admission to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming entangled in high-profile lawsuits brings a different kind of immortality. John Fogerty has achieved both. Weirdly, even tragically, his solo career has been marred by his involvement in a string of legal disputes with his erstwhile record label, Fantasy, and clashes with his ex-bandmates from Creedence Clearwater Revival, of which he was the lynchpin until it split in 1972. It remains to be seen whether he will be remembered for his music or his lawsuits. </p> <p>Fogerty, 55, is now sweeping across Europe supporting Tina Turner on her farewell tour. But he remains an ambiguous figure. During his heyday in Creedence Clearwater Revival it was he who wrote the band's hits, from Proud Mary (1969) to their last million-seller, Sweet Hitch-Hiker (1971). Since then, his solo career has produced gems such as Centerfield (1985) and Blue Moon Swamp (1997), both of which have demonstrated Fogerty's knack for concocting songs that are \"about as contrived as the weather\", as critic Greil Marcus put it. </p> <p>But a total of six albums in 27 years (only five of them comprising new material) seems a barely adequate return from so legendary a performer. For when Fogerty should have been in the studio, he was consulting lawyers or sitting in court. </p> <p>\"I have had a lot of trouble with Fantasy Records. \" Fogerty told me while promoting the release of Blue Moon Swamp. \"In 1988 I had to go through a plagiarism trial where I was sued for sounding like myself, and people tell me this was unprecedented. I spent more than three years trying to resolve these issues, but sadly it didn't work.\" </p> <p>In the bizarre self-plagiarism case, Fantasy and its boss Saul Zaentz claimed that Fogerty's 1985 song Old Man Down the Road was merely his old Creedence song, Run Through the Jungle, with a new title. The label wouldn't have been able to bring the suit if Fogerty hadn't sold them the rights to his old material, something any aspiring pop star would be strenuously advised not to do in these more artist friendly days. Fogerty won the case, but then had to jump through further legal hoops to win back $1.35m dollars in costs. </p> <p>While countless musicians, from George Michael to Spandau Ballet, have found themselves in litigation with managers, record companies or each other, they have eventually reached some sort of conclusion, even if they're not very happy with it. But Fogerty seems doomed never to achieve the outcome he thinks he deserves. The problems date right back to Creedence Clearwater's original contract with Fantasy. </p> <p>\"We were the only artists that mattered on the label. We were selling almost 99.9% of the company's records. We had signed a contract thinking we were all in it equally. I thought we would share to a great degree in the company's success. But then it didn't happen. Fantasy own the songs and they're supposed to pay me as the songwriter, but I've had to fight to get royalties from 1980 and every year after that. Basically, to get paid I had to sue them, that was their stance.\" </p> <p>After Creedence split, Fogerty found himself bound to Fantasy as a solo artist. His awareness that he was a bankable asset at the peak of his powers merely increased his sense of outrage. \"I felt like I was their little prisoner in their dungeon, their little mouse in a cage that they played with,\" he shuddered. \"To take somebody that was at their height, like Elvis or The Beatles, and then treat them so badly is really a horrible thing.\" </p> <p> During the late 70s and early 80s, he grew so sick of it all that he abandoned music and lived with his family on a farm in Oregon. Then in 1985, he re-emerged with a new record deal with Warner Bros and the album Centerfield. It looked as if he'd turned a corner - until the plagiarism lawsuit came along. </p> <p>That was not the worst of it. In 1990, his brother Tom died from respiratory failure following a long struggle with tuberculosis. The five Fogerty boys had been brought up by their single mother in California, and Tom had been Creedence's rhythm guitarist, but not even their family bond could survive John's feelings of betrayal. \"Tom ended up over the years evolving mentally into some sort of weird Patti Hearst syndrome,\" said John. \"That's what I call it when they kidnap you and you end up siding with your captors, and that's what Tom did. In some trick of mental agility, he ended up befriending Saul Zaentz against me. By the end of his life Tom was saying 'Saul is my best friend'. He even wrote me nasty letters saying things like 'Saul and I will win'. It was very unresolved and very sad.\" </p> <p>How does he remember Tom? \"I have very confused feelings for my brother because there was a time when things were happy. The best I can say in Tom's case is he was the older brother and the younger brother had a lot more talent, therefore he was jealous even to a greater degree than the other two in Creedence Clearwater Revival.\" </p> <p>Tom's death didn't soften John's attitude towards the other band members. In 1993, when Creedence were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Fogerty refused to allow drummer Doug Clifford and bassist Stu Cook to perform with him at the traditional end-of-ceremony jam. Cook and Clifford have responded by forming Creedence Clearwater Revisited and going on the road playing the old Fogerty hits, though he has tried to throw a spanner in the works. In 1996, he sued Cook and Clifford, seeking to prevent the use of the Creedence Clearwater name. He won a temporary injunction, but the band are now using their chosen name again, and toured Germany last month. </p> <p>It saddens Stu Cook. \"I'm sure that doctors have all kinds of names for this sort of behaviour,\" he commented. \"It's the saddest story in rock and one of the longest ongoing stupid feuds.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Fogerty has become a litigation junkie. At the end of last year, he even sued his former attorney Kenneth Sidle, who had helped him to win back his costs following the plagiarism case. John Fogerty should be remembered as a great songwriter. Instead, he risks becoming better known as an appellant in textbooks of precedent-setting case law. </p> <p>John Fogerty appears with Tina Turner at Wembley on Saturday and Sunday.

      "body": "<p>Leon Golub's paintings are nasty. They always have been nasty, they go on being nasty. They are bitter, raw and abrasive. Some depict unconscionable acts: beatings, riots, interrogations, debasements. Others, particularly his more recent works, have a sullen, careless humour. Now in his late 70s, dogged by old man's troubles, Golub paints the dog itself, snarling and ravaging, pausing to lick its balls. He paints rapacious eagles, moth-eaten sphinxes, skulls and slogans, Prometheus as a condemned Titan. Prometheus, with the eagle about to strike, screams: \"Fuck, I didn't expect this!\" </p> <p>Golub is as bloody-minded and awkward and battling as ever he was. His retrospective exhibition, at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, opened last Thursday. Walking the long corridors and intimate side-rooms of Imoma with Golub, is to walk a half-century of pain and violence, torture, war, evil and anger. We walk from the mythic battles, his giants and corruscated gods and Pompeiian cinder-men of the 1950s and early 60s, to the floundering napalmed figures which came in the wake of the American insurgence in Vietnam. Timelessness was replaced by the timely, and Golub turned to overt depictions of modern war - cowed Vietnamese farm-kids on one side of the canvas, American youth, battledressed and with all their machinery, on the other. </p> <p>Where once Debuffet had informed Golub's solvent-abused, built-up and scraped away painted surfaces, now the Picasso of the Charnel House, and the nightly news, stood sway. And then came portraits of Franco, Brazilian dictator General Geisel, Nelson D Rockefeller, Kissinger, Pinochet, Ho Chi Minh and Fidel Castro. Their images came from Time and Newsweek; he rendered them carefully, but without implied comment. He painted them as the camera saw them, in all their hubris, in their uniforms and in their coffins; dictators in their shades. Franco, removed from a context in which he was originally kissing someone's cheek (Salazar's maybe), looks like he's whistling. A series of Rockefeller portraits chart the ravages of power. </p> <p>I think of Saul Bellow's Augie March. Like Augie, Golub is an American, Chicago-born, and goes at things as he has taught himself. And like Augie, Golub is a jew, giving witness to what was - for ill as much as good - America's century. Golub's political radicalism, his anger at the world and America's part in it (the Vietnam war, all those other overt and covert operations, the unprincipled machinations of big business, the inequalities of the land of the free) has always set him apart. His subjects, as well as his cross-grained approach, may have stalled his career in America, but not his achievement. </p> <p>As abstract expressionism came and went, as minimal and conceptual art generated compliant heroes for the new international capital of the art world, Golub went his own way. He and his wife of almost 50 years, the artist Nancy Spero, lived in Italy and then in Paris, returning to the USA at a moment when painting such as his had little place. But really, he has been centre-stage all along. In the renewed enthusiasm for figurative painting in the early 1980s, his work stood as a kind of rejoinder to the breast-beating sophistications of younger artists like David Salle and Julian Schnabel. </p> <p>Golub is a painter bearing witness to his times. His work of the 1970s and 80s is only paralleled by Gerhard Richter's paintings of the Baader-Meinhoffs. One might almost regard Golub's work as a kind of social realism, but for the fact that it is too sardonic and too individual to be seen as affirmation of a collective conscience, or of anybody's dream. When he paints interrogators, or mercenaries, or the guys on the street corner, he knows, and often lets you know, what coercion and disenfranchisements lead them to this place. </p> <p>We walk through a world of squalid interrogation rooms and shadows where the abducted are thrown in the boot of a car. We stand over the bodies, wandering how to dispose of them. Someone urinates on a victim who has a mashed-in face. We hang around with old black footsore folks, and with guys like Vinnie from Last Exit to Brooklyn. We hurry past white-trash racial suprematists who give us obscene, antic gestures. We go to El Salvador, we come back, and things are much the same at home. </p> <p>You see things in Golub's work you've never wanted to think about, much less look at, unless it has been in movies, or in morbid fantasy. At their best, his paintings are irrefutable. He learned, from cinema and from abstraction, the use of emptiness, the blank screen, the close-up, cropping, grouping and isolation. He has a great sense of staging. Most of all, an unerring feel for characterisation - the details of the tableaux, the frozen moment. He paints geeky nervous trigger-happy dangerous types, urbane CIA politicos, the harassed station chief, the foot-slogger, the implacable psychopath who likes the dirty work. He can do haircuts, shoes, varicose veins, cigars smoked to the butt. He can do sweat and menace and fear, and the unspoken threat that hangs in the air. </p> <p>Walking and talking with Golub, it is clear that he has spent a lot of time inside these paintings, getting to know his inventions. Individual figures may be derived from porno mags and news-stand rags, weird fanzines, fashion plates, Guns &amp; Ammo, Field and Stream (the man pissing on his victim may have been derived from a shot of a man holding a fishing rod), but they become something else when Golub paints them. </p> <p>Just as Philip Guston's late style derived, in part, from Krazy Kat and Robert Crumb cartoons, so something of the rangy, evil-mouthed gawkiness of some of Golub's figures might itself have fed the style of Beavis and Butt-head. It would be a nice reciprocation. And scary, too, if you think that, one day, those kids might have to go to war. </p> <p>Golub's paintings hang, for the most part, unstretched on the wall. The paint - applied, scraped-off, applied again - leaves the image imbedded in the weave of the painting as much as on it. The images have a tremendous clarity and force: wristwatches, tattoos, knobbly fingers, a newly-shaved GI haircut, manacles and shiny boots aren't mere props or modern dress, but the texture of life at a certain period. I can think of few painters who can achieve this, without becoming boring. And although he hectors at times (so, too, does Oliver Stone), he can also give us a painting which announces the end of the world, with a parade of dancing girls. </p> <p>If only, you want to say, if only there had been more time for Golub to paint at full throttle, inventing his scenarios, getting inside his characters, reporting back from those dread corners of the world. At best he paints like a novelist or a film director. But let's not forget he also does the props, the costumes, the lighting. And, however much he invents in these paintings, the story is already out there, the bad thing done. Now, in the late paintings, Golub paints his own vicissitudes. A man, prone between the paws of a lion, holds up a little placard? It says: \"Why Me?\" Well, why not. One thing Golub is really proud of, he told me, was the look in the eagle's eye, a kind of savage knowing pitiless look. It stares back at me, down the long corridor of Golub's exhibition. </p> <p>Leon Golub: Paintings 1950-2000, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, till October 19. ( 00353 1 612 9900).

The next thing you know, you can have swollen hands and feet, and that can be a symptom of pre-eclampsia. This means, as far as I can make out, that the baby's hormones for making your heart beat faster to get blood to the placenta start to win out over your own calming hormones and your blood rushes round so hard, you break veins in your kidneys. </p> <p>Then you can get full-blown eclampsia which is terribly rare but had, you may remember, dreadful consequences for that nice Doctor Green on ER. Of course, modern medicine will catch you before you get to that stage. They put you in hospital and sedate you - a terrifying thought. I shouldn't think terrifying thoughts. That's the trouble with blood pressure - you can raise it just by thinking about it.

In fact, if I don't act soon, Baby will have to be wrapped in an old towel and sleep in a drawer. </p> <p>My bump is still growing exponentially: in a week's time, I won't be able to get through swivel doors. So, for the third time, I've set off to a major chain store - and stood open-mouthed in the baby department for half an hour before returning empty-handed. How has this happened? Partly, I've got to admit, it's nostalgia. I want baby goods to be the same as when I was a child, in the same way that parents are reassured by seeing their child in blazer and cap, regardless of the merit of the school. </p> <p>This is why I come over all Prince of Walesish at any item - and there are many - decorated with the horrid Disney Winnie-the-Pooh rather than the proper Ernest Shepard one and why I'm drawn to entirely impractical Black Watch carrycots instead of the car seat you're legally obliged to have. But I also object to anything that says \"development\" or \"stimulating\" on it - and that cuts out a whole swathe of items. It enrages me that anyone should think I am dim enough to believe blasting an embryo with a \"foetal microphone\" (\u00a340) will \"stimulate its language development\" or that a black and white mobile (\u00a320), rather than say, my face, will activate my baby's \"focusing impulse\". </p> <p>At the same time, these things make me feel, as they are designed to, an already inadequate mother. And I have an even worse problem: my oldest friend is an eco-activist. She's been training me since we were 15. Now I look at moulded plastic and see toxins. I finger a pile of teddies and hear her telling me about working conditions in developing countries, or how an American baby uses eight times the energy units of an Indian one. Disposable nappies are just 15% of British landfill to me, a Salisbury Plain of swelling, stinking parcels of sewage, many of them adorned with Winnie-the-Pooh: our monument for the next 300 years. </p> <p> The object that actually sent me spinning back through the swivel door this time was a special bin that compress-wraps your used nappies into an air-freshened string of plastic sausages.

My organic veg service just went bust, for example, and it's going to be months before the Welsh sheep on the retraining programme get round to knitting Baby's hat. And it took three weeks to get through to the terribly nice local nappy-washing service, though the 100% cotton Velcro-fastened nappies are now on their way.

New York dancer Mary Gale was given \u00a320,000 compensation when her surgical search for a more rounded bottom ended in disaster after silicone breast implants were inserted into her backside. As the \"backs are the new fronts\" debate rages on, courtesy of Joely, Anna et al, one can only pale at the thought of a boom in buttock surgery. Surely, in line with the laterally thinking New York surgeon, we could find a way of using up all those leftover bits that society so blithely - and damagingly - throws away? Implants the shape of culled badgers? They're safer than soya.",

According to Fuchs's biographer, Robert Chadwell Williams, their leftwing connections led MI5 to open a KAEOT - \"keep an eye on them\" - file on the family as early as 1928.</p> <p>Six years later, Werner's father, Robert, arrived in Britain as a refugee. Her brother, J\u00fcrgen, joined him in London in 1936, where despite - or, indeed, because of - his communist sympathies and anti-fascist credentials, he was later recruited by the OSS, the forerunner of the American CIA, to contact resistance groups in occupied Europe and draw up intelligence reports.</p> <p>Werner's career as a spy began in 1930, when, with her first husband, Rudolf Hamburger, she went to live in Shanghai. Hamburger, an architect and Soviet agent, had taken a job with the British-administered Shanghai municipal council. She later described her shock at the poverty and exploitation in the city, where she soon became involved in revolutionary and communist circles. She was approached by the German communist Richard Sorge, then the Soviet Union's masterspy in the Far East (he was executed by the Japanese in 1944). She later described it as the \"one event which was to prove decisive for my future life\".</p> <p>Sorge, who gave Werner the codename Sonya, suggested she went to Moscow for training in espionage and radio communications at the headquarters of the Red army's intelligence service, the GRU. She travelled extensively as a GRU agent, returning to China, where she helped to organise revolutionary forces fighting the Japanese along the Manchurian border.</p> <p>In 1938, after settling her children in England, Werner was sent to Switzerland, the centre for Europe's espionage networks, including the Rote Kapelle (Red Orchestra) and the Lucy Ring, which was later used by Britain to pass intelligence about Germany to the Soviet Union. There she met Allan Foote, a British member of the Lucy Ring, who introduced her to a fellow veteran of the International Brigade in Spain, Len Beurton, whom she married in 1940. With that act, she became entitled to a British passport, and, after coming close to being denounced as a Soviet spy, she made her way to England, with Len following soon after.</p> <p>The family rented a cottage in Summertown, north Oxford, before moving to a large house in the nearby village of Great Rollright - a convenient place from which Werner could handle Fuchs, then living and working in Birmingham - and at the atomic research centre at Harwell.</p> <p>In 1942, Fuchs contacted J\u00fcrgen, who he had known from their past communist days, and J\u00fcrgen immediately put him in touch with Werner. They had a series of meetings in Banbury, after which Werner passed Fuchs's information either to her Soviet controllers in London or directly to Moscow by radio.</p> <p>In 1946, Moscow suddenly broke off contact with Werner for reasons which remain unexplained. However, it seems clear that, by the following year, her and Len's cover had been blown by Foote - if only because she was visited by two special branch officers. Whatever the truth of the matter, they appeared to have no evidence about what Werner had been up to, and, as she put it later: \"They left us calmly and politely, but empty-handed.\" MI5 did not put her under surveillance either before or after the visits - the consequence of both incompetence and complacency.</p> <p>Werner was allowed to leave Britain early in 1950, on the day before Fuchs was put on trial for giving away the west's atom secrets. As she wrote in her autobiography, Sonya's Report, which was published in Germany in 1977 and in Britain in 1991: \"Either it was complete stupidity on the part of MI5 never to have connected me with Klaus, or they may have let me get away with it, since every further discovery would have increased their disgrace.\"</p> <p>Werner had been a member of the KPD, and joined the Communist party of Great Britain in 1947. She then became a member of the former communist party of East Germany, the reformed party of Democratic Socialism, which announced her death - without giving the cause. She had been married three times, and had three children.</p> <p>In an afterword to the British translation of her au tobiography, she wrote: \"I had not worked those 20 years with Stalin in mind. We wanted to help the people of the Soviet Union in their efforts to prevent war, and when war broke out against German fascism, to win it\".</p> <p><b>Norman Moss writes: </b><br><br> Ruth Werner was one of the last of that generation of people who dedicated their lives to communism in the belief that they were working for a more humane and just society.

      "bodyText": "The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, said a prayer for peace yesterday as jeering MPs aimed a parting swipe at him with two no-confidence votes, forcing him to delay his flight to a historic summit in the US. He narrowly survived the first of the votes, underlining the lack of support for his mission to Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, where talks with the Palestinians begin today. His government coalition, or at least what remains of it after the defection of three of its members on Sunday, did not fall, because his opponents failed to muster an absolute majority of 61 of the 120 Knesset seats. But his failure to win even a simple majority - the result was 54 for the no-confidence motion, 52 against and seven abstentions - is a further reminder that the Knesset is angry with his secretive approach to the negotiations. He left for the US as soon as the result was announced, hours behind schedule and troubled by the fact that many of his colleagues in parliament suspect that he will sell out Israel's security interests at this high-stakes meeting. Commentators say that if the summit achieves a final settlement of the 52-year conflict with the Palestinians, Mr Barak will call a general election. They are uncertain what will happen if he returns with a more modest deal. If the talks collapse outright, he could be forced into a government of national unity with the rightwing Likud party. In a defiant speech Mr Barak told parliament yesterday that, while his government no longer commanded a majority, as the directly elected prime minister he still had a mandate to make peace. He said he would negotiate with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, \"in the name of the parents of Israel, the children of Israel, and the grandparents of Israel\". A poll yesterday showed that 52% believed he should still go to Camp David. It found that despite the collapse of his coalition, 53% of Israelis believe he has a mandate to make concessions to the Palestinians, against 44% per cent who do not. But the Knesset was furious at his efforts to circumvent its authority. In his speech, Mr Barak reached out to the rightwing and religious parties which have left his coalition by reaffirming that the contested city of Jerusalem would remain the \"eternal and undivided capital of Israel\". His opponents were un-convinced. \"He will do everything at this summit to get a peace treaty,\" said Silvan Shalom, whose Likud party tabled yesterday's no-confidence motion. \"He knows he cannot come back with his tail between his legs. The only thing that can save us is if Arafat refuses to move\" \u0095 President Ezer Weizman ended an illustrious career yesterday with an early resignation and a tarnished image. Under pressure to resign because of a money scandal, the 76-year-old president stepped down three years before the end of his second term. Since parliament made him president in 1993 he has come under fire for crossing the lines of his largely ceremonial post, blasting rightwing governments and encouraging dovish leaders to move on the path to peace.",

      "bodyText": "The retired BBC weatherman Bill Giles yesterday expressed sympathy for a nurse sent to jail after a nine year harassment campaign in which she claimed to be his daughter. Joanna Toner, 40, was jailed for two and a half years at Barnstaple crown court, Devon, after admitting breaching a restraining order of August 1998, when she was also jailed for six months, forbidding her to contact Mr Giles or his wife, Maureen. Toner, of Tiverton, who has two children, had also pleaded guilty to arson charges and a bomb hoax. After yesterday's hearing Mr Giles, 60, said: \"I feel very sorry for her. The fact she has pleaded guilty means she realised the problem she had.\" Toner had sent up to a dozen letters a day to Mr Giles, his wife, people in their village and staff at the weather centre in London. \"I was proposed to be Joanna's father.\" Peter Greenfield, defending, said Toner intended to pursue this claim \"through the correct legal channels\".",

Passengers on the London Underground's Northern line found themselves travelling at around 18mph in the wrong direction. The train came to a halt when it passed an automatic stop signal and there was no damage to the train or injuries to passengers. Passengers were then able to get off the train at Chalk Farm station in north London. Asked if the driver fell asleep at the controls, a London Underground spokeswoman said: \"We just don't know.\" LU has now begun an investigation and the driver, who passed a breath test after the incident and is awaiting the result of a drug test, has been \"stood down from all duties\" pending the results of the inquiry. The incident happened at 12.50am last Saturday when a northbound train ran backwards downhill from just outside Belsize Park to Chalk Farm. \"We are conducting an investigation to discover exactly how and why this incident occurred.

But they arrive more in apprehension than expectation, and time - at least under Bill Clinton's presidency - is running out.</p> <p>With the Israeli right in revolt and talk of wide gaps on key issues, the usually irrepressible Israel prime minister, Ehud Barak, has put the chance of success at no more than 50-50. The Palestinians, for their part, fear their leader, Yasser Arafat, will be persuaded to make more concessions than his people will swallow.</p> <p>On the American side, some suggest, President Clinton's first objective is to ensure that, if the summit fails, someone else will get the blame.

      "bodyText": "Palestinian and Israeli negotiators will gather at the US presidential retreat, Camp David, today for a summit that could end 50 years of conflict in the Middle East. But they arrive more in apprehension than expectation, and time - at least under Bill Clinton's presidency - is running out. With the Israeli right in revolt and talk of wide gaps on key issues, the usually irrepressible Israel prime minister, Ehud Barak, has put the chance of success at no more than 50-50. The Palestinians, for their part, fear their leader, Yasser Arafat, will be persuaded to make more concessions than his people will swallow. On the American side, some suggest, President Clinton's first objective is to ensure that, if the summit fails, someone else will get the blame. But there is more at stake for Mr Clinton than that: success would redeem his presidency for the history books and give a huge boost to the Democrats' election campaign. Israelis and Palestinians alike will seek to emphasise today how little scope they have for manoeuvre. Mr Barak can point to the fragility of his coalition, amply demonstrated by his opponents in the past few days.But his position is perhaps more secure than it looks. In the event of a deal he has promised a referendum, which would allow the more extreme elements of his coalition no more weight than is their due.

The attempted adoption, which cost the couple $19,000 (\u00a313,000), raises doubts about US adoption controls. While adoption agencies are strictly regulated in some American states, others fall below British standards. The couple, who live in the south of England with their 15-year-old son, have been deemed unsuitable adoptive parents by their local social services department. Social workers, who discovered that the couple had the baby when she was taken for medical treatment, took her into care and placed her with foster parents. They contacted the adoption agency and suggested that it try to get back the baby, whose adoption had not been finalised. The order by Mr Justice Johnson, one of the family division's most senior judges, is the first to be granted to an adoption agency under the Hague convention, drawn up to return children kidnapped by estranged parents in tug-of-love battles. The agency will have its legal costs met by the British taxpayer. The judge made the order last Thursday, but cleared it for publication only yesterday. He said yesterday that his decision would have been much more difficult had the baby spent a year or more with the couple and become settled. But she was only seven months old and living with foster parents. In his judgment, he criticised the way the adoption process had been handled: \"I do not think anybody could begin to believe this was a proper way of deciding the future of a human being.\" He said that the baby girl, identified only by the initial J, was born in Texas on December 18 and immediately handed over by her mother, who had relinquished all parental responsibility, to the adoption agency. Two days later the prospective father from England went to the US, and J was handed over after he signed an adoption agreement. The judgment states that $19,000 was paid to the agency, but the agency's solicitor, Carolynn Usher, said her client, a non-profit concern, had not taken that much, and suggested that it might be a total figure for the couple's cost and expenses, including airfare. She said the US view was that it was in the child's interest to have a quick placement, while agencies in Britain took \"a more cautious approach\". The judge said the agreement provided for the adoption to be finalised within seven months and referred to \"home visits\" by a social worker. But having signed the agreement and paid the money, the adoptive father returned to Britain with the child, who was only six days old. No home visits had taken place. Mr Justice Johnson said a surprising feature of the case was that the adoption proceeded on the basis of a report by an independent social worker with no professional qualifications. The judge said the social services department was concerned when it discovered the baby was living with the couple \"because it believed that there were compelling reasons why the couple should not be regarded as able to provide a safe and secure home for J\".

      "body": "<p>Next time you buy an ice cream pause before you guzzle it. You are holding a cold link to history in your hand. What was once a luxury at the feasts of the fabulously wealthy is yours to munch any time the impulse grabs you.</p> <p><strong> What are the origins of ice cream?</strong> </p> <p>It is said that Marco Polo brought the knowledge of ice-cream making back with him from China in the 13th century. There is no evidence and it is doubtful that he reached China. </p> <p>However, the use of ice and snow to cool food and drink dates back more than 4,000 years. Alexander the Great is known to have ordered the digging of pits in which to store mountain ice, and the Romans put snow in their wine. </p> <p>If you mix salts such as alum in water a reaction occurs which causes the temperature of the water to drop. This chemistry may have travelled from India to the Middle East where Arabs used it to cool sugared drinks they called \"sharab\" - the early version of sorbet. Thanks to trade or the writings of Arab scholars, the salt technique came to southern Europe. Water ices appeared in Italy by the middle of the 17th century and in Naples they added fruit to cold sweetened milk. Ice cream had arrived! </p> <p><strong> What contributed to making ice cream available for everyone?</strong> </p> <p>When King Charles II ate ice cream at a banquet at Windsor Castle in 1671 it was only served to him and the people at his table. So it was across Europe. Ice cream was just for the rich people who could afford to build ice houses to store ice \"farmed\" from winter lakes and ponds.</p> <p>It was not until the 19th century that ice cream became the food of humbler folk. Several factors contributed. Chefs, who once might have only cooked for royalty, set up restaurants. Their menus included ice cream. Second, recipe books featuring ice-cream dishes became popular. In one of these by a Mrs Marshall, published in 1888, the first mention of ice-cream cones occurs.</p> <p>Better transport meant ice dropped in price - London received supplies from as far away as Norway. Poverty caused many Italians to seek their fortunes in Britain and America - often they became involved in the ice-cream trade. With the arrival of electricity, inventors created the first refrigerators. Ice cream could be stored and the stage was now set.</p> <p><strong> How much ice cream is sold in Britain?</strong></p> <p>About 370 ice-cream makers operate in Britain. There are two main types: impulse products (cones and stick ices) and premium products (luxury ice creams designed for home eating). Sales are worth a cool \u00a31 billion a year. Most goes to a few international firms. Seven in 10 ice creams bought on impulse in the UK are made by Wall's. More than 60 million Magnums are eaten in Britain every year - one for every resident.</p> <p><strong> How did Wall's come to dominate the UK ice-cream scene?</strong></p> <p>It found clever ways of distributing its ice cream. There were \"stop-me-and-buy-one\" tricycles and then ice-cream vans. It lent shops refrigerators in which only Wall's ice creams could be stored. Rivals, such as Lyons Maid and Mars were cut off from large parts of the marketplace.</p> <p><strong> Has Wall's had an unfair advantage?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, say its rivals. In 1989 Mars extended its famous chocolate bar into a dairy ice cream. Frustrated by its inability to get its product into many shops, it pressed British governments to loosen Walls' grip. In January the government backed a ruling that, among other measures, Wall's would have to allow shop owners to fill up to 50% of its freezer space with rivals' products. This summer will be the last season that Wall's has the big distribution advantage. Talk of an ice-cream revolution is in the air.</p> <p><strong> Further activities</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Behind every ice cream there is a story.

      "bodyText": "Next time you buy an ice cream pause before you guzzle it. You are holding a cold link to history in your hand. What was once a luxury at the feasts of the fabulously wealthy is yours to munch any time the impulse grabs you. What are the origins of ice cream? It is said that Marco Polo brought the knowledge of ice-cream making back with him from China in the 13th century. There is no evidence and it is doubtful that he reached China. However, the use of ice and snow to cool food and drink dates back more than 4,000 years. Alexander the Great is known to have ordered the digging of pits in which to store mountain ice, and the Romans put snow in their wine. If you mix salts such as alum in water a reaction occurs which causes the temperature of the water to drop. This chemistry may have travelled from India to the Middle East where Arabs used it to cool sugared drinks they called \"sharab\" - the early version of sorbet. Thanks to trade or the writings of Arab scholars, the salt technique came to southern Europe. Water ices appeared in Italy by the middle of the 17th century and in Naples they added fruit to cold sweetened milk. Ice cream had arrived! What contributed to making ice cream available for everyone? When King Charles II ate ice cream at a banquet at Windsor Castle in 1671 it was only served to him and the people at his table. So it was across Europe. Ice cream was just for the rich people who could afford to build ice houses to store ice \"farmed\" from winter lakes and ponds. It was not until the 19th century that ice cream became the food of humbler folk. Several factors contributed. Chefs, who once might have only cooked for royalty, set up restaurants. Their menus included ice cream. Second, recipe books featuring ice-cream dishes became popular. In one of these by a Mrs Marshall, published in 1888, the first mention of ice-cream cones occurs. Better transport meant ice dropped in price - London received supplies from as far away as Norway. Poverty caused many Italians to seek their fortunes in Britain and America - often they became involved in the ice-cream trade. With the arrival of electricity, inventors created the first refrigerators. Ice cream could be stored and the stage was now set. How much ice cream is sold in Britain? About 370 ice-cream makers operate in Britain. There are two main types: impulse products (cones and stick ices) and premium products (luxury ice creams designed for home eating). Sales are worth a cool \u00a31 billion a year. Most goes to a few international firms. Seven in 10 ice creams bought on impulse in the UK are made by Wall's. More than 60 million Magnums are eaten in Britain every year - one for every resident. How did Wall's come to dominate the UK ice-cream scene? It found clever ways of distributing its ice cream. There were \"stop-me-and-buy-one\" tricycles and then ice-cream vans. It lent shops refrigerators in which only Wall's ice creams could be stored. Rivals, such as Lyons Maid and Mars were cut off from large parts of the marketplace. Has Wall's had an unfair advantage? Yes, say its rivals. In 1989 Mars extended its famous chocolate bar into a dairy ice cream. Frustrated by its inability to get its product into many shops, it pressed British governments to loosen Walls' grip. In January the government backed a ruling that, among other measures, Wall's would have to allow shop owners to fill up to 50% of its freezer space with rivals' products. This summer will be the last season that Wall's has the big distribution advantage. Talk of an ice-cream revolution is in the air. Further activities \u0095 Behind every ice cream there is a story. Track down the origins of the Sundae, the Knickerbocker Glory and the Peach Melba. \u0095 Merchandising tie-ins between ice creams and films or cartoon characters make up a significant number of the products on the market. Invent a stick ice that reflects a character in one of your class readers or set texts. Make the shape, flavours and texture fit the character's personality. \u0095 Research the big ice cream manufacturers on line Mars, Unilever (for Birds Eye Wall's ), Ben and Jerry's \u0095 Haagen Dazs may sound Scandinavian but it is an invented name.

Lovelier now the scene Than in the richness of a summer eve, For all familiar to the eye was veil'd And the deep obscure delighted while it mock'd The baffled light. The Sun shone cheerfully On the clear summit that my toil had gain'd, And where the fir trees skirted the deep grove, Shot a slant beam upon their branchless trunk Their bright brown bark, and tinged its rusty moss. The autumnal leaves to the fresh morning air Their grateful odour gave; the broken dew Clouded the green sward grey; and the thin stem Of the grass-blossom bent with little globes Whose whole collected waters had not brimm'd Some Elfin's acorn cup. Onward I went - It seem'd as I looked down upon the Sun That climbing glorious up the eastern heaven Flash'd on my dazzled sight: anon the mist Roll'd on and veil'd its beams, and in a sea Of cloud wrapt all things, - only visible Thro' the white vapour was the beamless Sun.",

That's the third this year. </p> <p><strong> He's too good at ducking.</strong> I'm not complaining. Do you want reinforced glass this time? </p> <p><strong> Good idea. I suppose you clear up after a lot of domestic rows.</strong> We glaziers do many things, madam. </p> <p><strong> Oh, do tell.</strong> We cut glass, plastic or any window material and put it where and when it's needed: domestic double-glazing, big plate-glass shop fronts, glass roofs on industrial buildings, stained or leaded glass. </p> <p><strong> It's not just boring old glass?</strong> We use our knowledge of the properties of each glazing material and the position it is to be installed in to choose the appropriate material. </p> <p><strong> And there's the Plasticine, too.</strong> We call it putty, madam. </p> <p><strong> Do you specialise, or all do everything? </strong> There are specialists, especially in smaller firms. The staple work is window fixing, security, safety or high-wind glass, double-glazed windows and pre-glazed doors and roof glazing. </p> <p><strong> You obviously get around.</strong> Not half. Glaziers work both indoors and outdoors in all weathers and on construction sites where it can be pretty dirty or noisy. And often we work high up and need ladders, scaffolding and suspended cradles. </p> <p><strong> And you need muscles?</strong> Yep. We have to handle large, heavy panes of glass carefully. </p> <p><strong> Sounds dangerous.</strong> Working with glass requires a great deal of safety awareness, not just for ourselves but for other workers and members of the public. </p> <p><strong> What qualities are useful?</strong> Practical ability. The work takes methodical planning. Accurate measurement is essential. We need to be able to follow drawings, plans and written or spoken instructions. Cutting glass is a skill, which can be dangerous if care is not taken. Some specialist jobs, such as stained glass work, require a creative approach to colour and shape. </p> <p><strong> Any entry requirements?</strong> Not really, although a few GCSEs (grades A-G) are usually needed for entry as a trainee craftsperson. Maths, English and technology subjects are useful for the parts of the job that involve measurements and calculations and for theoretical training.

We take our Scrabble seriously. But not your windows. That's the third this year. He's too good at ducking. I'm not complaining. Do you want reinforced glass this time? Good idea. I suppose you clear up after a lot of domestic rows. We glaziers do many things, madam. Oh, do tell. We cut glass, plastic or any window material and put it where and when it's needed: domestic double-glazing, big plate-glass shop fronts, glass roofs on industrial buildings, stained or leaded glass. It's not just boring old glass? We use our knowledge of the properties of each glazing material and the position it is to be installed in to choose the appropriate material. And there's the Plasticine, too. We call it putty, madam. Do you specialise, or all do everything? There are specialists, especially in smaller firms. The staple work is window fixing, security, safety or high-wind glass, double-glazed windows and pre-glazed doors and roof glazing. You obviously get around. Not half. Glaziers work both indoors and outdoors in all weathers and on construction sites where it can be pretty dirty or noisy. And often we work high up and need ladders, scaffolding and suspended cradles. And you need muscles? Yep. We have to handle large, heavy panes of glass carefully. Sounds dangerous. Working with glass requires a great deal of safety awareness, not just for ourselves but for other workers and members of the public. What qualities are useful? Practical ability. The work takes methodical planning. Accurate measurement is essential. We need to be able to follow drawings, plans and written or spoken instructions. Cutting glass is a skill, which can be dangerous if care is not taken. Some specialist jobs, such as stained glass work, require a creative approach to colour and shape. Any entry requirements? Not really, although a few GCSEs (grades A-G) are usually needed for entry as a trainee craftsperson. Maths, English and technology subjects are useful for the parts of the job that involve measurements and calculations and for theoretical training. Entrants for apprenticeships or training schemes may have to pass a selection test. What about training? Most glaziers train on the job and gain vocational qualifications part-time at college. They are likely to work towards NVQs in installing glass structures and architectural glazing systems.

      "body": "<p>She called herself a white witch. One of three, as it happens, who had visited a 14th-century cellar near Coventry Cathedral at different times.</p> <p>Word had spread that there was a \"presence\" down there. Whatever it was certainly put the fear of God into witch number three. She was up the steps and through the tourist information office, which stands over the cellar, almost before staff had noticed she'd gone. Almost, but not quite.</p> <p>Carole Jung, assistant manager of the tourist office at the time, noticed that the witch looked \"frightened to death\". And she wasn't surprised. She, too, had had first-hand experience of the apparition and felt as though she were \"intruding, disturbing something\" when she took tours down the cellar.</p> <p>Others had been affected as well. Colour was seen to drain from the face of a visiting Canadian journalist, who said later that he was sure the face of a woman had been peering over his right shoulder.</p> <p>News of these strange phenomena had spread, not only to the community of white witches but also to Coventry University. Vic Tandy was more interested than most. He is experimental officer and part-time lecturer in the school of international studies and law. He could also be described as the university's chief ghost buster.</p> <p>Two years ago, he and Dr Tony Lawrence of the psychology department wrote a paper called Ghosts in the Machine for the journal of the Society for Psychical Research. They cited infrasound as the cause of apparitions seen by staff at a so-called haunted laboratory in Warwick.</p> <p>Tandy has just sent in another contribution to the same magazine. It is called Something in the Cellar, and it nails the culprit which terrified a Canadian journalist and a white witch. Infrasound, again.</p> <p>Infrasound, what's more, at the same level as that found in the Warwick laboratory: 18.9 Hz. As the .9 suggests, this is a very accurate reading established over a lengthy period using a sophisticated spectrum analyser from the university's department of engineering.</p> <p>Infrasound is not easy to measure because it vibrates at a frequency below the level of human hearing. \"Evidence from Nasa and other sources suggests that it can cause you to hyperventilate and your eyeballs to vibrate,\" says Tandy. Having established its presence here at a level likely to cause anxiety and apparitions, he is now trying to establish why some people are affected and not others.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he is developing a device - \"a sort of litmus test\" - which will detect the presence of infrasound. It won't cost thousands and it won't require a 13-amp plug. \"That does rather restrict your areas of research,\" he says with a grin. For the time being, he is using another spectrum analyser, cheaper than the one belonging to the engineering department, and battery-driven.</p> <p>Still, with its stylish silver case and its laptop screen, it looks rather incongruous parked on a glass display case full of medieval bone pins, 16th-century clay pipes and other artefacts from Coventry's illustrious past. Modern science on top of ancient history.</p> <p>Surely science in the 21st century will confine the ghosts to history by explaining them away. Not necessarily. \"When it comes to supernatural phenomena, I'm sitting on the fence.

      "bodyText": "She called herself a white witch. One of three, as it happens, who had visited a 14th-century cellar near Coventry Cathedral at different times. Word had spread that there was a \"presence\" down there. Whatever it was certainly put the fear of God into witch number three. She was up the steps and through the tourist information office, which stands over the cellar, almost before staff had noticed she'd gone. Almost, but not quite. Carole Jung, assistant manager of the tourist office at the time, noticed that the witch looked \"frightened to death\". And she wasn't surprised. She, too, had had first-hand experience of the apparition and felt as though she were \"intruding, disturbing something\" when she took tours down the cellar. Others had been affected as well. Colour was seen to drain from the face of a visiting Canadian journalist, who said later that he was sure the face of a woman had been peering over his right shoulder. News of these strange phenomena had spread, not only to the community of white witches but also to Coventry University. Vic Tandy was more interested than most. He is experimental officer and part-time lecturer in the school of international studies and law. He could also be described as the university's chief ghost buster. Two years ago, he and Dr Tony Lawrence of the psychology department wrote a paper called Ghosts in the Machine for the journal of the Society for Psychical Research. They cited infrasound as the cause of apparitions seen by staff at a so-called haunted laboratory in Warwick. Tandy has just sent in another contribution to the same magazine. It is called Something in the Cellar, and it nails the culprit which terrified a Canadian journalist and a white witch. Infrasound, again. Infrasound, what's more, at the same level as that found in the Warwick laboratory: 18.9 Hz. As the .9 suggests, this is a very accurate reading established over a lengthy period using a sophisticated spectrum analyser from the university's department of engineering. Infrasound is not easy to measure because it vibrates at a frequency below the level of human hearing. \"Evidence from Nasa and other sources suggests that it can cause you to hyperventilate and your eyeballs to vibrate,\" says Tandy. Having established its presence here at a level likely to cause anxiety and apparitions, he is now trying to establish why some people are affected and not others. Meanwhile, he is developing a device - \"a sort of litmus test\" - which will detect the presence of infrasound. It won't cost thousands and it won't require a 13-amp plug. \"That does rather restrict your areas of research,\" he says with a grin. For the time being, he is using another spectrum analyser, cheaper than the one belonging to the engineering department, and battery-driven. Still, with its stylish silver case and its laptop screen, it looks rather incongruous parked on a glass display case full of medieval bone pins, 16th-century clay pipes and other artefacts from Coventry's illustrious past. Modern science on top of ancient history. Surely science in the 21st century will confine the ghosts to history by explaining them away. Not necessarily. \"When it comes to supernatural phenomena, I'm sitting on the fence. That's where scientists should be until we've proved that there isn't anything,\" says Tandy, who has had some personal experience of what it's like to feel a ghostly presence. It happened some years ago when he was designing anaesthetic machines in that \"haunted\" Warwick laboratory. A cleaner had already given in her notice, complaining that she had seen a grey object out of the corner of her eye and \"gone all cold\". Tandy was working late one night when the grey thing came for him. \"I felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck,\" he recalls. \"It seemed to be between me and the door, so the only thing I could do was turn and face it.\" It disappeared. But only to reappear in a different form the following day when Tandy, a keen fencer, was oiling his foil and changing its grip for a forthcoming tournament. \"The handle was clamped in a vice on a workbench, yet the blade started vibrating like mad,\" he remembers.

New research to be published this week will show that the earnings gap between graduates and those holding advanced vocational qualifications is not so high as is thought. Holding a degree brings 9% more in annual earnings than not having one. This compares with a 7.5% annual earnings boost of having a higher national diploma (HND). Other vocational qualifications at level 3 and above reap similarly sizeable salary advantages. But far smaller positive earnings were found from national vocational qualifications (NVQs) at levels 1 and 2 by researchers at the Centre for Economics in Education in London. The results of the study, commissioned last summer by the DfEE, will be welcomed by ministers and - understandably - by the further education sector. Malcolm Wicks, the lifelong learning minister, also applauds the research's findings that basic numeracy and literacy skills bring significant earnings and employment advantages compared with not having these skills. Wicks, who is due to speak at the study's launch on Thursday at a conference in London, says it strongly backs up the government's desire to tackle Britain's high levels of adult illiteracy and innumeracy. The findings ought to have an impact on the decisions taken at 16 and 18, says Anna Vignoles, one of the four researchers who carried out the study. \"We'll certainly see that parents, children and their advisers who have to take those difficult decisions won't be so quick to assume that the academic qualification is immeasurably superior.\" She said the study found marked gender differences.

A man with an HNC or HND enjoys a 15% annual earnings advantage over a man without. Having the same qualification gives a woman a 9% advantage. Women with nursing and teaching qualifications also get higher returns from them than men. The research set out to calculate returns for major academic and vocational qualifications, including City &amp; Guilds, RSAs, and Btecs. It added a new twist on previous work in this area, by taking the length of study for each qualification into account. For instance, the data showed that men earned a 28% annual return from a degree, compared with a 15% return from an HNC. But the latter takes two years to do and the degree typically requires three years. \"Annualising\" these figures gives a return per year of study and narrows the apparently large gap between the two qualifications, says Vignoles.

She decided that she would confound her teachers and catch up on the education she had missed at school. </p> <p>The first step was a two-year maths course. That led to an Open University access course and then to a degree course. </p> <p>The Labour vision of a graduate economy depends on a huge expansion of higher education and a corresponding increase in the diversity of the student body. The traditional three-year degree course, with its assumption that the typical student will be 18, full-time and resident on campus, is likely to become an early casualty. Part-time courses, home study, distance learning and portable modules will become the norm. </p> <p>Government plans already acknowledge a move towards this goal.

      "bodyText": "Cassandra Bailey left school with virtually no qualifications and a feeling that education was something that other people did. \"No one really expected me to go on and do GCSEs or A levels,\" she remembers. A series of low-paid jobs persuaded the 23-year-old single mother that she needed to improve her prospects. She decided that she would confound her teachers and catch up on the education she had missed at school. The first step was a two-year maths course. That led to an Open University access course and then to a degree course. The Labour vision of a graduate economy depends on a huge expansion of higher education and a corresponding increase in the diversity of the student body. The traditional three-year degree course, with its assumption that the typical student will be 18, full-time and resident on campus, is likely to become an early casualty. Part-time courses, home study, distance learning and portable modules will become the norm. Government plans already acknowledge a move towards this goal. On current projections a third of the students in 2001-2 will be part-timers, and future growth is envisaged to be almost entirely driven by part-time provision.

      "body": "<p>If you happen to be passing through St Albans on a weekday morning just before nine, you may come across a woman pushing a shopping trolley with a dozen or so children in tow. Don't worry. This isn't cider lady on the rampage, but the last word in green transport policy.</p> <p>Every schoolday at Wheatfield School two parents take up position at opposite ends of a crocodile of children to kick-start the walking bus. The children throw their satchels and folders into the trolley and the whole lot then march to school, stopping from time to time at designated pick-up points to allow others to join en route. </p> <p>The Wheatfield scheme is cheap, non-polluting, decongests the roads and has the added benefit of keeping the children in some sort of shape. It is just the sort of thing David Blunkett must have had in mind when he recently urged everyone to get back into the habit of walking to school. </p> <p>To be fair to the nation's cholesterol levels, about half of all children, particularly those of primary age, still do walk to school, but this is a significant fall from the 1970s when about 72% walked. Some of the differences can be put down to increased car ownership and parental fears for safety, but there is still a sizeable and growing number of commuter kids for whom walking to school is never going to be an option. </p> <p>Schools don't come much more remote than those in the Orkneys, and of the 1,754 primary and 1,366 secondary children on register, more than 1,700 are entitled to school transport provided by the islands' education department. For primary schoolchildren this may just involve a bus journey, as many of the smaller islands have their own schools. But with just four junior secondary schools on the larger islands, and with the only two secondary schools that educate up to university level both on Orkney itself, pitching up for school can be a long haul for some children. </p> <p>\"A typical journey for those living on the inner islands might involve a 20-minute ride by car or bus, followed by a 20-minute ferry journey with another 20-minute bus ride at the other end,\" says Kevin Balfour, the administration officer for the Orkneys education department. \"For those living further away, a daily commute is not a viable option so children spend their weekday nights in a hostel and only take the ferry home at weekends.\" </p> <p>Sometimes, even a ferry isn't an option. North Ronaldsay is so isolated that Orkney has the provision to fly children to secondary school on the main island, though no children at present qualify for this five-star service. What strikes one most about the Orkney set-up is just how well the system works. Given the extremes of bad weather and the comparatively few hours of winter daylight, it is astonishing that only two days in the whole of the last academic year were lost to those travelling in by water. A day at school must seem a doddle after a force eight gale in the North Sea. </p> <p>Even in Northamptonshire, by no means the wildest county in the UK, getting to school can be a problem. Silverstone Junior and Infants schools both serve a couple of out-lying villages, the furthest of which is five or six miles away - a tough daily hike for even the fittest six-year-old. </p> <p>Until comparatively recently, most parents were happy to send their children to school on the bus, and the kids seemed happy with the arrangement, too. \"It was much more interesting going on the bus than by car with my mum,\" says seven-year-old William Lawson, though his mother believes his preference might have something to do with being force-fed spelling tests in the car. </p> <p>But all this changed when parents cottoned on to the fact that the bus service may not be as safe as it seemed. \"If the school takes your children on trips during school hours then rigorous safety checks apply,\" says Sarah Lawson. \"But before school hours, anything goes. The LEA put the bus service out to public tender and chose the cheapest. With the new company, United Counties Stagecoach, the buses no longer have seat belts or escorts. We were even told that the bus was a public service and that anyone could travel on it. </p> <p>\"There have been other problems, too. The bus hasn't always shown up, it has got lost and when we expressed concern about the speed, the driver told us that there were new time-tables and he couldn't keep up. We've complained to the council but little has happened, so most of us have now chosen not to use the service.\" </p> <p>A few weeks ago, a double-decker bus turned up to collect the two remaining children who were using the service and, symbolically, promptly broke down. One man who isn't surprised by this turn of events is Simon Larter, the head teacher of Northamptonshire Grammar School. In September last year, 14 of his pupils were involved in a road accident when the mini-coach they were travelling in crashed into two parked cars. </p> <p>\"The ambulance crew said it was only because the pupils were wearing seat belts that they escaped serious injury,\" said Larter. The school has now initiated a campaign to make it illegal for public service vehicles that carry children not to have seatbelts, rather than for the decision to be left to the discretion of local authorities. </p> <p>Distance and safety are by no means the only reasons why children sometimes end up being driven to school. In fact, the government's own policy and example on school selection has encouraged many parents to turn their kids into pint-sized commuters. Tony Blair ignored the Catholic school on his then Islington doorstep and instead sent his two eldest sons to the London Oratory, some six or seven miles away in Hammersmith, west London. Harriet Harman made a similar choice for her son, and where these two politicians have led, others have followed. Some, it must be said, out of necessity rather than inclination. </p> <p>\"Parental choice works just fine if you can actually get your children into the school you want,\" says Alex Benady, a south London father of two. \"But what the system has done for everyone else is to turn schooling into a lottery. Those schools with good reputations become everyone's first choice and are hopelessly oversubscribed, and the vast majority of people are left disappointed and unsure what to do next. You can't even try to second-guess the selection procedures for most schools' annual intake because they are thoroughly opaque.\" </p> <p>Benady applied to seven primary schools in the area for a place next year for his four-year-old son. He has been turned down by every single one. \"One of the schools was a beacon school,\" he continues, \"but the rest were all just average state schools. The only school we think we could still get into is one that has huge problems, with disastrous SATs results, a large intake of troubled children and widespread bullying, and I'm not prepared to send my son there. As a result we've had to consider an independent school but even that is an unsatisfactory 10- to 15-minute drive away. The only other option we have is to move.\" </p> <p>Outside London, parental choice tends to be a hypothetical rather than a practical issue as the distances involved in more rural areas often preclude more than the nearest option, but some parents will go to almost any lengths to ensure their children go to the right school. The average journey time for pupils to Manchester Grammar School is more than an hour each way, with some children coming in from as far as Sheffield and Blackpool, and most will pass one or two schools on the way where they have declined places. </p> <p>\"Our working day reflects our pupils' travelling time,\" says Dr Martin Stephen, the High Master of Manchester Grammar. \"We start at 9.10am and end at 3.45pm. Ease of travel is far more important than the time it takes, and most children regard the journey as a relaxant rather than a stressor. Our bus service has almost become a rite of passage and many boys prefer to take it rather than travel in to Manchester with their parents.\" </p> <p>Dr Stephen points to the school's 87% pass rate at grades A and B at A level and the thriving community of extracurricular clubs and societies as proof that the children aren't exhausted by or unhappy with the travelling. </p> <p>\"You accept the travelling if you value and enjoy what you get at the end of it. In my six years in charge, I've only ever had two boys come to me with commuting problems. One was a boy whose parents had divorced and whose mother had moved to a remote part of Derbyshire, and the other was a boy who had had a local bus service cancelled.\" </p> <p>None of which cuts too much ice with Benady, who spent two hours each day travelling across south London to school as a teenager. \"I found the journey deeply depressing and corrosive,\" he recalls. \"My home and school life became separated from one another and I ended up not knowing anyone where I lived.\" </p> <p>Not everyone reacts in the same way, of course, but not for the first time, one senses that Labour's policies are pulling in opposite directions. Almost by definition, parental choice equates to more travel and yet at the same time Blunkett is urging us all to walk to school. Time for a third way, perhaps.</p>",

Our bus service has almost become a rite of passage and many boys prefer to take it rather than travel in to Manchester with their parents.\" Dr Stephen points to the school's 87% pass rate at grades A and B at A level and the thriving community of extracurricular clubs and societies as proof that the children aren't exhausted by or unhappy with the travelling. \"You accept the travelling if you value and enjoy what you get at the end of it. In my six years in charge, I've only ever had two boys come to me with commuting problems. One was a boy whose parents had divorced and whose mother had moved to a remote part of Derbyshire, and the other was a boy who had had a local bus service cancelled.\" None of which cuts too much ice with Benady, who spent two hours each day travelling across south London to school as a teenager. \"I found the journey deeply depressing and corrosive,\" he recalls. \"My home and school life became separated from one another and I ended up not knowing anyone where I lived.\" Not everyone reacts in the same way, of course, but not for the first time, one senses that Labour's policies are pulling in opposite directions. Almost by definition, parental choice equates to more travel and yet at the same time Blunkett is urging us all to walk to school. Time for a third way, perhaps.",

Denscombe has questioned over 1,600 young people aged 15-16 about what they regard as the main threats to their health. \"Time and again,\" writes Denscombe, \"young people talked of the stresses involved as they worked in school towards their 16+ examinations.\" Irrespective of their social background or whether they were planning to leave school at 16 to find work, \"the vast majority of the young people were caught up with the pressure\". </p> <p>It is clear from what young people say that one source of their pressure comes from the feeling that the GCSE examination is the first one that really matters. Despite having taken national Standard Assessment Tasks (SATs) and other school exams, the youngsters believed that their performance at GCSE was the first time their achievements and potential were to be publicised.

These are times \"when events come together in such a way that an individual stands, as it were, at a crossroads in his existence\". To most teenagers, GCSE examinations are certainly fateful moments in their lives. </p> <p>But how have national public exams set at an age not even contemplated in many other countries been allowed to become so important at such a sensitive time in the lives of young people? One answer is the political climate around education that Tony Blair has been so instrumental in creating. As Professor Denscombe says, \"government policies in recent years have raised the profile of GCSE results and, as we enter the new millennium, there is little indication of any relaxation of this regime.\" </p> <p>Teenagers are aware of the political dimension associated with their GCSE performance and see their teachers as \"stress amplifiers\" as a result. They know that teachers are constantly nagging and pressurising them about work because they themselves are being judged by the publication of GCSE league tables. Many GCSE students now believe that this nagging is a result of teacher anxiety about their own positions rather than a desire to see their charges do well. As a result, the teachers may be contributing to teenage stress. </p> <p>As one of the interviewed students says: \"If teachers eased back a little, I think there would be less stress. Because at the end of the day we know what we've got to do. I mean it's like preaching all the time. But we don't need it for all the way throughout the year.\" </p> <p>As Tony Blair contemplates how best to deal with his son's excessive stress-release mechanism, he might wish to consider the words of Tracey, another year 11 student, who talked about her attempted suicide.

But Party in the Park, an annual pop fest held in Hyde Park, has changed all that. </strong></p> <p><strong>This weekend more than 40 acts gathered, along with 100,000 fans, to celebrate in the pouring rain. From Artful Dodger to Billie, Kylie and the increasingly glamourous Moloko, if it had hit the charts, it was here. </strong></p> <p><strong>The oddest sight came when Elton John, here known as EJ, stepped in to replace a member of boy band Backstreet Boys, AJ, who was home nursing his sick grandfather. Embarrassing doesn't get close to it. </strong></p> <p><strong>Victoria Beckham, on the other hand, was worth close scrutiny on this her first solo outing. Together with the Truesteppers for Out of Your Mind, she looked fantastic, hair extensions and all. The fact that she mimed, along with over half the other artists, didn't distract from her triumph. </strong></p> <p><strong>But it was down to old hands Bon Jovi to give the kids a good time. Running through a couple of hits and rounding off with a surprising cover of Lulu's Shout, Jon Bon Jovi strutted, teased, pulled his shirt off and shook his maracas, proving just how much fun pop can really be. BC</strong> </p> <p> S ome things in festival land never change. The queues for the scary toilets never shorten; in Scotland, it rains real sheets of driving rain all weekend. At Glasgow's T in the Park people sported free yellow plastic sheets to keep the damp out. They looked a lot like packets of Quavers. </p> <p>Iggy Pop looked more like one of those bacon-flavoured treats of old, a Frazzle, all lean and brown. In the wild, wild weather it was left to consummate performers like him to inject the crowd with something close to a lust for life.

      "bodyText": "W hile there are numerous summer festivals for indie kids, the clean world of pop has never had a grubby home. But Party in the Park, an annual pop fest held in Hyde Park, has changed all that. This weekend more than 40 acts gathered, along with 100,000 fans, to celebrate in the pouring rain. From Artful Dodger to Billie, Kylie and the increasingly glamourous Moloko, if it had hit the charts, it was here. The oddest sight came when Elton John, here known as EJ, stepped in to replace a member of boy band Backstreet Boys, AJ, who was home nursing his sick grandfather. Embarrassing doesn't get close to it. Victoria Beckham, on the other hand, was worth close scrutiny on this her first solo outing. Together with the Truesteppers for Out of Your Mind, she looked fantastic, hair extensions and all. The fact that she mimed, along with over half the other artists, didn't distract from her triumph. But it was down to old hands Bon Jovi to give the kids a good time. Running through a couple of hits and rounding off with a surprising cover of Lulu's Shout, Jon Bon Jovi strutted, teased, pulled his shirt off and shook his maracas, proving just how much fun pop can really be. BC S ome things in festival land never change. The queues for the scary toilets never shorten; in Scotland, it rains real sheets of driving rain all weekend. At Glasgow's T in the Park people sported free yellow plastic sheets to keep the damp out. They looked a lot like packets of Quavers. Iggy Pop looked more like one of those bacon-flavoured treats of old, a Frazzle, all lean and brown. In the wild, wild weather it was left to consummate performers like him to inject the crowd with something close to a lust for life. He pulled it off with gusto, encouraging the crowd to join him on stage for The Passenger. On the main stage, the acts divided into those that could rise above the sodden atmosphere (All Saints, Moby, Macy Gray, Supergrass) and those that failed to (Gomez, Idlewild, Ocean Colour Scene). A better option by far was to take refuge in the tented arenas, especially the King Tut's Tent, with some very fine options to dry off to (Badly Drawn Boy, Moloko, Toploader, Coldplay).
