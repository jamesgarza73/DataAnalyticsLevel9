      "body": "<p> On Thursday we were saying the ICC Knockout needed an upset. On Saturday it got one: Australia, the favourites, were knocked out in their first game, soundly beaten by India.</p> <p>While one Roy of the Rovers story was coming to an end at Wembley, another began at the Nairobi Gymkhana, as an unknown 18-year-old hit 84 against the world's best team, then took a great catch and, for good measure, pulled off a direct-hit run-out to get rid of the world's best one-day batsman, Michael Bevan. Yuvraj Singh didn't just make a name for himself: he lit the flame of a somewhat flickering tournament. He was Cathy Freeman and Ian Thorpe at the same time.</p> <p>The role of Eric the Eel was played by Glenn McGrath. About 99 per cent of the time, McGrath is utterly reliable - Angus Fraser with more pace and less grace. But when he is bad, he is very bad. It happened at Lord's in May 1997, when he served up half-volleys for Ben Hollioake to flick nonchalantly over midwicket. It happened at Edgbaston a couple of weeks later, when Nasser Hussain made 200 on a seaming pitch. It happened at Lord's in 1998, when Sachin Tendulkar alternately drove him on the up or pulled him into the Tavern. And it happened in Nairobi on Saturday. Tendulkar hit three sixes in consecutive overs from McGrath, who responded by sledging. The umpires didn't apply the new five-run penalty, but instead a subtler form of punishment came into force. So much time was wasted by McGrath's posturing - and the retrieval of the ball, as he conceded 61 off just nine overs - that Australia were docked two overs from their reply.</p> <p>So David beat Goliath. It was excellent news for the tournament, which was in danger of being a damp squib. A competition with ICC in its name was bound to cock a few things up and the most glaring error has been the price of the tickets - ranging from three days' wages for the average Kenyan up to about five weeks' worth. The indigenous population can't afford that, but it seems that the Indian community can. The Gymkhana will be reasonably full for at least one more match, when India take on England or South Africa in Friday's second semi-final.</p> <p>Whether the result was good for England is arguable. It means that their path to the final is no longer blocked by the world's best two teams. But it gives South Africa an even greater incentive to win tomorrow, as their bogey team has been conveniently removed for them. And the nature of India's victory means that even if England beat South Africa, they will still have to face formidable opponents in the semi-final. They still have to climb twin peaks: it's just that one of the peaks is not the one they were expecting.</p> <p>India have two wins under their belt already, they are expert exponents of one-day cricket on flat tracks, and after a spell of depression, they are suddenly on the up. Players accused of match-fixing have been jettisoned and their replacements have made an instant impact. The seam attack has been strengthened by the arrival of Zaheer Khan, who has impressed people with his pace and accuracy. And the world's best one-day top order just got even better, with Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid now backed up not just by Singh but by Vinod Kambli, a man who, when he fills in his hotel breakfast order form, ticks the box marked ENGLISH BOWLING.</p> <p>India v England would be a mouthwatering contest. But first England have to overcome the odds and see off South Africa. Duncan Fletcher said at the weekend that it would help that England have already sampled the conditions - the high altitude and the unexpectedly pacy Gymkhana pitch. He may not be aware that South Africa were here a year ago, for a quadrangular tournament called the LG Safari Cup. It was between Kenya, Zimbabwe, India and South Africa. You can guess who won. You can also guess which explosive left-hander hit a hundred for them at a run a ball.</p> <p>Altitude will hardly be a problem for the South Africans. The tennis-ball bounce might be. Allan Donald is a great bowler in both forms of the game but he can be expensive when the ball doesn't swing for him. If McGrath, Gillespie and Brett Lee can take a pounding, so can Donald, Pollock and Nantie Hayward. But the same applies, twice over, to whoever is asked to fill the size-12 boots of Alan Mullally. Against Bangladesh it was Mark Alleyne, whose military medium was cannon fodder, conceding 26 in three overs. Against South Africa it is more likely to be a Yorkshireman. This could be Paul Grayson, the Essex slow left-armer plucked from his winter job in a brewery in the wackiest England selection since Vince Wells made the World Cup squad. Or it could be Matthew Hoggard, a proper bowler, who takes wickets but also takes poundings - in his only England appearance so far, in the Lord's Test, he took one from Franklyn Rose. You wouldn't back either of them against Lance Klusener. But if India can beat Australia, anything can happen.</p> <p><em>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com.

The government has suffered a serious loss of face ever since the four big UK tobacco companies (Gallaher, Imperial, BAT and Rothmans) challenged the EU directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship in 1998. In June this year a Commons committee revealed that ad agencies had consistently tried to get round government attempts to ban tobacco advertising. Its report claimed the ad industry had used its \"creative talents to undermine government policy and evade regulation\". Evidence was submitted by four ad agencies - Mustoe Merriman Herring Levy, which handles Imperial; M&amp;C Saatchi, which has Silk Cut; CDP, which works with Gallaher; and TBWA, which has Marlboro. The findings were that voluntary agreements - which stipulate that tobacco companies must not, for example, advertise in magazines that have a young readership, nor within 200 metres of schools, nor in shop windows, and that all ads must be sanctioned by the ASA prior to release - had served the public badly. The committee's report concluded that regulations were seen by ad agencies as hurdles to be side-stepped and legislation banning advertising as a challenge - a policy to be undermined by whatever means possible.

But he says the industry will fight for its right to retain direct communication with its customers. He also points out that the Human Rights Act, which came into operation this month, may make it difficult for the government to ban the flow of literature between tobacco companies and smokers who ask for it. After so many false starts for the ban, there is currently little agreement between tobacco companies on how to react to Cooper's determination to impose a UK ban. As the December deadline loomed last year, M&amp;C Saatchi designed and created hundreds of large inflatable women, wearing split silk dresses and holding signs that read \"it's not over till the fat lady sings\".

But the younger generation, led by Riccardo Chailly and Simon Rattle, have been its consistent champions. </p> <p>Chailly recorded the work while head of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra, and now he has introduced it to the Royal Concertgebouw.

He times the first movement's climax in a screaming nine-note dissonance perfectly, gives the incessant central movement a terrifying inevitability, and unfolds the final pages of the symphony with ethereal tenderness. But he is not afraid to let the rough edges show, too, or to give the Concertgebouw's fabulous wind players licence to shape their solos. </p> <p>Such a towering performance could have been savoured on its own, but there was also Mahler to begin the programme: the five Ruckert songs delivered with effortlessly-judged variation of colour and phrasing by the baritone Matthias Goerne.

      "body": "<p>The multicultural Drum arts centre in Birmingham's Aston district is the perfect venue for Courtney Pine and his mission to bring Brit-jazz out of the shadows and closer to the mainstream. After a blast of Pine's polyglot polyrhythms, audiences can find themselves speaking in new tongues. </p> <p>The atmosphere inside is feverish and intense. People are standing on chairs, screaming and punching the air. Some are wiggling their hips as if at the Reggae Sunsplash in Jamaica. As Pine stands at the microphone and claps his hands above his head, the floor starts to bounce up and down like the Forth Bridge in an earthquake. A rock star would be delighted with the reaction, though he'd be surprised to find his audience was 95% black. </p> <p>And I thought this was supposed to be jazz, where the cognoscenti pay homage to the artists' daunting mastery of advanced harmonic theory and chord substitutions. Not that Pine can't play a harmolodic scale with the best of them, but he's been fighting this particular war ever since he was a teenager. For some, \"jazz\" will always mean Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Charlie Mingus, but that was 40 years ago. Pine has already absorbed the post-war greats of American jazz. Now, he's squaring up to the tougher task of forging a modern - and authentically British - musical idiom. </p> <p>I'm not convinced by the directions Pine pursues on his new CD, Back in the Day: I don't follow how respectful Joan Armatrading cover versions or extracts from Curtis Mayfield's soul catalogue square with Courtney's aim of developing a language that will reach a younger audience. But Pine seems to find all the justification he needs when he gets in front of a live audience and starts blowing the house apart. His band, dressed in a carnival of patterns and colours, erupts with thunderous expertise and joie de vivre. Cross-rhythms dart and surge. </p> <p>Pine himself is a walking encyclopedia of advanced saxophony, ripping out fiery Coltrane-esque note clusters and plumbing the tenor's bass register like a musical Jacques Cousteau. At the climax of the set Pine stood, arms outstretched, sustaining an absurdly long note through a feat of circular breathing. For a finale, he played an unaccompanied rendition of Bob Marley's Redemption Song, the audience quickly picking up the chorus. Then, with a symbolic flourish, he whipped off his beret and shook out the braided locks beneath. He may be pure musician, but there's an increasingly confident showman in there, too. </p> <p> Courtney Pine plays the Fleece and Firkin, Bristol (0117-945 0996), on Thursday, then tours.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The multicultural Drum arts centre in Birmingham's Aston district is the perfect venue for Courtney Pine and his mission to bring Brit-jazz out of the shadows and closer to the mainstream. After a blast of Pine's polyglot polyrhythms, audiences can find themselves speaking in new tongues. The atmosphere inside is feverish and intense. People are standing on chairs, screaming and punching the air. Some are wiggling their hips as if at the Reggae Sunsplash in Jamaica. As Pine stands at the microphone and claps his hands above his head, the floor starts to bounce up and down like the Forth Bridge in an earthquake. A rock star would be delighted with the reaction, though he'd be surprised to find his audience was 95% black. And I thought this was supposed to be jazz, where the cognoscenti pay homage to the artists' daunting mastery of advanced harmonic theory and chord substitutions. Not that Pine can't play a harmolodic scale with the best of them, but he's been fighting this particular war ever since he was a teenager. For some, \"jazz\" will always mean Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Charlie Mingus, but that was 40 years ago. Pine has already absorbed the post-war greats of American jazz. Now, he's squaring up to the tougher task of forging a modern - and authentically British - musical idiom. I'm not convinced by the directions Pine pursues on his new CD, Back in the Day: I don't follow how respectful Joan Armatrading cover versions or extracts from Curtis Mayfield's soul catalogue square with Courtney's aim of developing a language that will reach a younger audience. But Pine seems to find all the justification he needs when he gets in front of a live audience and starts blowing the house apart. His band, dressed in a carnival of patterns and colours, erupts with thunderous expertise and joie de vivre. Cross-rhythms dart and surge. Pine himself is a walking encyclopedia of advanced saxophony, ripping out fiery Coltrane-esque note clusters and plumbing the tenor's bass register like a musical Jacques Cousteau. At the climax of the set Pine stood, arms outstretched, sustaining an absurdly long note through a feat of circular breathing. For a finale, he played an unaccompanied rendition of Bob Marley's Redemption Song, the audience quickly picking up the chorus. Then, with a symbolic flourish, he whipped off his beret and shook out the braided locks beneath. He may be pure musician, but there's an increasingly confident showman in there, too. Courtney Pine plays the Fleece and Firkin, Bristol (0117-945 0996), on Thursday, then tours.",

The South Bank's three-week series Ikons of Light presents Tavener's work alongside his inspirations, from Byzantine choirs to Stravinsky: it gives a rare opportunity to assess Tavener's music on its own terms. </p> <p>In the first week, Tavener's Agraphon, written in 1995, was striking. A setting of the poetry of Angelos Sikelianos, the piece was performed on Wednesday by Patricia Rozario (one of Tavener's champions), with Richard Hickox and the City of London Sinfonia. The text, based on folk tales of Christ's life, is earthily descriptive. Christ admonishes the disciples for ignoring a dead dog; Jesus sees the rotting corpse as a route to the divine. Founded on Tavener's technique of repeating large paragraphs of material, the varied setting encompasses apocalyptic peals of timpani for \"the harsh lightning of God's justice\", while the soprano's concentration represents Jesus's rapt contemplation. </p> <p>The work's rigorous focus on melodic fragments betrays Tavener's love of Stravinsky. The London Sinfonietta's Saturday concert presented Stravinsky's 1956 Canticum Sacrum, the work that made Tavener decide to become a composer, alongside Tavener's The Protecting Veil, his most popular work. </p> <p>On the surface, the contrasts between the two composers are obvious: Stravinsky's complexity seems rooted in a different conception of music from Tavener's slow-breathed melodiousness. Yet the performances, from cellist Raphael Wallfisch in The Protecting Veil, and conductor David Atherton, revealed the connections between these musical icons. Atherton turned the austere Canticum Sacrum into a kaleidoscope of structure and spirituality. The same humanising zeal was at the heart of The Protecting Veil, as Wallfisch's impassioned playing caught a large-scale drama behind the surface of Tavener's static architecture. </p> <p>The most telling demonstration of the human engagement of Tavener's music came in the London Sinfonietta's concerts in Her Majesty's Prison, Pentonville, London. A choir of inmates gave the world premiere of Tavener's In One Single Moment. Their gritty performances movingly articulated the solidity of Tavener's seemingly simple idiom. </p> <p>Often when Tavener attempts to integrate worldly concerns into his musical universe, characters are reduced to ciphers. His casting of the saxophone as the evil agent of temptation seems naive, as does his use of the kaval, a primitive woodwind instrument, as a metaphor for preternatural goodness.

They had gone into this game full of confidence after their draw in France and that epoch-ending victory in Belgium, but a combination of a heavy pitch and a return to normal standards of Teutonic efficiency sucked out all their energy and creativity. </p> <p>It was easy to imagine, after a performance as grey and soggy as the shocking weather, that it might be another 34 years before England can beat this lot. </p> <p>Especially as England spent 77 minutes chasing the game. Germany would have been well content with a draw from this fixture, but as England allowed them to take the lead from a shambolic set- piece as early as the 13th minute, the pattern of the afternoon was set. Germany have only ever lost one World Cup qualifying game, and they did not earn a record like that by refusing gifts or failing to protect a lead. </p> <p>It was obvious from the opening 10 minutes that Germany under Rudi Voller were going to be a different proposition from the spiritless bunch who looked so bereft of inspiration in Charleroi. Within that space of time, the dangerous Mehmet Scholl had already demonstrated skill and steel, as well as intelligently drifting out to the right to make it more difficult for Gareth Southgate to mark him. </p> <p>England attempted a high- tempo opening, with David Beckham coming in from the right to add authority to the midfield, though their movement was predictable. Tellingly, Andy Cole was caught offside twice in the opening exchanges, on the first occasion demanding and receiving a pass from Beckham when the linesman's flag was bound to be raised. </p> <p>Germany are supposed to be the predictable party in this long rivalry, but they effectively laid that jibe to rest moments later, taking the lead with as smart a goal as Wembley has seen in all its 77 years. There appeared no immediate danger when Paul Scholes gave away a free-kick against Michael Ballack 25 yards out, which presumably explains why England thought they had all day to organise a wall. David Seaman was too busy barking out orders to Tony Adams and company to notice Dietmar Hamann shaping to take the kick quickly - though the goalkeeper managed to compose himself right at the last moment - and the Liverpool midfielder's shot was as sharp as his reactions. </p> <p>Seaman has recently been talking about setting himself a target of the World Cup finals in 2002, but being beaten low to his left by a shot from well outside the area hardly bodes well for a 37-year-old, even assuming England get to Japan and Korea. </p> <p>Just to prove Germans have a sense of humour, the travelling supporters spent the rest of the first half accusing the English of only singing when they are winning. The rather witless response from the home fans was 'Stand up if you won the war', which suggests English terrace humour is not what it was. Then again, neither is the football. </p> <p>A ripple of excitement passed through the crowd when Beckham shaped to take a free-kick from a similar range to Hamann's, though the comparison was not flat tering. Beckham took an age, then when the shot finally came it flew straight into Oliver Kahn's midriff. </p> <p>Marco Bode then went close with yet another free- kick after Adams had fouled Scholl, before Cole received a yellow card for a tackle from behind on the same player. </p> <p>Cole did bring a couple of saves from Kahn just after the half-hour but England's best chance of the first half came just before the interval, when Adams found space to meet a Beckham free-kick with a glancing header, but Kahn responded with his best save, diving low to his right to hold the ball. </p> <p>England brought on Kieron Dyer for Gary Neville at half-time, calling time on Southgate's midfield career by switching to a back three, with the substitute operating as right wing-back. It looked like a gamble, but at least Dyer looked the part, injecting pace and enthusiasm into a flagging English attack and almost immediately producing a cross from the right which Jens Nowotny had to scramble clear from Cole. </p> <p>The downside was space behind Dyer for the Germans to attack, an invitation accepted by the irrepressible Scholl after 52 minutes, when he skipped almost unchallenged on the left and into England's penalty area. An extravagant check took him past Martin Keown but Scholl scuffed his shot and Seaman was able to redeem himself with a save low to his left. </p> <p>Far from sitting on their lead Germany were actively looking for another goal, alert enough to realise that England's desperation was forcing them to take risks in defence. England kept going forward doggedly, though Paul Scholes was not enjoying one of his better days and there was depressingly little for Cole or Michael Owen to work with. Beckham pro duced a fingertip save from Kahn on the hour with a fiercely dipping shot from 25 yards, but it was significant that England had been reduced to hopeful efforts from outside the penalty area. </p> <p>Beckham was narrowly wide with another long shot four minutes before making way for Ray Parlour in the 82nd minute. Scholes and Dyer came into the game more in its closing stages, but Germany should have had a second when Nowotny and Bierhoff got in each other's way seven minutes from time. A few boos could be heard at the end. It was a sad way to leave Wembley, but at least it didn't go to penalties. </p> <p> <strong> England:</strong> Seaman, G.Neville (Dyer 46), Adams, Keown, Le Saux (Barry 77), Beckham (Parlour 82), Southgate, Scholes, Barmby, Cole, Owen. <strong> Subs not used</strong> : Martyn, Heskey, Wise, Phillips. </p> <p><strong> Germany:</strong> Kahn, Rehmer, Nowotny, Linke, Deisler, Ramelow, Hamann, Bode (Ziege 86), Ballack, Scholl, Bierhoff. <strong> Subs not used:</strong> Lehmann, Rink, Beinlich, Wosz, Baumann, Neuville. </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : Stefano Braschi (Italy).</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was the last refuge of the inadequate. Half-time neared, England were a goal down and a sizeable section of the crowd sullied the ever-dampening occasion. 'Stand up if you won the War,' they sang. </p> <p>When will English football stop harking back to old glories, rather than acknowledging them honourably and moving on? Not until it has a team to drag its game into the modern era, it seems. And that is unlikely to happen until it gets a coach able to do justice to a talented group of players ill-served by its leaders. That coach is not Kevin Keegan, who thankfully has gone. </p> <p>Even if England achieve victory in Finland on Wednesday night must not disguise the shortcomings of a coach and transmitted to his team. Hang the cost, the FA should accept that Keegan, a decent man out of his depth and feeling forced to be untrue to himself last week by lying to the media, that the unequal struggle was over for him before this match. </p> <p>The lesson of Terry Venables's era as coach was that in modern international football it is vital not to lose the numbers game in midfield, that to fail to match the opposition there was to be outmanoeuvred. In Glenn Hoddle's time, it was evident that movement up front by thoughtful, lively attackers was crucial. The bridge between the two was Teddy Sheringham, a player who caused midfield opponents to drop deeper, defenders to worry whether to stay or step forward. </p> <p>Keegan seemed to have absorbed little of the evidence and trends of the past five years. In fact, he seems to have absorbed little of the evidence of his own period in charge. His method, such as can be discerned, appeared to be that he took advice from all around him - senior players, coaching staff - then did exactly what he was planning to do all along anyway, ignoring precedent, mixing and matching selections. It was knee-jerk management. </p> <p>Yesterday, for example, the starting selection featured five defenders and five attackers and the team duly had a them-and-us feel about it, always likely to be stretched as Newcastle United used to be on their bad days. They turned Keegan's hair grey. England has given him bags under the eyes. Sleepless in Slough. </p> <p>Among the plethora of pointers from Charleroi in the summer was that a willing but bemused Gareth Southgate is ill-suited these days to a holding role in midfield and that David Seaman's time had probably gone in the English goal. The promise of Paris was seen in a formation that had a lone striker backed by a floating figure, in the shape of Paul Scholes, who could balance the equation in midfield and disrupt a defensive formation. </p> <p>It had the bonus of bringing David Beckham's talents into positions of more frequent influence and even of pleasing the players, who believed they were at last operating in a system that showcased their talents. So what Keegan's response? Play two up front, Southgate in midfield and push Beckham wide on the right. </p> <p>You could just about see what Keegan was attempting. Just about. Southgate was to drop in between Martin Keown and Tony Adams when England were defending. The full-backs Gary Neville and Graeme Le Saux were to push forward, taking Germany's wing-backs with them, enabling Beckham and Nicky Barmby to tuck inside rather than be marooned on the flanks. Scholes was to dart between Andy Cole and Michael Owen. </p> <p>The reality was, however, that it was a selection neither fish nor fowl. Freed of some imagined obligation to pick Alan Shearer, England should have been able to field a more mobile, flexible attacking force but it was back to the two up with Keegan unable to be brave and keep either Cole or Owen on the bench, preferably Cole.

      "bodyText": "It was the last refuge of the inadequate. Half-time neared, England were a goal down and a sizeable section of the crowd sullied the ever-dampening occasion. 'Stand up if you won the War,' they sang. When will English football stop harking back to old glories, rather than acknowledging them honourably and moving on? Not until it has a team to drag its game into the modern era, it seems. And that is unlikely to happen until it gets a coach able to do justice to a talented group of players ill-served by its leaders. That coach is not Kevin Keegan, who thankfully has gone. Even if England achieve victory in Finland on Wednesday night must not disguise the shortcomings of a coach and transmitted to his team. Hang the cost, the FA should accept that Keegan, a decent man out of his depth and feeling forced to be untrue to himself last week by lying to the media, that the unequal struggle was over for him before this match. The lesson of Terry Venables's era as coach was that in modern international football it is vital not to lose the numbers game in midfield, that to fail to match the opposition there was to be outmanoeuvred. In Glenn Hoddle's time, it was evident that movement up front by thoughtful, lively attackers was crucial. The bridge between the two was Teddy Sheringham, a player who caused midfield opponents to drop deeper, defenders to worry whether to stay or step forward. Keegan seemed to have absorbed little of the evidence and trends of the past five years. In fact, he seems to have absorbed little of the evidence of his own period in charge. His method, such as can be discerned, appeared to be that he took advice from all around him - senior players, coaching staff - then did exactly what he was planning to do all along anyway, ignoring precedent, mixing and matching selections. It was knee-jerk management. Yesterday, for example, the starting selection featured five defenders and five attackers and the team duly had a them-and-us feel about it, always likely to be stretched as Newcastle United used to be on their bad days. They turned Keegan's hair grey. England has given him bags under the eyes. Sleepless in Slough. Among the plethora of pointers from Charleroi in the summer was that a willing but bemused Gareth Southgate is ill-suited these days to a holding role in midfield and that David Seaman's time had probably gone in the English goal. The promise of Paris was seen in a formation that had a lone striker backed by a floating figure, in the shape of Paul Scholes, who could balance the equation in midfield and disrupt a defensive formation. It had the bonus of bringing David Beckham's talents into positions of more frequent influence and even of pleasing the players, who believed they were at last operating in a system that showcased their talents. So what Keegan's response? Play two up front, Southgate in midfield and push Beckham wide on the right. You could just about see what Keegan was attempting. Just about. Southgate was to drop in between Martin Keown and Tony Adams when England were defending. The full-backs Gary Neville and Graeme Le Saux were to push forward, taking Germany's wing-backs with them, enabling Beckham and Nicky Barmby to tuck inside rather than be marooned on the flanks. Scholes was to dart between Andy Cole and Michael Owen. The reality was, however, that it was a selection neither fish nor fowl. Freed of some imagined obligation to pick Alan Shearer, England should have been able to field a more mobile, flexible attacking force but it was back to the two up with Keegan unable to be brave and keep either Cole or Owen on the bench, preferably Cole. It is all very well plonking the two best strikers in the country together but if they not seeing a ball which is 65 per cent the opposition's possession, goal chances are bound to be few and far between. As early as the ninth minute, Adams was charging forward to berate his strikers for their lack of movement - England were becoming as predictable as the Germans were in Charleroi. Keegan duly changed things for the second half and you can bet that Adams had much to do with it. Southgate was withdrawn into the back three that suits his game-reading abilities better and Kieron Dyer replaced Neville to play wide on the right, freeing Beckham for more creative work. But on a day of so many memories, this was of Poland in 1973. Much huffing and puffing failed to yield and equaliser. Not long after, Sir Alf Ramsey was gone.

The decision is a devastating blow to England's hopes of qualifying for the World Cup. It has plunged the national team into chaos just four days before the crucial match against Finland in Helsinki. Keegan, who was appointed just 20 months ago, told shocked players and FA officials of his decision in the dressing room minutes after the defeat by England's deadly rivals. Rejecting appeals from the FA chief Adam Crozier to remain in his post, Keegan was last night replaced by technical director Howard Wilkinson, who will be in charge for Wednesday's match as acting manager. In an emotional outburst live on television, Keegan confessed that he lacked the qualities to continue in international management, adding that the angry reaction of England fans at the final whistle confirmed his decision. Fighting back tears, Keegan said: 'I just don't feel I can find that little bit extra that you need at this level to find a winning formula. I couldn't have asked for more effort from the players.

      "body": "<p>The rugged dry hills of northern Pakistan are almost 4,000 miles from the rolling dales of northern England. But if you stand at the corner of some streets in Bradford or Derby or Huddersfield they feel a lot closer. Old men, their beards dyed orange with henna, rest in the evening sunlight on their way to the mosque. Boys, in white round prayer caps and the traditional baggy trousers worn in Karachi or Peshawar, play cricket with a makeshift bat. Women pull their headscarves tight up to their eyes when a stranger walks past.</p> <p>Rukhsana Naz grew up in streets like these. A bright, educated woman, she had been married at 16 to an older man. At 19, she was pregnant by her childhood sweetheart. Her mother told her the child was 'an insult to [her] husband'.</p> <p>When she refused an abortion and demanded a divorce, Rukhsana was invited to a family dinner where her brother, Shazad, strangled her with a skipping rope. Her mother, Shakeela, helped hold her down. Her actions had 'shamed' the family, the court was told.</p> <p>Rukhsana Naz's killers were jailed last year. In June 1995 another Pakistani girl was run down and crushed to death by her brother-in-law for a similar offence in Bradford. Tasleem Begum was 20 and had been married for four years to an older Pakistani man. She too fell in love. She too transgressed traditional codes of behaviour and brought shame on her family.</p> <p>Such killings are not rare in South Asia and the Middle East. There are 5,000 of these 'honour killings' every year across the world, according to a recent UN report 'Living Together, Worlds Apart: Men and Women in a Time of Change'. They occur both in the rural areas, where age-old traditions, value codes and modes of justice still hold sway, and in the cities, where newer tensions have sparked increasing violence towards women.

      "bodyText": "The rugged dry hills of northern Pakistan are almost 4,000 miles from the rolling dales of northern England. But if you stand at the corner of some streets in Bradford or Derby or Huddersfield they feel a lot closer. Old men, their beards dyed orange with henna, rest in the evening sunlight on their way to the mosque. Boys, in white round prayer caps and the traditional baggy trousers worn in Karachi or Peshawar, play cricket with a makeshift bat. Women pull their headscarves tight up to their eyes when a stranger walks past. Rukhsana Naz grew up in streets like these. A bright, educated woman, she had been married at 16 to an older man. At 19, she was pregnant by her childhood sweetheart. Her mother told her the child was 'an insult to [her] husband'. When she refused an abortion and demanded a divorce, Rukhsana was invited to a family dinner where her brother, Shazad, strangled her with a skipping rope. Her mother, Shakeela, helped hold her down. Her actions had 'shamed' the family, the court was told. Rukhsana Naz's killers were jailed last year. In June 1995 another Pakistani girl was run down and crushed to death by her brother-in-law for a similar offence in Bradford. Tasleem Begum was 20 and had been married for four years to an older Pakistani man. She too fell in love. She too transgressed traditional codes of behaviour and brought shame on her family. Such killings are not rare in South Asia and the Middle East. There are 5,000 of these 'honour killings' every year across the world, according to a recent UN report 'Living Together, Worlds Apart: Men and Women in a Time of Change'. They occur both in the rural areas, where age-old traditions, value codes and modes of justice still hold sway, and in the cities, where newer tensions have sparked increasing violence towards women. Supporters say the killings maintain social order in changing times; critics allege that chauvinistic men use the 'family honour' as a pretext for punishing women who want more freedom. In the United Kingdom honour killings are also happening. The Observer has found that the deaths of Tasleem Begum and Rukhsana Naz fit into a broader pattern of violence against women within the South Asian community. Since Tasleem Begum died, nearly five years ago, there have been at least 20 other deaths in Britain that can be connected with ideas of 'honour', as well as hundreds of acts of lesser violence. Campaigners claim the honour code - and its accompanying concept of shame - is a key factor in the repression of the rights of tens of thousands of Asian women in Britain. Recent cases involving 'honour' in the UK include: \u0095 A Wakefield man axed to death by family members for continuing an affair with a younger female relative.

      "bodyText": "King George V, the obsessively correct monarch who died after uttering the famous profanity 'Bugger Bognor', interfered so much in the military operations of the First World War that the Prime Minister threatened to resign, according to new research. The monarch not only considered turning out the politicians and installing a military government in their place, but repeatedly blocked political appointments and installed officers loyal to his camp instead. The revelation that the king wielded such power will shock many experts because of the monarch's determination to conceal the true extent of his involvement. Documents describing the king's interference were uncovered by Professor Ian Beckett, one of Britain's leading military experts, during rare access to archives at Windsor Castle. Beckett discovered that, although the monarch ensured that he appeared to be on the periphery of the war effort, he was so determined to control the armed forces that David Lloyd George accused him of attempting to form a military dictatorship. Beckett, whose essay will appear in Leadership in Conflict, to be published next month, found that the king's interference reached such a height that the Prime Minister accused him of inciting an armed forces' mutiny. The climax was when Lloyd George threatened to provoke the Government's resignation, forcing the king into a more hands-off app-roach. 'He [the king] was a blunt and powerful man who believed firmly in his right to govern and was not afraid to express his displeasure,' said Beckett. amelia.hill@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Nice one, boss. The enduring mystery of why we laugh has been solved: we giggle, snigger and chortle to ingratiate ourselves with our superiors. According to new research, laughter is an 'acoustic response to a situation' - the equivalent in humans of birdsong - which is all to do with social signals and very little to do with humour. Even a baby will laugh into its parents' delighted faces because it is pre-programmed to please its providers. A team from the University of Maryland in Baltimore, led by neurobiology and psychology professor Robert Provine, have collected 1,200 'laugh episodes' by eavesdropping on people in public places around the world. The results show that people in power rarely snigger, although everyone will laugh more with dominant individuals, whether tribal elders or employers, than with equals. In short, when the boss laughs, everyone laughs. The pattern holds true around the world. In India, men of lower castes giggle when addressing men of higher castes, but never the other way round. 'They are controlling the emotional climate of the group,' said Provine, whose book, Laughter: A Scientific Investigation, is published in the US next week. Provine goes as far as to say that giggling may be a feminist issue: women are far more likely to laugh at men - and ingratiate themselves with the opposite sex - than men at women. Listeners, especially women, laugh more often when the speaker is male. Earlier studies have shown that people are 30 times more likely to laugh in social settings than when they are on their own. Even nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, loses its effect if someone takes it when they are alone, according to experiments done by German psychologist Willibald Ruch at the University of D\u00fcsseldorf. 'Laughter is only rarely a response to jokes,' Provine said. 'It is the quintessential human social signal. It solidifies relationships and pulls people into the fold.' The oft-heard clich\u00e9 of the 'evil laugh' is true. The two teenage Columbine High school killers who laughed as they killed classmates were showing solidarity with each other and a dismissiveness towards their terrified targets, said Provine. 'Laughter is a probe into such fundamental questions as why humans can speak but other apes can't,' he said. A laugh is usually one short exhalation of breath chopped into staccato segments lasting a fifteenth of a second each and spaced one-fifth of a second apart. Laughter is also contagious: in 1962 an epidemic of laughter among African schoolgirls in Tanganyika lasted for six months and forced officials to close down the schools. But while you can catch it from others, you cannot induce it in yourself. Even tickling yourself is a non-starter. Now experiments by Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, of University College London, may have finally revealed why that is. The neuroscientist used brain scans to look at the responses of volunteers who either tickled themselves or were tickled by a robotic tickler. She found that when you move your hand to tickle yourself, your brain predicts your moves and blocks the sensory response. If someone else tickles you, it is a surprise and the brain cannot control the touch. Laughing so hard that you have to hold on to something becomes 'a signal of trust in one's companions, a ritual disarming in effect,' said Provine. Provine says laughter, like most human behaviour, has evolved through communication. In an embarrassing or threatening situation, laughing may deflect anger. If an aggressor joins in, the risk of confrontation may become less.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Beth Winslet:</strong> We grew up in a small terraced house on a main road in Reading. It wasn't a wealthy upbringing, but we were really happy. Dad was always entertaining. He'd take me, Mum, my elder sisters Anna and Kate, and my younger brother Josh on holidays to the seaside. One of my earliest memories is being at the beach on the Isle of Wight and Dad doing a moonie. And just as he did it a lady walked past with a baby in a buggy. And we all rolled around laughing.</p> <p>At home there was always lots of singing and putting on plays. We'd tap dance in the kitchen and get told off and have to scrub the floor. And we went to see Dad's plays. He was like the majority of actors: often out of work or doing tiny bit parts like Snug the Joiner, or a baker who was shut in his own oven. Kate is an extreme example of success, and being her sister hasn't made me think it's any more achievable. People say: 'Well, if your sister's doing it, so can you.' But she's a rare talent and most people aren't that fortunate.</p> <p>I joined an amateur dramatics group when I was 10 and did lots of plays. At school, I had the mickey taken out of me because I had big Mick Jagger lips and the hugest mouth. After leaving school at 17, I joined the National Youth Theatre, got an agent and did a BBC drama, The Scold's Bride. The following year I made the film Bodywork (opens nationwide on 20 October) and met Gareth [Rhys Jones] who wrote and directed it. We're expecting a baby next month. I've always been family oriented and I'd found Gareth, so it seemed like the right time to start a family.</p> <p>Dad has sat back and let each of us make our own way, go down our own paths and make our own mistakes. But he's been there when we've needed him. I went through a bout of illness when I was 17 and Dad was the one who took me seriously. Mum told me to take a paracetemol and lie down. I ended up in hospital needing an operation.</p> <p>To call the Winslets an 'acting dynasty' is ridiculous. Although, I guess it does run in the family: Dad's aunts were in a vaudeville troupe, my uncle was an actor, and my grandparents founded a theatre company. Maybe if acting hadn't been around me I might have done something different. But I am pursuing other things in between acting: I've been working at a Rudolph Steiner school, which I love, and I'm about to start assisting a silversmith. And after years of hanging in there with acting, Dad is now gigging as a singer with his own songs.</p> <p><strong>Roger Winslet:</strong> I was kind of surprised that Beth and her sisters have all pursued acting. At the end of the day they have done what they wanted to do. I don't think there is any rivalry between them. That would smack of competition. They all accept their natural gifts as individuals. Kate's success hasn't been a strain or a problem. You try to take things in your stride and not let the family unit change.</p> <p>I always felt that I could be an actor, but didn't get any breaks in the professional world. It's a bit of a sad way of life if you aren't getting the work to sustain you. It is a great life when you do get a job, experiencing the camaraderie of working with other actors. But I always had long periods between acting jobs, and these downtimes have been particularly difficult periods in my life. All my children have been sympathetic in a constructive way. </p> <p>In between I'd do casual unskilled jobs, such as construction work. I do see elements of myself in Beth. She's stubborn, like I can be. We think similarly. I think she conceals her feelings sometimes, whereas I'm probably a bit more open and volatile. They all have a tremendous sense of fun, and relish the chance to come up with a dry comment every now and then. None of them wanted to be great scholars, they've educated themselves.</p> <p>It was during a fairly traumatic time in my life when I felt what it was to have a strong family around me. I was in a boat accident and needed reconstructive surgery on my foot. Two years later, when I was finally out of plaster and moving about - although still with great difficulty - I went back on the boat for a three-week trip. I had to go back to stop dreaming about it. Now, when I look back, I realise the accident could have been a lot worse. I could've lost my leg.</p> <p>I didn't get married until I was 28, then didn't start having children for another four years. I think it's wonderful that Beth and Kate are pregnant. We are as close as most families and try to get together on Sundays, if possible, and at Easter, Christmas and on birthdays.</p> <p>I don't think I'm a very wise person. I'm pretty dumb at times. I wanted the girls to be as honest as they can to other people and themselves. And to be aware of what a tough business the acting game is. Success doesn't come easy.

      "body": "<p>There is no going back if you're driving the Tour de France route. The world's greatest bike race travels along the world's longest one-way street: 2,500 miles of closed roads around France lined with impassive gendarmes and screaming cycling fans, an interminable sens unique which always ends on the Champs Elys\u00e9es. </p> <p>As a spectacle, the Tour is as much a 2,000-strong parade of motor vehicles as a bike race. The 180 cyclists are hidden somewhere among the floats bunging out freebie publicity material, the imposing blue BMW motorbikes of the Garde Republicaine, garish vehicles carrying corporate guests, and cars bearing spare bikes and wheels. Unless they are strung out over an Alpine pass, the skeletally thin cyclists with their farmers' tans take only a couple of minutes to pass. The cars keep coming for hours and hours, and simply heighten the crowds' sense of anticipation. </p> <p>Apart from les coureurs, they have come to see the 'publicity caravan' (the 'junk train' to aficionados) - 250 vehicles advertising everything from insurance to mail-order clothing, including trick motorcyclists, go-karts with oversize gas cylinders on top, cabriolets from which hotpant-clad go-go dancers dance at impossible angles, and 8ft-high coffee machines on vans. </p> <p>To be strictly accurate, the crowds have not come to see, but to scrabble for the free samples - canvas washing bags, sachets of coffee, bags of sweets. It is a child's dream and a parent's nightmare. On Bastille Day this year, a 12-year-old boy was killed when a car containing public relations people from a race sponsor left the road. Given that an estimated 10 million roadside fans, some drunk and all hyper, watch the race each year, it is a wonder there are so few accidents. </p> <p>On the Tour, everything that can be done is done on the move. Cyclists receive medical attention hanging on to the race doctor's car at 30mph, and have their gears adjusted by mechanics hanging out of car windows. Corporate hospitality is a carefully choreographed waltz between cars driven by former Tour stars driving as close to the cyclists as safety permits, and plush mobile homes where uniformed hostesses serve caviar and champagne. </p> <p>The Tour's caravan takes over smaller venues such as Brian\u00e7on, a little fortress town in the Alps, which was gridlocked for a whole evening as the race vehicles merged with the cars and camper vans of thousands of cycling fans. That night, Britain's only cyclist in the race, the young David Millar, was outraged at spending two and a half hours sitting in the bouchon to go 15 miles to his hotel, and this after some eight-and-a-half hours in the saddle. </p> <p>As much attention goes into choreographing the four-wheeled show as into running the two-wheeled race.

      "bodyText": "There is no going back if you're driving the Tour de France route. The world's greatest bike race travels along the world's longest one-way street: 2,500 miles of closed roads around France lined with impassive gendarmes and screaming cycling fans, an interminable sens unique which always ends on the Champs Elys\u00e9es. As a spectacle, the Tour is as much a 2,000-strong parade of motor vehicles as a bike race. The 180 cyclists are hidden somewhere among the floats bunging out freebie publicity material, the imposing blue BMW motorbikes of the Garde Republicaine, garish vehicles carrying corporate guests, and cars bearing spare bikes and wheels. Unless they are strung out over an Alpine pass, the skeletally thin cyclists with their farmers' tans take only a couple of minutes to pass. The cars keep coming for hours and hours, and simply heighten the crowds' sense of anticipation. Apart from les coureurs, they have come to see the 'publicity caravan' (the 'junk train' to aficionados) - 250 vehicles advertising everything from insurance to mail-order clothing, including trick motorcyclists, go-karts with oversize gas cylinders on top, cabriolets from which hotpant-clad go-go dancers dance at impossible angles, and 8ft-high coffee machines on vans. To be strictly accurate, the crowds have not come to see, but to scrabble for the free samples - canvas washing bags, sachets of coffee, bags of sweets. It is a child's dream and a parent's nightmare. On Bastille Day this year, a 12-year-old boy was killed when a car containing public relations people from a race sponsor left the road. Given that an estimated 10 million roadside fans, some drunk and all hyper, watch the race each year, it is a wonder there are so few accidents. On the Tour, everything that can be done is done on the move. Cyclists receive medical attention hanging on to the race doctor's car at 30mph, and have their gears adjusted by mechanics hanging out of car windows. Corporate hospitality is a carefully choreographed waltz between cars driven by former Tour stars driving as close to the cyclists as safety permits, and plush mobile homes where uniformed hostesses serve caviar and champagne. The Tour's caravan takes over smaller venues such as Brian\u00e7on, a little fortress town in the Alps, which was gridlocked for a whole evening as the race vehicles merged with the cars and camper vans of thousands of cycling fans. That night, Britain's only cyclist in the race, the young David Millar, was outraged at spending two and a half hours sitting in the bouchon to go 15 miles to his hotel, and this after some eight-and-a-half hours in the saddle. As much attention goes into choreographing the four-wheeled show as into running the two-wheeled race. Parking is carefully planned, but always overflowing. Elaborate routes are devised for getting the Tour's cars through start and finish towns. Each 'family' - media, organisation, publicity caravan, teams - is segregated. Where the Tour starts and finishes is dictated as much by the need to find 2,000 car and lorry parking spaces as by aesthetic, sporting or commercial considerations.

      "body": "<p>Herbert Ypma has one of the most enviable of lives. He spends his days researching glossy, coffee table books about hotels and interiors. His Hip Hotels series has given him the perfect reason (as if any were needed) to travel to exotic and far-flung destinations and check into some of the world's most luxurious and stylish hotels. His books on interiors and architecture have taken him from Mexico to Morocco, where he photographs kasbahs, mud castles, hotels and markets, designed to inspire, and make his readers dream. In Sweden, he has explored the Ice Hotel which is allowed to melt each year and is then rebuilt; in Chile, he has sought out the remote Hotel Explora, perched high above a waterfall in the wilds of Patagonia.</p> <p>Needless to say, he's a hard man to track down. His publishers never know quite where he is, or where he might be going. He himself is not quite sure where he lives anymore. Hip Hotels France will be out next spring. Right now he's working on the next volume of Hip Hotels, an edition devoted to interesting and unusual places to stay for between \u00a320 and \u00a380. </p> <p>In between Hip Hotels, however, Ypma has been spending quite a lot of time in Paris, working on his new book, The Paris Interior, to be published in early November. The aim of the book, he says, was to define the very essence of the Parisian interior. There are mountains of books out there covering everything from Paris apartments, monuments, caf\u00e9s and restaurants to bridges and metro stations, but they all, he says, miss the point. His idea was to spell out the precise elements that add up to the typical Parisian interior. </p> <p>'Whether in an ad for perfume or a film by the likes of Polanski or Bertolucci,' he writes in the introduction, 'we recognise a Parisian setting before we are told - if indeed we are told at all. Why? Because there is a visual language at play that is unique to Paris.' It starts with the Louis XVI chair, and goes right through to the wooden panels of the boiserie, integral to most apartments in the city. </p> <p>'You cannot separate the history of Paris and its interiors,' he explains on the phone during a brief touchdown somewhere in France. 'There are definite things that you can pinpoint as Parisian style.' Element number one is undoubtedly the Louis XVI chair. 'It's an incredibly well-designed piece of furniture,' he says, a design classic that is simultaneously of its time and timeless, more popular now (in terms of numbers produced) than at the time of the Bourbons. Then, the nobility would muse over the design and detail of their specially commissioned chair for days on end. It was their status symbol, in the same way as a certain car or handbag might be today.</p> <p>'It was a period when furniture manufacturing was briefly elevated to the status of high art,' he writes. Each chair would have been painstakingly hand-made by specialist craftsmen. Louis XV's bureau du roi took a team of craftspeople seven years to finish, and every chair that was commissioned for his palace would have been given the same treatment. </p> <p>It is this understanding and love of the art and craft of furniture that has helped to define the Parisian style. In Britain, the Industrial Revolution was all about mass-production and cutting costs. In France, however, there was a culture of making large numbers of a product, but by hand - irrespective of the amount it would cost or the time it would take. There is an ingrained love of luxury, although today it is the style and shape of the furniture made for Louis XV and XVI that are imitated, rather than the quality of the craftsman-ship. 'It is almost impossible to conceive of a stylish Paris interior without its Louis XV or Louis XVI chairs: whether upholstered with tapestry or plain silk, they can be found in almost every grand hotel or chic apartment.' Oh, and if you are wondering, the way to i tell the difference between Louis XV and XVI is simple: just take a look at the legs. </p> <p>The earlier king favoured curved legs, while Louis XVI preferred his straight and tapered. </p> <p>Paris interiors did not end with the 18th century, however. According to Ypma, they are very much alive and well today. Alongside the elements of style guaranteed to make an appearance in the Parisian apartment, including the clock, ('They were such objects of desire,' he says. 'If you commissioned a clock, you would have it made in your style'), chinoiserie, wood panelling, parquet floors, and the odd touch of the rococo, is the objet trouv\u00e9. </p> <p>'I think history can be really intriguing and fascinating,' says Ypma. 'An apartment without something from the past lacks a story.' And the perfect place to find something with a story is the flea market. Paris has several, from Clignancourt to Porte de Montreuil, each throwing up a seemingly endless supply of antiques, junk, novelties and - a favourite of Ypma's - copper pots. Sunday mornings are the time to go out in search of that Louis chair, the little crystal chandelier, or the baroque candlestick. The more faded and distressed, the better. It's all about character and eclecticism; bringing the interiors and furniture of the past to life by mixing unusual pieces, and making something out of nothing. </p> <p>Although Ypma himself does not have a Paris apartment, he has had no shortage of rooms to inspire him. He visits the city about 20 times a year, and is, of course, no stranger to some of the best and most characterful hotels. There's the Montalambert on the Left Bank, which he says is 'pretty, small and elegantly designed'; L'Hotel, near the Ecole des Beaux Arts, where all the rooms are different and 'very funky, if a little run down'; or the Lancaster, which is more traditional and classical. Even if he doesn't know where he is going to be from one week to the next, one thing is for sure: wherever he is in Paris, he can feel secure that there will be a Louis XVI chair to rest his weary, well-travelled legs.</p>",

      "byline": "Jane Clarke",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I am certainly not perfect when it comes to eating properly. It's normally stress that throws my eating habits out of kilter, when, bar breakfast, the day can whizz by without much more than the odd piece of fruit passing my lips. So, believe me, when you're lurching from one crisis to the next, I understand only too well how hard it can be to take the time to eat nutritious food. I therefore thought that I'd devote this week's column to taking you through what's good to eat when your stress levels are running high.</p> <p>The most important thing to know is what to eat and drink at the end of the day to help you to wind down. It can mean the difference between collapsing into bed totally exhausted but unable to switch off, or secure in the knowledge that you have given your body what it needs to get a good night's sleep. The complex group of carbohydrates are your greatest ally in this respect. A bowl of pasta, risotto or polenta, a jacket potato or a helping of mashed potatoes, will all have a calming effect that will lull you into a deep, body-nurturing sleep.</p> <p>When deciding on a sauce, however, remember that the excessive amounts of fat in creamy, buttery or oily sauces are hard for a stressed, sensitive stomach to digest, especially if it has had very little food over the course of the day. If food isn't eaten, digestive juices aren't produced, and the liver slows down accordingly. If you then pick up a fatty food, like a kebab, burger or fish and chips, on the way home, it will sit heavily in your stomach, waiting until there are sufficient digestive juices to break it down.</p> <p>Because the body doesn't tolerate undigested fat well, it will try to get rid of it as quickly as possible, causing you to suffer from heartburn or even to rush to the loo.</p> <p>So opt for a tomato-based pasta sauce or a risotto made with stock. Avoid fried foods in favour of grilled or baked ones. Both adults and children often tolerate cooked vegetables better than raw salad ingredients, which can be hard for a stressed gut to digest in the evening.</p> <p>Tempting as it is to hit the bottle with a vengeance when you are under stress, remember that alcohol on top of anxiety aggravates the body's adrenaline response and disrupts sleeping patterns. And if drunk on an under-nourished as well as anxious stomach, alcohol can wreak absolute havoc, lowering your blood-sugar levels and making you feel ravenous, so that when you do eventually get round to eating, you tend to eat too much too quickly. Then, not only will your gut complain throughout the night, but you'll probably feel slightly hung over in the morning. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can also weaken the muscle lining holding the top and the bottom of the stomach taut, making you more prone to heartburn. Because the presence of food in the stomach cushions these negative effects, postpone the booze until after you've eaten. Get it right the night before, and you shouldn't have any regrets the morning after.</p> <p>While I'm on the subject of drink, caffeine exacerbates the symptoms of stress, too, including a racing heart, a nervous stomach, an aching head and unstable emotions, so try not to drink too much tea, coffee, drinking chocolate, green tea, cola and so-called 'energising' drinks, such as Red Bull. Ideally, you would make your body a caffeine-free zone and instead drink plenty of water. (If drinking plain water doesn't appeal, try making a herbal infusion, perhaps of lime flower, camomile or St John's wort.) Dissolving a few drops of essential oil, such as lavender, bergamot, neroli or juniper, in your bathwater can also have a calming effect.</p> <p>Drinking water throughout the day, as well as snacking on fruit (especially bananas, as they're good stress relievers), will help to keep your blood-sugar levels low and reduce any feelings of anxiety and stress. Eating too many sugary foods, on the other hand, will cause your blood-sugar levels to ricochet all over the place, thereby exacerbating mood swings and even triggering panic attacks. Steadying your blood-sugar levels is as important in the morning as it is during the rest of the day, and a bowl of honey-coated or sugary breakfast cereal, a Danish pastry or a sweet drink will send them surging upwards.</p> <p>By contrast, a higher-fibre cereal, a slice of wholegrain toast spread with pure-fruit jam or a bowl of porridge (oats are an excellent de-stresser) topped with sliced banana all contain sugar that is more slowly absorbed. If you can't face a hearty breakfast, try having a little fresh fruit or a glass of freshly squeezed juice (if your stomach reacts badly to orange or grape-fruit, experiment with a less acidic juice, like apple or cranberry). And if you don't have much for breakfast, take some plain biscuits or a flapjack to work to eat a little later. Although higher-fibre foods usually work best in the morning, some people's digestive systems can be so stressed that their stomachs start grumbling if they eat them first thing. If this applies to you, you may find a bowl of lower-fibre cereal or a slice of white toast more easily digestible. If milk doesn't suit your stomach, try pouring some apple juice over your cereal - as strange as it may sound, it tastes delicious.</p> <p>Research has shown that people who eat something - however little - in the mornings can concentrate better, that children are more adept at arithmetic and that the body generally responds more favourably to the demands that are made of it, which means that you're less likely to feel out of your depth and stressed. It may take some effort, but if you invest some time and energy in getting what you eat and drink right, your efficiency and state of mind will both benefit.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I am certainly not perfect when it comes to eating properly. It's normally stress that throws my eating habits out of kilter, when, bar breakfast, the day can whizz by without much more than the odd piece of fruit passing my lips. So, believe me, when you're lurching from one crisis to the next, I understand only too well how hard it can be to take the time to eat nutritious food. I therefore thought that I'd devote this week's column to taking you through what's good to eat when your stress levels are running high. The most important thing to know is what to eat and drink at the end of the day to help you to wind down. It can mean the difference between collapsing into bed totally exhausted but unable to switch off, or secure in the knowledge that you have given your body what it needs to get a good night's sleep. The complex group of carbohydrates are your greatest ally in this respect. A bowl of pasta, risotto or polenta, a jacket potato or a helping of mashed potatoes, will all have a calming effect that will lull you into a deep, body-nurturing sleep. When deciding on a sauce, however, remember that the excessive amounts of fat in creamy, buttery or oily sauces are hard for a stressed, sensitive stomach to digest, especially if it has had very little food over the course of the day. If food isn't eaten, digestive juices aren't produced, and the liver slows down accordingly. If you then pick up a fatty food, like a kebab, burger or fish and chips, on the way home, it will sit heavily in your stomach, waiting until there are sufficient digestive juices to break it down. Because the body doesn't tolerate undigested fat well, it will try to get rid of it as quickly as possible, causing you to suffer from heartburn or even to rush to the loo. So opt for a tomato-based pasta sauce or a risotto made with stock. Avoid fried foods in favour of grilled or baked ones. Both adults and children often tolerate cooked vegetables better than raw salad ingredients, which can be hard for a stressed gut to digest in the evening. Tempting as it is to hit the bottle with a vengeance when you are under stress, remember that alcohol on top of anxiety aggravates the body's adrenaline response and disrupts sleeping patterns. And if drunk on an under-nourished as well as anxious stomach, alcohol can wreak absolute havoc, lowering your blood-sugar levels and making you feel ravenous, so that when you do eventually get round to eating, you tend to eat too much too quickly. Then, not only will your gut complain throughout the night, but you'll probably feel slightly hung over in the morning. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can also weaken the muscle lining holding the top and the bottom of the stomach taut, making you more prone to heartburn. Because the presence of food in the stomach cushions these negative effects, postpone the booze until after you've eaten. Get it right the night before, and you shouldn't have any regrets the morning after. While I'm on the subject of drink, caffeine exacerbates the symptoms of stress, too, including a racing heart, a nervous stomach, an aching head and unstable emotions, so try not to drink too much tea, coffee, drinking chocolate, green tea, cola and so-called 'energising' drinks, such as Red Bull. Ideally, you would make your body a caffeine-free zone and instead drink plenty of water. (If drinking plain water doesn't appeal, try making a herbal infusion, perhaps of lime flower, camomile or St John's wort.) Dissolving a few drops of essential oil, such as lavender, bergamot, neroli or juniper, in your bathwater can also have a calming effect. Drinking water throughout the day, as well as snacking on fruit (especially bananas, as they're good stress relievers), will help to keep your blood-sugar levels low and reduce any feelings of anxiety and stress. Eating too many sugary foods, on the other hand, will cause your blood-sugar levels to ricochet all over the place, thereby exacerbating mood swings and even triggering panic attacks. Steadying your blood-sugar levels is as important in the morning as it is during the rest of the day, and a bowl of honey-coated or sugary breakfast cereal, a Danish pastry or a sweet drink will send them surging upwards. By contrast, a higher-fibre cereal, a slice of wholegrain toast spread with pure-fruit jam or a bowl of porridge (oats are an excellent de-stresser) topped with sliced banana all contain sugar that is more slowly absorbed. If you can't face a hearty breakfast, try having a little fresh fruit or a glass of freshly squeezed juice (if your stomach reacts badly to orange or grape-fruit, experiment with a less acidic juice, like apple or cranberry). And if you don't have much for breakfast, take some plain biscuits or a flapjack to work to eat a little later. Although higher-fibre foods usually work best in the morning, some people's digestive systems can be so stressed that their stomachs start grumbling if they eat them first thing. If this applies to you, you may find a bowl of lower-fibre cereal or a slice of white toast more easily digestible. If milk doesn't suit your stomach, try pouring some apple juice over your cereal - as strange as it may sound, it tastes delicious. Research has shown that people who eat something - however little - in the mornings can concentrate better, that children are more adept at arithmetic and that the body generally responds more favourably to the demands that are made of it, which means that you're less likely to feel out of your depth and stressed. It may take some effort, but if you invest some time and energy in getting what you eat and drink right, your efficiency and state of mind will both benefit.",

But when Alice Ford turned two it was different.</p> <p>A family holiday abroad descended into nightmare for parents Andy and Angie. By the end of the short flight, Andy had blood running down his neck where Alice had torn at him with her nails. During the stay, Alice had not only pushed another child into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he had to be rescued by lifeguards, but she had also shoved an entire restaurant table into the harbour.</p> <p>For Andy, a computer-company project manager, and Angie, a teacher, who live in Sheffield, it was the last straw. They had been concerned for some time that Alice's development seemed slow, her speech poor and her hearing variable. But every time they raised their anxieties with health professionals they were told not to worry. Even though Alice failed her health visitor's hearing test at nine months, they were reassured when she sailed through the re-test weeks later and passed a further test, for speech, at 18 months. Returning from holiday, they were so desperate that they consulted a child psychologist, who recommended simply ignoring Alice for two hours every time she misbehaved.</p> <p>After a few weeks, she was transformed into a calm, compliant child. With hindsight, Andy believes it was the cruellest thing he has ever done. 'We are wracked with guilt about it,' he says. 'It breaks my heart.'</p> <p>What Andy and Angie now know is that Alice is deaf. She was born deaf. Yet, despite her parents' repeated concerns and after numerous tests, Alice's deafness was not diagnosed until she was more than three-and-a-half years old. By this time, Andy and Angie were so convinced she could not hear that they did their own test - hiding behind Alice and asking her to repeat words. Alice, it transpired, had somehow taught herself to lip-read. Once a speaker was out of sight, she failed to respond.</p> <p>Finally, the Fords were granted a thorough hospital hearing check which proved Alice had moderate to severe hearing loss. She was almost four - just two months off starting school - by the time she had hearing aids fitted. Andy remembers the moment well. 'She smiled the most enormous smile she had ever smiled in her life,' he says.</p> <p>Now 11, Alice has just started secondary school after doing well in her junior-school exams. But Andy is certain her education has suffered from her late diagnosis.</p> <p>'I think it took her virtually all of junior school to catch up,' he says. What makes matters worse is knowing that Alice's deafness could have been detected within a few days of birth through a simple, quick and safe test developed more than 10 years ago, but still not universally available.</p> <p>About 840 children are born each year in the UK with permanent deafness, mainly due to genetic damage to the cochlea or auditory nerve. So it makes sense that all children are called at around eight months old for a routine hearing test performed by health visitors to detect permanent hearing problems.</p> <p>The trouble is that the check, called the infant distraction test, is woefully unreliable. It detects at best 60 per cent, at worst 18 per cent, of permanent hearing loss, according to studies. Like Alice, many deaf children sail through with flying colours, while children with perfect hearing frequently fail and have to go for further checks. In fact, most hearing problems are actually detected by parents or health professionals independently of the test. Even so, more than half of children born deaf are still undiagnosed at 18 months, and a quarter are not diagnosed until more than three-and-a-half, according to the National Deaf Children's Society (NDCS). Late diagnosis, the society warns, delays giving vital help to deaf children - such as hearing aids and cochlea implants - and can cause lasting problems with the child's language, education, behaviour and even mental health.</p> <p>Yet there is a test, the transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) test, which can be done in hospital within days of birth, by inserting a tiny probe into a baby's ear, and which is almost foolproof. Developed in the 80s, it takes minutes, is totally safe and costs less than the health-visitor test. But the TEOAE is performed routinely on newborn babies in just a handful of UK hospitals. Generally, it is used only when family history suggests a baby might be deaf, despite the fact that 90 per cent of deaf children are born to families with no such history.</p> <p>This summer, the government announced pilot studies beginning next year to introduce TEOAE for all newborn children in 20 areas in England. But national TEOAE screening of all babies - replacing the health-visitor test - will not begin until possibly two or three years later. In that time, another 400 deaf children a year will go undiagnosed, and suffer in silence, like Alice.</p> <p>Evidence that the TEOAE works better than the infant-distraction test is already inarguable, according to John Bamford, professor of audiology at Manchester University. A study comparing the two tests found 96 per cent of deaf children were identified by nine months with the TEOAE but only half with the health-visitors' test.</p> <p>The main problem, he says, is that the infant-distraction test is subjective and dependent on circumstances. Introduced nationally in the 60s, it involves two health visitors: one holding the baby's attention, while the other stands behind the child making noises with special rattles and other equipment. Hearing is assessed by the baby's ability to turn towards the sounds. But in a busy health clinic, the test is often distorted because babies turn towards other noises, shadows, and even a health visitor's perfume. This means deaf children often pass the test while hearing children fail, causing unnecessary anxiety for parents and clogging up hospital clinics.</p> <p>The TEOAE is not only significantly better at detecting deafness, it also does it earlier, allowing help to be given sooner. Bamford says: 'There is now quite good emerging data that the earlier you identify children with a significant hearing problem and offer intervention - whether parental information or devices like hearing aids - the quicker the benefits.'</p> <p>An expert group investigating the issue, for which Professor Bamford was a member, recommended national TEOAE screening in 1997. Further delay means more deaf children will go undiagnosed and untreated before national screening comes in, warns Bamford, although he accepts the need to iron out teething problems through pilot studies.</p> <p>Even health visitors support abandoning their test in favour of neonatal screening but, according to the Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association, they also back pilots first.</p> <p>Susan Daniels, chief executive of the NDCS, which has campaigned for over 10 years for neonatal screening, is less content. Although delighted at the government's pledge to bring in national newborn screening, the 'most important development for deaf children since the invention of the hearing aid,' she sees no reason to wait.</p> <p>'We believe there is enough information today, from the States and other areas in Europe doing national screening, to be able to roll this out as soon as possible,' she says. Indeed, a law was passed in the US last year supporting newborn-deafness screening in every state. She adds: 'The importance of early diagnosis just cannot be overestimated. Parents need to know as soon as they possibly can.'</p> <p>Diana Glover, who has two out of three sons born deaf, supports that whole-heartedly. Second son Robin's hearing problems were dismissed by health professionals as 'glue ear', a common childhood complaint when fluid gathers behind the eardrum, until he was finally diagnosed with profound deafness at 19 months. Younger brother Benjamin was diagnosed within weeks of birth and had hearing aids fitted at three months, followed by a cochlea implant at two years. The difference, she says, is still obvious. Robin, now 17, is studying A levels at a school for deaf children and still struggles with language, while Benjamin, eight, is managing well in mainstream education.</p> <p>'I can see, with two deaf boys, the difference that early diagnosis makes,' says Diana. 'If you find out your child is deaf it is going to be a shock anyway, but if you have time on your side to make important decisions and for them to get used to hearing aids, it's so much more rewarding than finding you have missed so many crucial months and they are way behind.'</p> <p><b>Now hear this</b></p> <p>About one in every 1,000 babies is born deaf in the UK. A further 160 children become permanently deaf every year, mostly through meningitis. In addition, most children under five have bouts of 'glue ear', but this normally clears up on its own.</p> <p>Only a handful of UK hospitals perform the transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) test on newborn babies. Most only do the test when there is a family history of deafness. Almost all health districts invite children for the infant-distraction test, performed by health visitors, at between six to nine months. Nine out of 10 British children undergo this test. Studies show its success in detecting hearing problems varies from 18 to 60 per cent. Most children who fail the test have normal hearing. The government has promised to introduce national neonatal screening using the TEOAE test - but not until it analyses the results of 20 pilot studies due to begin next year.</p> <p>\u0095 If you're worried about your child's hearing, call the NDCS helpline (020 7250 0123) weekdays 10am-5pm.</p>",

      "body": "<p>During the first 50 years of American cinema, blacks were assigned the roles of maids, waiters, porters and cheerful slaves content with their lot. The great dancer, Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson, was only allowed on screen in his late fifties to dance with Shirley Temple; America's greatest black actor, Paul Robeson, had to come to Britain to find parts worthy of him.</p> <p>Today, Hollywood is full of black stars - James Earl Jones, Danny Glover, Morgan Freeman, Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington, the list goes on. What happened in between? The answer is Sidney Poitier, who was both a beneficiary of, and significant contributor to, social change. Freeman generously acknowledged the debt he and his generation owed him when Poitier received the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award in 1992.</p> <p>After the Second World War, Hollywood made biopics celebrating black-face singer Al Jolson and produced problem pictures starring white actors about blacks passing for white. Then in No Way Out (1950) Joseph L Mankiewicz broke the mould by casting the unknown 26-year-old Poitier as a black intern confronted by racist hoodlum Richard Widmark in an American city on the brink of inter-racial warfare. It was a strong role in a film so outspoken for its time that it wasn't shown in the South and was censored in some northern states.</p> <p>The tall, handsome, quietly spoken Poitier gave substance to a saintly, forgiving character, whose banked-up anger was expressed through those hypnotic eyes that penetrate and interrogate his antagonists and his audience. This was the first of a succession of understanding doctors, lawyers, social workers, teachers and cops that he was to embody over the next 20 years. They made him the first black superstar, 'an actor for all races' as one observer called him.</p> <p>His three finest films of the 50s were Richard Brooks's The Blackboard Jungle (1955), where he was an angry but sympathetic pupil at a New York trade school challenging Glenn Ford as the representative of a prejudiced social system; Martin Ritt's Edge of the City (1957), in which he befriended a bewildered John Cassevetes on the New York waterfront and had a showdown with racist foreman Jack Warden; and Stanley Kramer's preachy but hard-hitting The Defiant Ones (1959), which brought him an Oscar nomination as a convict on the run chained to racist redneck Tony Curtis.</p> <p>His best roles of the 60s were the sardonic journalist sussing out cold warrior Richard Widmark aboard a US warship in The Bedford Incident (1965), and Virgil Tibbs, the supercool homicide detective tangling with dim-witted Southern sheriff Rod Steiger in Norman Jewison's In The Heat of the Night (1967). But the movie that brought him an Oscar was Ralph Nelson's Lilies of the Fields (1963), a sentimental tale of a kindly itinerant labourer helping a party of East German nuns in Arizona.</p> <p>Self-parody continued with Kramer's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a reductio ad absurdum of the earnest liberal movie in which Spencer Tracy has trouble deciding whether he'll allow his daughter to marry Poitier, a doctor of international renown with impeccable manners, on the point of winning a Nobel Prize. This smug movie appeared during the most contentious days of the civil rights movement and strident Black Power leaders called Poitier an 'Uncle Tom'.</p> <p>But in 1957 he had become the nation's third biggest box-office star, and as he said: 'I'm the only Negro actor who works with any degree of regularity. I represent 10 million people in this country and millions more in Africa. Wait till there are six of us, then one of us can play villains all the time.'</p> <p>Poitier had no memorable roles in the 70s and by the end of the decade had switched entirely to directing lightweight comedies of no particular distinction. But in 1988 he returned to the screen giving weight to Roger Spottiswoode's Deadly Pursuit as an FBI chief, and he followed this up with another pair of authority figures - a former senior CIA man in Sneakers (1992) and the deputy director of the FBI in The Jackal (1997).</p> <p>But he figured most strikingly during the 90s in a movie in which he doesn't appear - the screen version of John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation, a dramatisation of the true story of a trickster who entered Manhattan society by posing as Poitier's son. This is a more potent tribute to his fame than his star on the Hollywood Boulevard.</p> <p><strong>Five classic movie moments</strong></p> <p><strong>No Way Out</strong> <br>(1950) <br>In the final scene, Dr Luther Brooks (Poitier) is tending the gunshot wounds of snivelling racist gangster Ray Biddle (Richard Widmark), who's been baiting him mercilessly and stirring up a riot.

      "body": "<p>This week, London has been the centre of attention for the design world. Designers from the UK and across Europe have been displaying their work at showrooms across the capital. The main focus of attention, however, is 100% Design, the massive contemporary furniture and product trade show at Earls Court. This is the place where the professionals go to shop, and where the design companies show off their newest, brightest ideas. </p> <p>But unlike most trade shows, 100% Design gives the public a chance to get in on the secret, too. </p> <p>Today, the doors are open to anyone who wants to know how their homes might look if they had a limitless budget and access to some of the more obscure prototypes soon to be on the market. You can drool over new furniture by Gijs Papavoine, Ron Arad and Matthew Hilton, fabrics by Christopher Farr, upholstery by the Azumis, and a brand new range of children's furniture by a collective of designers including Michael Marriott. One-off piecescan also be commissioned direct from many of the exhibiting designers.</p> <p>If you don't have the stamina to trawl around the whole show, however, make a beeline for the 100% Design/Blueprint Awards stand. The winner of a \u00a32,000 prize was announced on Friday, having been judged stringently by a team of experts, including the Italian architect, Mario Bellini. The innovations include a reversible Flip Table by Michael Sodeau for Isokon; a series of elegant vases by Sebastian Bergne for Driade, and an ingenious Scoop stool designed by Hugo Eccles for Pallucco. </p> <p>It's the ultimate one-stop shop, everything you need for the thoroughly modern home.

      "bodyText": "This week, London has been the centre of attention for the design world. Designers from the UK and across Europe have been displaying their work at showrooms across the capital. The main focus of attention, however, is 100% Design, the massive contemporary furniture and product trade show at Earls Court. This is the place where the professionals go to shop, and where the design companies show off their newest, brightest ideas. But unlike most trade shows, 100% Design gives the public a chance to get in on the secret, too. Today, the doors are open to anyone who wants to know how their homes might look if they had a limitless budget and access to some of the more obscure prototypes soon to be on the market. You can drool over new furniture by Gijs Papavoine, Ron Arad and Matthew Hilton, fabrics by Christopher Farr, upholstery by the Azumis, and a brand new range of children's furniture by a collective of designers including Michael Marriott. One-off piecescan also be commissioned direct from many of the exhibiting designers. If you don't have the stamina to trawl around the whole show, however, make a beeline for the 100% Design/Blueprint Awards stand. The winner of a \u00a32,000 prize was announced on Friday, having been judged stringently by a team of experts, including the Italian architect, Mario Bellini. The innovations include a reversible Flip Table by Michael Sodeau for Isokon; a series of elegant vases by Sebastian Bergne for Driade, and an ingenious Scoop stool designed by Hugo Eccles for Pallucco. It's the ultimate one-stop shop, everything you need for the thoroughly modern home. If you miss the show, you can catch up with the Blueprint finalists at a special display at the V&amp;A Museum until 10 October. The 100% Design Public Day runs today from 10am-6pm at Earls Court 2, London. Observer readers can enter for \u00a38 (usual price \u00a312) by presenting a copy of this magazine at the registration desk. To catch up on the latest news, go to www.100percentdesign.co.uk.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>What follows was triggered by an encounter with a man in a London pub. I'll call him Jacko. I was sitting on a high seat at the bar when the barman came up to me and said: 'I'm sorry, but you're going to have to move, you're sitting in Jacko's seat.' I turned around and saw a small-ish, old-ish man holding a paperback book. This was Jacko, looking - to do him credit - quite embarrassed. I climbed down from the chair, and he got on to it. As he did so, I noticed a metal plaque on the back: 'Jacko's Chair', it said, 'Keep Off'.</p> <p>No disrespect to Jacko, but as he settled down at his place, I was reminded of those road signs you see warning of frogs crossing the road. The point is: the frogs aren't going to change their ways, so you'd better change yours. It was the same with Jacko.</p> <p>I later found out that Jacko - who declined to be interviewed - claims his chair every night at 8pm and reads until the pub closes. He is what you might call an extremely regular person, like Admiral Boom in Mary Poppins, who fires a cannon from the roof of his house every night at 6pm, or Sherlock Holmes's brother, Mycroft, of whom it is said, in the Bruce-Partington Plans, that 'he has his rails and he runs on them', and who went to the Diogenes Club every night between quarter to five and twenty to eight.</p> <p>Sherlock Holmes, by contrast, was exasperatingly irregular. In The Mazarin Stone, Mrs Hudson asks him what time he'd like dinner, and he says 'Seven thirty, the day after tomorrow'.</p> <p>This waywardness of Holmes was probably more startling then than it would be today. He 'existed' at a time when many people ate fish on Friday and half the population of England went to church on Sundays. It's true that a century of industrialisation meant that the rhythms of nature were being left behind, but by the late-19th century they'd been replaced by the rhythms of industrial work and commuting - compared by Dickens to the act of breathing, which makes metronomes of us all.</p> <p>Today, despite the fact that the vast majority of people still travel to their place of work, we like to think we're not so orthodox in our behaviour. Our culture celebrates spontaneity in the form of 'flexible friends', Pay As You Go, Just Do It, lastminute.com, etc. A stigma is attached to regularity, which has overtones of All-Bran and prunes, and it attaches especially to pub regularity. You can't be a mover and shaker - according to current theory - if you have a tankard behind the bar with your name engraved on it.</p> <p>David Kyffin, landlord of the King's Arms in Oxford, however, sees new regulars all the time. After about four weeks, he makes his move, introducing himself. 'And some of them,' he says, 'just won't have it. They back off. They'd thought no one had noticed them coming in every day, and don't want to be marked down as regulars.'</p> <p>Mike Smith doesn't mind. He's a former stockbroker, now an amiable postgraduate student at Linacre College. In the mornings, he usually works in the Cecil Rhodes library, around the corner from the King's Arms, always using the same seat in a window bay.</p> <p>Then, at 12.30pm, five times a week, he comes into the King's Arms. He sits in the back bar, adjacent to the picture of Guy Fawkes. Mindful of Jacko, I asked Mike whether he'd mind if anyone was sitting in the seat when he arrived. 'Nah,' he said, at which David Kyffin interrupted, 'You don't say anything,' he said, 'but I've watched you, and your bottom lip goes out.'</p> <p>Mike has two pints per lunchtime, and the second is automatically poured for him when the first's finished. Ninety per cent of the time he drinks Guinness, but sometimes he'll opt for a lager 'to keep the staff on their toes'. He comes into the pub not for the booze, but for the conversation. 'We'll talk about what Blair's done\u0085 Prescott. Occasionally somebody might introduce a literary aspect.' He's been using the pub for four years, and although he's not yet been photographed by David for the gallery of regulars around the walls, it's only a matter of time.</p> <p>The back bar is the epicentre of regularity at the King's Arms. Basically, there are no tourists there. There used to be no women either, and there was a hierarchy of regulars. 'A newcomer would start in that chair there,' says Dave, 'then he'd work his way around to that one there.' When David started working at the King's Arms 30 years ago, the number-one regular, occupying the top chair (actually a stool at the bar) was Harry Turner, a 'cantankerous old bastard' whom David liked enormously. He not only had a personalised tankard, but also custom-made shelves built into the wall next to his stool to accommodate his snuff-taking gear. You were not allowed to sit on his stool, which was the only one in the pub with a padded top.</p> <p>Tradition dictated that Harry and most of the regulars of the King's Arms in those days drank halves (they drank a lot of them, mind you), and when Harry turned 80, another King's Arms regular, a brilliant low- temperature physicist called Dr Laurie Mole, carved him a 'beerometer' - a wooden stick with notches representing 80 halves of bitter that Mole had bought upfront for Harry. But the tragedy is that Harry had only worked his way through 40 of these before he died.</p> <p>David Kyffin is full of such stories about the legendary regulars of the King's Arms. He lists some of their names - Alan Turner, Fabian Barker, Cecil Skinner, Bill Quartermain, Ted East - and I enjoy hearing them. They just have a certain regularity about them. He's the sort of landlord who attracts regulars - a good one, in other words. Another of the breed is Norman Balon of the Coach and Horses in Greek Street, Soho - this despite the fact that he is proudly billed on the pub's match boxes as 'London's rudest landlord'. (Once, I was drinking in the Coach and Horses and one of the regulars, the actor Tom Baker, accidentally stood on my foot and apologised fulsomely for doing so. Overhearing this, Norman barked: 'Oi, stop being so bloody polite!')</p> <p>Norman is actually a very charming man, but if he doesn't like you, he bars you from his pub, so it's quite an exclusive place. One of the people he did not bar, despite pressure from third parties, was the late Jeffrey Bernard, doyen of regulars, who actually inspired a cartoon strip of that name in Private Eye. The catchphrase was 'Jeff bin in?', and the implicit answer was always yes. 'Jeffrey Bernard,' Balon told me, 'came in at 11 o'clock, and always sat on the same stool. In the early days, he was a Scotch drinker, then it was vodka, then gin. His drinks changed as his tolerance for alcohol decreased.'</p> <p>But he was very loyal to each of those drinks for many years, seldom wavering in his order, for Bernard, although regarded as a wild man, was actually very steady in certain areas.</p> <p>Norman thinks regularity is fading, but only slowly - 'because there are more other things you can do now'. He believes that '50 to 60 per cent' of the people in his pub at any one time will be regulars.</p> <p>The ability to be a magnet for regulars is important in the restaurant trade, as well. Elena Salvoni has it. She is probably London's most celebrated ma\u00eetre d'. She started as a waitress at the Caf\u00e9 Bleu in Old Compton Street, moved on to manage Bianchi's in Frith Street, and now she's at L'Etoile in Charlotte Street. Many customers have followed her through all three. 'You've got to remember where people like to sit, what they like to eat,' she says. 'Although sometimes they get stuck on the same thing, and if they do keep saying, \"I don't want to see the menu, I'll have the liver,\" I might say, \"Look come on, the lamb's very good.\"' She tries to stretch them a bit, in other words - it's for their own good. Not that she's against regularity. She's got this little thing she whispers to anyone who comes in three times in a week: 'You've done the hat trick!' Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh are two people who've done the hat trick at L'Etoile.</p> <p>Regulars at the Ivy restaurant in Covent Garden can show you the Michael Parkinson table, the Lloyd Webber table (he gets around, that Lloyd Webber), the table of the agent Anita Land, and so on. Another regular is Lee Menzies, currently producing Jeffrey Archer's play The Accused. He 'more or less always' has the hummus and Lebanese flat bread, then fish and chips, washed down with a glass of champagne and half a bottle of wine.</p> <p>He is a regular at the Piccadilly in Great Windmill Street, Soho, too. He's been going there every week for 30 years and having the tagliatelle bolognaise and a bottle of house red. I asked him to name another regular at the Piccadilly and he said, somewhat inevitably, 'Andrew Lloyd Webber'. Lee Menzies absolutely never eats pudding, never has coffee, but then again this is a man who's holidayed in room 23 of the Pine de Plage hotel in St Tropez for the past nine years. He's just a regular kind of guy, you might say. 'It's pretty boring,' he admits, 'but you know what you're getting.'</p> <p>Restaurant-going is increasing dramatically in this country, so there are presumably more restaurant regulars than ever. Perhaps their number compensates for what is surely, despite the anecdotal evidence of Kyffin and Balon, a steep overall decline in pub regularity as a result of the declining number of pubs. (According to the Campaign for Real Ale, they're closing at a rate of 20 a month.) My own suspicion would be that any new activity generates its own regulars. Before long, there'll probably be a large number of people who have virtual-reality sex so habitually that you will be able to set your watch by them.</p> <p>And according to consultant psychologist Dr Sidney Crown, they'll probably be men. Dr Crown believes that women tend to be less predictable, because they have 'deeper priorities' than sustaining habits - and certainly there are more men than women in this article. Dr Crown thinks that regularity across the board has remained pretty constant. On the one hand, he maintains, we had fewer choices in the past, but the current pressure on us all to work so hard forces us back towards regularity. To some extent, this is fine: 'Using the same beer mug every day helps us establish something about our identity; it's when it gets in the way of our overall effectiveness that it becomes a worry.'</p> <p>Dr Crown believes that more people are being treated for regularity, partly because obsessive-compulsive disorder, as extreme predictability is now called, is so widely popularised. 'The amount of people who come to see me, sit down and straightaway say, 'I'm OCD'\u0085 It's terrible.' He thinks they think it's glamorous, whereas nobody ever wanted to be labelled with the old-fashioned term 'neurotic'.</p> <p>One kind of regularity that undoubtedly is declining, however, is church going. Figures published by Christian Research show that, in 1979, 11.7 per cent of the population of England went to a Christian church on Sundays. The figure today is 7.5 per cent, and of those fewer than half go once a week. Statistics aside, the situation was summed up by the telephonist of the diocese of Durham who, when I called saying I was looking for a regular churchgoer in her area, laughed quite derisively for about 30 seconds.</p> <p>I did find one, though: Connie Hinds, who's been going to St Mary's church in Cockerton Green, Darlington, for about 50 years. If you go into the choir vestry, you'll see her name recurring many times - on the cleaning rota, the linen rota, the intercessions rota. You don't often find her on the flower rota, funnily enough, but she was joining in the flower arrangements for a forthcoming wedding when I met her. Connie comes to the 9am service on Sunday mornings, and also to evensong on Sunday, although I had to press hard to get the second piece of information, because Connie - a self-effacing, humorous woman - has 'a terrible fear of sounding pi'.</p> <p>For the past 12 years, she's sat at the back of the church, but, between 1951 and 1988, when she accompanied her mother to church, she sat further forward, underneath the war memorial, because that was her mother's favourite spot. 'For me,' she says, 'the week starts on a Sunday. I need to say thanks, I need to be forgiven.' In her time at St Mary's, Connie has seen 'sidesmen' become 'sidespeople', the growing necessity of locking the church to prevent vandalism, and the following vicars: Mr Porteus, Mr Walker, Mr Sexty, Mr Hall, Mr Kent, Mr Conway and now Mr Wallace. She describes the services as 'always the same and always different'. Some of the sermons connect more with her than others, but the point, really, is the ritual and regularity. I asked Connie whether people today had too many distractions on Sundays to be able to go regularly to church. 'That's what they think,' she said, with uncharacteristic severity.</p> <p>To Connie Hinds, the essentially prosaic performance of a routine leads to something transcendental - namely 'communion with all Christian souls living or dead'. Writers also create their own routines as a way of reaching some wider realm. My own, for example, is this: wake up, pretend to be still asleep until I hear the sound of my wife taking the kids off to school, get out of bed, have a coffee, have a slice of toast with jam on it, have another coffee, go to the lavatory, have a bath, have another coffee, light a small cigar, start work. Enid Blyton, by contrast, would give instructions concerning dinner to her cook, and then sit silently with her eyes closed in front of her typewriter for a few minutes before starting to write.</p> <p>The Scottish writer Nigel Tranter, who died earlier this year, and was best known for his historical novels, wrote as he walked. He set off every morning for a long tramp around Aberlady Bay in East Lothian, always starting by walking over a wooden structure he called the 'footbridge to enchantment', because it symbolised the point at which routine launched him into creativity. A parallel case from America involves the film director, David Lynch who, every day for seven years, located his muse by going to a Bob's Big Boy diner in LA and having a chocolate shake and seven cups of very sugary coffee.</p> <p>Then there's the poet and critic Al Alvarez, whose autobiography, Where Did It All Go Right? is just out. He swims every morning on Hampstead Heath. For most of the year, he uses the men's bathing pond but in summer he goes to the mixed bathing pond, a short walk from his Hampstead home. He's been swimming on the Heath more or less all his life, and never really fallen below three times a week. He now does it every day, because a crocked leg means he can no longer go rock climbing, which he used to do every weekend. He thinks it is crucial for a writer to do something that is not writing; and to do it regularly. He was strongly approving when I told him that I believed Martin Amis played tennis literally every day after a morning's work.</p> <p>As I swam with Alvarez one morning, I observed his routine. He leaves his clothes on a particular bench and dives in from the jetty. He swims front crawl away from the jetty and comes back doing backstroke. This is absolutely unvarying. As he swims, he waves to the composer Albert Alan Owen, a mixed-pool regular, who calls out the traditional, mixed-pool regulars' greeting: 'Not drowning\u0085 but waving!' Another regular is the radio producer Piers Plowright, and the bench on which Alvarez leaves his clothes commemorates a fourth regular, Alan Franks (1910-94), who was well known to Alvarez.</p> <p>The pond regulars are a rather tight clique and Alvarez finds himself 'slightly resentful' when, on sunny days, flighty, fairweather swimmers turn up, possibly forcing small detours in his routine. (There are women regulars at the mixed pool, by the way - it is mixed after all; there just weren't any around on the day I turned up.)</p> <p>After swimming with Alvarez, at about ten past ten, I watch a bearded man enter the open-air male changing room, get dried and then, without removing his trunks, sit down, peel an orange and start reading The Times, beginning with the back page. 'Yes,' Alvarez told me later, 'you'll probably find he does that every day.' Although I myself live close to the mixed-bathing pond, I haven't yet been back to confirm this, precisely because I - like Al Alvarez, and Mycroft Holmes, and most men and many women - do run on rails, and I'm afraid they take me elsewhere at that particular time of day.</p> <p>\u0095 Andrew Martin's next novel, The Bobby-Dazzlers, will be published by Faber and Faber in March 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "What follows was triggered by an encounter with a man in a London pub. I'll call him Jacko. I was sitting on a high seat at the bar when the barman came up to me and said: 'I'm sorry, but you're going to have to move, you're sitting in Jacko's seat.' I turned around and saw a small-ish, old-ish man holding a paperback book. This was Jacko, looking - to do him credit - quite embarrassed. I climbed down from the chair, and he got on to it. As he did so, I noticed a metal plaque on the back: 'Jacko's Chair', it said, 'Keep Off'. No disrespect to Jacko, but as he settled down at his place, I was reminded of those road signs you see warning of frogs crossing the road. The point is: the frogs aren't going to change their ways, so you'd better change yours. It was the same with Jacko. I later found out that Jacko - who declined to be interviewed - claims his chair every night at 8pm and reads until the pub closes. He is what you might call an extremely regular person, like Admiral Boom in Mary Poppins, who fires a cannon from the roof of his house every night at 6pm, or Sherlock Holmes's brother, Mycroft, of whom it is said, in the Bruce-Partington Plans, that 'he has his rails and he runs on them', and who went to the Diogenes Club every night between quarter to five and twenty to eight. Sherlock Holmes, by contrast, was exasperatingly irregular. In The Mazarin Stone, Mrs Hudson asks him what time he'd like dinner, and he says 'Seven thirty, the day after tomorrow'. This waywardness of Holmes was probably more startling then than it would be today. He 'existed' at a time when many people ate fish on Friday and half the population of England went to church on Sundays. It's true that a century of industrialisation meant that the rhythms of nature were being left behind, but by the late-19th century they'd been replaced by the rhythms of industrial work and commuting - compared by Dickens to the act of breathing, which makes metronomes of us all. Today, despite the fact that the vast majority of people still travel to their place of work, we like to think we're not so orthodox in our behaviour. Our culture celebrates spontaneity in the form of 'flexible friends', Pay As You Go, Just Do It, lastminute.com, etc. A stigma is attached to regularity, which has overtones of All-Bran and prunes, and it attaches especially to pub regularity. You can't be a mover and shaker - according to current theory - if you have a tankard behind the bar with your name engraved on it. David Kyffin, landlord of the King's Arms in Oxford, however, sees new regulars all the time. After about four weeks, he makes his move, introducing himself. 'And some of them,' he says, 'just won't have it. They back off. They'd thought no one had noticed them coming in every day, and don't want to be marked down as regulars.' Mike Smith doesn't mind. He's a former stockbroker, now an amiable postgraduate student at Linacre College. In the mornings, he usually works in the Cecil Rhodes library, around the corner from the King's Arms, always using the same seat in a window bay. Then, at 12.30pm, five times a week, he comes into the King's Arms. He sits in the back bar, adjacent to the picture of Guy Fawkes. Mindful of Jacko, I asked Mike whether he'd mind if anyone was sitting in the seat when he arrived. 'Nah,' he said, at which David Kyffin interrupted, 'You don't say anything,' he said, 'but I've watched you, and your bottom lip goes out.' Mike has two pints per lunchtime, and the second is automatically poured for him when the first's finished. Ninety per cent of the time he drinks Guinness, but sometimes he'll opt for a lager 'to keep the staff on their toes'. He comes into the pub not for the booze, but for the conversation. 'We'll talk about what Blair's done\u0085 Prescott. Occasionally somebody might introduce a literary aspect.' He's been using the pub for four years, and although he's not yet been photographed by David for the gallery of regulars around the walls, it's only a matter of time. The back bar is the epicentre of regularity at the King's Arms. Basically, there are no tourists there. There used to be no women either, and there was a hierarchy of regulars. 'A newcomer would start in that chair there,' says Dave, 'then he'd work his way around to that one there.' When David started working at the King's Arms 30 years ago, the number-one regular, occupying the top chair (actually a stool at the bar) was Harry Turner, a 'cantankerous old bastard' whom David liked enormously. He not only had a personalised tankard, but also custom-made shelves built into the wall next to his stool to accommodate his snuff-taking gear. You were not allowed to sit on his stool, which was the only one in the pub with a padded top. Tradition dictated that Harry and most of the regulars of the King's Arms in those days drank halves (they drank a lot of them, mind you), and when Harry turned 80, another King's Arms regular, a brilliant low- temperature physicist called Dr Laurie Mole, carved him a 'beerometer' - a wooden stick with notches representing 80 halves of bitter that Mole had bought upfront for Harry. But the tragedy is that Harry had only worked his way through 40 of these before he died. David Kyffin is full of such stories about the legendary regulars of the King's Arms. He lists some of their names - Alan Turner, Fabian Barker, Cecil Skinner, Bill Quartermain, Ted East - and I enjoy hearing them. They just have a certain regularity about them. He's the sort of landlord who attracts regulars - a good one, in other words. Another of the breed is Norman Balon of the Coach and Horses in Greek Street, Soho - this despite the fact that he is proudly billed on the pub's match boxes as 'London's rudest landlord'. (Once, I was drinking in the Coach and Horses and one of the regulars, the actor Tom Baker, accidentally stood on my foot and apologised fulsomely for doing so. Overhearing this, Norman barked: 'Oi, stop being so bloody polite!') Norman is actually a very charming man, but if he doesn't like you, he bars you from his pub, so it's quite an exclusive place. One of the people he did not bar, despite pressure from third parties, was the late Jeffrey Bernard, doyen of regulars, who actually inspired a cartoon strip of that name in Private Eye. The catchphrase was 'Jeff bin in?', and the implicit answer was always yes. 'Jeffrey Bernard,' Balon told me, 'came in at 11 o'clock, and always sat on the same stool. In the early days, he was a Scotch drinker, then it was vodka, then gin. His drinks changed as his tolerance for alcohol decreased.' But he was very loyal to each of those drinks for many years, seldom wavering in his order, for Bernard, although regarded as a wild man, was actually very steady in certain areas. Norman thinks regularity is fading, but only slowly - 'because there are more other things you can do now'. He believes that '50 to 60 per cent' of the people in his pub at any one time will be regulars. The ability to be a magnet for regulars is important in the restaurant trade, as well. Elena Salvoni has it. She is probably London's most celebrated ma\u00eetre d'. She started as a waitress at the Caf\u00e9 Bleu in Old Compton Street, moved on to manage Bianchi's in Frith Street, and now she's at L'Etoile in Charlotte Street. Many customers have followed her through all three. 'You've got to remember where people like to sit, what they like to eat,' she says. 'Although sometimes they get stuck on the same thing, and if they do keep saying, \"I don't want to see the menu, I'll have the liver,\" I might say, \"Look come on, the lamb's very good.\"' She tries to stretch them a bit, in other words - it's for their own good. Not that she's against regularity. She's got this little thing she whispers to anyone who comes in three times in a week: 'You've done the hat trick!' Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh are two people who've done the hat trick at L'Etoile. Regulars at the Ivy restaurant in Covent Garden can show you the Michael Parkinson table, the Lloyd Webber table (he gets around, that Lloyd Webber), the table of the agent Anita Land, and so on. Another regular is Lee Menzies, currently producing Jeffrey Archer's play The Accused. He 'more or less always' has the hummus and Lebanese flat bread, then fish and chips, washed down with a glass of champagne and half a bottle of wine. He is a regular at the Piccadilly in Great Windmill Street, Soho, too. He's been going there every week for 30 years and having the tagliatelle bolognaise and a bottle of house red. I asked him to name another regular at the Piccadilly and he said, somewhat inevitably, 'Andrew Lloyd Webber'. Lee Menzies absolutely never eats pudding, never has coffee, but then again this is a man who's holidayed in room 23 of the Pine de Plage hotel in St Tropez for the past nine years. He's just a regular kind of guy, you might say. 'It's pretty boring,' he admits, 'but you know what you're getting.' Restaurant-going is increasing dramatically in this country, so there are presumably more restaurant regulars than ever. Perhaps their number compensates for what is surely, despite the anecdotal evidence of Kyffin and Balon, a steep overall decline in pub regularity as a result of the declining number of pubs. (According to the Campaign for Real Ale, they're closing at a rate of 20 a month.) My own suspicion would be that any new activity generates its own regulars. Before long, there'll probably be a large number of people who have virtual-reality sex so habitually that you will be able to set your watch by them. And according to consultant psychologist Dr Sidney Crown, they'll probably be men. Dr Crown believes that women tend to be less predictable, because they have 'deeper priorities' than sustaining habits - and certainly there are more men than women in this article. Dr Crown thinks that regularity across the board has remained pretty constant. On the one hand, he maintains, we had fewer choices in the past, but the current pressure on us all to work so hard forces us back towards regularity. To some extent, this is fine: 'Using the same beer mug every day helps us establish something about our identity; it's when it gets in the way of our overall effectiveness that it becomes a worry.' Dr Crown believes that more people are being treated for regularity, partly because obsessive-compulsive disorder, as extreme predictability is now called, is so widely popularised. 'The amount of people who come to see me, sit down and straightaway say, 'I'm OCD'\u0085 It's terrible.' He thinks they think it's glamorous, whereas nobody ever wanted to be labelled with the old-fashioned term 'neurotic'. One kind of regularity that undoubtedly is declining, however, is church going. Figures published by Christian Research show that, in 1979, 11.7 per cent of the population of England went to a Christian church on Sundays. The figure today is 7.5 per cent, and of those fewer than half go once a week. Statistics aside, the situation was summed up by the telephonist of the diocese of Durham who, when I called saying I was looking for a regular churchgoer in her area, laughed quite derisively for about 30 seconds. I did find one, though: Connie Hinds, who's been going to St Mary's church in Cockerton Green, Darlington, for about 50 years. If you go into the choir vestry, you'll see her name recurring many times - on the cleaning rota, the linen rota, the intercessions rota. You don't often find her on the flower rota, funnily enough, but she was joining in the flower arrangements for a forthcoming wedding when I met her. Connie comes to the 9am service on Sunday mornings, and also to evensong on Sunday, although I had to press hard to get the second piece of information, because Connie - a self-effacing, humorous woman - has 'a terrible fear of sounding pi'. For the past 12 years, she's sat at the back of the church, but, between 1951 and 1988, when she accompanied her mother to church, she sat further forward, underneath the war memorial, because that was her mother's favourite spot. 'For me,' she says, 'the week starts on a Sunday. I need to say thanks, I need to be forgiven.' In her time at St Mary's, Connie has seen 'sidesmen' become 'sidespeople', the growing necessity of locking the church to prevent vandalism, and the following vicars: Mr Porteus, Mr Walker, Mr Sexty, Mr Hall, Mr Kent, Mr Conway and now Mr Wallace. She describes the services as 'always the same and always different'. Some of the sermons connect more with her than others, but the point, really, is the ritual and regularity. I asked Connie whether people today had too many distractions on Sundays to be able to go regularly to church. 'That's what they think,' she said, with uncharacteristic severity. To Connie Hinds, the essentially prosaic performance of a routine leads to something transcendental - namely 'communion with all Christian souls living or dead'. Writers also create their own routines as a way of reaching some wider realm. My own, for example, is this: wake up, pretend to be still asleep until I hear the sound of my wife taking the kids off to school, get out of bed, have a coffee, have a slice of toast with jam on it, have another coffee, go to the lavatory, have a bath, have another coffee, light a small cigar, start work. Enid Blyton, by contrast, would give instructions concerning dinner to her cook, and then sit silently with her eyes closed in front of her typewriter for a few minutes before starting to write. The Scottish writer Nigel Tranter, who died earlier this year, and was best known for his historical novels, wrote as he walked. He set off every morning for a long tramp around Aberlady Bay in East Lothian, always starting by walking over a wooden structure he called the 'footbridge to enchantment', because it symbolised the point at which routine launched him into creativity. A parallel case from America involves the film director, David Lynch who, every day for seven years, located his muse by going to a Bob's Big Boy diner in LA and having a chocolate shake and seven cups of very sugary coffee. Then there's the poet and critic Al Alvarez, whose autobiography, Where Did It All Go Right? is just out. He swims every morning on Hampstead Heath. For most of the year, he uses the men's bathing pond but in summer he goes to the mixed bathing pond, a short walk from his Hampstead home. He's been swimming on the Heath more or less all his life, and never really fallen below three times a week. He now does it every day, because a crocked leg means he can no longer go rock climbing, which he used to do every weekend. He thinks it is crucial for a writer to do something that is not writing; and to do it regularly. He was strongly approving when I told him that I believed Martin Amis played tennis literally every day after a morning's work. As I swam with Alvarez one morning, I observed his routine. He leaves his clothes on a particular bench and dives in from the jetty. He swims front crawl away from the jetty and comes back doing backstroke. This is absolutely unvarying. As he swims, he waves to the composer Albert Alan Owen, a mixed-pool regular, who calls out the traditional, mixed-pool regulars' greeting: 'Not drowning\u0085 but waving!' Another regular is the radio producer Piers Plowright, and the bench on which Alvarez leaves his clothes commemorates a fourth regular, Alan Franks (1910-94), who was well known to Alvarez. The pond regulars are a rather tight clique and Alvarez finds himself 'slightly resentful' when, on sunny days, flighty, fairweather swimmers turn up, possibly forcing small detours in his routine. (There are women regulars at the mixed pool, by the way - it is mixed after all; there just weren't any around on the day I turned up.)

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Under the triple canopy of the Nantahala forest of North Carolina it is impossible to see a man 10ft away. In Cherokee the word Nantahala means the 'land of the midday sun'. It is a place that rarely cools below 30\u00b0C in summer, that generates a cacophony of sounds - the screech of bobcats and the maddening static of the insects that begin their assault at dusk and continue until first light. The undergrowth throws out tangled roots to trip the unwary, and rattlesnakes lurk in bracken sharp enough to razor through trousers.</p> <p>Through this landscape, unchanged since the Cherokee were driven from their hunting lands a century and a half ago, the agents of the FBI are now stalking the thickets in search of Eric Rudolph, America's most wanted fugitive. The forest hides other dangers. There are more than a thousand mines within its half million acres - dangerous, half-hidden workings which date back to the Gold Rush. Then there are the natural caves and caverns, some poisoned by underground gases so lethal that a single breath renders a victim unconscious before their body hits the ground.</p> <p>Lurking among these hazards is Rudolph - bombmaker, backwoodsman and expert marksman. A right-wing extremist so dangerous the US has ranked him in its cosmology of evil alongside the Islamic fundamentalist Osama Bin Laden, who ordered the bombing of the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and in which 200 people died.</p> <p>In truth, Rudolph - for all the $1 million price put on his head - is a different scale of operator. He has caused minimal disruption when compared with his fellow traveller on the lethal fringes of the far right, America's most prolific domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 and injured 500 more when he bombed the Federal building in Oklahoma City.</p> <p>Charged, however, with six counts of bombing and attempted bombing, Rudolph committed one particular crime that needs to be read as much for its symbolic context as for its body count. The crime that made Rudolph infamous was seen as a humiliation for the US in front of the eyes of world. He bombed the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta in 1996, killing one and injuring hundreds, including children who were hit by flying nails packed into the crude device.</p> <p>His next two bombs targeted a clinic which performed abortions, the Sandy Springs Professional Building, north of Atlanta, in January 1997. Then Rudolph switched his attention to another group loathed by the American far right. He detonated two bombs a month later in the Otherside Lounge, a lesbian bar in Atlanta, and injured five people. </p> <p>Rudolph is also charged with the 29 January 1998 bombing of another abortion clinic, the New Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, during which an off-duty policeman was killed and a nurse permanently disfigured. Rudolph carried each unstable bomb to the site in an army surplus backpack and placed it where it should have killed many more.</p> <p>Eric Rudolph's significance lies not so much in the number of people he has killed or maimed but in what he represents. Like McVeigh and the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski (who killed three and injured 23 in a 17-year spate of mail bombings), he forms part of the 'leaderless resistance', the lone operators that the chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism unit Robert Burnham, describes as 'the biggest threat right now' to national security. Burnham embodies a contest between all the vast resources of the federal government, against which Rudolph and his colleagues on the 'militia' right have pitted themselves.</p> <p>This ruthlessness is encapsulated in a single image - the surveillance video that unmasked him and began the long manhunt. It comes from the Alabama bombing. In the grainy CCTV footage, Rudolph sits patiently in his pick-up truck, watching a policemen, Robert Sanderson, bend over to examine the bomb just before it detonates.</p> <p>Emily Lyons can remember very little about the morning of 29 January 1998. There was little amiss when she arrived early at the New Woman All Women Health Centre in Birmingham, Alabama to cover for a fellow nurse on maternity leave. She does not recall seeing Rudolph's grey pick-up truck parked outside the clinic, or the blast that followed. </p> <p>The shrapnel from the device has left her disfigured and has permanently damaged her left eye. Since that morning, a series of operations to reconstruct her face have required that she take the powerful painkillers Bersed and Fetnayl. These two drugs have impeded her memory of events between December 1997 and February 1998. But since the bombing, she has learned of witness, forensic, and material evidence amassed by the FBI, and its sister organisations involved in the investigation, that has convinced her beyond doubt that Rudolph is responsible. 'I feel no pity or anger towards him,' she says. 'He didn't know me. He just did it to me. I could feel anger if I knew him, but I have no connection with him. I hate what he has taken away from me: my job, my socialisation. I fear he'll strike again; he has no conscience.'</p> <p>What links Rudolph with McVeigh and the Unabomber is a warped version of the backwoods self-sufficiency preached by Henry David Thoreau. It is racist, anti-semitic, attached to the rights to bear arms and speak one's mind without interference, but rejecting the balancing duties in the American constitution of paying taxes and respecting the lives and opinions of others. It is Christian fundamentalist and pro-life (anti-abortion) to the extent of being prepared to murder doctors and abortion clinic staff. At its most bizarre, it believes that the United Nations is trying to take over the world.</p> <p>Andrews is a tiny one-road town on Interstate Highway 74 on the edge of the Nantahala forest, home to 1,699 people, 16 churches and no bars. When an Andrews hotel suggested last year that it might want to serve beer to accompany food, one of the town's First Baptist ministers wrote a furious letter to the local paper suggesting that this was the next step to the hotel declaring itself a bordello. </p> <p>It was into this deeply God-fearing area in 1981, that the 12-year-old Rudolph moved with his family from Florida. They moved into a small house on Partridge Creek, in the midst of the Nantahala. His father had just died, and it was a new beginning for the family. He enrolled at the local K12 Nantahala High School, a tiny cluster of classrooms along a single dusty corridor - each year group rarely exceeding 15 in number. Randy Cochran was one of Rudolph's better school friends. He and Eric would go camping, play war games in the woods and meet girls with the other boys from their area. 'In this part of the world, people who live near you are your friends,' he says. 'It's how life is here.' But Rudolph, who came from outside and whose family were not regular church goers, began to feel that he was an outsider - a conviction that would deepen with his years in the forest.</p> <p>With hindsight it appears these early influences on Rudolph are crucial. For Patricia Rudolph, his mother, did little to aid her son's easy assimilation into the community that was his new home. Instead, Patricia shared with the far-right militia movement a paranoid distrust of the Federal government. She refused to give her children's social security numbers to the school as she felt it allowed the government to track individuals. </p> <p>Significantly, she also introduced her sons to a neighbour, Thomas Wayne Branham, whose bail she paid in 1986 when he was charged with federal firearms violations. At his trial, Branham had denied the authority of the court and declared himself a 'freeman', an opponent of the federal government, before receiving a three-year suspended sentence.</p> <p>Patricia Rudolph had first met Branham when they lived in Florida before they moved to Nantahala; the Rudolph children would often stay with him in the forest for the summer. When the fatherless family moved to the area, their bond was strengthened. The views of Branham and Patricia Rudolph are not unusual in the forest.</p> <p>Two locals tell me about a rumour that has been going around. Someone has seen some tanks with United Nations markings, and non-English speaking troops have been seen on exercises in the forest. A popular theory, they assure me, is that the FBI are not solely here to try and catch Rudolph, but that they are acting as a cover for a UN takeover of the United States. </p> <p>In the deeper recesses of the Nantahala, lives Jay Peircle and her two daughters. They have a National Rifle Association bumper sticker on their car which declares 'Charlton Heston is my President', two large Confederate flags waving in their driveway, and no love for the FBI. Peircle readily tells me she'd rather have a beer with Rudolph than the Feds, and wouldn't tell the authorities if she found traces of him in the forest.</p> <p>The first sign of Eric Rudolph's growing disaffection and alienation came at 16. Rudolph dropped out of school - Randy Cochran says he doesn't know why - and stayed at home, in the woods. He returned to education, earning sufficient qualifications to enroll in Western Carolina University for two terms, but he was becomingly increasingly erratic. </p> <p>By the summer of 1986, he had left University to enlist in the army. In August 1987, he was posted to Fort Benning, Georgia, where he served 18 months before being discharged as a private, allegedly after being found smoking cannabis.</p> <p>Pot-growing is a thriving black economy in Nantahala. Agents working on the case have disclosed that Rudolph grew one of the strongest breeds of the drug in the hills near his home and sold it on to a dealer in Nash-ville, Tennessee. </p> <p>It was after Rudolph returned to Nantahala that the Olympic bombing took place, as did the two other Atlanta bombings to which the FBI have now linked him. During this time, Rudolph began to betray a few signs that something was amiss: he started using several pseudonyms - Bob Randolph, Robert Randolph and Bob Rudolph - and became ever more reclusive.</p> <p>The change in Rudolph during this period was noticed by Robin Key, a waitress at a local restaurant whom he first met in 1994. Key had been captivated by Rudolph's intense eyes, but otherwise says she found him dull and didn't chase him up. </p> <p>They met again by chance at a video store in 1997. They had dinner soon afterwards and went to a barbecue a few weeks later. They watched a few movies together and were alone once. Key recalls Rudolph was always good with her daughter, Selina, despite the fact that Selina found his quiet demeanour 'a little weird'. The last time they met was in an Andrews store in December 1997, and Rudolph 'blanked' her. She describes him as 'cold and nonchalant', as if a change had come over him.</p> <p>Two months later, Rudolph was charged with the January 1998 bombing of the Birmingham abortion clinic. But by the time the FBI turned up at the trailer he was living in, Rudolph had already fled, triggering the biggest man hunt in American history.</p> <p>Jack Thompson, county sheriff at the time, had been asked to look out for Rudolph by the FBI and had found him through post office and electricity company records at a place called Caney Creek, near Murphy (the next big town to Andrews). </p> <p>'My feeling', says the now-retired Thompson, who tipped off the FBI, 'is that he turned on the television at 6pm and must have seen news footage that his truck had been spotted near the Alabama blast.' Rudolph had been gone no more than 30 minutes, when seven federal agent cars arrived to find his trailer door open, the TV blaring and the lights still on. His truck was later dis-covered abandoned at St Martin's Creek, near Murphy.</p> <p>Rudolph's forest trackers go by the name of the Southeast Bomb Task Force - a collection of officers from the FBI, the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Unit, and the Department of Justice. For 30 months they have been scouring the thickets, caves and disused mineworkings of the Nantahala forest. The search teams are led by trackers from the US Forestry Service and include marksmen and local guides. It is tense and exhausting work.</p> <p>While Rudolph remains their main quarry, the forest itself has also become an enemy, its vastness seeming to collude with the fugitive bomber. Recently, one agent had a heart attack while searching its depths. </p> <p>It is little surprise that it took 20 minutes for the search party to hack out a clearing big enough for a helicopter to land.</p> <p>Much of the effort of the search is focused on the forest's caves and mines. The caves provide perfect shelter, remaining at a constant temperature during the extremes of both summer and winter. Many also contain drinkable spring water all year round. </p> <p>Darren Free has been employed by the SBTF to aid the search over the past 18 months. A caving expert and accomplished woodsman, he has an extensive knowledge of the area's caves which he accumulated while playing in them as a child. Free has proven invaluable to the SBTF. A light-hearted man with native American roots who makes a living cutting glass in nearby Hendersonville, he can theorise for hours about where he thinks Rudolph may be hiding. The $1m reward for his capture has almost lost its appeal for Free; for him it is now a personal hunt into which he pours his energy and ideas.</p> <p>Free and the SBTF remain convinced that Rudolph is not only alive but still sheltering in the forest. A source close to the search team says they believe they have come near to Rudolph on several occasions. Once they heard someone talking to themselves in the bushes; they then saw a ponytailed man fleeing the scene. Another time, two agents came across a pair of boots on a rock. They went for back-up, but on their return they found that the boots were gone.</p> <p>Rudolph's bootprints are themselves a problem: he has one of the most common makes of hiking boot in the country, boots in which legitimate hikers trample all over the Nantahala's trails. Regardless of the insurmountable task ahead of them, the task force has continued the search. So far it has cost at least $14m. At its peak, the force was 600 strong, now there remains a hard core of 12 dedicated hunters who scour the forest at the first sign of a fugitive.</p> <p>The last officially confirmed sighting of someone matching Rudolph's description occurred last February, but unofficially there have been sightings of a man matching Rudolph's description in the area within the past month, and on two of these occasions he was seen with an unidentified female. In February, the SBTF found food parcels and boot prints consistent with Rudolph. More recently, investigators came across an observation post that Rudolph may have been using to survey the area.</p> <p>A resident of the remote northern Nantahala area has also reported seeing a man matching Rudolph's description at regular intervals. A later search of the caves of that region brought to light what was described by a source close to the search as 'the strongest lead in two years'. In addition, the detailed profiles of Rudolph constructed by the FBI and all the evidence collated thus far, point to one conclusion: that Rudolph is still in these mountains, because this, if anywhere, is where he calls 'home'. </p> <p>More and more, however, the FBI is becoming convinced that, if Rudolph is surviving, it is because there are those out in the forest who are helping him. There was a steady pattern of break-ins around the Nantahala area in 1998 in which the items stolen - food, supplies and men's boots and shirts - were consistent with Rudolph. These break-ins stopped in 1999, suggesting that Rudolph had left the area, met his death in the forest, or is receiving a regular drop of supplies.</p> <p>George Nordmann is the last man that the authorities believe has seen Rudolph alive. The taciturn owner of an Andrews health-food store, Nordmann got close enough to be able to provide a description of the haggard Rudolph. On 9 July 1998, Rudolph, then sporting a beard and ponytail, took six months' worth of food and supplies and a truck from Nordmann's house. In Nordmann's absence, he left $500 in payment for the items and a note in the truck which apologised for the inconvenience. The truck was found abandoned near Nantahala and the search picked up pace again. The FBI erected a village of tents on the Appletree Campground outside Andrews and helicopters and agents poured into the forest. </p> <p>Today, Nordmann still runs a small health-food store - The Better Way - on the main road in Andrews. He has little to say about the events of that day, bar confirming that he knew Rudolph's family and Eric himself as a child, and that Rudolph went to school with some of Nordmann's 11 children. He is tired of the association made between him and Rudolph and yet more fatigued by constant calls from reporters. 'There's so much other crime in the world; I could wring his neck now, having to put up with this baloney,' he says wearily, adding that the $500 he left 'shows he had some decency. He was not robbing me.'</p> <p>Nordmann's sympathy is political, too. On the wall is a poster picturing two little girls in martial arts poses with the advice 'our children are going to need more than nursery rhymes to get through the next millennium'. Below is a number to call for classes. On one sideboard is an audio tape with the conspiratorial label 'The Real United Nations'.

      "bodyText": "Under the triple canopy of the Nantahala forest of North Carolina it is impossible to see a man 10ft away. In Cherokee the word Nantahala means the 'land of the midday sun'. It is a place that rarely cools below 30\u00b0C in summer, that generates a cacophony of sounds - the screech of bobcats and the maddening static of the insects that begin their assault at dusk and continue until first light. The undergrowth throws out tangled roots to trip the unwary, and rattlesnakes lurk in bracken sharp enough to razor through trousers. Through this landscape, unchanged since the Cherokee were driven from their hunting lands a century and a half ago, the agents of the FBI are now stalking the thickets in search of Eric Rudolph, America's most wanted fugitive. The forest hides other dangers. There are more than a thousand mines within its half million acres - dangerous, half-hidden workings which date back to the Gold Rush. Then there are the natural caves and caverns, some poisoned by underground gases so lethal that a single breath renders a victim unconscious before their body hits the ground. Lurking among these hazards is Rudolph - bombmaker, backwoodsman and expert marksman. A right-wing extremist so dangerous the US has ranked him in its cosmology of evil alongside the Islamic fundamentalist Osama Bin Laden, who ordered the bombing of the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and in which 200 people died. In truth, Rudolph - for all the $1 million price put on his head - is a different scale of operator. He has caused minimal disruption when compared with his fellow traveller on the lethal fringes of the far right, America's most prolific domestic terrorist Timothy McVeigh, who killed 168 and injured 500 more when he bombed the Federal building in Oklahoma City. Charged, however, with six counts of bombing and attempted bombing, Rudolph committed one particular crime that needs to be read as much for its symbolic context as for its body count. The crime that made Rudolph infamous was seen as a humiliation for the US in front of the eyes of world. He bombed the Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta in 1996, killing one and injuring hundreds, including children who were hit by flying nails packed into the crude device. His next two bombs targeted a clinic which performed abortions, the Sandy Springs Professional Building, north of Atlanta, in January 1997. Then Rudolph switched his attention to another group loathed by the American far right. He detonated two bombs a month later in the Otherside Lounge, a lesbian bar in Atlanta, and injured five people. Rudolph is also charged with the 29 January 1998 bombing of another abortion clinic, the New Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, during which an off-duty policeman was killed and a nurse permanently disfigured. Rudolph carried each unstable bomb to the site in an army surplus backpack and placed it where it should have killed many more. Eric Rudolph's significance lies not so much in the number of people he has killed or maimed but in what he represents. Like McVeigh and the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski (who killed three and injured 23 in a 17-year spate of mail bombings), he forms part of the 'leaderless resistance', the lone operators that the chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism unit Robert Burnham, describes as 'the biggest threat right now' to national security. Burnham embodies a contest between all the vast resources of the federal government, against which Rudolph and his colleagues on the 'militia' right have pitted themselves. This ruthlessness is encapsulated in a single image - the surveillance video that unmasked him and began the long manhunt. It comes from the Alabama bombing. In the grainy CCTV footage, Rudolph sits patiently in his pick-up truck, watching a policemen, Robert Sanderson, bend over to examine the bomb just before it detonates. Emily Lyons can remember very little about the morning of 29 January 1998. There was little amiss when she arrived early at the New Woman All Women Health Centre in Birmingham, Alabama to cover for a fellow nurse on maternity leave. She does not recall seeing Rudolph's grey pick-up truck parked outside the clinic, or the blast that followed. The shrapnel from the device has left her disfigured and has permanently damaged her left eye. Since that morning, a series of operations to reconstruct her face have required that she take the powerful painkillers Bersed and Fetnayl. These two drugs have impeded her memory of events between December 1997 and February 1998. But since the bombing, she has learned of witness, forensic, and material evidence amassed by the FBI, and its sister organisations involved in the investigation, that has convinced her beyond doubt that Rudolph is responsible. 'I feel no pity or anger towards him,' she says. 'He didn't know me. He just did it to me. I could feel anger if I knew him, but I have no connection with him. I hate what he has taken away from me: my job, my socialisation. I fear he'll strike again; he has no conscience.' What links Rudolph with McVeigh and the Unabomber is a warped version of the backwoods self-sufficiency preached by Henry David Thoreau. It is racist, anti-semitic, attached to the rights to bear arms and speak one's mind without interference, but rejecting the balancing duties in the American constitution of paying taxes and respecting the lives and opinions of others. It is Christian fundamentalist and pro-life (anti-abortion) to the extent of being prepared to murder doctors and abortion clinic staff. At its most bizarre, it believes that the United Nations is trying to take over the world. Andrews is a tiny one-road town on Interstate Highway 74 on the edge of the Nantahala forest, home to 1,699 people, 16 churches and no bars. When an Andrews hotel suggested last year that it might want to serve beer to accompany food, one of the town's First Baptist ministers wrote a furious letter to the local paper suggesting that this was the next step to the hotel declaring itself a bordello. It was into this deeply God-fearing area in 1981, that the 12-year-old Rudolph moved with his family from Florida. They moved into a small house on Partridge Creek, in the midst of the Nantahala. His father had just died, and it was a new beginning for the family. He enrolled at the local K12 Nantahala High School, a tiny cluster of classrooms along a single dusty corridor - each year group rarely exceeding 15 in number. Randy Cochran was one of Rudolph's better school friends. He and Eric would go camping, play war games in the woods and meet girls with the other boys from their area. 'In this part of the world, people who live near you are your friends,' he says. 'It's how life is here.' But Rudolph, who came from outside and whose family were not regular church goers, began to feel that he was an outsider - a conviction that would deepen with his years in the forest. With hindsight it appears these early influences on Rudolph are crucial. For Patricia Rudolph, his mother, did little to aid her son's easy assimilation into the community that was his new home. Instead, Patricia shared with the far-right militia movement a paranoid distrust of the Federal government. She refused to give her children's social security numbers to the school as she felt it allowed the government to track individuals. Significantly, she also introduced her sons to a neighbour, Thomas Wayne Branham, whose bail she paid in 1986 when he was charged with federal firearms violations. At his trial, Branham had denied the authority of the court and declared himself a 'freeman', an opponent of the federal government, before receiving a three-year suspended sentence. Patricia Rudolph had first met Branham when they lived in Florida before they moved to Nantahala; the Rudolph children would often stay with him in the forest for the summer. When the fatherless family moved to the area, their bond was strengthened. The views of Branham and Patricia Rudolph are not unusual in the forest. Two locals tell me about a rumour that has been going around. Someone has seen some tanks with United Nations markings, and non-English speaking troops have been seen on exercises in the forest. A popular theory, they assure me, is that the FBI are not solely here to try and catch Rudolph, but that they are acting as a cover for a UN takeover of the United States. In the deeper recesses of the Nantahala, lives Jay Peircle and her two daughters. They have a National Rifle Association bumper sticker on their car which declares 'Charlton Heston is my President', two large Confederate flags waving in their driveway, and no love for the FBI. Peircle readily tells me she'd rather have a beer with Rudolph than the Feds, and wouldn't tell the authorities if she found traces of him in the forest. The first sign of Eric Rudolph's growing disaffection and alienation came at 16. Rudolph dropped out of school - Randy Cochran says he doesn't know why - and stayed at home, in the woods. He returned to education, earning sufficient qualifications to enroll in Western Carolina University for two terms, but he was becomingly increasingly erratic. By the summer of 1986, he had left University to enlist in the army. In August 1987, he was posted to Fort Benning, Georgia, where he served 18 months before being discharged as a private, allegedly after being found smoking cannabis. Pot-growing is a thriving black economy in Nantahala. Agents working on the case have disclosed that Rudolph grew one of the strongest breeds of the drug in the hills near his home and sold it on to a dealer in Nash-ville, Tennessee. It was after Rudolph returned to Nantahala that the Olympic bombing took place, as did the two other Atlanta bombings to which the FBI have now linked him. During this time, Rudolph began to betray a few signs that something was amiss: he started using several pseudonyms - Bob Randolph, Robert Randolph and Bob Rudolph - and became ever more reclusive. The change in Rudolph during this period was noticed by Robin Key, a waitress at a local restaurant whom he first met in 1994. Key had been captivated by Rudolph's intense eyes, but otherwise says she found him dull and didn't chase him up. They met again by chance at a video store in 1997. They had dinner soon afterwards and went to a barbecue a few weeks later. They watched a few movies together and were alone once. Key recalls Rudolph was always good with her daughter, Selina, despite the fact that Selina found his quiet demeanour 'a little weird'. The last time they met was in an Andrews store in December 1997, and Rudolph 'blanked' her. She describes him as 'cold and nonchalant', as if a change had come over him. Two months later, Rudolph was charged with the January 1998 bombing of the Birmingham abortion clinic. But by the time the FBI turned up at the trailer he was living in, Rudolph had already fled, triggering the biggest man hunt in American history. Jack Thompson, county sheriff at the time, had been asked to look out for Rudolph by the FBI and had found him through post office and electricity company records at a place called Caney Creek, near Murphy (the next big town to Andrews). 'My feeling', says the now-retired Thompson, who tipped off the FBI, 'is that he turned on the television at 6pm and must have seen news footage that his truck had been spotted near the Alabama blast.' Rudolph had been gone no more than 30 minutes, when seven federal agent cars arrived to find his trailer door open, the TV blaring and the lights still on. His truck was later dis-covered abandoned at St Martin's Creek, near Murphy. Rudolph's forest trackers go by the name of the Southeast Bomb Task Force - a collection of officers from the FBI, the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Unit, and the Department of Justice. For 30 months they have been scouring the thickets, caves and disused mineworkings of the Nantahala forest.

      "byline": "Heather Connon",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is now just over three years since Imperial Chemical Industries made its $8 billion (\u00a35.3bn) purchase of a collection of fragrances, flavours and other speciality chemicals from Unilever. </p> <p>That marked the start of what it promised was a three-year programme of reshaping the group from a bulk producer of commodity chemicals to a highly focused, much less cyclical, business. </p> <p>At the time of the acquisition, the then chairman, Sir Ronnie Hampel, promised \u00a33bn of disposals to both cut its debt, which stood at \u00a36bn just after the deal, and complete the reshaping of the group. </p> <p>In fact, it has sold business worth more than twice that - and a further \u00a3300 million or so has still to go - as it rapidly became clear that businesses such as materials and titanium dioxide were not resilient enough to merit a place in the new-look group. </p> <p>Despite that level of sales, however, debt still stands at \u00a32.9bn; analysts expect profits this year to be just over twice its \u00a3180m interest bill; and a dividend cut is all but certain; albeit in 2001 rather than 2000. The shares have collapsed from 917p in July 1997 - and a high of 1244p early in 1999 - to just 379p last week. </p> <p>So has the transformation been a failure? The answer at the moment is a qualified no, if only because its position without Unilever would have been so much worse - just look at the performance of rivals such as Dow, which has stayed in the commodity industry. </p> <p>It has, however, been harder than ICI expected. </p> <p>At the time, few would have predicted that the materials business and the added- value parts of industrial chemicals would have declined so rapidly - indeed, ICI had been investing heavily to develop these very areas. </p> <p>The deterioration in trading undermined the impact of disposals on its borrowings, and made finding buyers willing to pay acceptable prices that much harder. </p> <p>Some analysts also say it paid too much for the Unilever businesses and then moved too quickly to add bits to them when it should have waited until it had raised the funds. </p> <p>On the plus side, however, the businesses acquired are performing well. </p> <p>In the first six months of the year, sales and profits of these new core businesses rose by 6 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. Margins at most of them also rose, despite increases in their costs - not least because of the rise in the oil price. </p> <p>Fear that the high oil price will start to hit profits prompted another sharp fall in ICI's shares last month - indeed, they have fallen by about a quarter, relative to the rest of the market, in the past three months. </p> <p>The group is far less exposed to the price of oil than it was; now, oil accounts for only about 30 per cent of its \u00a32bn raw material bill, compared with around 90 per cent as recently as five years ago. </p> <p>But, as ICI itself admits, that makes it harder to pass on cost increases than it was, so there is the risk that margins will be under pressure in the second half of the year. </p> <p>The threat of a dividend cut will also hang over the shares until chief executive Brendan O'Neill makes his intentions clear.

      "bodyText": "It is now just over three years since Imperial Chemical Industries made its $8 billion (\u00a35.3bn) purchase of a collection of fragrances, flavours and other speciality chemicals from Unilever. That marked the start of what it promised was a three-year programme of reshaping the group from a bulk producer of commodity chemicals to a highly focused, much less cyclical, business. At the time of the acquisition, the then chairman, Sir Ronnie Hampel, promised \u00a33bn of disposals to both cut its debt, which stood at \u00a36bn just after the deal, and complete the reshaping of the group. In fact, it has sold business worth more than twice that - and a further \u00a3300 million or so has still to go - as it rapidly became clear that businesses such as materials and titanium dioxide were not resilient enough to merit a place in the new-look group. Despite that level of sales, however, debt still stands at \u00a32.9bn; analysts expect profits this year to be just over twice its \u00a3180m interest bill; and a dividend cut is all but certain; albeit in 2001 rather than 2000. The shares have collapsed from 917p in July 1997 - and a high of 1244p early in 1999 - to just 379p last week. So has the transformation been a failure? The answer at the moment is a qualified no, if only because its position without Unilever would have been so much worse - just look at the performance of rivals such as Dow, which has stayed in the commodity industry. It has, however, been harder than ICI expected. At the time, few would have predicted that the materials business and the added- value parts of industrial chemicals would have declined so rapidly - indeed, ICI had been investing heavily to develop these very areas. The deterioration in trading undermined the impact of disposals on its borrowings, and made finding buyers willing to pay acceptable prices that much harder. Some analysts also say it paid too much for the Unilever businesses and then moved too quickly to add bits to them when it should have waited until it had raised the funds. On the plus side, however, the businesses acquired are performing well. In the first six months of the year, sales and profits of these new core businesses rose by 6 per cent and 13 per cent respectively. Margins at most of them also rose, despite increases in their costs - not least because of the rise in the oil price. Fear that the high oil price will start to hit profits prompted another sharp fall in ICI's shares last month - indeed, they have fallen by about a quarter, relative to the rest of the market, in the past three months. The group is far less exposed to the price of oil than it was; now, oil accounts for only about 30 per cent of its \u00a32bn raw material bill, compared with around 90 per cent as recently as five years ago. But, as ICI itself admits, that makes it harder to pass on cost increases than it was, so there is the risk that margins will be under pressure in the second half of the year. The threat of a dividend cut will also hang over the shares until chief executive Brendan O'Neill makes his intentions clear. The betting in the City is that he will hold the payment at 32p for this year, but will warn of a cut, possibly to 20p, the following year. It would, therefore, be unwise to rely too much on the 8.2 per cent yield currently available on the shares. But if the forecasts of a 20p dividend are right, the yield would still be a generous 5.1 per cent. That will of course, look less attractive if the shares continue their inexorable slide - and this column has recommended buying them at higher prices in the past. But the valuation is now so low that sentiment could easily be swayed by any bit of good news, from a lower oil price to a strengthening euro. Those who have the stomach for a risk should buy now. Time to be radical Those who have been clamouring for British Land to do something to reverse the poor performance of its shares got a little bit of extra ammunition last week. The property group has put four of its prime London properties into a joint venture with the German bank WestLB. The properties were sold to the joint-venture company at a small premium to their value on the balance sheet. Yet the City is currently valuing British Land's shares at around 35 per cent below the value of its property portfolio. Surely, then, it should simply sell off the rest of its assets and give the money back to shareholders. Of course, life is not so simple - not least because of the huge tax bill which would be incurred if it should decide to do that. Even more seriously, chairman John Ritblat shows no sign of wishing to withdraw from life with a public company, regardless of how unpopular his shares become. But the past 10 years demonstrate that the big property companies are not delivering value to shareholders. Ritblat needs to do something a bit more radical than set up yet another joint venture if he is to reverse that trend. Cracking China The fact that Vodafone, the mobile phone company, has paid $2.5bn (\u00a31.7bn) for a stake of just 2 per cent in China Mobile shows just how high the stakes are in the battle for international cellular domination. Vodafone, with its Mannesman and Airtouch deals and its growing international network of shareholdings and alliances, is up there among the leaders of the pack. The China deal, which gives it a link to the biggest mobile operator in one of the fastest-growing markets, is yet another astute move. But the risks of the strategy are high. No one really knows what shape our telecoms businesses will take in the future, but the size of the bets required is increasing. The cost of acquiring stakes is matched by the high price of third-generation licences. The nervousness of bank regulators means that debt, too, will become more expensive to finance. Vodafone is well placed to be one of the winners. But those who buy the shares should be aware of the risks.",

      "body": "<p>Sir Iain Vallance of BT, Ian Harley from Abbey National, Greg Hutchings of Tomkins and Peter Salsbury of Marks &amp; Spencer. Can you spot the odd one out? </p> <p>It is, of course, Salsbury. He has just lost his job as chief executive after a long whispering campaign against him. The other three are still in their posts fighting those who criticise their performance and question their managerial skills. </p> <p>It is a difficult battle to fight because none of them really knows who the enemy is. War is being waged not in the boardrooms or even at meetings with significant shareholders, where questions of stewardship should be decided. These are guerrilla wars, waged through unattributable briefings and stories quoting 'insiders' or 'major shareholders'. The very essence of a whispering campaign is that no one will ever admit to being behind it. </p> <p>They can be extremely destabilising. One company which was at the heart of a long-running campaign said it undermined the ability of the executives to manage the business. </p> <p>It is no coincidence that the number of whispering campaigns has been rising recently. The stock market has been drifting downwards for much of the year and some sectors - banks, engineers and retailers among them - have been performing badly for much longer. That is bad news for major shareholders and not just because the value of their portfolio is falling. If the poor performance goes on, it can affect their own bonuses and salaries, even the security of their jobs. </p> <p>'The people who have made the decision to buy into these companies are under obvious pressure when the share price underperforms,' said Peter Butler of Hermes, who has publicly criticised whispering campaigns. 'Regrettably, instead of talking directly to the board or sharing their concerns with other shareholders, they often speak off the record to the press.' </p> <p>If whispering campaigns are aimed at ending underperformance, then they do not seem to work. The campaign against Hutchings started more than a year ago, and the company has done many of the things that the unattributable investors were asking for, including appointing an external chairman and selling its food business. But the shares are now a third below their high for the year. Marks &amp; Spencer's shares dipped to a 10-year low last week, despite Salsbury's departure. Abbey National has underperformed the banking sector in the six months since the campaign really kicked off; and BT's shares have less than half the rating of telecom rivals such as Vodafone, although they received a fillip on Friday from the resignation of finance director Robert Brace. </p> <p>Indeed, some say that such campaigns could be counterproductive. Tomkins was trying to sell Ranks Hovis McDougall, its food business, while the whispering campaign was at its height. 'Each time a critical article appeared, the venture capitalists cut the price they were offering for it,' said Butler. </p> <p>Others say that, far from making Hutchings think about standing down and handing over to someone more able to improve performance, the campaign made him even more determined to stay. </p> <p>Everyone would agree that institutions should be critical of companies which fail to perform - they are, after all, the owners. Hundreds of pages of corporate governance guidance is aimed at ensuring they do just that. What is questionable, however, is voicing that criticism through whispering campaigns. </p> <p>'If shareholders are unhappy and they want to go public with that, it is up to them. But it must be attributable; whispering campaigns often destroy shareholder value,' said Butler. Most fund managers seem, however, to be overcome with shyness when threatened with the limelight. While they will be blunt in private with journalists and fellow investors, in meetings with the company, they will give no indication that anything is wrong. </p> <p>'Sometimes their knowledge of a company will be superficial,' said one institution. They may also be understandably reluctant to tell a chief executive that their performance is inadequate. </p> <p>That is why Sir Ronnie Hampel recommended that a senior non-executive director, usually the chairman, should always be nominated. He or she would be the person whom shareholders could contact to discuss the performance of the executive team. Such meetings rarely happen, however - perhaps for the simple reason that investors do not know where to find him. </p> <p>But what happens if the campaign is being orchestrated not by shareholders but by company insiders? While institutional shareholders have complained about all the companies mentioned above, there are signs of internal dissent in three of them. At BT, there are hints that one or more of Vallance's board colleagues told journalists that he planned to leave early, a story that was promptly flatly denied by BT, although Brace's resignation supported the conspiracy theorists. At Abbey National, there are suggestions that the campaign against Harley is being led by one of the directors who failed to get his job when Peter Birch retired. Some executives within M&amp;S were as frustrated by the slow speed of Salsbury's reforms as investors were. </p> <p>In such cases, it is surely time for the non-executive directors to do something. It should be noted that the most successful boardroom putsch in recent years was at BP, when Bob Horton was ousted in favour of David Simons. That was orchestrated by the non-executive directors, who were concerned at the atmosphere within the company. The shares have been rising almost continuously since.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir Iain Vallance of BT, Ian Harley from Abbey National, Greg Hutchings of Tomkins and Peter Salsbury of Marks &amp; Spencer. Can you spot the odd one out? It is, of course, Salsbury. He has just lost his job as chief executive after a long whispering campaign against him. The other three are still in their posts fighting those who criticise their performance and question their managerial skills. It is a difficult battle to fight because none of them really knows who the enemy is. War is being waged not in the boardrooms or even at meetings with significant shareholders, where questions of stewardship should be decided. These are guerrilla wars, waged through unattributable briefings and stories quoting 'insiders' or 'major shareholders'. The very essence of a whispering campaign is that no one will ever admit to being behind it. They can be extremely destabilising. One company which was at the heart of a long-running campaign said it undermined the ability of the executives to manage the business. It is no coincidence that the number of whispering campaigns has been rising recently. The stock market has been drifting downwards for much of the year and some sectors - banks, engineers and retailers among them - have been performing badly for much longer. That is bad news for major shareholders and not just because the value of their portfolio is falling. If the poor performance goes on, it can affect their own bonuses and salaries, even the security of their jobs. 'The people who have made the decision to buy into these companies are under obvious pressure when the share price underperforms,' said Peter Butler of Hermes, who has publicly criticised whispering campaigns. 'Regrettably, instead of talking directly to the board or sharing their concerns with other shareholders, they often speak off the record to the press.' If whispering campaigns are aimed at ending underperformance, then they do not seem to work. The campaign against Hutchings started more than a year ago, and the company has done many of the things that the unattributable investors were asking for, including appointing an external chairman and selling its food business. But the shares are now a third below their high for the year. Marks &amp; Spencer's shares dipped to a 10-year low last week, despite Salsbury's departure. Abbey National has underperformed the banking sector in the six months since the campaign really kicked off; and BT's shares have less than half the rating of telecom rivals such as Vodafone, although they received a fillip on Friday from the resignation of finance director Robert Brace. Indeed, some say that such campaigns could be counterproductive. Tomkins was trying to sell Ranks Hovis McDougall, its food business, while the whispering campaign was at its height. 'Each time a critical article appeared, the venture capitalists cut the price they were offering for it,' said Butler. Others say that, far from making Hutchings think about standing down and handing over to someone more able to improve performance, the campaign made him even more determined to stay. Everyone would agree that institutions should be critical of companies which fail to perform - they are, after all, the owners. Hundreds of pages of corporate governance guidance is aimed at ensuring they do just that. What is questionable, however, is voicing that criticism through whispering campaigns. 'If shareholders are unhappy and they want to go public with that, it is up to them. But it must be attributable; whispering campaigns often destroy shareholder value,' said Butler. Most fund managers seem, however, to be overcome with shyness when threatened with the limelight. While they will be blunt in private with journalists and fellow investors, in meetings with the company, they will give no indication that anything is wrong. 'Sometimes their knowledge of a company will be superficial,' said one institution. They may also be understandably reluctant to tell a chief executive that their performance is inadequate. That is why Sir Ronnie Hampel recommended that a senior non-executive director, usually the chairman, should always be nominated. He or she would be the person whom shareholders could contact to discuss the performance of the executive team. Such meetings rarely happen, however - perhaps for the simple reason that investors do not know where to find him. But what happens if the campaign is being orchestrated not by shareholders but by company insiders? While institutional shareholders have complained about all the companies mentioned above, there are signs of internal dissent in three of them. At BT, there are hints that one or more of Vallance's board colleagues told journalists that he planned to leave early, a story that was promptly flatly denied by BT, although Brace's resignation supported the conspiracy theorists. At Abbey National, there are suggestions that the campaign against Harley is being led by one of the directors who failed to get his job when Peter Birch retired. Some executives within M&amp;S were as frustrated by the slow speed of Salsbury's reforms as investors were. In such cases, it is surely time for the non-executive directors to do something. It should be noted that the most successful boardroom putsch in recent years was at BP, when Bob Horton was ousted in favour of David Simons. That was orchestrated by the non-executive directors, who were concerned at the atmosphere within the company. The shares have been rising almost continuously since.",

      "body": "<p>Martin Evans is a potato farmer in Pembroke. For 26 years, this 48-year-old fourth-generation Welsh farmer has sown up to 100 acres, producing 1,500 tonnes of the crop each spring. But next year he will cut back sharply, and in 2002 pack it in altogether. </p> <p>The reason is straightforward: like thousands of small farmers around Britain, Evans simply cannot make a living. Nor, dependent on the whims of the big supermarkets, can he afford to take the risk of the chains wriggling out of contracts when the next cheap boatload docks from Jersey or Cyprus. </p> <p>This June, Evans received just 3.4p for every pound of spuds, compared with the 28p Tesco is charging at its new superstore down the road at Pembroke Dock. And, like every lamb and beef farmer in the land, he is furious that the long-awaited Competition Commission report has cleared the big chains of not passing derisory farmgate prices on to the consumer. </p> <p>'It's absolute rubbish. Tesco haven't dropped their prices,' he says. 'I'm not making any money now. I used to.

      "bodyText": "Martin Evans is a potato farmer in Pembroke. For 26 years, this 48-year-old fourth-generation Welsh farmer has sown up to 100 acres, producing 1,500 tonnes of the crop each spring. But next year he will cut back sharply, and in 2002 pack it in altogether. The reason is straightforward: like thousands of small farmers around Britain, Evans simply cannot make a living. Nor, dependent on the whims of the big supermarkets, can he afford to take the risk of the chains wriggling out of contracts when the next cheap boatload docks from Jersey or Cyprus. This June, Evans received just 3.4p for every pound of spuds, compared with the 28p Tesco is charging at its new superstore down the road at Pembroke Dock. And, like every lamb and beef farmer in the land, he is furious that the long-awaited Competition Commission report has cleared the big chains of not passing derisory farmgate prices on to the consumer. 'It's absolute rubbish. Tesco haven't dropped their prices,' he says. 'I'm not making any money now. I used to. And supermarkets, because they now control so much of the market, are a big part of the reason why.'

If it does not go on doing so, the Government faces not so much a threat from enthusiasts shouting, 'Don't be vague, vote for Hague' as the kind of mass abstention that has afflicted Labour in most local and European elections since 1 May 1997. </p> <p>The Conservatives' principal problem continues to be that New Labour has stolen most of its clothes. Labour's problem is that, unless it shows some respect for these embarrassing elderly relations who constitute its core vote, it could yet screw up its best mandate since 1945. </p> <p>Labour needed a shock, and it has received several. This is no bad thing. Provided the Government shows that it has learnt something from recent grass-roots revolts, it - and we - should be all the better for the experience.

All these are unworthy of a left-wing government with a budget surplus that would have embarrassed even Gladstone. </p> <p>The Conservatives have been too stupid by half in trying to trump Labour on public expenditure. What their claims really boil down to is that they will spend more than Labour does now on this or that public service, simply because in the natural way of things public expenditure is likely to grow year by year anyway. Its growth would be less than under Labour's current plans, that's all. </p> <p>And anyone who puts his or her faith in the insurance companies as a way of augmenting the good work of the beleaguered health service is referred to the article that a lifelong believer in private insurance, the late Jock Bruce-Gardyne, wrote in the Spectator when the time came for him to collect from Bupa and it was found wanting in his hour of need. </p> <p>The Government is certainly spending on the public services from now on, but one continues to wonder whether it was really necessary to have that two-year freeze at the beginning. </p> <p>The second reservation about Brown's stewardship has been the 'hands-off' attitude towards a pound which has been so high that it has been damaging two vital sectors, manufacturing industry and agriculture. An exchange rate regime in which Nissan's European showpiece factory in Sunderland struggles to make money is one that is seriously out of kilter. </p> <p>There are always time lags in these matters, and the full force of the regime has not yet been felt in an economy that has profited from a combination of a global economic boom and the relative absence of inflationary pressure - an absence not uncon nected with the fierce international competition associated with the phenomenon known as 'globalisation'. </p> <p>The impressive collection of economic experts who produced the Liberal Democrats' recent pamphlet Britain's Adoption of the Euro concluded that the range of 'possible sustainable entry rates' was between DM2.45 to DM2.84, against around DM3.25 now. </p> <p>In Prague, the Chancellor told a press conference, against the background of the G7 intervention to stabilise the euro, that the current sterling/euro rate was 'not justified by fundamentals' and, again 'not justified by any look at long-term fundamentals'. Admittedly Brown had made the same point earlier in the summer in his James Meade lecture at the London School of Economics; but, taken in the context of Britain's participation in the G7 operation, this began to sound like a major change of policy and an attempt, at last, to encourage the pound down to more realistic and sustainable levels. </p> <p>Alas, when the details of the G7 intervention were duly published last week, it turned out that Britain's participation in the multi-billion dollar support for the euro was a mere $70 million or so, and that it sold the euros the same day. This makes Britain sound not so much like a member of the G7 as half a member. It was the first time the British establishment had intervened in the market for sterling against European currencies since Black Wednesday (16 September 1992), although there may have been some intervention later in that decade vis-a-vis the yen. </p> <p>So, it was a major change of policy - and it lasted several hours. The Treasury is now busily briefing that its intention was to strengthen the euro, not weaken the pound for domestic reasons. </p> <p>The Bank of England can, within its restricted balance sheet, intervene to lower the pound but only, as I understand it, as part and parcel of its remit to achieve the inflation target.

The Sydney site is one of a range being considered for leisure and retail development by the 40-strong team originally assembled at Nomura to roll out its proposals for the Millennium Dome. Since the failure of negotiations over the Greenwich attraction with the New Millennium Experience Company last month, the team - whose original title 'Dome Europe' has been dropped as a result - has been looking for other high-profile opportunities. There have been recent rumours that the Japanese bank is considering re-entering negotiations for the Dome, but Nomura sources said there was no possibility of it rebidding. Suspicion as to the origin of these rumours centres on the New Millennium Experience Company, which is currently trying to close a deal with Legacy, the group headed by millionaire Labour donor Robert Bourne - which was originally outbid by Nomura. The Japanese bank's favoured targets now include a \u00a3100m expansion and modernisation project at the UK's biggest conference venue, the National Exhibition centre in Birmingham; Germany's Expo site in Hanover; and a greenfield development outside Amsterdam. A successful bid for Sydney's Olympic Park would be a coup for Nomura, which views it as a 'very exciting opportunity' despite being further afield than was envisaged in the original Dome Europe plans. Details provided by the New South Wales government indicate that it backs a theme park option for the Olympic site, which would fit well with Nomura's leisure model. 'It is a wonderful opportunity, although it is still early days,' said a Nomura source, who confirmed that the team would be visiting within two weeks. Nomura's plans involve a combination of entertainment and retail facilities, with leisure acting as the main draw for visitors, and retail providing the main revenue stream. Each development will focus around a show - with other entertainment, educational, retail and restaurant facilities. It is looking for sites that fulfil key criteria - urban location with a high residential population, potential for entertainment, retail and restaurants, high-quality transport links and the possibility of redeveloping brownfield areas. Hands will have to negotiate to secure capital from Nomura's board in Japan.",

      "byline": "Sam Taylor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As far as Billy Gilman is concerned, 1991 is, like, ancient history. Not because he was only three at the time, but because those were the days when his family 'didn't even have cable. We only had five or six channels, and Sesame Street was a big deal... LONG time ago!' It was, however, the time when, watching Pam Tillis sing 'Cleopatra, Queen of Denial', Billy Gilman discovered country music, and decided that he wanted to be a star. </p> <p>Now aged 12, a mere 10 weeks after releasing his debut album, he is the youngest ever person to go platinum (one million copies) in the States, and has just recorded a duet with Charlotte Church in an effort to break Britain. Billy himself does not tell me this; it is his pretty blonde tour manager, Elly, who furnishes me with the precise sales figures. 'Stop it!' yells Billy, 'I'm blushing!' He's not. So how does it feel to be so successful, Billy? 'It's awesome. Platinum in 10 weeks! What else could I accomplish?' He says this in more or less the same tone of voice that Hitler probably used after conquering Poland. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong: Billy Gilman is cute as a button. Tousled hair, perfect skin, big loud friendly voice, and extensive dental work. The ideal American kid. But when you hear him talking about 'renegotiating with Sony' or his 'densely populated' hometown in Rhode Island, it's easy to think you're listening to some world-weary, hard-nosed fortysomething, rather than a 4ft 7in preteen with take-home pay of $5 a week. </p> <p>Take the dental work, for instance. It happened on 20 June this year, when Billy was taking a golf lesson. Another kid - 'who had probably never hit a golf ball before in his life' - pitched a ball straight at Billy's mouth, smashing his two front teeth. Billy's first reaction? 'I was crying! I thought, \"What are Sony going to say?\"' Within a week, a local radio station had produced a billboard of Billy's blown-up face with a hole cut into his mouth, and were challenging golfers to hit a ball through the hole in order to win tickets to see Billy. 'It was real painful,' says Billy, 'but I got good press out of it...' </p> <p>And while all his adolescent friends spend their evenings in the bathroom, imagining what it would be like to touch a girl's breasts, Billy Gilman is screamed at by thousands upon thousands of girls his own age - or even, gasp, older. 'It's awful. Some times they scream so loud that I can't hear myself sing,' he complains. 'They send lots of letters, too. I laugh, because some of them are so... like, one of them spelt \"please\" like \"p-l-e-e-z-e\"!' He snorts with derision. A word of advice to Billy's female admirers: use a dictionary. </p> <p>It's only when he breaks into song - as he does several times during our interview - that you get a glimpse of the child beneath the pragmatic bluster. Preternaturally mature his voice may be, but its clear, high, haunting quality sounds undeniably innocent.

      "bodyText": "As far as Billy Gilman is concerned, 1991 is, like, ancient history. Not because he was only three at the time, but because those were the days when his family 'didn't even have cable. We only had five or six channels, and Sesame Street was a big deal... LONG time ago!' It was, however, the time when, watching Pam Tillis sing 'Cleopatra, Queen of Denial', Billy Gilman discovered country music, and decided that he wanted to be a star. Now aged 12, a mere 10 weeks after releasing his debut album, he is the youngest ever person to go platinum (one million copies) in the States, and has just recorded a duet with Charlotte Church in an effort to break Britain. Billy himself does not tell me this; it is his pretty blonde tour manager, Elly, who furnishes me with the precise sales figures. 'Stop it!' yells Billy, 'I'm blushing!' He's not. So how does it feel to be so successful, Billy? 'It's awesome. Platinum in 10 weeks! What else could I accomplish?' He says this in more or less the same tone of voice that Hitler probably used after conquering Poland. Don't get me wrong: Billy Gilman is cute as a button. Tousled hair, perfect skin, big loud friendly voice, and extensive dental work. The ideal American kid. But when you hear him talking about 'renegotiating with Sony' or his 'densely populated' hometown in Rhode Island, it's easy to think you're listening to some world-weary, hard-nosed fortysomething, rather than a 4ft 7in preteen with take-home pay of $5 a week. Take the dental work, for instance. It happened on 20 June this year, when Billy was taking a golf lesson. Another kid - 'who had probably never hit a golf ball before in his life' - pitched a ball straight at Billy's mouth, smashing his two front teeth. Billy's first reaction? 'I was crying! I thought, \"What are Sony going to say?\"' Within a week, a local radio station had produced a billboard of Billy's blown-up face with a hole cut into his mouth, and were challenging golfers to hit a ball through the hole in order to win tickets to see Billy. 'It was real painful,' says Billy, 'but I got good press out of it...' And while all his adolescent friends spend their evenings in the bathroom, imagining what it would be like to touch a girl's breasts, Billy Gilman is screamed at by thousands upon thousands of girls his own age - or even, gasp, older. 'It's awful. Some times they scream so loud that I can't hear myself sing,' he complains. 'They send lots of letters, too. I laugh, because some of them are so... like, one of them spelt \"please\" like \"p-l-e-e-z-e\"!' He snorts with derision. A word of advice to Billy's female admirers: use a dictionary. It's only when he breaks into song - as he does several times during our interview - that you get a glimpse of the child beneath the pragmatic bluster. Preternaturally mature his voice may be, but its clear, high, haunting quality sounds undeniably innocent. On most of the songs on his debut album, One Voice , it is wasted - doing nonsense rhymes over bland, uptempo country-pop tracks - but on the title track (and first single), Billy sings with an angelic passion which will make men stop pistol-whipping their wives this Christmas, and weep, if only for three and a half minutes. A subtle anti-gun anthem, it is accompanied by a brilliant black-and-white video in which Billy looks on compassionately at the young thugs beside him on the school bus, smiling enigmatically at the end when one of them tosses his firearm into a river. Released in the wake of the Columbine high school massacre, it had a profound impact on middle America's psyche. Or profound enough at least to cause a million people to buy the album.

For the rest of us, mere opera- goers, the work emits an air of musty gravitas, like an old book whose importance is known but which is too intimidating to open. </p> <p>That Welsh National Opera found a way to enjoy the distant rhetoric and make it alive and affecting is a tribute to the production team of Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser. Instead of trying to reinvent the piece, which has two hours of enthralling music but almost no action, they exalted in its puzzling qualities and engaged with its spirit. </p> <p>In simple terms, Gluck's 1762 composition provides a bridge between the grand formalities of baroque opera (Handel, say) and the expressive freedoms of the nineteenth century (almost everyone who followed). Because of its economy, and its new way of integrating chorus and dance with the drama, it has been called a 'reform opera', giving Gluck a particular place in operatic history. </p> <p>All well and good. The complications start when you learn that Gluck first wrote the piece in Italian, then reworked it in French, adapting the role of Orpheus from castrato to high tenor, changing the orchestration and generally fiddling around with order, keys and detail. Further revisions followed, with the 'English' Bach (J.C.) inserting his own music when the work came to London in 1770 in order to make a longer evening's entertainment (not, apparently, having learnt that short can be beautiful, especially in the opera house). </p> <p>Bypassing the many other efforts by various hands, we then come to Berlioz, who paid homage to Gluck with an edition of his own in 1859, aided by the great mezzo-soprano, Pauline Viardot (much swooned over by Charles Dickens). </p> <p>You can read the details in books. The significance here is that WNO chose Berlioz's version for the new staging. This meant that the title role was sung by a mezzo, the Swedish-born Katarina Karneus, winner of the Cardiff Singer of the World Competition in 1995. She follows in a tradition of mezzo interpreters which includes Clara Butt, Kathleen Ferrier and Janet Baker. </p> <p>Tall and, with her short hair, boyish looking, Karneus fits the part admirably. Her voice has a crisp asperity, which softened as the evening progressed and suited the virtuosic runs and ornaments of Berlioz's version. As yet she keeps a tight rein on emotional power. The music demands restraint, but a notch more expression would develop her already dignified and serious interpretation. </p> <p>Natalie Christie, always a sympathetic performer, sang Eurydice - who doesn't meet her lover until the third act - with a sharp mix of petulance and fervour. Eurydice, you will recall, was the girl who wouldn't take no for an answer when Orpheus refused to look at her. </p> <p>He finally weakens not because of his own desires but to quell her unjust accusations. His plans to rescue her from the underworld are thus wrecked, and she dies a second time. Fortunately, this being the eighteenth century, a deus ex machina in the shape of Amour (Jeni Bern) appears and all ends happily, with a Hymn of Love and Cupid floating back up to heaven on clouds of glory. </p> <p>Not for Gluck the continuation of the story (fully explored by Harrison Birtwistle in his 1986 Mask of Orpheus ) in which, after Bac chic revelling, Orpheus is torn to shreds, his head cast in the River Hades still calling out: 'Eurydice!' Paul McCreesh, renowned for his historically informed performances, conducted a taut account in which the WNO orchestra, after a scrappy start, got in to their stride and played vigorously and accurately, and the chorus sang well, though their French was somewhat vague. </p> <p>Caurier and Leiser dealt with the work's static nature by creating handsome stage pictures, with the help of Christian Fenouillat's sets and Agostino Cavalca's old-new costumes (with lighting by Christopher Forey) in which colour is used to potent effect. </p> <p>At the start, after the bright overture which hardly prepares you for the melancholy scene which follows, mourners in black suits and coats, successful-looking even in grief, stand stock still in the dappled light around the tomb of the dead Eurydice. In the Elysian Fields, all are in white with fine chiffon blindfolds, the sylvan scene evoking the fetes galantes of Fragonard or Watteau. Orpheus, in black, touchingly lifts the head or tilts the hat of each in his search for his lost love, who eventually springs from her protective white cot in a cocktail dress of cerulean blue. Amour, a quaint dancing master figure, dazzles in burnt orange frock coat and feathered hat. </p> <p>The spectres and furies of Hades, echoing images of Fuseli, wriggle and jive in agitation at the sound of Orpheus's lyre. Painted side-wings and cloths rise and fall in the style of an eighteenth- century theatre, changing swiftly and simply. All is thought out in impressive detail. A work that has long been respected was here celebrated and brought to sombre life. It deals out its rewards more gradually than other operas but they are durable. </p> <p>After Cardiff, next performance is Oxford, 19 October. </p> <p>The musical severity of Orph\u00e9e certainly seemed light years from the engaging mix of calypso and gospel, highland piping, Victorian music-hall songs, waltzes and Brittenesque soliloquy which comprised <b> Mary Seacole</b> , a ballad opera by Richard Chew (to a libretto by SuAndi Obe) about the Jamaican healer and nurse who went to the front line of the Crimean War at the same time as Florence Nightingale. </p> <p>The world premiere was given by Gyenyame, a new company which was founded to 'produce multi-cultural opera and dance in the UK'. </p> <p>More episodic than dramatic, with many touching moments, it was well performed and easy to listen to. </p> <p>To be among a celebratory audience in the Royal Opera House (albeit in its subterranean Linbury Studio) as part of a white minority was a novel experience and one to repeat, though perhaps with more taxing fare.</p>",

Fortunately, this being the eighteenth century, a deus ex machina in the shape of Amour (Jeni Bern) appears and all ends happily, with a Hymn of Love and Cupid floating back up to heaven on clouds of glory. Not for Gluck the continuation of the story (fully explored by Harrison Birtwistle in his 1986 Mask of Orpheus ) in which, after Bac chic revelling, Orpheus is torn to shreds, his head cast in the River Hades still calling out: 'Eurydice!' Paul McCreesh, renowned for his historically informed performances, conducted a taut account in which the WNO orchestra, after a scrappy start, got in to their stride and played vigorously and accurately, and the chorus sang well, though their French was somewhat vague. Caurier and Leiser dealt with the work's static nature by creating handsome stage pictures, with the help of Christian Fenouillat's sets and Agostino Cavalca's old-new costumes (with lighting by Christopher Forey) in which colour is used to potent effect. At the start, after the bright overture which hardly prepares you for the melancholy scene which follows, mourners in black suits and coats, successful-looking even in grief, stand stock still in the dappled light around the tomb of the dead Eurydice. In the Elysian Fields, all are in white with fine chiffon blindfolds, the sylvan scene evoking the fetes galantes of Fragonard or Watteau. Orpheus, in black, touchingly lifts the head or tilts the hat of each in his search for his lost love, who eventually springs from her protective white cot in a cocktail dress of cerulean blue. Amour, a quaint dancing master figure, dazzles in burnt orange frock coat and feathered hat. The spectres and furies of Hades, echoing images of Fuseli, wriggle and jive in agitation at the sound of Orpheus's lyre. Painted side-wings and cloths rise and fall in the style of an eighteenth- century theatre, changing swiftly and simply. All is thought out in impressive detail. A work that has long been respected was here celebrated and brought to sombre life. It deals out its rewards more gradually than other operas but they are durable. After Cardiff, next performance is Oxford, 19 October. The musical severity of Orph\u00e9e certainly seemed light years from the engaging mix of calypso and gospel, highland piping, Victorian music-hall songs, waltzes and Brittenesque soliloquy which comprised Mary Seacole , a ballad opera by Richard Chew (to a libretto by SuAndi Obe) about the Jamaican healer and nurse who went to the front line of the Crimean War at the same time as Florence Nightingale. The world premiere was given by Gyenyame, a new company which was founded to 'produce multi-cultural opera and dance in the UK'. More episodic than dramatic, with many touching moments, it was well performed and easy to listen to. To be among a celebratory audience in the Royal Opera House (albeit in its subterranean Linbury Studio) as part of a white minority was a novel experience and one to repeat, though perhaps with more taxing fare.",

A few motes twinkle in the angled rays, but nothing stirs among the hollows. The further you look into the thickening light, the more the perspective vanishes. A twig cracking would shatter the unearthly hush. There is no trace of a path. </p> <p>Scene Two takes place in another part of the mind - an expanse of snow-capped mountains you have somehow scaled. It might be the view from a Boeing - those Alps you imagine treading like a giant - or that painting by Caspar David Friedrich in which you have become the traveller looking out over the white mists of the Romantic sublime. </p> <p>To say <strong> Mariele Neudecker</strong> has realised these visions in three dimensions would be true but insufficient. She doesn't just create a theatre of the unconscious, she fills it with spells and symbols, fragments of fiction and poetry, souvenirs from a voyage through painting. She also does in it miniature - the tanks in which she installs her model dioramas are roughly proportioned to a Friedrich. When you notice that these tanks are filled with liquid - mysteriously resolving into low-lying vapours and even viscous light in the forest - there is the additional thrill of a submerged world, of landscapes at the bottom of the ocean. </p> <p>Neudecker's models are so superb that you can press your face against the glass and the illusion of reality won't be dispelled. This is a breathtaking accomplishment, to make a sealed scene no bigger than a fishtank stand in for an actual realm. But it is also crucial to Neudecker's aim that you should be able to look directly into your own imagination without wondering why those clouds don't disperse in water. She puts you above the clouds, nose-deep in the forest: just where the mind's eye would take you. </p> <p>That, of course, was a Romantic ideal, the mind wandering through the infinite landscape of art. Neudecker is from D\u00fcsseldorf and many of her models are a kind of Paradise Regained - German Romanticism before it was annexed by the Nazis. But although they may dream of painting, her works aren't bounded by two, or even three dimensions. </p> <p>In It was always like this , Neudecker has filmed a soaring range, its shadows cobalt-blue in the distance. Another film has been superimposed on these immovable mountains, so snow seems to drift across them, obliterating all but the peaks, before blowing away again in a fantastical time-lapse sequence. Friedrich's mountains have been remade as a model; the work of ancient seasons is animated through digital paintbox. It is an illusion within an illusion, making imagined time and place suddenly, spectacularly visible. </p> <p>Neudecker can seem too attached to painting. At the Ikon, two films are projected on panels hung back to back like the double sides of a canvas. If you saw them next to each other, you would witness the simultaneous rising and setting of the sun in Australia and the Azores - just the kind of dream she likes to realise. But then you encounter her amazing anamorphic skull, created in glowing amber. What seems to be an impossible object - surely these perceptual distortions only work in 2D - resolves into a perfect head from a certain vantage. It is more skilful, more wondrous even than the flat image from which it leaps - the skull in Holbein's Ambassadors . </p> <p>This is a stunning exhibition. Neudecker is one of those rare artists whose intelligence is matched by skill and who knows how to liberate the imagination in others. When she wants to envisage infinite light, she does it with fluorescent fishing wires and a litre of sol vent. The effect is a play on painted rays, but it's also a hi-tech vision for the mind's eye - a work of postmodern sublime. </p> <p>Iranian-born <strong> Shirazeh Houshiary </strong> was shortlisted for the Turner Prize in 1994, vanished soon afterwards and has barely been seen in this country since. Self-effacement was always something of a theme in her work - labyrinthine sculptures based on the geometry of Islam, veils of tiny marks pencilled across canvases, which turn out to be Sufi mantras. Now she has retreated from sculpture and eliminated the words from her abstract paintings. </p> <p>What's left at the Lisson is pretty well nothing, or little more than monochrone panels. A few shadows are faintly discernible, a deepening void at the centre of a brilliant white rectangle, a grey mist settling over a patch of light. These indistinct blurs have titles to match - Deep , Unknowing , Memory - and seem to materialise like ghosts from the canvas. Minuscule graphite marks congregate between glazes of diaphanous aquacryl so you can't tell which came first: drawing or painting. </p> <p>Clearly, these are intended as contemplative objects. But the minute you get up close, a civil war breaks out. The brain tries to read the craquelure of marks as some sort of calligraphy, while the eyes are dazzled by the glare. Instead of experiencing the light and abstraction as metaphors of mystical immanence, you feel thwarted by the discomfort and illegibility. The work comes over as repetitive, laborious and, for all its subtle delicacy, like a long-winded postscript to Minimalism. </p> <p>The loudest counterblast to Minimalism ever marshalled in a gallery is surely <strong> Jim Shaw's Thrift Store Paintings</strong> at the ICA. This is a show of content and nothing but: smiling pets, flying saucers, tearful crucifixions, lavish dollybirds, Hollywood dreams and private nightmares. Shaw has collected 400 examples of this hideous American schlock at a dollar a throw - not so much found art as discarded artefact. </p> <p>Hideous, but also weirdly absorbing. Nothing comes between you and the subjects these people wanted to paint - not skill, style, reputation or value. There is absolute sincerity in the religious scenes, palpable psychosis in some of the fantasies. What you get is the message, never lost no matter how ineptly transcribed.

As soon as the usual request to silence phones and pagers had been issued - 'noises off', as it were - a mighty peal from a mobile rang defiantly through the auditorium. A plant, presumably, rather than an eerie coincidence? Either way, two of Frayn's points were neatly made. Here's a farce about a farce which shows that timing can make the difference between annoyance and amusement, and a play in which real life unexpectedly takes the stage. </p> <p>Eighteen years after its first performance, the central device of Noises Off is still hilariously effective. The first act shows a repertory company rehearsing a farce, whose title, Nothing On , neatly echoes Frayn's own. Its cast is a gruesome parade of stereotypes: a comic char in a pinny, a dizzy blonde in cami-knickers, a burly robber. Its actors slip in and out of character: a brilliant piece of casting allows Patricia Hodge to slide in a second from gorblimey to cut-glass. </p> <p>For the second act, the stage spins round, and you watch Nothing On being performed as if you were backstage. You see the reverse side of Robert Jones's cleverly tacky design - with its sticky doors, plastic Tudor beams and earwig-size antlers. You see the liaisons between the actors beginning to interfere with their onstage relationships. You see their world-weary control beginning to slip: this, one of them remarks, 'is becoming farcical'. </p> <p>This is wonderfully entertaining. But the really original stroke is the final tweak. There's a third act - so startling that at least one member of the audience was already on his feet thinking it was all over - in which everything unravels, and the satire about farce is engulfed by farce. Here some of Frayn's slow-burning jokes burst into flame. He builds up his gags pyramid-style: in the first scene, every joke has a lot of triggers; in the last, one word - 'Sardinia' comes to mind - is enough to cause a collapse. </p> <p>And here the skill of director Jeremy Sams, who persuaded Frayn to make some elisions in the play, is fully shown. His musical skills - he directed the London production of Spend, Spend, Spend - are valuable here. He choreographs the piece like a ballet, which is what is needed: whole sequences hinge on tripping, leaping, passing, miming. Everything happens at speed; everything happens at the same time. It's a whizz. </p> <p>The National needs this success. No one doubts that Trevor Nunn is a fine director of plays. But there are doubts about his direction of a theatre. The National is looking lopsided at the moment, with Nunn's own productions strong, but too many gaps elsewhere. Where is the new writing? And where are the new directors? </p> <p>What, for example, is the point of subsidising a Royal National Theatre and a Royal Shakespeare Company to do within six months of each other two poor productions of the same Shakespeare play? Twelve weeks ago Stratford hosted a leaden <strong> Romeo and Juliet</strong> ; now Tim Supple has followed suit in the Olivier. </p> <p>Supple's production (to the extent that it is his, as Nunn was called in to help out) is slurrily spoken and moves at a snail's pace. Confusingly set in modern dress but with sword fights, it seems to be propelled by the notion that youthful passion can be evoked by clamour and irritation. </p> <p>When Charlotte Randle's Juliet isn't on the brink of inappropriate jokiness (she nearly falls off the balcony, and almost giggles at 'God knows when we shall meet again') she is racing around the stage, flinging her arms about (she does this at the mention of wings) and stomping. Patrick O'Kane's short-breathed Mercutio spends the whole play in a lather of indignation, which makes sense when he's just been stabbed but means he delivers the Queen Mab speech as if it were an extended insult.

But they are left floundering without support. </p> <p>To glimpse the theatre of the future you have to look elsewhere. At, for example, the Southwark Playhouse, where an investigation of family history - <strong> The Woman Who Swallowed a Pin </strong> - is being enacted. Clare Bayley's promenade play begins as the audience wait in a lane to go into the theatre. Illuminated behind a heavy plastic curtain which gives things the blurred milky look of old film, you see an early twentieth-century scene: a young girl applying for a below-stairs job.

She is set on recovering her family's past, seeing her history of miscarriages as linked to the story of an ancestor who lost eight children. Recovering the past may mean securing the future. </p> <p>A guide, so tactful as to seem ghostly, prompts the audience to move through the tiny space which, in an origami-style feat, is made to contain long views into the past, a multitude of different characters and generations, and a host ofinteriors and outside views. A large central space is a typing-pool in which 1920s flappers use tea-chests as desks, and an Edwardian kitchen where a maid pummels something in an enamel bowl, while a workman peeks in through a skylight. Double doors open to show a courtship conducted on a bench, framed as by a proscenium arch; another romance is followed through a game of chess. Here's a piece which imitates the flicker of film and of memory. </p> <p>The artistic director of Southwark, Erica Whyman, is to move in the New Year to the Gate, treading in the footsteps of Stephen Daldry. The theatre is currently full of animation under the sorcerer's touch of Hayley Carmichael, who makes her directorial debut with an adaptation of a South American fairy tale. Anyone who has ever felt even faintly stirred by the idea of magic realism should see <strong> Shoot Me In The Heart</strong> . </p> <p>You don't go for the plot, which is tousled by whimsicality: you go to see a carnival. Its story - of a young woman who, never growing beyond the size of a small girl, is surrounded by harpy malice but rescued by romance - is a lava flow of red-hot images. </p> <p>Unexpected perspectives, both physical and emotional, are apparent from the opening moments. Naomi Wilkinson's beautiful design - a scarlet box made up of louvred doors - springs apart to display the heroine, radiantly played by Lisa Hammond, at a child's party surrounded by adults dressed as children.

Moments later the girl's mother stands in front of a book made out enormous red and white sheets, ripping out the pages on which are inscribed the tale of 'Thumbelina'. The mad dance induced by the bite of the tarantula is often mentioned: the play ends with lace curtains closing around the stage: they are striped with shadows like the huge jointed legs of a giant spider. </p> <p>The author of To the Green Fields Beyond , which I reviewed last week, was wrongly named as Nicholas Wright, instead of Nick Whitby.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I am a monarchist. There - I've said it. We need the royals. Whatever people might say about them being an inbred bunch of freeloading, self-promoting pillocks, one thing cannot be denied. They possess a combination of unmerited social standing and grotesque personal inadequacy without which our country would be a poorer place.</p> <p>Their goonishness is raised above the ordinary by their highness, their budding insanity blooms untroubled under the mysterious protection of their royalness. In short, they live their mad, mad lives without anyone ever saying to their face: 'Shut up and go away, you arse.' This is their power.</p> <p>I speak as one who has tasted this power, who has worn the amulet of royalty - albeit briefly - and enjoyed the blessed freedom to twerp that Fergie, Edward, William and the rest take for granted. I became, for two short weeks, Charles, the fourteenth Earl of Newmarket. With double-breasted suit, weak chin and equerry in tow, I went to Hollywood to see how far I could ride the royal ticket. One hell of a long way, as it turned out.</p> <p>The Channel 4 lawyers had given us strict instructions before we left: don't break anything, don't kill anything, and don't tell anyone that you're Prince Harry's real father. Typical bloody lawyers. Trying to take the fun out of everything. Bang went our plans to go whale-watching off the Californian coast and for me to whip out a shotgun and have a pop at a humpback. Still, we did manage to get a sword through customs. More of that later.</p> <p>As a programme, The Earl is a tribute to one particular and perhaps the finest of all the royal family's foibles: the shameless attempts of some of them to cash in on their status to forge media careers. In this arena, two names stand head and shoulders above the rest: Sarah Ferguson and Prince Edward.</p> <p>At heart, the Earl's character is the unholy amalgam of frenetic self-promotion and breathtaking talentlessness that makes Eddie and Fergie such extraordinary individuals. To this we added a smattering of other royal traits: rudeness, bigotry and an unshakeable absence of self-consciousness.</p> <p>Lord Newmarket shares as well Prince Edward's charming belief that Britain resents success. Edward's thesis, like the man himself, is simple: 'I am so successful in Britain that I'm not allowed to be successful.' So he hotfooted it to LA, where his success wouldn't be stifled.</p> <p>Like Edward before him, Newmarket found a willingness among Americans to give him the respect and deference owing to him. In an address to the assembled masses at a charity baseball game in Orange County - where he had the honour of throwing the first pitch (by far, incidentally, the most embarrassing moment of my already embarrassment-rich life) - he set out his stall: 'America is a wonderful place to be. America applauds success. America is a success. Not morally or economically, but spiritually...'</p> <p>Having so spoken, I turned to the pitcher's mound, wound up my weak left arm, and delivered the weediest throw in baseball history, which landed a good yard short of the catcher's feet. I acknowledged the bemused cheers of the crowd and hurried off to the lavatory where I clutched my head in shame.</p> <p>With my public profile growing, I set out to conquer Hollywood. 'Conquer' in the sense of behaving like a nut. A succession of studio bosses, producers, agents and publishers were subjected to a merciless barrage of thunderingly bad ideas. Like Buckingham 3000 - a sci-fi historical romance with a Windsor twist - or, as I put it in one meeting: ' Judge Dredd meets Crocodile Dundee .'</p> <p>There was no depth to which I wouldn't sink. The pitch for If Diana Had Lived was pretty low on the scale: 'We're looking currently at a script for a biopic about what would have happened if Diana hadn't died in that terrible tunnel.

      "bodyText": "I am a monarchist. There - I've said it. We need the royals. Whatever people might say about them being an inbred bunch of freeloading, self-promoting pillocks, one thing cannot be denied. They possess a combination of unmerited social standing and grotesque personal inadequacy without which our country would be a poorer place. Their goonishness is raised above the ordinary by their highness, their budding insanity blooms untroubled under the mysterious protection of their royalness. In short, they live their mad, mad lives without anyone ever saying to their face: 'Shut up and go away, you arse.' This is their power. I speak as one who has tasted this power, who has worn the amulet of royalty - albeit briefly - and enjoyed the blessed freedom to twerp that Fergie, Edward, William and the rest take for granted. I became, for two short weeks, Charles, the fourteenth Earl of Newmarket. With double-breasted suit, weak chin and equerry in tow, I went to Hollywood to see how far I could ride the royal ticket. One hell of a long way, as it turned out. The Channel 4 lawyers had given us strict instructions before we left: don't break anything, don't kill anything, and don't tell anyone that you're Prince Harry's real father. Typical bloody lawyers. Trying to take the fun out of everything. Bang went our plans to go whale-watching off the Californian coast and for me to whip out a shotgun and have a pop at a humpback. Still, we did manage to get a sword through customs. More of that later. As a programme, The Earl is a tribute to one particular and perhaps the finest of all the royal family's foibles: the shameless attempts of some of them to cash in on their status to forge media careers. In this arena, two names stand head and shoulders above the rest: Sarah Ferguson and Prince Edward. At heart, the Earl's character is the unholy amalgam of frenetic self-promotion and breathtaking talentlessness that makes Eddie and Fergie such extraordinary individuals. To this we added a smattering of other royal traits: rudeness, bigotry and an unshakeable absence of self-consciousness. Lord Newmarket shares as well Prince Edward's charming belief that Britain resents success. Edward's thesis, like the man himself, is simple: 'I am so successful in Britain that I'm not allowed to be successful.' So he hotfooted it to LA, where his success wouldn't be stifled. Like Edward before him, Newmarket found a willingness among Americans to give him the respect and deference owing to him. In an address to the assembled masses at a charity baseball game in Orange County - where he had the honour of throwing the first pitch (by far, incidentally, the most embarrassing moment of my already embarrassment-rich life) - he set out his stall: 'America is a wonderful place to be. America applauds success. America is a success. Not morally or economically, but spiritually...' Having so spoken, I turned to the pitcher's mound, wound up my weak left arm, and delivered the weediest throw in baseball history, which landed a good yard short of the catcher's feet. I acknowledged the bemused cheers of the crowd and hurried off to the lavatory where I clutched my head in shame. With my public profile growing, I set out to conquer Hollywood. 'Conquer' in the sense of behaving like a nut. A succession of studio bosses, producers, agents and publishers were subjected to a merciless barrage of thunderingly bad ideas. Like Buckingham 3000 - a sci-fi historical romance with a Windsor twist - or, as I put it in one meeting: ' Judge Dredd meets Crocodile Dundee .' There was no depth to which I wouldn't sink. The pitch for If Diana Had Lived was pretty low on the scale: 'We're looking currently at a script for a biopic about what would have happened if Diana hadn't died in that terrible tunnel. Would, for example, Prince William have turned out to be something other than an Austro-Hungarian goon?' Sadly, my subsequent speculations about the character of Prince Harry were banished, after some urgent words from the lawyers, to the cutting-room floor. Interest in If Diana Had Lived was heightened when I revealed that Princess Margaret was being lined up for a cameo role. 'I happen to know she's rather short of cash at the moment.' In lowered tones, I explained the reason: 'It's her feet...' My inside knowledge of Palace goings-on (and my Fergian willingness to share every last bit of it for financial gain) was one of the keynotes of the meetings. And the Hollywood players lapped it up. In fact, they lapped up almost everything I said. When I proposed a soft-core fictionalisation of the sex life of the Duchess of York, I had people reaching for the chequebook. It's appalling but it's true: if you're a royal, you can get away with anything in America. Never more did I know this to be the case than when I had David Waller, the associate dean of the National University, kneeling before me on a purple Marks &amp; Spencer cushion, with his assembled faculty members looking on - me tapping him on his head with a sword, he swearing eternal fealty to the throne. I smiled down at him: 'Arise, Sir Waller.' Never have I seen such awe in another human being's eyes. Such is the power of the royal family. God knows, I'm going to miss it.

It is a challenging period for new dancers trying to make their mark in the company. But they are getting their chances in a rich season - a programme of ballets dear to Dowell's heart which include Romeo and Juliet , Ondine , Shadowplay , The Dream , Triad and Song of the Earth . </p> <p>All these dancers have taken risks, made sacrifices, to join the Royal Ballet. Unlike the five men who left in a blaze of publicity two years ago to join Tetsuya Kumakawa's K-Ballet in Japan, these dancers believe that Covent Garden is the place to dance. Their enthusiasm is infectious, as is their optimism. </p> <p> <strong> TAMARA ROJO (Spanish, age 26)</strong> </p> <p> 'The repercussion in Spain of my joining the Royal Ballet was amazing. When I went home to Madrid in the summer, I was in the news - everybody wanted to have an interview.' Rojo, already a principal with the English National Ballet, had approached Dowell last year after dancing the Chosen One in ENB's production of MacMillan's Rite of Spring . 'It was a role that really had an effect on me, as a person, not only as a dancer. It showed me a new world of possibilities and I thought, \"I want more of this\".' </p> <p>Rojo's interpretation received rave reviews. She was a thing possessed, brave and vulnerable, her dark eyes burning like coals. She has always been remarkable. She joined Victor Ullate's ballet company in Madrid at the age of 16, dancing leading roles. She joined ENB in 1997, introduced by Derek Deane as a star in the making. In spite of a range of roles, she was beginning to feel restive by 1999 as the same ballets came round again. Then came the Rite of Spring revelation and the lure of dancing more MacMillan works if she moved to the Royal Ballet. 'I was on hold for a contract, then they called and asked if I could do Giselle at three weeks' notice. Yes, definitely I could.' </p> <p>Rojo made her unscheduled debut on the last night of the Royal Ballet's July season, replacing an injured Darcey Bussell. Rojo gave a compelling performance. 'This season is to discover each other,' she says diplomatically. 'I have no career plan. I just want to make each performance as near-perfect as possible.' </p> <p>She will be dancing Giselle again in April next year, as well as Romeo and Juliet . But first she follows Bussell in Swan Lake at the start of the new season, appearing in Shadowplay and Ondine before Christmas. </p> <p> <strong> JOHAN PERSSON (Swedish, age 29)</strong> </p> <p> After four years as a principal with the National Ballet of Canada, Persson decided to follow his Canadian girlfriend, Jamie Tapper, to the Royal Ballet. They had won the Erik Bruhn Prize together in 1995: 'But we don't insist on dancing with each other. We're not a package deal. Jamie came first, a year ago, and she loves it - so I was prepared to come even as a first soloist.' </p> <p>Bruce Sansom's departure from the Royal Ballet in July created a principal's vacancy, so Persson comes in at the top. He dances Swan Lake with Tamara Rojo on 25 October and will be doing leading roles in The Nutcracker , La Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e and Giselle. He's being tried out with a range of partners. 'I'm not quite tall enough for Darcey. But I'm considered tall for some of the roles I do, like Puck in The Dream and Alain in Fille .' He hopes to be coached by Dowell in roles that Dowell created. 'He's one of those people you look up to - that's why I want to be here.' </p> <p> <strong> EDWARD WATSON (English, age 25)</strong> </p> <p> Watson's most conspicuous role on the Opera House stage so far has been as the geeky redhead who blipped Sylvie Guillem over the head in The Concert . His next big chance comes in Shadowplay , the work that first brought the young Dowell to public attention. Watson, who started dancing because his twin sister did, has featured mostly in new works by his contemporaries - Cathy Marston, William Tuckett, Wayne McGregor. They have exploited his strange intensity and his hyper-suppleness. 'Yeah, I did hear a few gasps when I did Wayne's piece. It was a big challenge because it was so fast, with such extreme positions.' He partnered Deborah Bull in McGregor's Symbiont , another big challenge for him. 'I've learnt a lot about partnering in the last year, both with Debbie and rehearsing Serenade with Darcey. You don't drop somebody like that'. </p> <p> <strong> ALINA COJOCARU (Romanian, age 19)</strong> </p> <p> Very small and very young, she startled audiences last year by taking on one of Margot Fonteyn's iconic roles at five days' notice. Cojocaru had never seen Symphonic Variations when she stepped in for an injured dancer and won everyone's admiration. 'I didn't have time to realise... I just did it and I loved it,' she says shyly. </p> <p>Cojocaru wasn't quite plucked, unknown, from the corps de ballet . She trained in Kiev and was then at the Royal Ballet School, after winning a Prix de Lausanne scholarship in 1998. The Kiev Ballet invited her to join straight from school as a principal. 'I admired the Royal Ballet but I just had to dance big roles, given the chance.' She did, in Don Quixote , The Sleeping Beauty , The Nutcracker , Cinderella . Then she left after a year, to start again at the Royal Ballet. It was a hard decision to go from principal to low-ranking artist, but she was never going to get stuck in the corps . After her lucky break with Symphonic Variations , which she will dance again in December, she has been understudying Manon and Ondine ; she will make her debut as Giselle , with Johan Kobborg as Albrecht, in April. And she is longing to have a go at Juliet. All being well, Cojocaru is the Royal Ballet's next ballerina. </p> <p> <strong> IVAN PUTROV (Ukrainian, age 20)</strong> </p> <p> Putrov trained in Kiev and joined the Royal Ballet School after winning the gold medal in the 1996 Prix de Lausanne. He was offered a principal's contract with the Kiev Ballet, but turned it down to join the Royal Ballet as an artist. 'I decided I would respect myself more if I did it the hard way. I knew I would need more and more, which I might not get in Ukraine. I want contemporary as well as classical.' He's been frustrated, cast only as the young male lead in The Nutcracker last Christmas and this. But now he is sharing the role of the Shadowplay Boy with the Matted Hair with Edward Watson, and he is getting Benvolio in Romeo and Juliet . However, he may return to guest with the Kiev Ballet next year as the Royal Ballet is not yet offering him fully grown up roles. </p> <p>Putrov looks at the meteoric career of his friend from Kiev, Svetlana Zakharova, already a principal at 21 with the Kirov. 'Yes, I would like to dance with the Kirov. Yes, it could be possible. But I am happy here. You want Nirvana, like the boy in Shadowplay , but you'll never find perfection.' </p> <p> <strong> MARIANELA NU\u00f1EZ (Argentinian, age 18)</strong> </p> <p> Nu\u00f1ez joined Maximiliano Guerra's Argentine ballet company as a baby ballerina but was told she was too young to join the Royal Ballet at 15. 'They had a contract for me but I had to wait until I graduated from the Royal Ballet School at 16. So I went from leading roles to being back in school and then into the corps de ballet . But I knew it was the right thing for me. Even when things went slow in the company, I knew I had to be patient.' </p> <p>Nu\u00f1ez was promoted to first artist at the end of last season, after dancing in the White Nights Gala for the Kirov. 'It was the best night of my life. Dancing with Carlos Acosta was one of my dreams and I was surrounded by these Russian dancers I so admire. And then I was promoted as well!' </p> <p>Nu\u00f1ez is friends with Cojocaru and Putrov, as well as with the large number of Spanish speakers in the company. 'I bet all the girls say the same thing - we all want to do Juliet, Manon, Odette/Odile. We'll have to see what the new director wants. I have to pinch myself sometimes and say, \"You are here, in the same studio as Sylvie and Darcey\". It means so much to me.' </p> <p> Royal Ballet season starts 20 October.

      "body": "<p>In voting for your favourite No 1 records of all time, the rules stipulate that you can only vote for one record by a group or artist. This ensures that the list is not overrun by a plague of Beatles, or a camp of Queens, or a fishnet of Madonnas. Or indeed a drip of Westlifes. Westlife have had six number ones inside a couple of years, and so you might imagine that the carefully chosen experts on Channel 4's selection panel, including angry middle aged ex-punk me, might have spent many hours deciding which Westlife to include.</p> <p>If you're over nine, you'll be pleased to hear that there is no Westlife song in the selection. It's as difficult to think of the name of a Westlife song as it is to think of the name of a Westlife boy. Perhaps they're all called Boy - the songs and the members. Thanks to Westlife's best and worst efforts, a No 1 single isn't quite as rare a thing as it was up until a few years ago. In the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties, the veritable pits of current pop nostalgia, the list decades of the moment, there were usually about 12 to 15 No 1s a year. This year, there will probably be about 30. Next year, possibly 52. In the good and bad old days, records took time to reach No 1. Sometimes there was a kind of struggle that made the No 1 somehow richer. Now record companies like to demonstrate their greased marketing muscle and the instant impact their acts are having on a spoilt youth consciousness by heaving their singles straight in at No 1, where mostly they shine anonymously for a week or so before drifting off.</p> <p>But even now that No 1 singles are as common as muck, and you can have half a dozen and make minimal impact on the mass popular imagination, the No 1 pop single remains a special thing. The aura of magic, tragedy, novelty and glamour that has accumulated over 40 years has not been rubbed away, not even by the fact that a single isn't quite what it was but a multi-formatted marketing echo of the idea of a single. The marvellousness of the No 1 pop single hasn't yet been undermined by all the business interference that goes on as to what a single is about or for. It's still all about the potential madness of the moment collected in a commercial song that you love or hate and that reminds you of who you are, and who you were.</p> <p>The enduring specialness of the No 1 and how it relates to the individual and collective memory, the way that No 1s over the years somehow communicate the strange extremes of pop, and tell a story about the history of fashion, means that I was happy to do something I normally don't like doing, which is to become part of a panel choosing a list. I'm reluctant to do this kind of thing because I get anxious, I take it far too seriously, and panic when things don't go my way. As soon as I accepted the task of helping Channel 4 come up with a selection of No 1s for people to base their votes on, I became a zealot, determined to rid the list of the 'Lady In Reds' and 'Mull Of Kintyres'. The thought of Berlin's 'You Take My Breath Away' making the list upset me dearly, and I knew that I was quite capable of making such exceptional points about why 'Sugar Sugar' by The Archies or Buck Fizz's ' 'Making Your Mind Up' were to be included that it might lead to me being led away by men in white jackets. I could write a book on why Sonny and Cher's 'I Got You Babe' is more of a No 1 than, say, The Eurythmics' 'There Must Be An Angel'.</p> <p>My kind of No 1 is a great thinking blast of non epic non-soppy, non-pretty-pretty pop that at the very moment of being No 1 seems to celebrate that it is No 1. My kind of No 1 is a dramatic blend of obviousness and surprise that takes all pop forward a little bit, or at least sidewards. I prefer the silly No 1, whether 'In The Year 2525' or Cher's 'I Believe', to the drawn out thickly sentimental trips of triteness of Whitney Houston, Wet Wet Wet and Bryan Adams. The length these songs stay at No 1 suggest that a nation doesn't so much fall in love with their grace and insight as get hypnotised by their creepy-crawly insistence.</p> <p>Other panellists had their quirks too. The venerable Paul Gambaccini, appalled at my frivolous and rather desperately trendy determination to have the Chemical Brothers 'Setting Sun' included over Spandau Ballet's gluey 'True', was adamant that no song from the past five years should be included. He figured, taking it all even more seriously than me, that it takes time for greatness, or iconic badness, to form, for the essential temporariness of pop to become inessentially permanent. Other panellists were alarmed that it would look foolish to ignore the obvious pop classicism of Britney, The Prodigy and Fatboy. And even though Norman Cook added a seaside fish and chip beat to the aromatic delicacy of Cornershop's 'Brimful Of Asha' to help it to No 1, it's one of the deftest songs to ever get there, along with The Pretenders' 'Brass In Pocket,' and it had to be included. Gambaccini was overruled. (It should be said that, this being the civilised twenty-first century, we didn't meet in a smoke filled room. We deliberated via email. The storming outs were done at the touch of a button. The sulking was all cyber.) Personally, I would have gone up to last year, and would have preferred to have seen Mud's 'Tiger Feet' in the list rather than Spiller's 'Groovejet' (written by Mud's guitarist.)</p> <p>The compromises forced upon you are what makes doing such a thing so painful. It becomes a matter of personal taste versus cultural inevitability. I knew that against all my principles something by Take That was going to be included, and however sensitive I felt about it there was just no room for Creedence Clearwater Revival, ABC or KLF. But there is pleasure in winning a few battles. A list without Kraftwerk is to me as absurd as a list without The Beatles or Presley. The fact that someone as intense and dangerous as Hendrix had a No 1 demonstrates some of the changing wonders of the No 1, and he just had to be included. I felt I was being very professional at suggesting 'If You Tolerate This' by the Manic Street Preachers despite feeling the song is more Bryan Adams than Sex Pistols, and that I was being acceptably emotional in using virtual tears to force in New Order's 'World in Motion' and maturely nostalgic in pointing out the absolute necessity of including the love of my early teens, T.Rex.

      "bodyText": "In voting for your favourite No 1 records of all time, the rules stipulate that you can only vote for one record by a group or artist. This ensures that the list is not overrun by a plague of Beatles, or a camp of Queens, or a fishnet of Madonnas. Or indeed a drip of Westlifes. Westlife have had six number ones inside a couple of years, and so you might imagine that the carefully chosen experts on Channel 4's selection panel, including angry middle aged ex-punk me, might have spent many hours deciding which Westlife to include. If you're over nine, you'll be pleased to hear that there is no Westlife song in the selection. It's as difficult to think of the name of a Westlife song as it is to think of the name of a Westlife boy. Perhaps they're all called Boy - the songs and the members. Thanks to Westlife's best and worst efforts, a No 1 single isn't quite as rare a thing as it was up until a few years ago. In the Sixties, Seventies and Eighties, the veritable pits of current pop nostalgia, the list decades of the moment, there were usually about 12 to 15 No 1s a year. This year, there will probably be about 30. Next year, possibly 52. In the good and bad old days, records took time to reach No 1. Sometimes there was a kind of struggle that made the No 1 somehow richer. Now record companies like to demonstrate their greased marketing muscle and the instant impact their acts are having on a spoilt youth consciousness by heaving their singles straight in at No 1, where mostly they shine anonymously for a week or so before drifting off. But even now that No 1 singles are as common as muck, and you can have half a dozen and make minimal impact on the mass popular imagination, the No 1 pop single remains a special thing. The aura of magic, tragedy, novelty and glamour that has accumulated over 40 years has not been rubbed away, not even by the fact that a single isn't quite what it was but a multi-formatted marketing echo of the idea of a single. The marvellousness of the No 1 pop single hasn't yet been undermined by all the business interference that goes on as to what a single is about or for. It's still all about the potential madness of the moment collected in a commercial song that you love or hate and that reminds you of who you are, and who you were. The enduring specialness of the No 1 and how it relates to the individual and collective memory, the way that No 1s over the years somehow communicate the strange extremes of pop, and tell a story about the history of fashion, means that I was happy to do something I normally don't like doing, which is to become part of a panel choosing a list. I'm reluctant to do this kind of thing because I get anxious, I take it far too seriously, and panic when things don't go my way. As soon as I accepted the task of helping Channel 4 come up with a selection of No 1s for people to base their votes on, I became a zealot, determined to rid the list of the 'Lady In Reds' and 'Mull Of Kintyres'. The thought of Berlin's 'You Take My Breath Away' making the list upset me dearly, and I knew that I was quite capable of making such exceptional points about why 'Sugar Sugar' by The Archies or Buck Fizz's ' 'Making Your Mind Up' were to be included that it might lead to me being led away by men in white jackets. I could write a book on why Sonny and Cher's 'I Got You Babe' is more of a No 1 than, say, The Eurythmics' 'There Must Be An Angel'. My kind of No 1 is a great thinking blast of non epic non-soppy, non-pretty-pretty pop that at the very moment of being No 1 seems to celebrate that it is No 1. My kind of No 1 is a dramatic blend of obviousness and surprise that takes all pop forward a little bit, or at least sidewards. I prefer the silly No 1, whether 'In The Year 2525' or Cher's 'I Believe', to the drawn out thickly sentimental trips of triteness of Whitney Houston, Wet Wet Wet and Bryan Adams. The length these songs stay at No 1 suggest that a nation doesn't so much fall in love with their grace and insight as get hypnotised by their creepy-crawly insistence. Other panellists had their quirks too. The venerable Paul Gambaccini, appalled at my frivolous and rather desperately trendy determination to have the Chemical Brothers 'Setting Sun' included over Spandau Ballet's gluey 'True', was adamant that no song from the past five years should be included. He figured, taking it all even more seriously than me, that it takes time for greatness, or iconic badness, to form, for the essential temporariness of pop to become inessentially permanent. Other panellists were alarmed that it would look foolish to ignore the obvious pop classicism of Britney, The Prodigy and Fatboy. And even though Norman Cook added a seaside fish and chip beat to the aromatic delicacy of Cornershop's 'Brimful Of Asha' to help it to No 1, it's one of the deftest songs to ever get there, along with The Pretenders' 'Brass In Pocket,' and it had to be included. Gambaccini was overruled. (It should be said that, this being the civilised twenty-first century, we didn't meet in a smoke filled room. We deliberated via email. The storming outs were done at the touch of a button. The sulking was all cyber.) Personally, I would have gone up to last year, and would have preferred to have seen Mud's 'Tiger Feet' in the list rather than Spiller's 'Groovejet' (written by Mud's guitarist.) The compromises forced upon you are what makes doing such a thing so painful. It becomes a matter of personal taste versus cultural inevitability. I knew that against all my principles something by Take That was going to be included, and however sensitive I felt about it there was just no room for Creedence Clearwater Revival, ABC or KLF. But there is pleasure in winning a few battles. A list without Kraftwerk is to me as absurd as a list without The Beatles or Presley. The fact that someone as intense and dangerous as Hendrix had a No 1 demonstrates some of the changing wonders of the No 1, and he just had to be included. I felt I was being very professional at suggesting 'If You Tolerate This' by the Manic Street Preachers despite feeling the song is more Bryan Adams than Sex Pistols, and that I was being acceptably emotional in using virtual tears to force in New Order's 'World in Motion' and maturely nostalgic in pointing out the absolute necessity of including the love of my early teens, T.Rex. (It was immaturely nostalgic of me to expect McGuinness Flint's 'When I'm Dead And Gone' to be included over above, say, 'Bridge Over Troubled Water', and probably verging on the hysterical for me to demand Adamski's 'Killer' over say Oasis. It was also stupid of me to try and marshall support for Edwyn Collins's 'Never Met A Girl Like You Before' as it never actually got to No 1, one of those that got away, like Pulp's 'Common People, and Robbie's sobby, psychosickly 'Angels'.')

Not that I want to influence your voting or anything, but I did pledge to the panel that if it tops the favourites but not the least favourites then I will sing the song live on Richard and Judy's This Morning wearing nothing but a revolving bow tie and a stick-on Freddie Mercury moustache. And if you're looking for your favourite in this list, for The Who, or Meatloaf, or All Saints, or indeed Westlife, all I can say is, don't blame the panel. Blame 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.

      "body": "<p>I took early retirement last June and, as my annual season ticket ran to 5 December, I wanted a refund from Connex South Central. I was due for \u00a3979, which they said would be paid to my bank account, through my debit card, on 5 July. Despite innumerable phone calls, this still has not been paid. Other than taking the firm to court, what can I do?<strong><br>MC, Seaford </strong> </p> <p>This should have been a straightforward case to sort out. But no. First, Connex said its records showed you had been paid on 5 July. </p> <p>When it was proved that you had not, it claimed the delays were caused by Barclays Merchant Services which runs the electronic plastic-card business. Barclays countered that Connex was at fault for processing your refund on an inactive terminal. Barclays had disabled it because Connex had fewer transactions going through that one outlet than agreed in the contract. </p> <p>No, not our fault, said Connex: we went on using the terminal because Barclays failed to tell us it had shut it down. </p> <p>Well yes, we were a bit slow, admitted Barclays, and we had to go through Connex's intermediary company which added to the delay. Nine other refunds have also been held up. </p> <p>You should by now have \u00a3979 in your bank account but I feel you are entitled to compensation for the cost of the delay. </p> <p>Neither Barclays nor Connex agreed immediately, but said they would discuss it. Write to them both and ask. </p> <p><strong> Seeing double over TV cover</strong></p> <p>I bought a television set from Powerhouse on a 12-month 'buy now, pay later' deal that included extended warranty insurance for \u00a3244. Between signing and the payment date, I bought insurance for all my electrical equipment, so I contacted the store and the lender, GE Capital Bank, and was told I could cancel my original deal. I paid for the TV in June 1997 and visited the store to confirm what I had done. </p> <p>A year later, I noticed a direct debit of \u00a377 from my bank. GE Capital Bank took it for the insurance cover under a mandate signed two years earlier. It said that, because I had not paid the \u00a3244, I now owed \u00a3750, including interest on the sum I had already paid. I did not feel up to making a fight of it then but, after reading a similar case in Money Writes, I wonder if I could now.<br><strong> PH, Birmingham </strong> </p> <p>GE Capital initially refused to refund the money, saying your situation was not the same as the other reader's. The only difference I could see was that you had already paid up. </p> <p>When asked for an explanation, GE deliberated for several weeks before agreeing you had done all you could. It now has systems in place that alert staff when borrowers repay all but a small amount of an interest-free deal, and says it will not penalise you for being hit by the old procedure. It is refunding the insurance premium and interest you paid. </p> <p><strong> Please Minister, give us windfalls</strong><br> </p> <p>Thousands of NHS staff have subscribed to Equitable Life additional voluntary contributions for their pensions, but apparently the scheme is invested in a single account in the name of the Health Secretary. How can we protect our interests?<br><strong>AS, Wigan </strong></p> <p>Exactly what happens depends on Equitable Life's new owner, whoever that turns out to be, and whether the insurer demutualises. But you can be fairly relaxed. Civil Service employees were in the same situation when Lloyds TSB bought their AVC manager, Scottish Widows. There too the Secretary of State held the policy but the windfall was spread among the AVC holders. </p> <p>The NHS Pensions Agency says the principle of including members in any windfall 'would be respected where practicable'. Equitable Life says it too wants individual policyholders to receive the money. </p> <p>The National Association of Pension Funds points out that all Equitable Life's AVC holders face the same problem and it has already had meetings with the company to see they are treated fairly. </p> <p><strong> Who will handle my son's cash?</strong></p> <p>I am a single parent with a court order for maintenance payments for my 15- year-old son, arranged in 1991. I receive \u00a3129 a month, plus \u00a330 recently agreed voluntarily. I understood, when the Child Support Agency was established in 1993, that it would take over all agreements arranged through the courts. Is this still the plan?<br><strong>JS, Haddington</strong></p> <p>The original idea was that the courts would cease to have jurisdiction, and all applications to vary court orders would be made to the CSA, although this has not happened in practice. </p> <p>But under new legislation, from 2002 the CSA alone will have jurisdiction to determine child maintenance. It is believed that, for existing court orders, jurisdiction will remain with the courts for one year after the new law takes effect. Then it, too, will go to the CSA alone. </p> <p><strong> Leaving on a jet plane, \u00a3750 light</strong></p> <p>I took out Barclaycard travel insurance a couple of days before flying to Canada to visit my elderly father, but did not receive the policy document before I left. I misread my return date. I should have checked in at 10pm on 7 July for a flight at 1am, but I had it fixed in my mind that I was flying back on 8 July and missed the plane. </p> <p>When I realised my error, I called the emergency number and was advised to find the cheapest flight out.

      "bodyText": "I took early retirement last June and, as my annual season ticket ran to 5 December, I wanted a refund from Connex South Central. I was due for \u00a3979, which they said would be paid to my bank account, through my debit card, on 5 July. Despite innumerable phone calls, this still has not been paid. Other than taking the firm to court, what can I do? MC, Seaford This should have been a straightforward case to sort out. But no. First, Connex said its records showed you had been paid on 5 July. When it was proved that you had not, it claimed the delays were caused by Barclays Merchant Services which runs the electronic plastic-card business. Barclays countered that Connex was at fault for processing your refund on an inactive terminal. Barclays had disabled it because Connex had fewer transactions going through that one outlet than agreed in the contract. No, not our fault, said Connex: we went on using the terminal because Barclays failed to tell us it had shut it down. Well yes, we were a bit slow, admitted Barclays, and we had to go through Connex's intermediary company which added to the delay. Nine other refunds have also been held up. You should by now have \u00a3979 in your bank account but I feel you are entitled to compensation for the cost of the delay. Neither Barclays nor Connex agreed immediately, but said they would discuss it. Write to them both and ask. Seeing double over TV cover I bought a television set from Powerhouse on a 12-month 'buy now, pay later' deal that included extended warranty insurance for \u00a3244. Between signing and the payment date, I bought insurance for all my electrical equipment, so I contacted the store and the lender, GE Capital Bank, and was told I could cancel my original deal. I paid for the TV in June 1997 and visited the store to confirm what I had done. A year later, I noticed a direct debit of \u00a377 from my bank. GE Capital Bank took it for the insurance cover under a mandate signed two years earlier. It said that, because I had not paid the \u00a3244, I now owed \u00a3750, including interest on the sum I had already paid. I did not feel up to making a fight of it then but, after reading a similar case in Money Writes, I wonder if I could now. PH, Birmingham GE Capital initially refused to refund the money, saying your situation was not the same as the other reader's. The only difference I could see was that you had already paid up. When asked for an explanation, GE deliberated for several weeks before agreeing you had done all you could. It now has systems in place that alert staff when borrowers repay all but a small amount of an interest-free deal, and says it will not penalise you for being hit by the old procedure. It is refunding the insurance premium and interest you paid. Please Minister, give us windfalls Thousands of NHS staff have subscribed to Equitable Life additional voluntary contributions for their pensions, but apparently the scheme is invested in a single account in the name of the Health Secretary. How can we protect our interests? AS, Wigan Exactly what happens depends on Equitable Life's new owner, whoever that turns out to be, and whether the insurer demutualises. But you can be fairly relaxed. Civil Service employees were in the same situation when Lloyds TSB bought their AVC manager, Scottish Widows. There too the Secretary of State held the policy but the windfall was spread among the AVC holders. The NHS Pensions Agency says the principle of including members in any windfall 'would be respected where practicable'. Equitable Life says it too wants individual policyholders to receive the money. The National Association of Pension Funds points out that all Equitable Life's AVC holders face the same problem and it has already had meetings with the company to see they are treated fairly. Who will handle my son's cash? I am a single parent with a court order for maintenance payments for my 15- year-old son, arranged in 1991. I receive \u00a3129 a month, plus \u00a330 recently agreed voluntarily. I understood, when the Child Support Agency was established in 1993, that it would take over all agreements arranged through the courts. Is this still the plan? JS, Haddington The original idea was that the courts would cease to have jurisdiction, and all applications to vary court orders would be made to the CSA, although this has not happened in practice. But under new legislation, from 2002 the CSA alone will have jurisdiction to determine child maintenance. It is believed that, for existing court orders, jurisdiction will remain with the courts for one year after the new law takes effect. Then it, too, will go to the CSA alone. Leaving on a jet plane, \u00a3750 light I took out Barclaycard travel insurance a couple of days before flying to Canada to visit my elderly father, but did not receive the policy document before I left. I misread my return date. I should have checked in at 10pm on 7 July for a flight at 1am, but I had it fixed in my mind that I was flying back on 8 July and missed the plane. When I realised my error, I called the emergency number and was advised to find the cheapest flight out. I paid \u00a3750, more than twice the cost of my original return ticket. Barclaycard has refused my claim, saying my policy does not cover these circumstances. If I had been told this by the Canadian representative, I would have sought a much cheaper, if more complicated, way home. UN, Southall Travel insurance will pay for extra flights only if you had missed the original through circumstances beyond your control. The person you spoke to was probably trying to be helpful and sympathetic, but was not in a position to say your money would be refunded. Sadly, you have no case.

Policyholders who don't show their support in this way, whatever they truly think of the proposals, will get nothing - at least in the short-term. </p> <p>Axa's proposals are highly controversial, bringing accu sations of unfairness and manipulation from the Consumers' Association (CA) and from lawyers. The association believes policyholders are being shortchanged in order to pass on a large chunk of the \u00a31.7 billion orphan assets to shareholders. </p> <p>In the past, orphan assets - unclaimed policy funds - have traditionally been split on a 90:10 basis between policyholders and shareholders. But CA calcula tions, produced by accountant KPMG, suggest that policyholders stand to get as little as 35 per cent in the Axa scheme. </p> <p>Policyholders must return their paperwork to Axa by 16 October to be included in the ballot. But there is a sting in the tail: the paperwork only allows policyholders to support the proposal. Anyone who wants to show their dissent only has the option of not sending back the form. </p> <p>As of last week, about 350,000 policyholders - out of a total of 750,000 - had yet to send in the forms. The February payments will aver age \u00a3400 per policyholder, and some will be as much as \u00a31,000. The CA will hope to see its concerns aired in a High Court hearing on 20 November. Arrangements of this kind - occurring as the result of the merger of Axa and Sun Life's with-profits funds - always need court approval. </p> <p>The CA is also concerned that the balloting procedure has been unfair. Its spokesman Ashley Holmes is unhappy with the way that Axa has announced that more than 51 per cent of policyholders have already sent in their papers. He says: 'This is rotten. It will clearly influence people who haven't already voted.' </p> <p>Electoral Reform Services, a subsidiary of the Electoral Reform Society, which is overseeing the ballot, says it is happy with Axa's plan to stop payments to those who do not send in their forms.</p> <p><strong>\u00a32 billion opportunity goes begging </strong></p> <p>Pensions lawyer Robin Ellison of Eversheds is calling on insurers, the Government and other bodies who sometimes end up with orphan funds to ask people building up their pensions or life assurance to sign a form donating all such funds to charity. </p> <p>Many people pay into their funds - whether through National Insurance or through contributions into actual pensions and life policies - and then never claim on the money they have built up.</p> <p>Ellison estimates orphan funds worth \u00a32 billion a year would be given to charities if a new charitable scheme of this kind happened. It would also avoid the type of row that is engulfing the Axa scheme.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With-profits policyholders in Axa Sun Life could lose out on a cash payment of about \u00a3400 unless within the next week they return papers to the insurer supporting Axa's proposals on distributing its 'orphan assets'. Policyholders who don't show their support in this way, whatever they truly think of the proposals, will get nothing - at least in the short-term. Axa's proposals are highly controversial, bringing accu sations of unfairness and manipulation from the Consumers' Association (CA) and from lawyers. The association believes policyholders are being shortchanged in order to pass on a large chunk of the \u00a31.7 billion orphan assets to shareholders. In the past, orphan assets - unclaimed policy funds - have traditionally been split on a 90:10 basis between policyholders and shareholders. But CA calcula tions, produced by accountant KPMG, suggest that policyholders stand to get as little as 35 per cent in the Axa scheme. Policyholders must return their paperwork to Axa by 16 October to be included in the ballot. But there is a sting in the tail: the paperwork only allows policyholders to support the proposal. Anyone who wants to show their dissent only has the option of not sending back the form. As of last week, about 350,000 policyholders - out of a total of 750,000 - had yet to send in the forms. The February payments will aver age \u00a3400 per policyholder, and some will be as much as \u00a31,000. The CA will hope to see its concerns aired in a High Court hearing on 20 November. Arrangements of this kind - occurring as the result of the merger of Axa and Sun Life's with-profits funds - always need court approval. The CA is also concerned that the balloting procedure has been unfair. Its spokesman Ashley Holmes is unhappy with the way that Axa has announced that more than 51 per cent of policyholders have already sent in their papers. He says: 'This is rotten. It will clearly influence people who haven't already voted.' Electoral Reform Services, a subsidiary of the Electoral Reform Society, which is overseeing the ballot, says it is happy with Axa's plan to stop payments to those who do not send in their forms. \u00a32 billion opportunity goes begging Pensions lawyer Robin Ellison of Eversheds is calling on insurers, the Government and other bodies who sometimes end up with orphan funds to ask people building up their pensions or life assurance to sign a form donating all such funds to charity. Many people pay into their funds - whether through National Insurance or through contributions into actual pensions and life policies - and then never claim on the money they have built up. Ellison estimates orphan funds worth \u00a32 billion a year would be given to charities if a new charitable scheme of this kind happened. It would also avoid the type of row that is engulfing the Axa scheme.",

      "body": "<p>Thousands of people have been unknowingly breaking Isa investment rules and evading tax for the last 18 months. </p> <p>Individual Savings Accounts have been very successful since their introduction in April 1999, attracting investments worth \u00a328bn in their first year alone, around a third more than the sum put into Peps and Tessas in their last and most popular year on sale . </p> <p>Richard Wastcoat, managing director of Fidelity Investment Services, one of the largest Isa providers, attributes the Isa's success to the fact that it is a uniform scheme. He says: 'With Isas there is just one message to get across to savers, rather than two as with Peps and Tessas. This helps create greater awareness and it makes it easier to educate people.' </p> <p>But while the concept of Isas may be easier to grasp, the complexity of the investment rules has proved more difficult for many people. In particular, confusion has arisen from the fact that savers have had to decide between spreading their \u00a37,000 investment allowance between up to three so-called 'mini' Isas or keeping it within one 'maxi'. Soon after Isas were intro duced, the PEP &amp; Isa Managers Association (PIMA) warned that there was growing anecdotal evidence that savers did not appreciate the difference between mini and maxi accounts and were inadvertently taking out multiple Isas without realising they had broken the rules. </p> <p>Peter Shipp, PIMA technical director, says: 'It was not always the public's fault. During the first six months of Isas, there were plenty of reports of savers being given the wrong information, particularly on the high street.' </p> <p>However, the Government was reluctant to admit there was a problem until it had hard evidence from the examination of managers' first-year records. These are now in the Inland Revenue's hands, but, according to a spokeswoman, a significant number of managers did not meet the deadline of 1 June, so the process of checking for multiple Isas has been delayed. </p> <p>'If a problem is discovered, the matter will have to go to a Minister for comment,' she says. </p> <p>In theory, if it is discovered that someone has taken out both a mini and maxi in the same tax year, they will have the second one they opened voided and any tax relief they have received will be clawed back. However, PIMA believes savers who have made a genuine mistake and have not exceeded the \u00a37,000 Isa limit should not be penalised. Whether the Government will scrap the distinction for the future remains to be seen. </p> <p>PIMA's Shipp says: 'We have always questioned the need for minis and maxis.' However, Fidelity's Wastcoat does not want to see a single limit. He thinks his company's business might suffer. He argues: 'It would hand the Isa market to the banks. They would encourage savers to put the whole \u00a37,000 into cash instead of investing in shares for the long term.' </p> <p>Whatever their other complications, the Government clearly felt it could help make Isas more understandable through the introduction of Cat standards. These were a different set of terms and conditions for each Isa component which focused on three aspects - fair Charges, easy Access and decent Terms.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of people have been unknowingly breaking Isa investment rules and evading tax for the last 18 months. Individual Savings Accounts have been very successful since their introduction in April 1999, attracting investments worth \u00a328bn in their first year alone, around a third more than the sum put into Peps and Tessas in their last and most popular year on sale . Richard Wastcoat, managing director of Fidelity Investment Services, one of the largest Isa providers, attributes the Isa's success to the fact that it is a uniform scheme. He says: 'With Isas there is just one message to get across to savers, rather than two as with Peps and Tessas. This helps create greater awareness and it makes it easier to educate people.' But while the concept of Isas may be easier to grasp, the complexity of the investment rules has proved more difficult for many people. In particular, confusion has arisen from the fact that savers have had to decide between spreading their \u00a37,000 investment allowance between up to three so-called 'mini' Isas or keeping it within one 'maxi'. Soon after Isas were intro duced, the PEP &amp; Isa Managers Association (PIMA) warned that there was growing anecdotal evidence that savers did not appreciate the difference between mini and maxi accounts and were inadvertently taking out multiple Isas without realising they had broken the rules. Peter Shipp, PIMA technical director, says: 'It was not always the public's fault. During the first six months of Isas, there were plenty of reports of savers being given the wrong information, particularly on the high street.' However, the Government was reluctant to admit there was a problem until it had hard evidence from the examination of managers' first-year records. These are now in the Inland Revenue's hands, but, according to a spokeswoman, a significant number of managers did not meet the deadline of 1 June, so the process of checking for multiple Isas has been delayed. 'If a problem is discovered, the matter will have to go to a Minister for comment,' she says. In theory, if it is discovered that someone has taken out both a mini and maxi in the same tax year, they will have the second one they opened voided and any tax relief they have received will be clawed back. However, PIMA believes savers who have made a genuine mistake and have not exceeded the \u00a37,000 Isa limit should not be penalised. Whether the Government will scrap the distinction for the future remains to be seen. PIMA's Shipp says: 'We have always questioned the need for minis and maxis.' However, Fidelity's Wastcoat does not want to see a single limit. He thinks his company's business might suffer. He argues: 'It would hand the Isa market to the banks. They would encourage savers to put the whole \u00a37,000 into cash instead of investing in shares for the long term.' Whatever their other complications, the Government clearly felt it could help make Isas more understandable through the introduction of Cat standards. These were a different set of terms and conditions for each Isa component which focused on three aspects - fair Charges, easy Access and decent Terms. Cat standard cash Isas, for example, have to allow withdrawals within seven days and pay interest no lower than 2 per cent below base rate. Cat standard unit trust Isas must have an annual charge of no more than 1 per cent. However, Cat standards were voluntary and there was no rush among Isa providers to take them up. Currently only 53 out of 136 mini cash Isas listed by the Moneyfacts research organisation are Cat standard, only 20 out of 95 unit trust Isa managers offer them and just one out of 32 investment trust Isa providers. At one of the refuseniks Aberdeen Asset Managers, sales and marketing manager Richard Wilson explains: 'We are not in favour of Cat standards because we feel investors may see them as a quality endorsement when all they are really doing is flagging up that a fund is cheap.' However, not everyone is dismissive of Cat standards. At the Halifax, which offers a Cat standard mini-cash Isa and claims to have a 30 per cent share of the cash account market, Nigel Payne, head of savings, believes it has helped to give savers confidence. 'It's difficult to quantify the effect it has had on our business but I'm sure that it has been a reassuring feature for some of our savers,' says Payne. 'It's a bit like the kitemark you get on furniture and so on. Even if you don't know what it means, you feel better about buying it because you know the product conforms to a minimum standard.'",

      "body": "<p>If you have ever felt that you would like to murder a solicitor, you are not alone. Half of the people who say they had problems in house buying or selling say the cause was due to 'delays by solicitors', according to research conducted by law firm HammondsDirect. </p> <p>But help is at hand. Hammonds recently launched an e-conveyancing service which, it says, will deliver a much quicker and more efficient service. </p> <p>The firm, which has been involved in e-conveyancing for the Halifax and other lenders for nearly three years, estimates that it cuts the length of the process from 12 to eight weeks. </p> <p>Other firms are likely to follow suit. The Society for Licensed Conveyancers has agreed to provide e-conveyancing for the homebuying site <a href=\"http://www.easier.com\">www.easier.com</a>. </p> <p>E-loan, the online mortgage quotation and arrangement site, also wants to set up an e-conveyancing capability. 'In theory, searches could be done instantly,' says product development director Frank Eve. 'Buying a house is very stressful - but it becomes less stressful if you know what is happening. Under the current system, what tends to happen is that people ring their solicitors to find out, but have difficulty getting a reply. Solicitors tend to be busy people. And if you don't know what is happening on the transaction, you tend to fill the vacuum with negative thoughts.' </p> <p>On the Hammonds Direct site, legalmove.com, clients can access their case file 24 hours a day on a secure part of the site. They can read all the relevant documents as they are created or as they arrive - the contract agreement, the leasehold or the fixtures and fittings list, for example. They can also see whether the searches have been applied for and what responses were received. </p> <p>Hammonds Direct has not, however, set out to be the cheapest player in the business. Its fees for most properties will be between \u00a3299 and \u00a3499, depending on the purchase price. </p> <p>Lucci Dammone, who has masterminded legalmove.com, says the emphasis is more on providing an efficient, transparent service than on shaving the fees to the minimum. 'The conveyancing service is ideally suited to using the internet,' he says. </p> <p>If local authorities also went online, searches could be done in a matter of seconds, rather than the fortnight that it often takes now.

      "bodyText": "If you have ever felt that you would like to murder a solicitor, you are not alone. Half of the people who say they had problems in house buying or selling say the cause was due to 'delays by solicitors', according to research conducted by law firm HammondsDirect. But help is at hand. Hammonds recently launched an e-conveyancing service which, it says, will deliver a much quicker and more efficient service. The firm, which has been involved in e-conveyancing for the Halifax and other lenders for nearly three years, estimates that it cuts the length of the process from 12 to eight weeks. Other firms are likely to follow suit. The Society for Licensed Conveyancers has agreed to provide e-conveyancing for the homebuying site www.easier.com. E-loan, the online mortgage quotation and arrangement site, also wants to set up an e-conveyancing capability. 'In theory, searches could be done instantly,' says product development director Frank Eve. 'Buying a house is very stressful - but it becomes less stressful if you know what is happening. Under the current system, what tends to happen is that people ring their solicitors to find out, but have difficulty getting a reply. Solicitors tend to be busy people. And if you don't know what is happening on the transaction, you tend to fill the vacuum with negative thoughts.' On the Hammonds Direct site, legalmove.com, clients can access their case file 24 hours a day on a secure part of the site. They can read all the relevant documents as they are created or as they arrive - the contract agreement, the leasehold or the fixtures and fittings list, for example. They can also see whether the searches have been applied for and what responses were received. Hammonds Direct has not, however, set out to be the cheapest player in the business. Its fees for most properties will be between \u00a3299 and \u00a3499, depending on the purchase price. Lucci Dammone, who has masterminded legalmove.com, says the emphasis is more on providing an efficient, transparent service than on shaving the fees to the minimum. 'The conveyancing service is ideally suited to using the internet,' he says. If local authorities also went online, searches could be done in a matter of seconds, rather than the fortnight that it often takes now. But progress of this order will take a few years yet: only a quarter of local authorities are thought to have converted to an electronic system. And solicitors have been slow to embrace the new world of the web in this field. Many are worried that they could lose some of their profit margin if they switch from a labour-intensive service to one that makes more use of computers. But now that the first firms have started offering their services, however, other firms are more likely to feel the heat of competition. The service being developed by the Society for Licensed Conveyancers will also focus on service delivery rather than marketing itself on price. About 24 firms are planning to take part in the scheme.

For her students, getting to grips with all the exceptions that make up our mother tongue cannot be easy. For Lynne, it is pensions and investments that cause a headache. </p> <p>She is worried about the personal pension she took out with insurer Gan when she opted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps) in 1992. Gan was taken over by Windsor Life and recent bad press about the company's investment performance has made Lynne unhappy. </p> <p>'I wrote to the company expressing my concerns and got a letter back which admitted to the underperformance of some funds but assured me things would be OK in the long run,' says an unconvinced Lynne. 'I don't feel confident in the firm,' she says. </p> <p>Yet she finds herself in a dilemma because she feels she would lose out if she tried to transfer her pension fund elsewhere. </p> <p>Lynne would like to increase her contributions but does not want to do so if she is not going to get a good deal. She now puts aside just under \u00a370 a month, although she has saved more in the past. Her last statement from Windsor Life put the value of her voluntary contributions to her Personal Wealth Plan at \u00a316,448 and her Serps con tribution rebates at \u00a36,373. The plan's transfer value - the amount she would get if she switched - was only \u00a317,023. </p> <p>Her employer does not provide a scheme, although the school employs seven full-time staff and six or seven more working casually. Lynne knows 'stakeholder pensions are a possibility' but the school principal has not yet told staff his intentions about the new Government-backed scheme, which starts next April. </p> <p>She has recently been saving \u00a350 a month in an Egg account, and could afford to put aside around \u00a320 a month more. </p> <p>Is there anything better she could be doing with this money, she asks. So far she has \u00a33,000 in the Egg account and would like a better return. She has been considering switching to another high interest bank or building society account. </p> <p>Her mortgage concerns her too. Like many borrowers who feared a return to higher interest rates a few years ago, in 1997 she took out a five-year fixed-rate loan at 7.89 per cent. Ordinary mortgage rates declined, and she is still paying more than the current variable rate of 7.74 per cent charged by most large lenders. </p> <p>She has thought about remortgaging, but her bank, NatWest, said early redemption would cost her more than \u00a3900 in penalties, which appears to cancel out any advantage.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Amanda Davidson </strong></p> <p>Lynne has an old-style pension that locks you in and penalises you heavily for moving. There is unlikely to be anything that she can do about this.</p> <p>She is right that stakeholder pensions will be with us in about six months' time. Her firm will have to provide one of these pensions as there are more than five staff. It could be advantageous for Lynne to participate, particularly if her employer decides to contribute. She should keep up with any plans it may have before deciding what to do.</p> <p>Meanwhile, she could put the money into an individual savings account (Isa). This, while not giving her tax relief on contributions as a pension would, would enable her to benefit in future from a tax-free fund, from which she could draw a tax-free income. This has become a good alternative to pensions for basic-rate taxpayers such because annuity rates are so low.</p> <p>The savings in the Egg account could be transferred into a mini-cash Isa. Up to \u00a33,000 can be placed in these without any tax on the interest.</p> <p>Lynne could ask her lender, to waive the penalties, giving her a fresh deal. If that only locked her further into her current scheme or she fails to improve it, she should wait until 2002 and renegotiate.</p> <p>Finally, she should make sure that if she or her husband fell ill they could repay their mortgage. They need either health or critical-illness insurance. </p> <p>Amanda Davidson works for financial adviser Holden Meehan.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Steven Price</strong></p> <p>The \u00a33,000 Lynne has saved for emergencies should go into a tax-free mini- cash Isa. </p> <p>Remortgaging would bring exit and entry costs if a further fixed-rate loan was taken out. Lynne already puts the fees for leaving her current loan at more than \u00a3900. Arranging another five-year fixed loan would cost between \u00a3350 and \u00a3600, though this could be added to the new loan.</p> <p>There are some very competitive deals available, and she could benefit from remortgaging in the short to medium term. The Britannia and the Leeds &amp; Holbeck offer five-year fixed rates of 6.39 per cent and 6.44 per cent respectively. Yet it would take Lynne between 16 and 24 months to break even on the exit and entry costs. She should first ask NatWest to put the loan on more favourable terms for little or no penalty.</p> <p>Lynne could go on with her present pension until she knows what her employer will offer. She could check the costs of reinstating her contributions to the original level of \u00a3140 with Windsor Life. The initial charges may have been largely taken out, so the ongoing fees could be relatively cheap.</p> <p>Lynne should ask Windsor Life and a rival firm - of her own choice or her employer's in a year's time - how much she could expect at retirement if she did raise her contributions to the old level. Then she can consider her options in more detail.</p> <p>Steven Price works for financial adviser Towry Law. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

If that only locked her further into her current scheme or she fails to improve it, she should wait until 2002 and renegotiate. Finally, she should make sure that if she or her husband fell ill they could repay their mortgage. They need either health or critical-illness insurance. Amanda Davidson works for financial adviser Holden Meehan. Adviser 2: Steven Price The \u00a33,000 Lynne has saved for emergencies should go into a tax-free mini- cash Isa. Remortgaging would bring exit and entry costs if a further fixed-rate loan was taken out. Lynne already puts the fees for leaving her current loan at more than \u00a3900. Arranging another five-year fixed loan would cost between \u00a3350 and \u00a3600, though this could be added to the new loan. There are some very competitive deals available, and she could benefit from remortgaging in the short to medium term. The Britannia and the Leeds &amp; Holbeck offer five-year fixed rates of 6.39 per cent and 6.44 per cent respectively. Yet it would take Lynne between 16 and 24 months to break even on the exit and entry costs. She should first ask NatWest to put the loan on more favourable terms for little or no penalty. Lynne could go on with her present pension until she knows what her employer will offer. She could check the costs of reinstating her contributions to the original level of \u00a3140 with Windsor Life. The initial charges may have been largely taken out, so the ongoing fees could be relatively cheap. Lynne should ask Windsor Life and a rival firm - of her own choice or her employer's in a year's time - how much she could expect at retirement if she did raise her contributions to the old level. Then she can consider her options in more detail. Steven Price works for financial adviser Towry Law. Advice is for guidance only. \u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

Generally, the further from the centre you live the more you will get for your money. While \u00a3150,000 might buy you a dog kennel in Chelsea or South Kensington (if you are lucky), the same amount could buy you a two-bedroom house in Tooting. If you have to live in an expensive area because of work, ask local estate agents if there are pockets of housing that represent better value for money compared to their fashionable neighbours. Cash-strapped buyers usually look in the area immediately next to the one that they really want to live in, but can't afford. </p> <p>However, Yolande Barnes, head of research at agent FPD Savills, says that in a housing market that is on the turn (as London seems to be), this can be a dangerous ploy. She warns that property prices in the 'poor man's alternative' areas are much more volatile than those in consistently popular areas, and that people buying at the top of the market could soon find themselves sitting on a loss. </p> <p>However, if you are buying on a budget, you will have little choice. Instead of looking in: </p> <p>\u0095 Islington, former home of the Blairs, consider Stoke Newington, where \u00a3150,000 will buy you a two-bedroom flat in a mansion block; </p> <p>\u0095 Chiswick consider Brentford where \u00a3155,000 will buy you a two-bedroom house; </p> <p>\u0095 Clapham consider Tooting or Streatham, where \u00a3138,000 buys you a two-bedroom house; </p> <p>\u0095 Fulham, consider Putney, where \u00a3149,950 will buy you a three-bedroom split-level maisonette; </p> <p>\u0095 Blackheath, consider Catford, where \u00a3158,000 will buy a three-bedroom terraced house on the Corbett Estate. </p> <p><strong> Take in a lodger</strong></p> <p> Take advantage of the fact that some people cannot afford to buy in London by renting out a room in your house. Under the Rent-a-Room scheme, you can take in a lodger and charge up to \u00a34,250 during the current tax year (or \u00a381 a week) without paying any income tax (any rent over this amount will be liable for tax at your highest rate). You cannot, however, claim any expenses or capital allowances. The Inland Revenue publishes a leaflet IR87 Letting And Your Home, available free via internet, <a href=\"http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk\">www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk</a> or by calling the Orderline on 08459 000404. </p> <p><strong> Check mortgage and insurance</strong></p> <p> If you have lived in your home for a few years and have had the same mortgage and house and contents insurance since you moved in, you can probably save money by switching.</p> <p>Ray Boulger of London independent financial advisers John Charcol says someone paying the typical variable rate of 7.74 per cent on a \u00a3150,000 repayment mortgage would be paying \u00a31,145 a month. But if they remortgaged to a Coventry Building Society mortgage discounted by 2.46 per cent (to a rate of 5.24 per cent) until 31 December 2002 (with free legal fees and valuation but an arrangement fee of \u00a3195), they would pay just \u00a3908 a month - a saving of \u00a3237.</p> <p>Likewise there is little benefit to be gained in staying with the same house and contents insurer. Ask an insurance broker such as People's Choice (0800 112233) to check out quotes on your behalf, and shop around some of the direct insurers yourself, such as Churchill (0800200345) or Eagle Star (0800 868686). </p> <p><strong> Do holiday swaps </strong></p> <p> Just because you find London a strain, it doesn't stop other people wanting to visit for a holiday.

The new town is the most popular destination in the UK for people moving home, according to the Regional Trends survey. Its population grew by 60 per cent between 1981 and 1998. </p> <p>Liz Clarke, a 29-year old project administrator, has experienced both places. 'I was born and grew up in Milton Keynes, moved to London when I was 19, and came back to Milton Keynes after travelling. I found it really dull as a teenager, but the town has changed out of all recognition since then,' she says.</p> <p>The town used to lack an infrastructure, she says, with no real high street and no community feel. But now Milton Keynes has developed a thriving shopping centre over the years, with a John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer, Top Shop, Hennes and a recently opened Debenhams. A piazza has built up around the town's theatre, encour aging a cafe-society feel to evenings out.</p> <p>And although Milton Keynes is just 35 minutes from London by train, with Oxford and Cambridge just 35 miles away in opposite directions, property prices are relatively low. You can buy a two-bedroom flat for \u00a350,000 and a four-bedroom house with double garage for \u00a3140,000. But a disadvantage is that you really need a car to get around from one section of town to another.</p> <p>Nor is there any shortage in employment, with companies such as Abbey National, Minolta, Mercedes, IBM and BT having bases there. 'I've never been out of work for more than three days,' says Liz.</p> <p>But although there are attractive villages in the vicinity such as Newport Pagnell and Stoney Stratford, she admits the town itself still lacks character.</p> <p>Now she is on the move again. Last week Liz swapped a one-bedroom flat in Newport Pagnell, which she had been renting for \u00a3385 a month, for a smaller one-bedroom flat off Clapham Common in South London for \u00a3800 a month. She hopes the move will enable her to move into media-related work and add spice to her leisure time. 'Milton Keynes is fantastic for families. It's got everything you need then. Maybe in 10 years I'll settle down here.'</p>",

Move to a cheaper part of town Although properties are much more expensive in London than anywhere else in the country, there is a wide variation in prices throughout the capital. Generally, the further from the centre you live the more you will get for your money. While \u00a3150,000 might buy you a dog kennel in Chelsea or South Kensington (if you are lucky), the same amount could buy you a two-bedroom house in Tooting. If you have to live in an expensive area because of work, ask local estate agents if there are pockets of housing that represent better value for money compared to their fashionable neighbours. Cash-strapped buyers usually look in the area immediately next to the one that they really want to live in, but can't afford. However, Yolande Barnes, head of research at agent FPD Savills, says that in a housing market that is on the turn (as London seems to be), this can be a dangerous ploy. She warns that property prices in the 'poor man's alternative' areas are much more volatile than those in consistently popular areas, and that people buying at the top of the market could soon find themselves sitting on a loss. However, if you are buying on a budget, you will have little choice. Instead of looking in: \u0095 Islington, former home of the Blairs, consider Stoke Newington, where \u00a3150,000 will buy you a two-bedroom flat in a mansion block; \u0095 Chiswick consider Brentford where \u00a3155,000 will buy you a two-bedroom house; \u0095 Clapham consider Tooting or Streatham, where \u00a3138,000 buys you a two-bedroom house; \u0095 Fulham, consider Putney, where \u00a3149,950 will buy you a three-bedroom split-level maisonette; \u0095 Blackheath, consider Catford, where \u00a3158,000 will buy a three-bedroom terraced house on the Corbett Estate. Take in a lodger Take advantage of the fact that some people cannot afford to buy in London by renting out a room in your house. Under the Rent-a-Room scheme, you can take in a lodger and charge up to \u00a34,250 during the current tax year (or \u00a381 a week) without paying any income tax (any rent over this amount will be liable for tax at your highest rate). You cannot, however, claim any expenses or capital allowances. The Inland Revenue publishes a leaflet IR87 Letting And Your Home, available free via internet, www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk or by calling the Orderline on 08459 000404. Check mortgage and insurance If you have lived in your home for a few years and have had the same mortgage and house and contents insurance since you moved in, you can probably save money by switching. Ray Boulger of London independent financial advisers John Charcol says someone paying the typical variable rate of 7.74 per cent on a \u00a3150,000 repayment mortgage would be paying \u00a31,145 a month. But if they remortgaged to a Coventry Building Society mortgage discounted by 2.46 per cent (to a rate of 5.24 per cent) until 31 December 2002 (with free legal fees and valuation but an arrangement fee of \u00a3195), they would pay just \u00a3908 a month - a saving of \u00a3237. Likewise there is little benefit to be gained in staying with the same house and contents insurer. Ask an insurance broker such as People's Choice (0800 112233) to check out quotes on your behalf, and shop around some of the direct insurers yourself, such as Churchill (0800200345) or Eagle Star (0800 868686). Do holiday swaps Just because you find London a strain, it doesn't stop other people wanting to visit for a holiday. Save money while seeing the world by swapping your home for another in a more exotic location. Several organisations publish directories of home swaps, and you can get your home listed for as little as US$30 (\u00a320). Check out home swap websites: \u0095 www.homelink.org - annual subscription \u00a395, lists 2,000 properties in 50 countries; \u0095 www.wwhec.com - \u00a340 fee to have your home listed, plus \u00a310 if you want a photo included, 330 homes on books; \u0095 www.homebase-hols.com - membership starts from \u00a338, 3,000 listing worldwide, with 33 per cent in the US, and the bulk of the rest in Europe. \u0095 www.homeexchange.com - joining fee of $30, site based in Santa Barbara, California, with 1,500 listings on its database. If all else fails, move out of London Milton Keynes is the most popular destination for evacuees, according to the Regional Trends survey. But if concrete cows don't take your fancy, you could swap your \u00a3350,000 Balham terrace with 50ft garden for a \u00a3345,000 four-bedroom house with stables and four acres on the south side of Harrogate, leaving you\u00a35,000 for a horse - or a six-bedroom farmhouse with four acres for \u00a3300,000 in Westhoughton, near Manchester (both properties on www.easier.co.uk) The internet is a good place to start if you have no firm location ideas. Try www.rightmove.co.uk, www.assertahome.com and www.home.co.uk to get an idea of what you can buy nationwide.

New town, new life in Milton Keynes If you are looking for an alternative to London but still need to be within commuting distance, what about Milton Keynes? The new town is the most popular destination in the UK for people moving home, according to the Regional Trends survey. Its population grew by 60 per cent between 1981 and 1998. Liz Clarke, a 29-year old project administrator, has experienced both places. 'I was born and grew up in Milton Keynes, moved to London when I was 19, and came back to Milton Keynes after travelling. I found it really dull as a teenager, but the town has changed out of all recognition since then,' she says. The town used to lack an infrastructure, she says, with no real high street and no community feel. But now Milton Keynes has developed a thriving shopping centre over the years, with a John Lewis, Marks &amp; Spencer, Top Shop, Hennes and a recently opened Debenhams. A piazza has built up around the town's theatre, encour aging a cafe-society feel to evenings out. And although Milton Keynes is just 35 minutes from London by train, with Oxford and Cambridge just 35 miles away in opposite directions, property prices are relatively low. You can buy a two-bedroom flat for \u00a350,000 and a four-bedroom house with double garage for \u00a3140,000. But a disadvantage is that you really need a car to get around from one section of town to another. Nor is there any shortage in employment, with companies such as Abbey National, Minolta, Mercedes, IBM and BT having bases there. 'I've never been out of work for more than three days,' says Liz. But although there are attractive villages in the vicinity such as Newport Pagnell and Stoney Stratford, she admits the town itself still lacks character. Now she is on the move again. Last week Liz swapped a one-bedroom flat in Newport Pagnell, which she had been renting for \u00a3385 a month, for a smaller one-bedroom flat off Clapham Common in South London for \u00a3800 a month. She hopes the move will enable her to move into media-related work and add spice to her leisure time. 'Milton Keynes is fantastic for families. It's got everything you need then. Maybe in 10 years I'll settle down here.'",

He took a \u00a353,000 mortgage and endowment with Barclays in 1988 to buy his first two-bedroom house, in Bicester. </p> <p>Two years ago, Barclays Life told him that the policy was not performing well and raised the premium from \u00a390 a month to \u00a3129. He recently had another letter about underperformance and discovered that the endowment policy does not mature until eight years after he retires from the NHS. </p> <p>Barclays investigated and admitted it could not locate the Factfind, which is the adviser's formal record showing why a particular policy is recommended. </p> <p>So the insurer was unable to explain why Mr Moddia was sold a low-start endowment or why it matured after his retirement date. Barclays Life offered him a refund of premiums plus interest minus tax, making a total payment of \u00a318,538.97 in full and final settlement. </p> <p>Mr Moddia then told Barclays he believed he was entitled to compensation. Barclays agreed that he had been inconvenienced and offered him a \u00a3150 ex-gratia pay ment. He feels this is still inadequate compensation. </p> <p> <strong> Where does he go from here?</strong> </p> <p> When it is not clear exactly what a homebuyer would have done if he had not taken out an endowment policy, the Ombudsman generally agrees that a refund of premiums plus interest is probably a suitable remedy. But if it is apparent that the complainant would have taken out a repayment mortgage instead, the Ombudsman can also take into account how much capital would have been repaid from a capital-and-repayment mortgage over the same period. </p> <p><strong>Standard Life</strong></p> <p>Standard Life has given this option to Mrs C of London, when admitting it mis-sold her an endowment. The insurer had been unable to establish if her risk rationale, or other types of mortgage, had been discussed when selling her the policy. She has the choice of returned premiums plus interest less the cost of life cover, or recalculating her debt as though she had taken out a repayment loan but deducting the current surrender value of the endowment policy. If she keeps the endowment, Standard Life will also give compensation of the difference between the surrender value and the debt reduction figure, \u00a3126.95. </p> <p>Mrs C has a shortfall of \u00a32,200 if she takes the figures provided on 20 April, or \u00a3600 at 21 July. She is adamant that the salesperson guaranteed that the endowment would repay the loan in full but Standard Life says it cannot find evidence of this. The endowment was sold by Halifax as a representative of Standard Life, so Standard Life handled the complaint, but Mrs C believes that Halifax should take some responsibility. </p> <p> <strong> Where does she go from here?</strong> </p> <p> The Ombudsman is likely to agree with allowing borrowers to choose one of these two options, assuming the deduction for life cover is appropriate because it is either required by the lender or needed by the complainant. The Ombudsman is unlikely to award the difference between the current mortgage balance and the current estimated maturity value of the endowment pol icy (which is the projected shortfall) unless there is sufficient evidence to prove that the company guaranteed at the outset that the policy would repay the mortgage at maturity. This has proved to be extremely rare in the cases presented to the Ombudsman so far. </p> <p><strong>Abbey Life</strong></p> <p>Annette McParland had an existing endowment policy with Abbey Life for \u00a325,500 when she approached the Halifax for a mortgage of \u00a352,000 to buy a new apartment. A Halifax representative suggested a personal equity plan mortgage but she explained that she would keep the property for only a couple of years before moving to the Republic of Ireland. Non-UK taxpayers cannot hold Peps. The salesperson then ad-vised her to buy an endowment, saying she could use the policy against a mortgage in the Republic. </p> <p>She is now about to move and has discovered the drawback of earning in punts but paying insurance premiums in sterling. Lenders in Ireland have told her that fluctuating exchange rates make it difficult to fix the exact value of the policy and they will not accept it towards a mortgage. The policy is now useless to her: she has no dependants, but it has little cash-in value as it is only two years old. She has complained that she should not have been sold it. </p> <p> <strong> Where does she go from here?</strong> </p> <p> Annette needs to prove that it was reasonably foreseeable at the point of sale that she would move abroad in the future, and then show the effect that moving out of the UK has had on the policy.</p> <p><strong>Do you have a problem?

      "body": "<p>It really is grim down south. New research confirms what many southerners have suspected - living standards are higher in the North of England. Yes, people in the South East do earn more, but their living standards are among the lowest in the country because they pay far more for food, transport and housing, according to the Regional Trends report published by the Office of National Statistics. </p> <p>Someone working in Middlesbrough earned an average of \u00a317,490 last year, and people in Greater Manchester were paid an average \u00a319,438, while Londoners generally were paid\u00a328,812 and those working in the City itself received a whopping \u00a343,288. </p> <p>But the cost of buying a home, travelling to work and groceries are also much higher in the South. While the weekly food and drink bill for one person comes to \u00a315.57 in the North East, it is\u00a317.99 in London and \u00a318.88 in the South East. And while the weekly national average household expenditure is \u00a3332.60 and only \u00a3282.90 in the North East, the bill increases to \u00a3376 in London and the South East. </p> <p>However, the biggest problem for anyone trying to buy a home or raise a family in London and the surrounding commuter belt is property prices. Lawrence Davies, a solicitor who works at North Lambeth Law Centre in south London, is paid \u00a323,000 a year. His salary is above the national average of \u00a320,919, but below the average for London, and he has found it impossible to buy a family-sized home for himself and his wife within reasonable travelling distance of work. The couple, who have been married for just over a year, are thinking of starting a family in two or three years, and will need somewhere larger than their one-bedroom flat in Kingston. </p> <p>But Davies says: 'Anything with two or more bedrooms is going to cost more than \u00a3100,000. My wife is planning to return to college and, whatever income multiples you use, my salary just won't cover a \u00a3100,000-plus mortgage.' </p> <p>The couple are contemplating a move to Oxfordshire, which would mean a long and tiring journeys to and from work for him. </p> <p>One of his law centre colleagues is quitting the Law Centre to move to Leeds. 'He can't secure a rental property in London because the market is so competitive, and he can't afford to buy,' says Davies. </p> <p>The Halifax House Price Index shows the the scale of the problem. Although prices fell in London by 2.4 per cent during the second quarter of this year, the cost of the average London property is still \u00a3145,104 - nearly three times higher than in the North (\u00a356,228) or in Yorkshire and Humberside (\u00a355,494). Semi-detached houses in Greater London fetched an average of \u00a3210,100, nearly four times more than the cost of an equivalent home in Northumberland (\u00a356,250) and nearly five times more than in South Humberside (\u00a344,800). </p> <p>If struggling to meet the monthly mortgage payment doesn't make your life purgatory, commuting to work will. Transport costs are much higher in London and the South East. While a monthly Metro pass to all areas of Newcastle costs \u00a339.25, and a monthly bus and train pass in Manchester costs \u00a368.50, a monthly pass for all zones in on London Transport will set you back a huge \u00a3136.00. True, Londoners have shorter journeys to work, but they spend much longer commuting - an average of 32 minutes compared with only 18 minutes for commuters elsewhere in the country. </p> <p>These findings are, to some extent, con tradicted by the Indices of Deprivation 2000, published by the Department of the Environment. This report, which came out in August, shows that nine of the 10 most deprived areas in England are in the North. That data, covering most accepted measures of the quality of life, including job opportunities, health, housing, education and access to basic services such as post offices and shops, shows that northern towns and cities such as Middlesbrough and Liverpool suffer the worst social conditions. The only exception is Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. The 10 least deprived areas are in the South and Midlands, according to this study, which doesn't take living costs into account. </p> <p>But Londoners don't believe any of it, and are voting with their feet. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation finds that 48,000 more people leave London each year than move to the capital from other parts of the country. </p> <p>And contrary to popular belief, the pressure on housing in the South East has not been caused by northerners migrating south. The real culprit is an exodus of Londoners pushing up prices in the surrounding areas as they swap life in the capital for those longer commuter journeys and higher travelling costs. </p> <p><strong>Rich and poor </strong></p> <p><strong>Most deprived areas</strong></p> <p>1.

      "bodyText": "It really is grim down south. New research confirms what many southerners have suspected - living standards are higher in the North of England. Yes, people in the South East do earn more, but their living standards are among the lowest in the country because they pay far more for food, transport and housing, according to the Regional Trends report published by the Office of National Statistics. Someone working in Middlesbrough earned an average of \u00a317,490 last year, and people in Greater Manchester were paid an average \u00a319,438, while Londoners generally were paid\u00a328,812 and those working in the City itself received a whopping \u00a343,288. But the cost of buying a home, travelling to work and groceries are also much higher in the South. While the weekly food and drink bill for one person comes to \u00a315.57 in the North East, it is\u00a317.99 in London and \u00a318.88 in the South East. And while the weekly national average household expenditure is \u00a3332.60 and only \u00a3282.90 in the North East, the bill increases to \u00a3376 in London and the South East. However, the biggest problem for anyone trying to buy a home or raise a family in London and the surrounding commuter belt is property prices. Lawrence Davies, a solicitor who works at North Lambeth Law Centre in south London, is paid \u00a323,000 a year. His salary is above the national average of \u00a320,919, but below the average for London, and he has found it impossible to buy a family-sized home for himself and his wife within reasonable travelling distance of work. The couple, who have been married for just over a year, are thinking of starting a family in two or three years, and will need somewhere larger than their one-bedroom flat in Kingston. But Davies says: 'Anything with two or more bedrooms is going to cost more than \u00a3100,000. My wife is planning to return to college and, whatever income multiples you use, my salary just won't cover a \u00a3100,000-plus mortgage.' The couple are contemplating a move to Oxfordshire, which would mean a long and tiring journeys to and from work for him. One of his law centre colleagues is quitting the Law Centre to move to Leeds. 'He can't secure a rental property in London because the market is so competitive, and he can't afford to buy,' says Davies. The Halifax House Price Index shows the the scale of the problem. Although prices fell in London by 2.4 per cent during the second quarter of this year, the cost of the average London property is still \u00a3145,104 - nearly three times higher than in the North (\u00a356,228) or in Yorkshire and Humberside (\u00a355,494). Semi-detached houses in Greater London fetched an average of \u00a3210,100, nearly four times more than the cost of an equivalent home in Northumberland (\u00a356,250) and nearly five times more than in South Humberside (\u00a344,800). If struggling to meet the monthly mortgage payment doesn't make your life purgatory, commuting to work will. Transport costs are much higher in London and the South East. While a monthly Metro pass to all areas of Newcastle costs \u00a339.25, and a monthly bus and train pass in Manchester costs \u00a368.50, a monthly pass for all zones in on London Transport will set you back a huge \u00a3136.00. True, Londoners have shorter journeys to work, but they spend much longer commuting - an average of 32 minutes compared with only 18 minutes for commuters elsewhere in the country. These findings are, to some extent, con tradicted by the Indices of Deprivation 2000, published by the Department of the Environment. This report, which came out in August, shows that nine of the 10 most deprived areas in England are in the North. That data, covering most accepted measures of the quality of life, including job opportunities, health, housing, education and access to basic services such as post offices and shops, shows that northern towns and cities such as Middlesbrough and Liverpool suffer the worst social conditions. The only exception is Great Yarmouth in Norfolk. The 10 least deprived areas are in the South and Midlands, according to this study, which doesn't take living costs into account. But Londoners don't believe any of it, and are voting with their feet. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation finds that 48,000 more people leave London each year than move to the capital from other parts of the country. And contrary to popular belief, the pressure on housing in the South East has not been caused by northerners migrating south. The real culprit is an exodus of Londoners pushing up prices in the surrounding areas as they swap life in the capital for those longer commuter journeys and higher travelling costs.

      "body": "<p>The man from the Intelligence Bureau wanted to know exactly what I was up to in Multan. He had spotted me walking through the bazaar with my host, Moin, and had been so alarmed at the spectacle that he had rung Moin at his family home at eight the next morning. Moin, the director of a local non-governmental organisation, is no friend of the military dictatorship, and is accustomed to low-level harassment from the authorities. I heard him assure the secret policeman that I was merely a 'writer of cricket stories' and that my visit had nothing to do with politics. This wasn't strictly true but I was happy to bow to Moin's preference for discretion over valour.</p> <p>'That man is very happy now,' Moin informed me. 'Cricket is the best passport you can have in Pakistan.' </p> <p>Multan in the southern Punjab is renowned for heat, flies and beggars, but in the early spring it's a balmy place, with a dilapidated medieval centre speckled with blue-glazed Sufi shrines. That day I drove south through a landscape of shady canals, green fields and mango orchards. In nearby Bahawalpur I visited the Dring Stadium, the country's oldest international cricket ground, where Hanif Mohammed scored the first Test century on Pakistani soil in 1954.</p> <p>Little of note has taken place there since. The one-day international circus rarely alights at the Dring which, like southern Punjab as a whole, seems a victim of discrimination and neglect. Nonetheless, it remains an attractive ground with a 1930s pavilion. While the malis weeded the outfield, the surrounding gardens and alleyways were packed with boys playing cricket. Barefoot fast bowlers with whippy actions hurled battered composite balls at batsmen who played shots all around the wicket. There's no academy in Pakistan, no development system, but young prodigies keep bubbling up from below. </p> <p>In Bahawalpur, as elsewhere in Pakistan, I was interrogated with polite determination. What was my opinion of the Pakistani cricket team? Since it was obvious that Pakistan had the world's most talented cricketers, why did the team lose so often? Why did they keep changing the captain? Who could explain the selection policies? In sum, what was wrong with Pakistani cricket? As elsewhere, they didn't need me to tell them the answers. They muttered about corruption, mismanagement, favouritism, factionalism. Their contempt for the rulers of Pakistani cricket was as fierce as their pride in the brilliance of Pakistani cricketers. I asked them who would win tomorrow's one day international against Sri Lanka.</p> <p>'Pakistan, of course,' said a studious-looking wicketkeeper in glasses and baseball cap, then added, 'unless...' and rubbed his fingers together in the universal sign for the bottom line.</p> <p>The next day I made my way into the Cholistan desert. In a remote village there was an annual mela, an immemorial gathering of the clans around the sand dune shrine of a folk saint. Transvestites dance and smile. Nomadic families are camped out with their animals, cooking and chatting in the sun. Singers and drummers keep up an endless rhythmic drone. A group of boys squatting next to a herd of young camels listen to a small radio broadcasting the ball by ball from Karachi. I approach and ask the score. Pakistan are batting well. They are making a big score. But then, a wicket falls. There's a burst of excited static from the radio. The boys fiddle with the tuner. They shake their heads. One looks at me with a grim smile and rubs his fingers together.</p> <p>To grasp the impact of the cascade of match-fixing rumours and revelations in Pakistan and India, you first have to grasp the importance of cricket within south Asian culture. Imagine the British interest in football, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf, snooker and athletics all rolled into one, then add in pop music and television soaps, and you begin to get the scale. Sachin Tendulkar has been repeatedly named not only as the most widely recognised living Indian, but also the most respected. In England, it's a rare occurrence for an event in the cricket world to hit the front-pages. In India and Pakistan, it's routine. India has the second largest population in the world, and Pakistan the sixth, but they barely featured in the medal winners' table in Sydney. For societies eager for a hike in global status, cricket is a rare and welcome balm, a compensation as well as a distraction. In this field alone they have produced world-beaters, so when the world-beaters' probity and patriotism comes into question, emotions run high. </p> <p>'The automatic equation between brilliant-cricketer-therefore-brilliant-human-being is a difficult one to break,' says Sharda Ugra, sports editor at India Today, the country's biggest English language weekly. On her way back from reporting on the King Commission inquiry into the Hanise Cronje scandal in South Africa (the magazine's cover story), she found herself trying to explain to incredulous cricket lovers some painful realities about one of India's greatest sporting heroes, the all-rounder (and until recently, national coach) Kapil Dev. 'It took me the better part of three hours to convince two people sitting next to me in the plane that Kapil might be involved in the scandals. When I told him about all the times that Kapil had refused to do interviews if he wasn't paid, this middle-aged businessman could only say, \"But he is my hero!\"</p> <p>'The die hard fans are still struggling with the fact that their heroes could be guilty of doing what Cronje did,' says Ugra. 'But the newer followers, that section of the population that had switched during the past 10 years from being totally uninterested in cricket to being riveted by the television spectacle, a lot of them female, retired people, are now disgusted and put off. It is this lot who have made what I call the \"reality-switch\" very quickly.' </p> <p>Perhaps the saddest feature of the whole affair is that so few people in India believe anything will come of it. After all, scandals of much greater import to Indian society - and involving greater sums of money and equally famous names - have come and gone with the culprits still at large. No one ever faced trial in either the Bofors or Hawala scams, which were considered political earthquakes in their day. The rich and well-connected, it seems, will always escape justice. While the Indian criminal justice system grinds slowly, sponsors and advertisers have been quicker to pass judgment. Suddenly the ubiquitous adverts featuring famous cricketers plugging everything from air conditioners to men's suits have vanished from the screen. A recent television advert gives some idea of the prevailing mood. It shows four people sitting around watching cricket on the box. The screen flickers and the picture is distorted. One of the viewers gets up and says the cable must have shifted.</p> <p>'Match fix kar doon?' ('shall I fix the match?'), he asks. His friend answers that there's no need; the problem can be 'fixed' from a seated position - and then extols the television's new remote control features.</p> <p>There's a wary cynicism in the popular response to the match-fixing scandal, but it doesn't seem to have reduced the popular appetite for cricket. Vendors of cricket equipment insist the scandal has had no impact on sales and the demand for places in cricket clubs and coaching clinics is as insatiable as ever. Since the ICC Knock-Out Trophy currently under way in Kenya will be the first international cricket played by India since the scandal broke in April, it remains to be seen whether television audiences have kept faith with the game. </p> <p>People in India can't seem to make up their minds whether Manoj Prabhakar is a hero or villain in the match-fixing melodrama. The former Indian all-rounder was always known as a member of the awkward squad, and had already made his share of enemies long before he began muttering about bookies and bribes in 1997. His allegations were investigated by the Chandrachud Commission and dismissed as unfounded.</p> <p>Earlier this year, following Cronje's confession, Prabhakar equipped himself with a hidden camera and videotaped a number of private conversations with players and administrators. The explosive results were aired on Indian television in May. One after another, cricketers, broadcasters, coaches and cricket board members confirm Prabhakar's allegations. One after another, they concede that match-fixing is 'going on all the time' but that 'there is nothing you can do about it'.</p> <p>'Prabhakar's videotapes have had a huge impact on the non-believers,' Ugra observes. 'A lot of us knew there was antagonism and backbiting and insecurity within cricket, like there is in any sport, but there were plenty who gave cricketers the benefit of the doubt. I think no one could predict the extent of the rot.'</p> <p>One of the documentary's saddest, most revealing moments occurs in a conversation between Prabhakar and Navjot Singh Sidhu, the former Indian opening batsman, a gritty crease-occupier and, like Prabhakar, renowned as a difficult customer. On the tape, Sidhu makes it clear that while he does not dispute Prabhakar's allegations, he must turn down his old friend's pleas to back him in public. 'I know you very well, but first listen to me. Even if you go to someone else, he will not go along with you. Nobody. After all, Kapil Dev is not an ordinary person. He is a respected man in this country. Highly respected. If you lift a finger against a respected man and you don't have proof, it's like inviting trouble. Secondly, I'm indebted to Kapil Paaji. He gave me an opportunity to play no matter what kind of person he is. I owe him a debt. I don't want to be dragged into this. I don't get involved in any matter, leave alone a matter of this importance. They (journalists) call me everyday. I don't even say,\"'No comments\".'</p> <p>Sidhu's paranoia, like Prabhakar's whiny desperation, tell us a great deal about big-time Indian cricket. This is a climate in which patronage and personal favour count, in which success on the field is never enough. It is not a climate in which whistle-blowers flourish.</p> <p>As a result of the Prabhakar tapes and King Commission testimony, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stepped up its probe and in mid-July the Income Tax department launched high-profile raids on cricketers and cricket board personnel. With a characteristically south Asian nostalgia for the game's lost innocence, tax officials dubbed the raids 'Operation Gentleman'.</p> <p>From Kapil Dev to the former chairman of the International Cricket Council, Jagmohan Dalmiya, few were spared. Although the information gathered is still under review and no charges have been brought, newspapers have printed lurid accounts of the eye-popping wealth uncovered in the course of the raids. If nothing else, the press leaks have re-inforced the popular conviction that corruption in the game is widespread. 'I am delighted that these raids took place,' said Khushwant Singh, one of the country's best-known columnists. 'Personally, I am relieved. I have stopped watching cricket altogether.'</p> <p>Whatever they may add by way of circumstantial evidence in the match-fixing cases, in themselves the raids merely confirm that international cricketers are no different from other rich Indians. The hoarding of undeclared assets is standard practise among the country's *lite. For that *lite, there is now a growing danger that the match-fixing scandal will overspill its boundaries. Jaya Jaitly, the president of the Samata party, a partner in the governing coalition, held a press conference in Delhi to denounce the 'high-handed' raid on the homes and offices of Ajay Jadeja, the middle-class heart throb with the princely pedigree who has been repeatedly named in connection with the scandals. Jaitly's daughter works for Jadeja and is said to be engaged to marry him. The politician took particular umbrage over the 'personal' questioning of her daughter ('by my own government') and accused the tax officials of asking for 50,000 rupees (\u00a3750) to hush up the case. 'They asked for food and demanded rotis made at home, not bazaar stuff.'</p> <p>In the wake of the tax raids, both Muhammad Azharuddin and Kapil Dev were interrogated by the CBI. They were also named frequently in Prabhakar's tapes. Imagine Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker in the dock, and you'll get a small idea of how the heavens have fallen in the sub-continent. </p> <p>I first laid eyes on Muhammad Azharuddin at Eden Gardens in January 1985, when the then 21-year-old neophyte compiled a measured Test century against England. The crowd that day - full to its 100,000 capacity, patient, knowledgeable, appreciative - seems to belong to a different world to the crowds that surge into the grounds for today's one-day internationals - feverishly partisan, quickly bored, and mostly indifferent to anything other than national victory. </p> <p>And apart from the still flexible wrists, the world-weary, besieged celebrity who turned out for Asia against the Rest of the World at the Oval this summer seems a very different person from the modest, tongue-tied, unworldly lad who put the English bowlers to the sword at Eden Gardens. In those days, he shared a home in a low-income housing colony in Hyderabad with 17 other family members. Today, according to the reports leaked from the income tax raids, he is the owner of seven luxury properties in Bombay, six imported vehicles, 20 designer wristwatches and several closets worth of Armani and Versace togs. </p> <p>At the Oval, every time Azhar touched the ball, the crowd let fly. 'Account number kya hai?' (What is your account number?). When he fluffed a catch in the slips, it was 'Payment late?'. The umpires were urged to 'check his pockets!'. Compared to what is likely to greet him in India, if he ever plays cricket there again, it was mild.</p> <p>Azhar was named by Cronje to the King Commission as his initial link man with the bookies, nd on the Prabhakar tape Ravi Shastri, the former Indian all-rounder turned TV commentator, describes him as 'the asshole' who 'must be shifted'. Panicked by the rising tide of accusation, Azhar did something he had resisted in the past; he played the minority card, claiming that he was being singled out for attack because he was a Muslim.</p> <p>Azhar captained India through much of the 1990s, a period that coincided with the rising influence of a right-wing Hindu nationalism pumping out an ugly anti-Muslim message. Like other Muslims prominent in the entertainment world, he went out of his way to assert his patriotic credentials and in particular his desire to defeat Pakistan on the field of play. Hindu bigots heaped praise on him for showing the country what a 'loyal Muslim' should be. However, he was already being criticised by conservatives - both Muslim and Hindu - for his divorce and subsequent marriage to Sangeeta Bijlani, a Bombay model. On the outside, Azhar remained a diffident figure. But those who know him insist he changed. The globe-trotting, the lavish lifestyle, the adoring crowds, the easy money are all blamed for ruining the one time innocent.</p> <p>Azhar also suffers from a subliminal association with the 'Muslim underground', the criminal empire said to be run by Dawood Ibrahim from his safe haven in the Gulf. There is little that goes wrong in India that some people are not prepared to lay at Dawood's doorstep; his alleged links with just about every powerful figure in Indian life - from politics to cinema to sport - keep conspiracy theorists working overtime. As the Prabhakar tapes confirmed, Dawood is a real presence in cricket, and has appeared in both the Indian and Pakistani dressing rooms. But if there is a specific link between Azhar and Dawood - as former Indian captain Ravi Shastri alleges in the Prabhakar tapes - it has nothing to do with Islam and everything to do with money.</p> <p>Azhar is a creature of the culture of individual acquisitiveness that swept through the upper echelons of Indian society in the 1990s. In business, politics and culture, it was the decade of hype and hustle, a scramble for scarce privileges in a poverty-blighted society. A packaged patriotism was married to a deregulated business environment, and Azhar was only one of many pulled into the resultant maelstrom. </p> <p>As rumour followed rumour, Kapil Dev found his hitherto unchallenged public standing hopelessly compromised. Journalists began publishing some of the things they had already known for a long time, particularly about Kapil's business affairs. The Gujerat state government announced that it was ordering the removal from school text books of a chapter celebrating the great all-rounder. In early September, Kapil was interrogated by the CBI, and pressure built up for him to resign as coach of the Indian team. This was a delicate matter for the cricket board. How do you rid yourself discreetly of a tainted national hero? Everyone wanted Kapil to go, but no one wanted to be seen to push him out. So the board reportedly floated rumours that it might be looking for a replacement, then publicly denied the rumours and invited Kapil to remain in charge. </p> <p>Besieged by the media, Kapil submitted his resignation, which was then accepted by the board with a show of regret. Privately, it had been made clear to Kapil that if he delayed any longer, he would have to be sacked. Sharda Ugra described the episode as 'a classic example of Indian cricket's theatre of the absurd' dictated by 'a tragi-comic compromise formula.' The legendary slow bowler and long-time loose cannon Bishen Bedi dismissed Kapil's exit as 'stage managed.' Indian captain Saurav Ganguly was surprisingly terse: 'Frankly, it doesn't matter who the coach is.' </p> <p>The board was said to be divided over how to handle Kapil's disgrace. Having excluded all those players named in the match-fixing imbroglio from the squad for the ICC Trophy (which meant no places for Azhar or Jadeja), it seemed strange that the axe should not also fall on the national coach. But then, the axe had also spared two other individuals involved in the tax raids - the powerful Dalmiya and the board treasurer Kishore Rungta. 'What happens to the board officers will indicate the intent and extent of Indian cricket's clean-up,' commented a still sceptical Ugra.</p> <p>As for Kapil, the once vivacious and uncomplicated competitor has slunk away from the public eye, wounded and bewildered. 'I cannot explain anything,' he told a journalist. 'You are free to write what you wish. I have nothing to say. Let me be. Please.'</p> <p>Shortly after Pakistan's elected government was ousted by a military dictatorship last year, Lt General Tauqir Zia was installed as head of the cricket board, assisted by a phalanx of army and air force personnel. For the current military rulers, cricket serves much the same purposes as it served their predecessors, generals Zia Ul Haq and Ayub Khan: an instrument for legitimising the regime and for distracting the masses. It is also, now, a means for the military to demonstrate its main justification in the eyes of the people - its claim that it will root out the corruption that bedevilled the civilian system. So far there's little evidence of improvement, in cricket or elsewhere. </p> <p>It was in Pakistan that the match-fixing scandal began in 1994, when Salim Malik was accused of attempted bribery by Shane Warne and Mark Waugh (who, it later emerged, had themselves accepted payment from bookies). Nearly six years later, after three inquiries supervised by the cream of the Pakistani judiciary, the result is that former captain Salim Malik and medium-pacer Ata-ur-Rehman have been banned for life (their international careers were finished in any case). Six others, including Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed, have been fined amounts between $2,000 and $6,000. The fines will be deducted from their match fees. </p> <p>Judging by the published reports, the case against Akram seemed much weightier than the one made out against Ata-ur-Rehman. Akram remains, however, a key member of the side. Colonel (Retd) Rafi Nasim, a former head of the cricket board and now a columnist for a daily newspaper, declared that the fines 'will act as a last nail in the coffin of match fixing as far as Pakistan is concerned. Of all the countries allegedly involved in this evil practice Pakistan was the most prompt as well as logical in dealing with this issue.' Not everyone agrees. A citizen has lodged a petition in the Sindh High Court calling for all the players named in the final report to be banned from the game and prosecuted for criminal offences. </p> <p>Turning from tragedy to farce, Pakistani cricket has recently been rocked by one of its rare sex scandals. Or at least that' s how the local press have reported it. Three promising international cricketers were found in the company of of a number of young women in the team's Karachi hotel rooms on the eve of their flight to a tournament in Singapore. The players insisted that the women were fans who had barged their way in, and the manager says his investigation confirms their story. Nonetheless, they have each been fined \u00a3800 and banned from the ICC tournament in Kenya.

The popular all-rounder Shahid Afridi, one of the three players who may or may not have committed a minor misdemeanour in the Karachi hotel, bewailed his predicament. 'My father, mother and brothers have been very critical of my actions. They have been reprimanding me. None of them are ready to believe me. I am at a loss as to what my action should be. </p> <p>Those who raised this false allegation have managed to establish it as a truth. However, I can swear by God to prove my innocence.'

      "bodyText": "The man from the Intelligence Bureau wanted to know exactly what I was up to in Multan. He had spotted me walking through the bazaar with my host, Moin, and had been so alarmed at the spectacle that he had rung Moin at his family home at eight the next morning. Moin, the director of a local non-governmental organisation, is no friend of the military dictatorship, and is accustomed to low-level harassment from the authorities. I heard him assure the secret policeman that I was merely a 'writer of cricket stories' and that my visit had nothing to do with politics. This wasn't strictly true but I was happy to bow to Moin's preference for discretion over valour. 'That man is very happy now,' Moin informed me. 'Cricket is the best passport you can have in Pakistan.' Multan in the southern Punjab is renowned for heat, flies and beggars, but in the early spring it's a balmy place, with a dilapidated medieval centre speckled with blue-glazed Sufi shrines. That day I drove south through a landscape of shady canals, green fields and mango orchards. In nearby Bahawalpur I visited the Dring Stadium, the country's oldest international cricket ground, where Hanif Mohammed scored the first Test century on Pakistani soil in 1954. Little of note has taken place there since. The one-day international circus rarely alights at the Dring which, like southern Punjab as a whole, seems a victim of discrimination and neglect. Nonetheless, it remains an attractive ground with a 1930s pavilion. While the malis weeded the outfield, the surrounding gardens and alleyways were packed with boys playing cricket. Barefoot fast bowlers with whippy actions hurled battered composite balls at batsmen who played shots all around the wicket. There's no academy in Pakistan, no development system, but young prodigies keep bubbling up from below. In Bahawalpur, as elsewhere in Pakistan, I was interrogated with polite determination. What was my opinion of the Pakistani cricket team? Since it was obvious that Pakistan had the world's most talented cricketers, why did the team lose so often? Why did they keep changing the captain? Who could explain the selection policies? In sum, what was wrong with Pakistani cricket? As elsewhere, they didn't need me to tell them the answers. They muttered about corruption, mismanagement, favouritism, factionalism. Their contempt for the rulers of Pakistani cricket was as fierce as their pride in the brilliance of Pakistani cricketers. I asked them who would win tomorrow's one day international against Sri Lanka. 'Pakistan, of course,' said a studious-looking wicketkeeper in glasses and baseball cap, then added, 'unless...' and rubbed his fingers together in the universal sign for the bottom line. The next day I made my way into the Cholistan desert. In a remote village there was an annual mela, an immemorial gathering of the clans around the sand dune shrine of a folk saint. Transvestites dance and smile. Nomadic families are camped out with their animals, cooking and chatting in the sun. Singers and drummers keep up an endless rhythmic drone. A group of boys squatting next to a herd of young camels listen to a small radio broadcasting the ball by ball from Karachi. I approach and ask the score. Pakistan are batting well. They are making a big score. But then, a wicket falls. There's a burst of excited static from the radio. The boys fiddle with the tuner. They shake their heads. One looks at me with a grim smile and rubs his fingers together. To grasp the impact of the cascade of match-fixing rumours and revelations in Pakistan and India, you first have to grasp the importance of cricket within south Asian culture. Imagine the British interest in football, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf, snooker and athletics all rolled into one, then add in pop music and television soaps, and you begin to get the scale. Sachin Tendulkar has been repeatedly named not only as the most widely recognised living Indian, but also the most respected. In England, it's a rare occurrence for an event in the cricket world to hit the front-pages. In India and Pakistan, it's routine. India has the second largest population in the world, and Pakistan the sixth, but they barely featured in the medal winners' table in Sydney. For societies eager for a hike in global status, cricket is a rare and welcome balm, a compensation as well as a distraction. In this field alone they have produced world-beaters, so when the world-beaters' probity and patriotism comes into question, emotions run high. 'The automatic equation between brilliant-cricketer-therefore-brilliant-human-being is a difficult one to break,' says Sharda Ugra, sports editor at India Today, the country's biggest English language weekly. On her way back from reporting on the King Commission inquiry into the Hanise Cronje scandal in South Africa (the magazine's cover story), she found herself trying to explain to incredulous cricket lovers some painful realities about one of India's greatest sporting heroes, the all-rounder (and until recently, national coach) Kapil Dev. 'It took me the better part of three hours to convince two people sitting next to me in the plane that Kapil might be involved in the scandals. When I told him about all the times that Kapil had refused to do interviews if he wasn't paid, this middle-aged businessman could only say, \"But he is my hero!\" 'The die hard fans are still struggling with the fact that their heroes could be guilty of doing what Cronje did,' says Ugra. 'But the newer followers, that section of the population that had switched during the past 10 years from being totally uninterested in cricket to being riveted by the television spectacle, a lot of them female, retired people, are now disgusted and put off. It is this lot who have made what I call the \"reality-switch\" very quickly.' Perhaps the saddest feature of the whole affair is that so few people in India believe anything will come of it. After all, scandals of much greater import to Indian society - and involving greater sums of money and equally famous names - have come and gone with the culprits still at large. No one ever faced trial in either the Bofors or Hawala scams, which were considered political earthquakes in their day. The rich and well-connected, it seems, will always escape justice. While the Indian criminal justice system grinds slowly, sponsors and advertisers have been quicker to pass judgment. Suddenly the ubiquitous adverts featuring famous cricketers plugging everything from air conditioners to men's suits have vanished from the screen. A recent television advert gives some idea of the prevailing mood. It shows four people sitting around watching cricket on the box. The screen flickers and the picture is distorted. One of the viewers gets up and says the cable must have shifted. 'Match fix kar doon?' ('shall I fix the match?'), he asks. His friend answers that there's no need; the problem can be 'fixed' from a seated position - and then extols the television's new remote control features. There's a wary cynicism in the popular response to the match-fixing scandal, but it doesn't seem to have reduced the popular appetite for cricket. Vendors of cricket equipment insist the scandal has had no impact on sales and the demand for places in cricket clubs and coaching clinics is as insatiable as ever. Since the ICC Knock-Out Trophy currently under way in Kenya will be the first international cricket played by India since the scandal broke in April, it remains to be seen whether television audiences have kept faith with the game. People in India can't seem to make up their minds whether Manoj Prabhakar is a hero or villain in the match-fixing melodrama. The former Indian all-rounder was always known as a member of the awkward squad, and had already made his share of enemies long before he began muttering about bookies and bribes in 1997. His allegations were investigated by the Chandrachud Commission and dismissed as unfounded. Earlier this year, following Cronje's confession, Prabhakar equipped himself with a hidden camera and videotaped a number of private conversations with players and administrators. The explosive results were aired on Indian television in May. One after another, cricketers, broadcasters, coaches and cricket board members confirm Prabhakar's allegations. One after another, they concede that match-fixing is 'going on all the time' but that 'there is nothing you can do about it'. 'Prabhakar's videotapes have had a huge impact on the non-believers,' Ugra observes. 'A lot of us knew there was antagonism and backbiting and insecurity within cricket, like there is in any sport, but there were plenty who gave cricketers the benefit of the doubt. I think no one could predict the extent of the rot.' One of the documentary's saddest, most revealing moments occurs in a conversation between Prabhakar and Navjot Singh Sidhu, the former Indian opening batsman, a gritty crease-occupier and, like Prabhakar, renowned as a difficult customer. On the tape, Sidhu makes it clear that while he does not dispute Prabhakar's allegations, he must turn down his old friend's pleas to back him in public. 'I know you very well, but first listen to me. Even if you go to someone else, he will not go along with you. Nobody. After all, Kapil Dev is not an ordinary person. He is a respected man in this country. Highly respected. If you lift a finger against a respected man and you don't have proof, it's like inviting trouble. Secondly, I'm indebted to Kapil Paaji. He gave me an opportunity to play no matter what kind of person he is. I owe him a debt. I don't want to be dragged into this. I don't get involved in any matter, leave alone a matter of this importance. They (journalists) call me everyday. I don't even say,\"'No comments\".' Sidhu's paranoia, like Prabhakar's whiny desperation, tell us a great deal about big-time Indian cricket. This is a climate in which patronage and personal favour count, in which success on the field is never enough. It is not a climate in which whistle-blowers flourish. As a result of the Prabhakar tapes and King Commission testimony, India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) stepped up its probe and in mid-July the Income Tax department launched high-profile raids on cricketers and cricket board personnel. With a characteristically south Asian nostalgia for the game's lost innocence, tax officials dubbed the raids 'Operation Gentleman'. From Kapil Dev to the former chairman of the International Cricket Council, Jagmohan Dalmiya, few were spared. Although the information gathered is still under review and no charges have been brought, newspapers have printed lurid accounts of the eye-popping wealth uncovered in the course of the raids. If nothing else, the press leaks have re-inforced the popular conviction that corruption in the game is widespread. 'I am delighted that these raids took place,' said Khushwant Singh, one of the country's best-known columnists. 'Personally, I am relieved. I have stopped watching cricket altogether.' Whatever they may add by way of circumstantial evidence in the match-fixing cases, in themselves the raids merely confirm that international cricketers are no different from other rich Indians. The hoarding of undeclared assets is standard practise among the country's *lite. For that *lite, there is now a growing danger that the match-fixing scandal will overspill its boundaries. Jaya Jaitly, the president of the Samata party, a partner in the governing coalition, held a press conference in Delhi to denounce the 'high-handed' raid on the homes and offices of Ajay Jadeja, the middle-class heart throb with the princely pedigree who has been repeatedly named in connection with the scandals. Jaitly's daughter works for Jadeja and is said to be engaged to marry him. The politician took particular umbrage over the 'personal' questioning of her daughter ('by my own government') and accused the tax officials of asking for 50,000 rupees (\u00a3750) to hush up the case. 'They asked for food and demanded rotis made at home, not bazaar stuff.' In the wake of the tax raids, both Muhammad Azharuddin and Kapil Dev were interrogated by the CBI. They were also named frequently in Prabhakar's tapes. Imagine Kevin Keegan and Gary Lineker in the dock, and you'll get a small idea of how the heavens have fallen in the sub-continent. I first laid eyes on Muhammad Azharuddin at Eden Gardens in January 1985, when the then 21-year-old neophyte compiled a measured Test century against England. The crowd that day - full to its 100,000 capacity, patient, knowledgeable, appreciative - seems to belong to a different world to the crowds that surge into the grounds for today's one-day internationals - feverishly partisan, quickly bored, and mostly indifferent to anything other than national victory. And apart from the still flexible wrists, the world-weary, besieged celebrity who turned out for Asia against the Rest of the World at the Oval this summer seems a very different person from the modest, tongue-tied, unworldly lad who put the English bowlers to the sword at Eden Gardens. In those days, he shared a home in a low-income housing colony in Hyderabad with 17 other family members. Today, according to the reports leaked from the income tax raids, he is the owner of seven luxury properties in Bombay, six imported vehicles, 20 designer wristwatches and several closets worth of Armani and Versace togs. At the Oval, every time Azhar touched the ball, the crowd let fly. 'Account number kya hai?' (What is your account number?). When he fluffed a catch in the slips, it was 'Payment late?'. The umpires were urged to 'check his pockets!'. Compared to what is likely to greet him in India, if he ever plays cricket there again, it was mild. Azhar was named by Cronje to the King Commission as his initial link man with the bookies, nd on the Prabhakar tape Ravi Shastri, the former Indian all-rounder turned TV commentator, describes him as 'the asshole' who 'must be shifted'. Panicked by the rising tide of accusation, Azhar did something he had resisted in the past; he played the minority card, claiming that he was being singled out for attack because he was a Muslim. Azhar captained India through much of the 1990s, a period that coincided with the rising influence of a right-wing Hindu nationalism pumping out an ugly anti-Muslim message. Like other Muslims prominent in the entertainment world, he went out of his way to assert his patriotic credentials and in particular his desire to defeat Pakistan on the field of play. Hindu bigots heaped praise on him for showing the country what a 'loyal Muslim' should be. However, he was already being criticised by conservatives - both Muslim and Hindu - for his divorce and subsequent marriage to Sangeeta Bijlani, a Bombay model. On the outside, Azhar remained a diffident figure. But those who know him insist he changed. The globe-trotting, the lavish lifestyle, the adoring crowds, the easy money are all blamed for ruining the one time innocent. Azhar also suffers from a subliminal association with the 'Muslim underground', the criminal empire said to be run by Dawood Ibrahim from his safe haven in the Gulf. There is little that goes wrong in India that some people are not prepared to lay at Dawood's doorstep; his alleged links with just about every powerful figure in Indian life - from politics to cinema to sport - keep conspiracy theorists working overtime. As the Prabhakar tapes confirmed, Dawood is a real presence in cricket, and has appeared in both the Indian and Pakistani dressing rooms. But if there is a specific link between Azhar and Dawood - as former Indian captain Ravi Shastri alleges in the Prabhakar tapes - it has nothing to do with Islam and everything to do with money. Azhar is a creature of the culture of individual acquisitiveness that swept through the upper echelons of Indian society in the 1990s. In business, politics and culture, it was the decade of hype and hustle, a scramble for scarce privileges in a poverty-blighted society. A packaged patriotism was married to a deregulated business environment, and Azhar was only one of many pulled into the resultant maelstrom. As rumour followed rumour, Kapil Dev found his hitherto unchallenged public standing hopelessly compromised. Journalists began publishing some of the things they had already known for a long time, particularly about Kapil's business affairs. The Gujerat state government announced that it was ordering the removal from school text books of a chapter celebrating the great all-rounder. In early September, Kapil was interrogated by the CBI, and pressure built up for him to resign as coach of the Indian team. This was a delicate matter for the cricket board. How do you rid yourself discreetly of a tainted national hero? Everyone wanted Kapil to go, but no one wanted to be seen to push him out. So the board reportedly floated rumours that it might be looking for a replacement, then publicly denied the rumours and invited Kapil to remain in charge. Besieged by the media, Kapil submitted his resignation, which was then accepted by the board with a show of regret. Privately, it had been made clear to Kapil that if he delayed any longer, he would have to be sacked. Sharda Ugra described the episode as 'a classic example of Indian cricket's theatre of the absurd' dictated by 'a tragi-comic compromise formula.' The legendary slow bowler and long-time loose cannon Bishen Bedi dismissed Kapil's exit as 'stage managed.' Indian captain Saurav Ganguly was surprisingly terse: 'Frankly, it doesn't matter who the coach is.' The board was said to be divided over how to handle Kapil's disgrace. Having excluded all those players named in the match-fixing imbroglio from the squad for the ICC Trophy (which meant no places for Azhar or Jadeja), it seemed strange that the axe should not also fall on the national coach. But then, the axe had also spared two other individuals involved in the tax raids - the powerful Dalmiya and the board treasurer Kishore Rungta. 'What happens to the board officers will indicate the intent and extent of Indian cricket's clean-up,' commented a still sceptical Ugra. As for Kapil, the once vivacious and uncomplicated competitor has slunk away from the public eye, wounded and bewildered. 'I cannot explain anything,' he told a journalist. 'You are free to write what you wish. I have nothing to say. Let me be. Please.' Shortly after Pakistan's elected government was ousted by a military dictatorship last year, Lt General Tauqir Zia was installed as head of the cricket board, assisted by a phalanx of army and air force personnel. For the current military rulers, cricket serves much the same purposes as it served their predecessors, generals Zia Ul Haq and Ayub Khan: an instrument for legitimising the regime and for distracting the masses. It is also, now, a means for the military to demonstrate its main justification in the eyes of the people - its claim that it will root out the corruption that bedevilled the civilian system. So far there's little evidence of improvement, in cricket or elsewhere. It was in Pakistan that the match-fixing scandal began in 1994, when Salim Malik was accused of attempted bribery by Shane Warne and Mark Waugh (who, it later emerged, had themselves accepted payment from bookies). Nearly six years later, after three inquiries supervised by the cream of the Pakistani judiciary, the result is that former captain Salim Malik and medium-pacer Ata-ur-Rehman have been banned for life (their international careers were finished in any case). Six others, including Wasim Akram, Saeed Anwar, Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed, have been fined amounts between $2,000 and $6,000. The fines will be deducted from their match fees. Judging by the published reports, the case against Akram seemed much weightier than the one made out against Ata-ur-Rehman. Akram remains, however, a key member of the side. Colonel (Retd) Rafi Nasim, a former head of the cricket board and now a columnist for a daily newspaper, declared that the fines 'will act as a last nail in the coffin of match fixing as far as Pakistan is concerned. Of all the countries allegedly involved in this evil practice Pakistan was the most prompt as well as logical in dealing with this issue.' Not everyone agrees. A citizen has lodged a petition in the Sindh High Court calling for all the players named in the final report to be banned from the game and prosecuted for criminal offences. Turning from tragedy to farce, Pakistani cricket has recently been rocked by one of its rare sex scandals. Or at least that' s how the local press have reported it. Three promising international cricketers were found in the company of of a number of young women in the team's Karachi hotel rooms on the eve of their flight to a tournament in Singapore. The players insisted that the women were fans who had barged their way in, and the manager says his investigation confirms their story. Nonetheless, they have each been fined \u00a3800 and banned from the ICC tournament in Kenya. Lt General Zia explained: 'I had to strike a balance as PCB chairman and that I did without destroying the careers of the players. I have penalised the players for their indiscretion although there was no evidence against them.' So although the alleged perpetrators of this poor excuse for a sex scandal were declared innocent, they were still fined some two thirds of the amount that was levied on players acused, and found guilty, of match-fixing. The popular all-rounder Shahid Afridi, one of the three players who may or may not have committed a minor misdemeanour in the Karachi hotel, bewailed his predicament. 'My father, mother and brothers have been very critical of my actions. They have been reprimanding me. None of them are ready to believe me. I am at a loss as to what my action should be. Those who raised this false allegation have managed to establish it as a truth. However, I can swear by God to prove my innocence.' Unfortunately for Afridi, many Pakistani (and Indian) cricketers have made similar declarations in recent years, and too often they have proved hollow.... Today, in India and Pakistan, people follow the unfolding match-fixing scandals, and see in cricket a vivid picture of a malaise that blights both their societies: the lawlessness of the rich, the unaccountability of the powerful, the cynical manipulation of public institutions and popular spectacles for private gain. But that is not all they see in cricket. If the England players make the most of their opportunities, what they'll experience once they've wandered outside the luxury hotel perimeter is the world's most fervent grass-roots cricket culture. It's only when you watch a gang of raggedy kids construct a wicket from a couple of bricks on a gravel-strewn vacant lot next to a shanty town, and then watch them play a pick-up game with fire and flair worthy of a one-day international, that you realise the creative intensity of south Asian cricket, and the scale of its betrayal. \u0095 Mike Marqusee is the author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties (Verso, paperback) which has been voted one of 25 'Books to Remember, 1999' by the New York Public Library.

Enki Bilal, the designer of this brutal setting, is a cult creator of bandes dessin\u00e9es , the comic strips that the French take more seriously than we do. Bilal's nightmare of a society controlled by ruthless androids depicts Verona as a sci-fi dystopia or a present-day police state. </p> <p>This is how the Albanian-French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj interprets Romeo and Juliet : not as tragic young love reconciling warring families, but as doomed defiance of oppression. Romeo and his gang emerge from the margins of the set, creatures of the underclass. They can be 'disappeared' by the secret police without account. Mercutio will be tortured to death; Romeo's suicide obliterated; Juliet's death hushed up. </p> <p>Preljocaj is a radical dance-maker in the way that he rethinks what the body can say.

      "bodyText": "Romeo and Juliet Ballet Preljocaj, Sadler's Wells, London EC1 Bedlam/Aletta Collins Lilian Baylis Theatre, London EC1 Prokofiev's blaring chords in the Romeo and Juliet overture give way to the thump of helicopter blades; searchlights sweep the stage as an armed guard patrols a high-level walkway. Enki Bilal, the designer of this brutal setting, is a cult creator of bandes dessin\u00e9es , the comic strips that the French take more seriously than we do. Bilal's nightmare of a society controlled by ruthless androids depicts Verona as a sci-fi dystopia or a present-day police state. This is how the Albanian-French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj interprets Romeo and Juliet : not as tragic young love reconciling warring families, but as doomed defiance of oppression. Romeo and his gang emerge from the margins of the set, creatures of the underclass. They can be 'disappeared' by the secret police without account. Mercutio will be tortured to death; Romeo's suicide obliterated; Juliet's death hushed up. Preljocaj is a radical dance-maker in the way that he rethinks what the body can say. Most choreographers try to reflect Shakespeare's imagery in non-verbal poetry: the young lovers swoop, sigh and exchange ecstatic embraces. Preljocaj shows the physical craving that no words can express. His sex addicts devour each other with a hunger that goes beyond mere appetite. Romeo has no time for romance.

The plan, a rival to the \u00a33m bid backed by Halton Borough Council, is the brainchild of a Nepalese multi-millionaire who made his money from selling Indian food in Britain. An artist's impression of the scheme shows only half the story: The idea is to incorporate the towers into a new syncretic centre of unified Hindu, Buddhist and Tantric worship. The millionaire is said to have visited Wembley in 1989 for the Sherpa Van Trophy final between Bolton and Torquay, since when he has wanted to recreate the binding 'venue of legends' spirit in rural Nepal. 'He's a big fan of the beautiful towers,' says a bid insider. 'He believes they will bring great peace and happiness to our people, as they have done in Brent for 77 years.' An FA spokesman denied knowledge of the scheme and said the artist's impression looked 'remarkably like the new menu cover from the Wembley Tandoori'. </p> <p><strong> Win: top tickets, top night</strong> </p> <p>Just hours before demolition begins, Wembley will host a massive New Year's Eve-style farewell bash: tickets are on sale now (020 8947 1881), but we've a top-of-the-range pair to give away. The 'AXA Final Ball' event on 2 November will see 2,000 celebrities celebrating the personal achievements of sportsmen and women at the stadium, and raising \u00a31m for the NSPCC'S Full Stop campaign. To win our exclusive pair of seats for the night, priced at \u00a33,000, answer this: </p> <p>What was the name of the white horse in the 1923 White Horse final? a) Billie b) Alf c) Trevor? </p> <p>Send your answer and details to AXA Final Ball, Observer Sport, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1M 5RS. </p> <p> <strong> Other news: Jesus, panties and bras</strong> </p> <p>Atletico Madrid president Jesus Gil - who, as predicted here two weeks ago sacked his twenty-third manager on Monday and appointed his 24th - has been answering charges of frittering $800,000 of club money on women's underwear and photos of Franco. Gil was challenged over the expenses last week by administrators investigating Atletico's debts. They found 150 million pesetas had been spent on dubious items - with baby clothes, perfume and kitchen accessories among the other items on Gil's list of essentials. Gil, though, says they were gifts for visiting officials. 'No one told me there was a prohibition on panties and bras,' Gil told the court. He also justified the redecoration of one of his houses with club funds, denied alleged illegal financing of his political party GIL, and refuted allegations of misuse of funds in his role as flamboyant mayor of Marbella. The entertaining hearing goes on. </p> <p><strong> The longest ball: part two</strong> </p> <p>Jamie Clapham to Mark Venus - 25 million miles: was it the longest ball ever played? Not according to a strangely large volume of responses to last week's item. Although Tim Stevens of London missed the point by offering Sheffield United's Curtis Woodhouse (Cumbria) to Bruno Ribiero (north Brazil) at 4,689 miles - falling 24.99 million miles short - Gavin Huggett's 26.5m light years from Tottenham's Justin Edinburgh to Ramon Vega (the brightest star in the Lyra constellation) looks unbeatable. (Baz Sheridan's theological bender from Socrates to Jesus was disqualified.) </p> <p><strong>Win: Sportal trip to San Siro</strong> </p> <p>British web company Sportal - producers of last summer's Euro 2000 website - have launched their Champions League shirt sponsorship of Juventus and juventus.com by offering S&amp;D readers a chance to see Juve play AC Milan later this month. The trip to the San Siro for the 21 October game includes flights and a four-star hotel. To enter, answer this: euro2000.org received 1.41 billion hits, making the site officially the most popular football website in internet history. But how many punters mistyped and made euro200.org - a blank purple page - almost as popular? a) 9,816, b) 21,281, c) 54,075.

Ranieri is said to be 'desperate' to build up his midfield in the wake of Roberto Di Matteo's injury - Real Madrid's Savio remains a target. </p> <p><strong> TOON CLOSE ON ACUNA</strong>Newcastle have had a \u00a31m bid for controversial Chilean midfielder Clarence Acuna accepted. Acuna spent two weeks on trial from Universidad de Chile last month - Bobby Robson followed up with a bid yesterday after Man City expressed their interest. Personal terms and a work permit, though, could be a problem. </p> <p><strong> SAINTS SPLASH CASH</strong>Southampton boss Glenn Hoddle has made a club record \u00a32m bid to land Dundee's Scotland B keeper Robert Douglas. Hoddle wants to replace struggling Paul Jones, and placed the bid after Celtic showed an interest. Hoddle could finance the deal by selling club icon Matt Le Tissier to Crystal Palace. </p> <p>Jens Nowotny's \u00a315m move from Bayer Leverkusen to <strong> Arsenal </strong> could go through this week after the defender spoke of his admiration for Arsenal's pitches.

A \u00a310m deal for Portuguese star Rui Costa is still under discussion. </p> <p> \u0095 Colin Hendry has slammed <strong> Coventry </strong> for running a hate campaign against him: 'I am a big boy but being booed and jeered is not on.' </p> <p> \u0095 Jim Smith says he'll be sacked soon unless <strong> Derby</strong> start winning. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong> Everton </strong> are battling Aston Villa in the race to sign Liverpool reject Steve Staunton. </p> <p> \u0095 Gert Verheyen says he still hopes to join <strong> Ipswich </strong> despite Bruges rejecting two bids: 'I've set my mind on playing for Ipswich'. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong> Leeds </strong> youngster Alan Maybury could make his loan move to Crewe permanent. </p> <p> \u0095 Peter Taylor says <strong> Leicester</strong> won't be spending again until the EU secure the transfer market. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong> Liverpool </strong> have offered Michael Owen a new 10-year deal. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong> Man City </strong> want Chilean star Clarence Acuna on trial. </p> <p> \u0095 Hamburg winger Mehdi Mahdavikia has refused to join <strong> Manchester United</strong>. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong> Middlesbrough </strong> are battling Leeds to land Australian Simon Colosimo. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong> Newcastle </strong> are keen on Wrexham midfielder Carlos Edwards. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong> Southampton </strong> are favourites to land Sheffield Wednesday's Andy Hinchcliffe. </p> <p> \u0095<strong> </strong> Milton Nunez says life in <strong> Sunderland </strong> isn't as bleak as he expected: 'I'm enjoying it.

Send your answer and details to AXA Final Ball, Observer Sport, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1M 5RS. Other news: Jesus, panties and bras Atletico Madrid president Jesus Gil - who, as predicted here two weeks ago sacked his twenty-third manager on Monday and appointed his 24th - has been answering charges of frittering $800,000 of club money on women's underwear and photos of Franco. Gil was challenged over the expenses last week by administrators investigating Atletico's debts. They found 150 million pesetas had been spent on dubious items - with baby clothes, perfume and kitchen accessories among the other items on Gil's list of essentials. Gil, though, says they were gifts for visiting officials. 'No one told me there was a prohibition on panties and bras,' Gil told the court. He also justified the redecoration of one of his houses with club funds, denied alleged illegal financing of his political party GIL, and refuted allegations of misuse of funds in his role as flamboyant mayor of Marbella. The entertaining hearing goes on. The longest ball: part two Jamie Clapham to Mark Venus - 25 million miles: was it the longest ball ever played? Not according to a strangely large volume of responses to last week's item. Although Tim Stevens of London missed the point by offering Sheffield United's Curtis Woodhouse (Cumbria) to Bruno Ribiero (north Brazil) at 4,689 miles - falling 24.99 million miles short - Gavin Huggett's 26.5m light years from Tottenham's Justin Edinburgh to Ramon Vega (the brightest star in the Lyra constellation) looks unbeatable. (Baz Sheridan's theological bender from Socrates to Jesus was disqualified.) Win: Sportal trip to San Siro British web company Sportal - producers of last summer's Euro 2000 website - have launched their Champions League shirt sponsorship of Juventus and juventus.com by offering S&amp;D readers a chance to see Juve play AC Milan later this month. The trip to the San Siro for the 21 October game includes flights and a four-star hotel. To enter, answer this: euro2000.org received 1.41 billion hits, making the site officially the most popular football website in internet history. But how many punters mistyped and made euro200.org - a blank purple page - almost as popular? a) 9,816, b) 21,281, c) 54,075.

Tales from the Tabs RANIERI'S \u00a37M SWOOPNew Chelsea boss Claudio Ranieri last night lodged a \u00a33m bid for Deportivo La Coruna's Savisa Jokanovic and made a \u00a34m salary offer to AC Milan reject Zvonimir Boban. Ranieri is said to be 'desperate' to build up his midfield in the wake of Roberto Di Matteo's injury - Real Madrid's Savio remains a target. TOON CLOSE ON ACUNANewcastle have had a \u00a31m bid for controversial Chilean midfielder Clarence Acuna accepted. Acuna spent two weeks on trial from Universidad de Chile last month - Bobby Robson followed up with a bid yesterday after Man City expressed their interest. Personal terms and a work permit, though, could be a problem. SAINTS SPLASH CASHSouthampton boss Glenn Hoddle has made a club record \u00a32m bid to land Dundee's Scotland B keeper Robert Douglas. Hoddle wants to replace struggling Paul Jones, and placed the bid after Celtic showed an interest. Hoddle could finance the deal by selling club icon Matt Le Tissier to Crystal Palace. Jens Nowotny's \u00a315m move from Bayer Leverkusen to Arsenal could go through this week after the defender spoke of his admiration for Arsenal's pitches. 'They have 10 pitches which is very interesting,' says Nowotny. A deal for B93 Copenhagen's young right-back Per Kroldrup is also close, as is the arrival of Feyenoord keeper Jerzy Dudek. \u0095 Aston Villa will reopen talks for Sheffield Wednesday's wantaway Belgian Gilles De Bilde tomorrow. \u0095 Bradford have been knocked back by Everton in their attempt to sign Richard Dunne - Sunderland and Middlesbrough are also keen. \u0095 Charlton have denied making a \u00a32m bid for Leicester's Frank Sinclair. \u0095 Christian Panucci has told Chelsea he'd like to play for Real Madrid instead: 'Whenever I hear of Real, it raises the hairs on the back of my neck.' A \u00a310m deal for Portuguese star Rui Costa is still under discussion. \u0095 Colin Hendry has slammed Coventry for running a hate campaign against him: 'I am a big boy but being booed and jeered is not on.' \u0095 Jim Smith says he'll be sacked soon unless Derby start winning. \u0095 Everton are battling Aston Villa in the race to sign Liverpool reject Steve Staunton. \u0095 Gert Verheyen says he still hopes to join Ipswich despite Bruges rejecting two bids: 'I've set my mind on playing for Ipswich'. \u0095 Leeds youngster Alan Maybury could make his loan move to Crewe permanent. \u0095 Peter Taylor says Leicester won't be spending again until the EU secure the transfer market. \u0095 Liverpool have offered Michael Owen a new 10-year deal. \u0095 Man City want Chilean star Clarence Acuna on trial. \u0095 Hamburg winger Mehdi Mahdavikia has refused to join Manchester United. \u0095 Middlesbrough are battling Leeds to land Australian Simon Colosimo. \u0095 Newcastle are keen on Wrexham midfielder Carlos Edwards. \u0095 Southampton are favourites to land Sheffield Wednesday's Andy Hinchcliffe. \u0095 Milton Nunez says life in Sunderland isn't as bleak as he expected: 'I'm enjoying it. Now I just hope to get a chance in the first team.' \u0095 Celtic have made a new \u00a31m enquiry for Tottenham's Ian Walker - George Graham wants \u00a31.5m. \u0095 West Ham have sent scouts to check on Wigan keeper Roy Carroll - Leicester, Newcastle and Liverpool will rival any bid.",

      "body": "<p>Sheffield Wednesday's season-ticket holders received renewal forms in the summer emblazoned with the slogan: Get your Premier League return ticket. Oh dear. Nine games into the campaign some fans are questioning in which year they intend to return. Or even which century. At the moment it's looking more like a super saver direct to Division Two. </p> <p>Wednesday are bottom of the pile, picking from the remains of a squad the manager confesses is a considerable distance short of ideal, and crippled by debt. After a fans' forum last week, the faithful called for the board to quit. Celebrity supporter Martyn Ware, of new romantic pop fame, mused: 'I came out of the meeting with the smell of decay and death in my nostrils.' From Heaven 17 to the undertakers via Hillsborough. </p> <p>The club are ailing, with symptoms that supporters fear are serious. The cause is a desperate lack of funds. Despite being spinelessly relegated last spring, the team had the seventh highest wage bill in the Premiership and the board immediately set about whittling it down. Eleven players have been offloaded, nine on free transfers. The gallows humorists reckon that if anybody comes in with a decent offer for the goalposts, Wednesday will gladly flog them. </p> <p>What is left of the squad comprises moderate buys, loan signings and kids. If Aaron Lescott, a \u00a3100,000 arrival from Aston Villa's reserves, makes his first appearance today against West Brom he will be the thirteenth player to make his Wednesday debut this season. The fans don't recognise their team. 'Ideally, some of these players wouldn't be anywhere near the first team,' admits their manager, Paul Jewell. 'Some would barely get in the reserves if the club were strong. For the game at Tranmere it was so bad that if you were fit and over 16 you were in the squad. I've got to put 11 on the pitch somehow. My hands are tied.' </p> <p>When Robbie Fowler was due to make his comeback against Wednesday's reserves, the game was cancelled as they couldn't raise a side. </p> <p>The future doesn't bear thinking about. The past is simply tormenting, the good old days making the fall from grace even more unfathomable. A week ago, Hillsborough ambled down memory lane for David Hirst's testimonial, and nostalgia flooded back. In the early Nineties, Wednesday played in Europe, in Wembley Cup finals, swooned to the skills of Chris Waddle and Trevor Francis, and average gates approached 30,000. </p> <p>Hirst was once one of the most coveted strikers in the land, subject of a \u00a33.5 million bid from Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford (which would have smashed the transfer record). It was faxed directly back with a 'Not for sale' sign attached. </p> <p>How attitudes have changed. Today, any hands proffering a few bob for the likes of internationals Gilles de Bilde and Wim Jonk would be snapped off. But as chairman Howard Culley laments: 'There is no magic solution that makes people come in and bid for your players.' The seeds of financial despair were sown when Wednesday's demise wiped the value off a clutch of talented, handsomely paid foreigners. Their pair of rebellious Italian artists, Paolo Di Canio and Benito Carbone, abandoned ship for a fraction of their true worth. Brazilian defender Emerson Thome, sold to Chelsea for \u00a32.5 million, left the Bridge six months later for \u00a34.5 million. Lively Swede Niclas Alexandersson was transferred to Everton for a bargain \u00a32.5 million. </p> <p>How quickly does Jewell want to complete the purge of unaffordable staff? Today. Painful process though it is, at least it would give the team a clean slate to start again, without the dissenting vibes of big shots with bad attitudes. 'The whole club needs a change of thought process,' explains the former Bradford manager. 'I've come from a team where every player gave their best every day in training and were desperate to get in that team. Here, people lack a little bit of discipline, good basics. I've got to re-educate people and that takes time. </p> <p>'When I first walked in the door, you could hear a pin drop. It was really negative, there was so much apathy. Now there is more noise, more character, more fun if you like. I think people actually enjoy coming to training. They don't enjoy being bottom of the league. But as bad as we have been we are capable of performing 10 times better than we have shown. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact we've still got some good players here.' </p> <p>Jewell is remarkably chipper all things considered. Joe Kinnear, a previous target of the Wednesday board, had turned the job down after his pleas to delay selling experienced players until some points were in the bank were ignored. It sounded a sensible enough plan, and as it is Wednesday are left with a minuscule squad and minimum points. Jewell accepts the situation and hopes endeavour and positive spirit will turn things around. </p> <p>There is pathos in this sorry tale. Both Jewell and Culley are decent men trying to do their best in unenviable jobs. But the supporters worry that this may not be enough. Dan Gordon, vice chairman of the Wednesday Independent Supporters Club, fears a noose is tightening round the club's neck. 'Nobody can see where the next win is coming from. At Hirsty's testimonial, the team of the early Nineties were better than the one now, which shows how far we've sunk. Accountants who have examined the financial statements say the club is insolvent. I feel Howard Culley is in over his head. What the club need is some vision and imagination. Whether anyone is capable of that I don't know.' </p> <p>Culley responds: 'The job is difficult enough to do without having to fight our own supporters. I think we're doing the right things and it's very early to judge us or our management team. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel and it's an old football saying that nobody gets relegated in October. We've got to climb out of the danger zone and I don't blame people for saying we can't wait too long.' </p> <p>Jewell believes he is a third of the way down the road to manipulating his players around to his methods. By that thinking they should have turned the corner by Christmas. 'I don't know what year Christmas,' he laughs, keeping that chin up while those around him feel like singing the blues. </p> <p>Maybe someone pointed out the circus was setting up over the road at Hillsborough Park.</p>",

Despite being spinelessly relegated last spring, the team had the seventh highest wage bill in the Premiership and the board immediately set about whittling it down. Eleven players have been offloaded, nine on free transfers. The gallows humorists reckon that if anybody comes in with a decent offer for the goalposts, Wednesday will gladly flog them. What is left of the squad comprises moderate buys, loan signings and kids. If Aaron Lescott, a \u00a3100,000 arrival from Aston Villa's reserves, makes his first appearance today against West Brom he will be the thirteenth player to make his Wednesday debut this season. The fans don't recognise their team. 'Ideally, some of these players wouldn't be anywhere near the first team,' admits their manager, Paul Jewell. 'Some would barely get in the reserves if the club were strong. For the game at Tranmere it was so bad that if you were fit and over 16 you were in the squad. I've got to put 11 on the pitch somehow. My hands are tied.' When Robbie Fowler was due to make his comeback against Wednesday's reserves, the game was cancelled as they couldn't raise a side. The future doesn't bear thinking about. The past is simply tormenting, the good old days making the fall from grace even more unfathomable. A week ago, Hillsborough ambled down memory lane for David Hirst's testimonial, and nostalgia flooded back. In the early Nineties, Wednesday played in Europe, in Wembley Cup finals, swooned to the skills of Chris Waddle and Trevor Francis, and average gates approached 30,000. Hirst was once one of the most coveted strikers in the land, subject of a \u00a33.5 million bid from Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford (which would have smashed the transfer record). It was faxed directly back with a 'Not for sale' sign attached. How attitudes have changed. Today, any hands proffering a few bob for the likes of internationals Gilles de Bilde and Wim Jonk would be snapped off. But as chairman Howard Culley laments: 'There is no magic solution that makes people come in and bid for your players.' The seeds of financial despair were sown when Wednesday's demise wiped the value off a clutch of talented, handsomely paid foreigners. Their pair of rebellious Italian artists, Paolo Di Canio and Benito Carbone, abandoned ship for a fraction of their true worth. Brazilian defender Emerson Thome, sold to Chelsea for \u00a32.5 million, left the Bridge six months later for \u00a34.5 million. Lively Swede Niclas Alexandersson was transferred to Everton for a bargain \u00a32.5 million. How quickly does Jewell want to complete the purge of unaffordable staff? Today. Painful process though it is, at least it would give the team a clean slate to start again, without the dissenting vibes of big shots with bad attitudes. 'The whole club needs a change of thought process,' explains the former Bradford manager. 'I've come from a team where every player gave their best every day in training and were desperate to get in that team. Here, people lack a little bit of discipline, good basics. I've got to re-educate people and that takes time. 'When I first walked in the door, you could hear a pin drop. It was really negative, there was so much apathy. Now there is more noise, more character, more fun if you like. I think people actually enjoy coming to training. They don't enjoy being bottom of the league. But as bad as we have been we are capable of performing 10 times better than we have shown. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact we've still got some good players here.' Jewell is remarkably chipper all things considered. Joe Kinnear, a previous target of the Wednesday board, had turned the job down after his pleas to delay selling experienced players until some points were in the bank were ignored. It sounded a sensible enough plan, and as it is Wednesday are left with a minuscule squad and minimum points. Jewell accepts the situation and hopes endeavour and positive spirit will turn things around. There is pathos in this sorry tale. Both Jewell and Culley are decent men trying to do their best in unenviable jobs. But the supporters worry that this may not be enough. Dan Gordon, vice chairman of the Wednesday Independent Supporters Club, fears a noose is tightening round the club's neck. 'Nobody can see where the next win is coming from. At Hirsty's testimonial, the team of the early Nineties were better than the one now, which shows how far we've sunk. Accountants who have examined the financial statements say the club is insolvent. I feel Howard Culley is in over his head. What the club need is some vision and imagination. Whether anyone is capable of that I don't know.' Culley responds: 'The job is difficult enough to do without having to fight our own supporters. I think we're doing the right things and it's very early to judge us or our management team. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel and it's an old football saying that nobody gets relegated in October. We've got to climb out of the danger zone and I don't blame people for saying we can't wait too long.' Jewell believes he is a third of the way down the road to manipulating his players around to his methods. By that thinking they should have turned the corner by Christmas. 'I don't know what year Christmas,' he laughs, keeping that chin up while those around him feel like singing the blues. Maybe someone pointed out the circus was setting up over the road at Hillsborough Park.",

      "body": "<p>The Jim Leighton affair has threatened to introduce some dreaded discord to Craig Brown's well-established Scotland squad serenity - and perhaps even create a morale-damaging schism. It was the last thing Brown needed as his squad prepared for what he considers to be their most demanding World Cup qualifier, against Croatia in Zagreb on Wednesday.</p> <p> Yet, from the available evidence, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that Brown carried the trouble over his own threshold.

      "bodyText": "The Jim Leighton affair has threatened to introduce some dreaded discord to Craig Brown's well-established Scotland squad serenity - and perhaps even create a morale-damaging schism. It was the last thing Brown needed as his squad prepared for what he considers to be their most demanding World Cup qualifier, against Croatia in Zagreb on Wednesday. Yet, from the available evidence, it is impossible to escape the conclusion that Brown carried the trouble over his own threshold. By inviting Leighton, Scotland's most-capped goalkeeper with 91 appearances, to join the group as a goalkeeping coach to the under-21 side, Brown virtually guaranteed that the previously happy camp would be riven by controversy and acrimony. The manager was aware of the bad blood that has existed between Leighton and the senior goalkeeping coach, Alan Hodgkinson. Leighton has held Hodgkinson culpable for influencing the manager to choose Andy Goram ahead of him in Euro 96 and in subsequent matches. Leighton has always found it difficult to reconcile himself to the fact that he was regarded as second best, apparently failing to consider the reality that it was, in all cases, ultimately Brown's decision. It has also been public knowledge for some time that Leighton had commissioned the 'ghosting' of his autobiography, in which he would publish retaliatory criticism of several figures he believed had wronged him - including Hodgkinson and Brown himself. The serialisation of the book begins today in the Sunday Mail, who recognised that maximum publicity would be generated by starting with the chapter on Hodgkinson. In defending his decision to ask Leighton to join the party, Brown insisted that the notion had occurred to him after Leighton led a 'session' with the under-21 team in Latvia last month, where he was covering the Scots' opening World Cup qualifier as a summariser for BBC Radio 5 Live. Brown also said that he had been assured by Leighton that nothing in the Mail serialisation would embarrass the SFA while they were on the expedition to San Marino and Croatia. These were unconvincing claims and what seemed much more plausible was the whisper that circulated later - and hinted at the real reason for Leighton's startling appearance at Glasgow Airport on Thursday afternoon kitted out in the uniform of the official party. It is said that Ebbe Skovdahl, the Aberdeen manager for whom Leighton works as a goalkeeping coach, had turned down the latter's request to make the trip to San Marino and Croatia as a radio commentator. Skovdahl was then allegedly persuaded by Brown to relent for an official one-off arrangement that would allow Leighton to continue his normal work with Ryan Esson, the young Aberdeen goalkeeper. Brown himself admitted to phoning Skovdahl and to the fact that the Dane was initially reluctant to allow Leighton to make the trip, but he stopped short of confessing that he had recruited Leighton merely as a favour. And Brown took pains to scotch a darker rumour - emphasising that he had categorically assured the Yorkshireman that there was no threat to his position as senior goalkeeping coach. Hodgkinson was so upset by the presence of Leighton that he eschewed the usual first-night banter on a trip in favour of an early night. By Friday morning, Hodgkinson was quite animated in his anger. It was decided then, by Brown and the association's chief executive, David Taylor, that it would be appropriate if Leighton were relieved of his duties and moved out of the team's hotel to take up his job in the media. As Brown had known since last weekend's blurb in the Sunday Mail that serialisation of the autobiography was to start today, it would have been a simple matter to call Leighton and postpone his appointment. Now comes the crunch. Having seen Croatia, including talented midfielder Robert Prosinecki, draw 0-0 with Belgium in Brussels, Brown has no doubt they are the keenest rivals in Group 6.

The highest-earning specialities include heart surgery, plastic surgery and gynaecology. William Laing, chairman of the private medicine analysts Laing &amp; Buisson, said: 'I know there are some, but they are few in number. There are a far larger number earning over \u00a3500,000 a year'. </p> <p>Jerry Gilmore, a top consultant surgeon in Harley Street, is thought to be one of the highest earners. Gilmore, who specialises in breast cancer, is reputed in private medical circles to earn more than \u00a31 million a year. The Observer was unable to contact him for comment. </p> <p>Last year, around 600,000 operations were carried out in private hospitals. The number has risen in recent years as disillusionment with NHS waiting times has grown. </p> <p>Standard fees for surgeons are \u00a32,170 for a heart bypass operation, \u00a32,140 to remove a brain tumour, \u00a31,045 for a mastectomy, \u00a3825 for a hip replacement, and \u00a3645 for a hysterectomy. Doctors in high demand in London can push up their fees further. </p> <p>Laing said that, with these kinds of fees, earning a million a year was perfectly feasible. 'Suppose they earn \u00a32,000 an operation and have 200 working days a year, they'd have to average two-and-a-half operations a day to make a million pounds. That's certainly possible.' </p> <p>Private hospitals and health insurers, who have to pay the bills, have become increasingly dismayed by the growing incomes of private doctors. David Ashdown, director of communications at private insurer WPA, said: 'The trouble is you get expensive doctors, and the hospitals and people can't afford it. People then give up private health.' </p> <p>Until recently the rates for private operations were set by the British Medical Association, but insurers have now succeeded in implementing their own standard rates. However, doctors have resisted by boosting their salaries in other ways. </p> <p>Dr Adrian Bull, medical director of PPP Healthcare, said: 'Some doctors have started to add things on. Before they would just charge for a hernia, whereas now they might also charge for 'dividing adhesions' when they are operating - that's an extra charge sometimes made to inflate the overall bill. We need more clarity in what patients are paying for.' </p> <p>Another increasingly common practice is that doctors charge separately for the outpatient follow-up for an operation, which used to be included in the whole bill. </p> <p>Consultants who work exclusively in the NHS earn about \u00a360,000 a year. However, many boost their earnings with private work, doubling their salary on average. The private earnings of doctors who work in the NHS has always been a source of controversy, and the Government is trying to clamp down.

Certainly too old to wear a bikini, probably too old to take up free fall parachuting, but no way too old to scuba dive. Moments later, I was committed to a course in the Cayman Islands. Friends expressed envy but I knew the learning curve would be difficult. I am naturally more terrestrial than aquatic and diving, unlike most adventure sports, is potentially life-threatening from the start. </p> <p>With 5,000 centres around the world, Padi is the most widely recognised of several dive training organisations. Passing the basic open water diver course is the key to the deep, allowing you to rent scuba equipment and go diving without an instructor. Padi stands for Professional Association of Diving Instructors or, less reverentially, Put Another Dollar In, a reference to the extensive list of more advanced courses pressed on successful students. Candidates for the basic qualification must pass an exam based on the Padi Diver Manual and complete five confined and four open water dives. If all goes well, this takes four days, rather too large a chunk of holiday to spend in school. A better option is the referral system, which allows you to do the classwork and the confined dives at home, then finish the course in the resort. </p> <p>So we gathered in Wembley for a long, hot Saturday of Americanised video tuition, followed by a water-logged Sunday in a swimming pool in Essex. Our teacher, Mike Harrison, was patience personified as he coaxed us into the unwieldy equipment and positioned us on the bottom of the pool to practise our skills. It was possible, he insisted, to remove and replace the regulator (breathing mouthpiece) without choking. Ditto the mask. Or even to take off the kit altogether and replace it underwater. The Padi course is geared to worst-case scenarios. What if your tank got jammed in a wreck? Or your mask flipped off by a passing shark? </p> <p>Under water, forewarned is forearmed, but there are extreme penalties for failure. What of nitrogen narcosis, which can result in 'foolish' behaviour at depth, or decompression sickness, which can numb, paralyse or even kill? The answers lie in calculating safe depths and appropriate surface intervals between dives. By the time we flew to Grand Cayman, we knew the score. </p> <p>After a night in the Hyatt Hotel patronised by Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman in the film The Firm, we ate a nervous breakfast and gathered on the jetty for our inaugural open water dive with Red Sails Sports. Our instructor was Renee, an ebullient Canadian who inspired confidence from the start, and we were soon geared up and stumbling awkwardly towards the brink. The moment for the 'giant stride', the flippered step into the sea, had come. Masks and regulators held firmly with one hand, weight belts with the other, we launched ourselves and discovered the equipment, so unwieldy on shore, is weightless in the water. </p> <p>That was the first miracle. The second was the reef. Inquisitive sergeant majors, disdainful spotlight parrotfish and iridescent queen trigger fish milled around us as we tried to maintain proper buoyancy above the vibrant plant life embedded in the gnarly coral. Don't touch, we'd been warned, not only because damaged coral regenerates at an infinitesimally slow speed, but also because it is slightly poisonous. Within 30 minutes, we were back on the surface, triumphant and ready for a second attempt, longer and deeper, with sightings of bulky grouper fish, a golden eel, briefly tempted out of a rock crevice by Renee, and a million or so tiny yellowtail snapper. Two dives down, two to go. </p> <p>Had the next day not been Renee's day off, things might have worked out differently. As it was, we were passed to Mark, also Canadian, but aggressively macho. He launched into the things he would require of us if we were to qualify. We were on rough seas on a dive boat that resembled a factory ship. We were in the presence of experienced divers. Insensitively, Mark took us down to 60ft, as deep as unqualified divers are allowed to go, and put us through the skill tests required for open water dive three. </p> <p>On the final dive, which requires a full mask removal and replacement, I swallowed half the ocean and was choking so badly that Mark had no alternative but to abort my dive. I had to rely on him to assess the speed that would get me to the surface without either drowning or decompression sickness. As I coughed and struggled, he yelled for help to remove the equipment and eventually I was heaved back on board in total disarray. Mark's note to the clinic cited 'frothy yellowish/pinkish foam' coming from my lungs in a 'near drowning', but luckily the ascent had been slow enough for the doctor to pass me fit to try again. </p> <p>The next day, we visited Stingray City with Ashton Ebanks, an amenable Cayman Islander who was persuaded I wouldn't drown in 10ft of water. The rays are so well geared up for tourists they throw themselves into your arms as they target Ashton's bait. Harmless nurse sharks were eager to share the bonanza. </p> <p>The question of the diving qualification was still hanging over me when I arrived in Rarotonga two weeks later. Owned by New Zealander Greg Wilson, Cook Island Divers is an endearingly yesteryear operation, a group of people hanging out cheerfully for the love of the sport.

This was startling news. The Pimlico Road is generally known for the grossly over-priced antiques shops flogging pointlessly gilded nick-nacks to the inbred, snorting Chelsea girls with too much money and not enough taste who live nearby. It is where you go for an emergency rococo mirror. It is not where you go for great Chinese food.</p> <p>Except, of course, that according to the punters who contribute to Harden's, it is. And they are right, though God knows how they found it in the first place. Hunan is not a glossy establishment and you could quite easily miss it. Which I and my companion Robert almost did. </p> <p>Once, Robert was a banker, but, as he puts it, greed forced a career change upon him - during incessant business lunches he began to find the food more interesting than the business under discussion. And so he became a restaurateur instead. Certainly he is a man who knows his Chinese food. He even claims to possess a recipe for bear's paw 'in the Hunanese style'. 'Though it says you can substitute beef for bear' - helpful given that Robert lives in east London, which is a bit light on wild bears these days. </p> <p>There may or may not be bear's paw on the menu at Hunan. To be honest, we gave it very little attention save to note that, for a Chinese restaurant, it is exceptionally short. We had been advised, both by Harden's and the waiters, to place ourselves in the hands of the owner, Mr Pang. He would see us right, we were told. And he did. </p> <p>Mr Pang is probably the only acquired taste at Hunan. He tends to hover a little, looking for your approval and grinning like an indulgent nanny as each dish arrives. But then, when the food is this good, who can blame him? We gave him few directions, save that we didn't mind a bit of chilli - useful as its a key flavour in Hunanese food - and that a bit of seafood wouldn't go amiss. Mr Pang grinned some more.</p> <p>We began with little bamboo mugs of a steaming, aromatic broth heavy with pigeon breast that had been steamed and then minced. (We know this because we asked; a friend of mine, who is a non-meat eater and a regular at Hunan, only discovered that he has been eating pigeon for years when he and I compared notes.) Next came minced chicken in a sweet chilli sauce to be wrapped in crisp lettuce leaf. That was followed by the best, sweetest prawn toast I have ever tasted.</p> <p>It should be said that none of these dishes were huge; each was little more than a forkful, so that there was space for the next. When we asked for a bowl of rice with which to soak up the sauces, Mr Pang almost refused. 'It will fill you up,' he said with disdain. He didn't want that. The kitchen was only just getting into it's stride. </p> <p>There were green beans in a light batter with chilli and salt. Four gorgeous dinky mushrooms came stuffed with minced pork and topped with a sesame crust. There were slices of pork fillet in a sweet unctuous sauce that remained crisp despite being served en papillote. Then came two perfectly formed dumplings stuffed with spinach, water chestnut and sweet basil. We know this because Mr Pang insisted that we identify them. Robert got them all; I trailed in behind with just the spinach.</p> <p>The next dish, shredded duck with plum sauce and pancakes, was the only slightly duff note. The perfectly rendered crispy dusk had been swamped in a sweet chilli sauce. No matter. As a palate cleanser there was a dish of fresh spring vegetables and one of chicken, stir fried in a very different and chilli sauce. (A warning: don't go to Hunan if you're not keen on chillies; it would be like someone with a fear of heights going up the Eiffel Tower.) </p> <p>For pudding we shared a light and delightfully bland almond jelly - exactly what was needed after such a massive assault of flavour. There is no doubt that, with Mr Pang's help, we pushed the boat out and the bill for \u00a372, which included service and a few beers, reflects that. But give Mr Pang a budget and I'm sure he'd keep to it. Just don't ask him for the menu. Mr Pang does not hold with menus.</p> <p>Hunan, 51 Pimlico Road, London SW1 (020 7730 5712).

As catalysts of regeneration, they don't always work. </p> <p>But as things stand few businesses would dream of coming to Rotherham or South Yorkshire. This is because skills levels here are among the worst in the country. A workforce whose members for generations were guaranteed a job didn't need to pay any attention at school. Their children, seeing how their dads were thrown on the scrapheap with no alternative offered, gave up. The result? A deep socio-economic crisis. </p> <p>In Grimethorpe, home to the famous colliery brass band, heroin and crack pose serious problems for this small, resilient community. Residents in sink estates outside Doncaster literally air their dirty washing for all to see as whey-faced kids roam the streets with nothing to do. And the last time Rotherham hit the front pages? The discovery last year that a 12-year-old girl was expecting a baby fathered by a 14-year-old boy. </p> <p>During the past 15 years there have been various attempts to regenerate South Yorkshire after an estimated 160,000 workers lost jobs in the coal, steel and engineering industries. The Tories, having destroyed 'the enemy within', set up City Challenge funds to rebuild communities. The trouble was, these initiatives placed the emphasis on bricks and mortar regeneration assuming that businesses would flock to the area to take up the slack once foundations were in place. They didn't. </p> <p>After Tory Minister Michael Heseltine rang the death knell of the coal industry in 1992, an emergency package of aid was set up. This included Single Regeneration Budget funds. The trouble is that rival regions compete for funds and more than half the applicants fail. The failures are normally from communities that do not have the resources to plough into a coherent bid - the very communities which SRB funds are there to help. </p> <p>Swept to power on a wave of optimism in 1997, the Labour Party pledged to revitalise depressed coal mining communities. Its response to the Coalfields Taskforce was considered to be the most important step forward for England's mining communities for decades. </p> <p>Three years later, progress has been made. The Government has set up the Coalfield Regeneration Trust with \u00a355m to plough into community-led initiatives over three years. One year down the line, grants worth \u00a320m have been committed. It is now crucial that the CRT extends its funding for another three years. Negotiations are ongoing. </p> <p>The Government has allowed English Partnerships, the regeneration quango, to assume control of most of the coalfields to fast-track redevelopment. </p> <p>But progress in transferring the coalfields has been held up by lease complications and a recent EU judgment which ruled government intervention on regeneration sites as 'anti-competitive'. </p> <p>The Government has set a framework by which South Yorkshire can fight back, but what could really make a difference to the region is a \u00a3700m EU Objective One grant announced last July which, as it has to be, will be matched by another \u00a3700m from the Government. </p> <p>Objective One grants are given to areas deemed to be poverty stricken, and there are many Yorkshire folk who see the windfall as confirmation of abject failure. Action plans by the local Regional Development Agency, Yorkshire Forward, are being fine-tuned, but most money will be spent on education, training and employment opportunities. </p> <p>Objective One cash, despite having lost \u00a350m in value since the collapse of the euro, is seen by those in the area as its last chance to get itself on an even keel. </p> <p>'EU enlargement means that other countries will get it in the future,' explained Mike Bower, acting deputy director of the Yorkshire's Objective One project team. 'We won't get this amount of cash from Europe again.' </p> <p>If handled correctly, this cash could lever another \u00a3400m of public and private money into the area, making a total of \u00a31.8 billion. That it might be wasted is the great fear preoccupying South Yorkshire. </p> <p>'Inevitably, we'll get duplication on the ground. With so many agencies, local councils, employment organisations, training bodies, it gets very complicated. I don't know the answer,' said Sara Turton, Yorkshire Forward's Learning &amp; Skills manager. </p> <p>But for those who have been thrown on the scrapheap, egos, corruption and inefficiency cannot be tolerated. This is South Yorkshire's last chance. It must not be blown. </p> <p><strong>Carving out a new living</strong></p> <p>It would take a hard man not to be inspired by the Wildwood project next to the former Bentley mine in South Yorkshire. The project was set up last year with \u00a3250,000 of grants from the Church Urban Fund, Coalfield Regeneration Trust and the John Paul Getty Junior Trust. </p> <p>The initiative trains the long-term unemployed in making furniture from recycled wood. Later this month, it is forecast that Wildwood will scoop a Chambers of Trade Investors in People award. </p> <p>The project is currently driven by the vicar of Bentley and a former deputy managing director of the Scotsman newspaper group. </p> <p>In this financial year, Wildwood has turned over \u00a39,000 in sales. It has got a long way to go to be self-financing. </p> <p>But it has just won a contract to supply a local museum with exhibition cabinets, is identifying other niche markets and is talking to retail partners to sell products ranging from mahogany dining tables, toy boxes and garden furniture. </p> <p>Such is the energy and drive pulsing through Wildwood that you don't think those involved in it will allow it to fail. </p> <p>Graduates from its courses have either been employed within the company or have found employment outside it. Only two have given up, both through ill-health.</p> <p><strong>Retraining delivers jobs</strong></p> <p>With numbers in the coal and steel industries slashed, unions have found it hard to adapt to the post-industrial age. </p> <p>But ISTC, the principal steel union, has over the last year increased its numbers by 7 per cent to nearly 35,000 thanks to retraining ex-steel workers. It is the first time a British union has taken this approach - using a model which came from the United States. </p> <p>Staffed largely by redundant steel workers, its new body, the Steel Training Partnership, counsels those put out of work, offers them training and tries to find them new jobs. </p> <p>The organisation is held back by a lack of IT teachers and the sheer number needing help. </p> <p>In Rotherham, STP has found people jobs in tree surgery, product auditing and telecommunications, and helped a number of non-union members to study for childcare qualifications.</p>",

But progress in transferring the coalfields has been held up by lease complications and a recent EU judgment which ruled government intervention on regeneration sites as 'anti-competitive'. The Government has set a framework by which South Yorkshire can fight back, but what could really make a difference to the region is a \u00a3700m EU Objective One grant announced last July which, as it has to be, will be matched by another \u00a3700m from the Government. Objective One grants are given to areas deemed to be poverty stricken, and there are many Yorkshire folk who see the windfall as confirmation of abject failure. Action plans by the local Regional Development Agency, Yorkshire Forward, are being fine-tuned, but most money will be spent on education, training and employment opportunities. Objective One cash, despite having lost \u00a350m in value since the collapse of the euro, is seen by those in the area as its last chance to get itself on an even keel. 'EU enlargement means that other countries will get it in the future,' explained Mike Bower, acting deputy director of the Yorkshire's Objective One project team. 'We won't get this amount of cash from Europe again.' If handled correctly, this cash could lever another \u00a3400m of public and private money into the area, making a total of \u00a31.8 billion. That it might be wasted is the great fear preoccupying South Yorkshire. 'Inevitably, we'll get duplication on the ground. With so many agencies, local councils, employment organisations, training bodies, it gets very complicated. I don't know the answer,' said Sara Turton, Yorkshire Forward's Learning &amp; Skills manager. But for those who have been thrown on the scrapheap, egos, corruption and inefficiency cannot be tolerated. This is South Yorkshire's last chance. It must not be blown. Carving out a new living It would take a hard man not to be inspired by the Wildwood project next to the former Bentley mine in South Yorkshire. The project was set up last year with \u00a3250,000 of grants from the Church Urban Fund, Coalfield Regeneration Trust and the John Paul Getty Junior Trust. The initiative trains the long-term unemployed in making furniture from recycled wood. Later this month, it is forecast that Wildwood will scoop a Chambers of Trade Investors in People award. The project is currently driven by the vicar of Bentley and a former deputy managing director of the Scotsman newspaper group. In this financial year, Wildwood has turned over \u00a39,000 in sales. It has got a long way to go to be self-financing. But it has just won a contract to supply a local museum with exhibition cabinets, is identifying other niche markets and is talking to retail partners to sell products ranging from mahogany dining tables, toy boxes and garden furniture. Such is the energy and drive pulsing through Wildwood that you don't think those involved in it will allow it to fail. Graduates from its courses have either been employed within the company or have found employment outside it. Only two have given up, both through ill-health. Retraining delivers jobs With numbers in the coal and steel industries slashed, unions have found it hard to adapt to the post-industrial age. But ISTC, the principal steel union, has over the last year increased its numbers by 7 per cent to nearly 35,000 thanks to retraining ex-steel workers. It is the first time a British union has taken this approach - using a model which came from the United States. Staffed largely by redundant steel workers, its new body, the Steel Training Partnership, counsels those put out of work, offers them training and tries to find them new jobs. The organisation is held back by a lack of IT teachers and the sheer number needing help. In Rotherham, STP has found people jobs in tree surgery, product auditing and telecommunications, and helped a number of non-union members to study for childcare qualifications.",

      "body": "<p>During the first 50 years of American cinema, blacks were assigned the roles of maids, waiters, porters and cheerful slaves content with their lot. The great dancer, Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson, was only allowed on screen in his late fifties to dance with Shirley Temple; America's greatest black actor, Paul Robeson, had to come to Britain to find parts worthy of him.</p> <p>Today, Hollywood is full of black stars - James Earl Jones, Danny Glover, Morgan Freeman, Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington, the list goes on. What happened in between? The answer is Sidney Poitier, who was both a beneficiary of, and significant contributor to, social change. Freeman generously acknowledged the debt he and his generation owed him when Poitier received the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award in 1992.</p> <p>After the Second World War, Hollywood made biopics celebrating black-face singer Al Jolson and produced problem pictures starring white actors about blacks passing for white. Then in No Way Out (1950) Joseph L Mankiewicz broke the mould by casting the unknown 26-year-old Poitier as a black intern confronted by racist hoodlum Richard Widmark in an American city on the brink of inter-racial warfare. It was a strong role in a film so outspoken for its time that it wasn't shown in the South and was censored in some northern states.</p> <p>The tall, handsome, quietly spoken Poitier gave substance to a saintly, forgiving character, whose banked-up anger was expressed through those hypnotic eyes that penetrate and interrogate his antagonists and his audience. This was the first of a succession of understanding doctors, lawyers, social workers, teachers and cops that he was to embody over the next 20 years. They made him the first black superstar, 'an actor for all races' as one observer called him.</p> <p>His three finest films of the 50s were Richard Brooks's The Blackboard Jungle (1955), where he was an angry but sympathetic pupil at a New York trade school challenging Glenn Ford as the representative of a prejudiced social system; Martin Ritt's Edge of the City (1957), in which he befriended a bewildered John Cassevetes on the New York waterfront and had a showdown with racist foreman Jack Warden; and Stanley Kramer's preachy but hard-hitting The Defiant Ones (1959), which brought him an Oscar nomination as a convict on the run chained to racist redneck Tony Curtis.</p> <p>His best roles of the 60s were the sardonic journalist sussing out cold warrior Richard Widmark aboard a US warship in The Bedford Incident (1965), and Virgil Tibbs, the supercool homicide detective tangling with dim-witted Southern sheriff Rod Steiger in Norman Jewison's In The Heat of the Night (1967). But the movie that brought him an Oscar was Ralph Nelson's Lilies of the Fields (1963), a sentimental tale of a kindly itinerant labourer helping a party of East German nuns in Arizona.</p> <p>Self-parody continued with Kramer's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, a reductio ad absurdum of the earnest liberal movie in which Spencer Tracy has trouble deciding whether he'll allow his daughter to marry Poitier, a doctor of international renown with impeccable manners, on the point of winning a Nobel Prize. This smug movie appeared during the most contentious days of the civil rights movement and strident Black Power leaders called Poitier an 'Uncle Tom'.</p> <p>But in 1957 he had become the nation's third biggest box-office star, and as he said: 'I'm the only Negro actor who works with any degree of regularity.

      "body": "<p>They lay, mothballed, at the very bottom of the trunk: a hussar's jacket covered with Ruritanian silver braiding; an absurdly flounced pink dress. Pillaging my children's former dressing-up clothes recently for contributions to the local primary school's play box, I paused to catch hold of a memory fainter than the whiff of camphor drifting from their folds. I was three or four years old, tucked under a mosquito net on the wide verandah of our home in Calcutta; my parents, rigged out for a fancy dress ball, had come to say goodnight. </p> <p>A parental apparition, frilled and epauletted like something off a Quality Street chocolate box, would have seemed nothing much out of the ordinary at No 2 Mayfair, Ballygunge. Like tea at Flury's or watching the blur of blue and white silk that was my father on the Tollygunge Club racecourse, it was part of the non-stop party that was postwar, pre-Independence, British Calcutta. It would be Ayah's job to sing me and my younger brother back to sleep: ' Nini, baba, nini; roti, makkhan, chini (Sleep child, sleep; bread, butter, sugar).' </p> <p>One of the last children of the Raj, I was just old enough to remember the party's final fling: birthdays at the Calcutta Saturday Club, Christmas on the beach at genteel Gopalpur-on-Sea; the Tibetan traders in scarlet felt boots and silver amulets who squatted on the steps of our retreat in Kalimpong, smoking pipes, chunks of turquoise and coral woven through their hair. </p> <p>With my father heading the Calcutta office of a large tea company, my parents were transitional figures who stayed on for several years after India celebrated her independence. They loved Calcutta and had many Indian friends, one of whom, writing my mother's obituary last year, remembered her as 'an extraordinary woman', nothing akin to the 'haughty and condescending creature' that had been the stereotypical Burra Memsahib of his youth during the last two decades of the Raj. </p> <p>Well before dysentery banished us, aged four and six respectively, to the alien planet known as Home, my brother and I had spent a memorable day riding round Calcutta on a lorry draped with green and orange flags. ' Jai Hind!' we shouted: 'Victory to India!' After that, and very properly so, nothing would be the same. </p> <p>In February I returned to Calcutta with my husband John. It had taken me more years than I cared to count to persuade him to visit my grimy old birthplace. I looked forward to sharing not only what was left of the city of sugar-coated childhood memory but whatever bread and butter realities had overtaken it since my last visit. We would start by finding the house with the big verandahs. Ballygunge remains a middle-class residential area, but street names had changed and the driver seemed uncertain, negotiating the traffic with worrying lack of concentration. Pulling up at last at the ancestral portals, he opened the door and was sick all over the pavement. Less of a political statement than the reaction of someone who had overdone things at a niece's wedding the night before, this gesture struck John as extremely funny. Like the state of No 2 Mayfair - equally the worse for wear, its flaking walls daubed with a scarlet hammer and sickle - the omens did not augur well for a sentimental journey. </p> <p>Driving down Chowringhee, I struggled to identify landmarks. Could that weed-sprouting ruin have been the stately Whiteaway Laidlaw &amp; Co, or perhaps the Army &amp; Navy, twin founts of knitting wool and pith helmets? Wasn't that gap site once occupied by the eighteenth-century Bihar Palace, later the English governor's residency? 'It was felt to take up a lot of space,' said our guide vaguely. Only the green shutters remained of Firpos, a former grande dame of a restaurant now in the last stages of senile dementia. </p> <p>Across the road lay the Maidan, Calcutta's 2,000-acre central park, its cast of kite fliers, horsemen, marching cadet scouts and impromptu cricketers eerily unchanged. On my first return to Calcutta, in my twenties, I had learnt to ride here or, rather, tried to. 'Relax, Memsahib!' cried my hosts' exasperated Sikh groom. 'Think of Shakespeare!' was positively his last throw though not, alas, mine. In the languid sunshine of a February morning, the Maidan's riders and runners, the man with the rifle and balloon-covered sandwich board, the feeders of sacred rats, the brisk members of the Calcutta Ladies' Golf Club, looked as though they might just have taken up their activities again after 30 years of suspended animation. </p> <p>A wedding party came caracoling past as we emerged from the Gothic cathedral where I had been searching out the memorial to my uncle, a High Court judge. Bollywood<strong> </strong> music blared from a bicycle-driven ghetto blaster; the groom, marigold-garlanded and wearing a tasselled headdress, swayed uneasily on a thin white pony, his youngest male relative riding pillion. 'No Tax on Love,' shouted the hoardings above his head; 'Bumchums Anytime Wear', 'Pollution is Killing Us, Slowly but Surely.' Sentimentality can be pretty lethal stuff too. Slowly, I began to recognise the whole nostalgia exercise for what it was, a piece of dusty self-indulgence that, however flimsy, threatened to mask the city's vivid, raucous, contemporary self. We were wasting good Calcutta (make that Kolkata) time. </p> <p>Leaning over the Sealdah flyover, we watched a stream of humanity, many thousands strong, pouring on foot along Bowbazar Street into the city centre. 'The River of People,' murmured our young guide. What he really wanted to show us was a statue of the physicist and botanist Sir J.C. Bose, 'inventor of the radio seven years before Marconi'; the memorials to Calcutta's five Nobel laureates; yet another statue of the radical freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Who could blame modern Kolkata, repository of Bengal's fierce nationalist and intellectual inheritance, for having more on its mind than the preservation of pigeon-splashed imperial relics? </p> <p>Though, even in this area, public opinion seemed to be changing. Over breakfast we read in the feisty Calcutta Telegraph, a condemnation of the Central Public Works Department's thriving black-market trade in antique railings, door jambs and window frames looted from hundreds of derelict sites. The 1813 town hall, due for resurrection as the Museum of Calcutta, had already had a facelift and looked good; so did the Victorian High Court. Even the statues of former viceroys, including Lord Curzon and Sir Robert Peel, were said to be on their way back from banishment to reinstatement on the Calcutta waterfront where, it was optimistically predicted, a chain of heritage hotels would soon join them. This city still has plenty to offer connoisseurs of the British past: regal canvases by the acre in the Victoria Memorial; the handsome eighteenth-century frontage of Government House; a handful of Georgian churches. </p> <p>My mother and the legal uncle were enthusiastic foragers through the New Market, the Thieves' Bazaar, the dusty bookstalls of Dhurramtollah Street. I thought of them as we rummaged round the second-hand bookstacks that line the university quarter. Here, my mother found a battered novel entitled Hartly House, Calcutta which she later edited. First published in 1789, it records the girlish effusions of fictional Sophia Goldborne, newly arrived in the East India Company's capital. Sophia's experiences made companionable holiday reading. She casts off her stays, learns to drink a bottle of claret a day and falls in love with 'a young Brahmin', the nephew of her father's notary. Neither her father nor, apparently, any of the British official circles in which she moved appear to have disapproved of this alliance, nor of Sophia's espousal of the Gentoo (Hindu) faith. The Calcutta of the early Company days had not yet acquired the racial snobberies of the Raj. </p> <p>Sophia notices 'a new church erecting, on quite an European model, with galleries, a set of bells and every suitable etcetera'. She forms 'very high expectations of the superstructure' and is right to do so. I was glad to be reacquainted with some of St John's suitable etceteras: the Zoffany Last Supper , depicting British Calcutta's city fathers as the 12 apostles; the tomb of Mrs Frances Johnson who, at 13, married the first of her four husbands, the irresistibly named Parry Purple Templer. Like us, Sophia was affected by the well-turned walks of South Park Street Cemetery, whose classical monuments stand witness to the ravages of cholera, childbirth, shipwreck and melancholia among the appallingly youthful ranks of incomers. Almost every epitaph begins on the lines of: 'If ever tears deservedly were shed...' </p> <p>But wherever we travelled - and that included a startlingly efficient modern underground system - Calcutta elbowed nostalgia out of the frame. Poverty? Of course. Abject poverty? We had seen much worse in Central Africa. Overwhelmed by its energy, Edward Lear called Calcutta Hustlefussabad. Beyond the lawns of the Tollygunge Club where he (and we) stayed, the streets heave with activity: with sugar-cane crushers, sellers of paan and plaster goddesses, shoeshiners, barbers, sorters of scrap paper and worshippers at pavement shrines; stalls totter under piles of lentils and spark plugs, floral-patterned tin trunks, clay pots and day-old chicks. </p> <p>Goats and mangy dogs, children swinging trays of teacups from bamboo poles, rickshaws laden with 12 mattresses at a time dice insouciantly with death in the roaring traffic lanes. Images of transcendent beauty remain: piles of tuberoses in the flower market, the parrot-coloured silks of a student festival, the lovers sitting on a bank in the Botanic Gardens like figures from a willow pattern plate. </p> <p>Totting up the members of my family who spent at least part of their working lives in India, I can count seven generations, not always direct forebears but a wavering line stretching back to the late eighteenth century. One had fought in the Maratha Wars, a campaign during which the troops had been warned not to stop cannon balls with their feet. An 18-year-old ensign had perished in the Mutiny, now widely known as the First War of Independence.

      "bodyText": "They lay, mothballed, at the very bottom of the trunk: a hussar's jacket covered with Ruritanian silver braiding; an absurdly flounced pink dress. Pillaging my children's former dressing-up clothes recently for contributions to the local primary school's play box, I paused to catch hold of a memory fainter than the whiff of camphor drifting from their folds. I was three or four years old, tucked under a mosquito net on the wide verandah of our home in Calcutta; my parents, rigged out for a fancy dress ball, had come to say goodnight. A parental apparition, frilled and epauletted like something off a Quality Street chocolate box, would have seemed nothing much out of the ordinary at No 2 Mayfair, Ballygunge. Like tea at Flury's or watching the blur of blue and white silk that was my father on the Tollygunge Club racecourse, it was part of the non-stop party that was postwar, pre-Independence, British Calcutta. It would be Ayah's job to sing me and my younger brother back to sleep: ' Nini, baba, nini; roti, makkhan, chini (Sleep child, sleep; bread, butter, sugar).' One of the last children of the Raj, I was just old enough to remember the party's final fling: birthdays at the Calcutta Saturday Club, Christmas on the beach at genteel Gopalpur-on-Sea; the Tibetan traders in scarlet felt boots and silver amulets who squatted on the steps of our retreat in Kalimpong, smoking pipes, chunks of turquoise and coral woven through their hair. With my father heading the Calcutta office of a large tea company, my parents were transitional figures who stayed on for several years after India celebrated her independence. They loved Calcutta and had many Indian friends, one of whom, writing my mother's obituary last year, remembered her as 'an extraordinary woman', nothing akin to the 'haughty and condescending creature' that had been the stereotypical Burra Memsahib of his youth during the last two decades of the Raj. Well before dysentery banished us, aged four and six respectively, to the alien planet known as Home, my brother and I had spent a memorable day riding round Calcutta on a lorry draped with green and orange flags. ' Jai Hind!' we shouted: 'Victory to India!' After that, and very properly so, nothing would be the same. In February I returned to Calcutta with my husband John. It had taken me more years than I cared to count to persuade him to visit my grimy old birthplace. I looked forward to sharing not only what was left of the city of sugar-coated childhood memory but whatever bread and butter realities had overtaken it since my last visit. We would start by finding the house with the big verandahs. Ballygunge remains a middle-class residential area, but street names had changed and the driver seemed uncertain, negotiating the traffic with worrying lack of concentration. Pulling up at last at the ancestral portals, he opened the door and was sick all over the pavement. Less of a political statement than the reaction of someone who had overdone things at a niece's wedding the night before, this gesture struck John as extremely funny. Like the state of No 2 Mayfair - equally the worse for wear, its flaking walls daubed with a scarlet hammer and sickle - the omens did not augur well for a sentimental journey. Driving down Chowringhee, I struggled to identify landmarks. Could that weed-sprouting ruin have been the stately Whiteaway Laidlaw &amp; Co, or perhaps the Army &amp; Navy, twin founts of knitting wool and pith helmets? Wasn't that gap site once occupied by the eighteenth-century Bihar Palace, later the English governor's residency? 'It was felt to take up a lot of space,' said our guide vaguely. Only the green shutters remained of Firpos, a former grande dame of a restaurant now in the last stages of senile dementia. Across the road lay the Maidan, Calcutta's 2,000-acre central park, its cast of kite fliers, horsemen, marching cadet scouts and impromptu cricketers eerily unchanged. On my first return to Calcutta, in my twenties, I had learnt to ride here or, rather, tried to. 'Relax, Memsahib!' cried my hosts' exasperated Sikh groom. 'Think of Shakespeare!' was positively his last throw though not, alas, mine. In the languid sunshine of a February morning, the Maidan's riders and runners, the man with the rifle and balloon-covered sandwich board, the feeders of sacred rats, the brisk members of the Calcutta Ladies' Golf Club, looked as though they might just have taken up their activities again after 30 years of suspended animation. A wedding party came caracoling past as we emerged from the Gothic cathedral where I had been searching out the memorial to my uncle, a High Court judge. Bollywood music blared from a bicycle-driven ghetto blaster; the groom, marigold-garlanded and wearing a tasselled headdress, swayed uneasily on a thin white pony, his youngest male relative riding pillion. 'No Tax on Love,' shouted the hoardings above his head; 'Bumchums Anytime Wear', 'Pollution is Killing Us, Slowly but Surely.' Sentimentality can be pretty lethal stuff too. Slowly, I began to recognise the whole nostalgia exercise for what it was, a piece of dusty self-indulgence that, however flimsy, threatened to mask the city's vivid, raucous, contemporary self. We were wasting good Calcutta (make that Kolkata) time. Leaning over the Sealdah flyover, we watched a stream of humanity, many thousands strong, pouring on foot along Bowbazar Street into the city centre. 'The River of People,' murmured our young guide. What he really wanted to show us was a statue of the physicist and botanist Sir J.C. Bose, 'inventor of the radio seven years before Marconi'; the memorials to Calcutta's five Nobel laureates; yet another statue of the radical freedom fighter Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Who could blame modern Kolkata, repository of Bengal's fierce nationalist and intellectual inheritance, for having more on its mind than the preservation of pigeon-splashed imperial relics? Though, even in this area, public opinion seemed to be changing. Over breakfast we read in the feisty Calcutta Telegraph, a condemnation of the Central Public Works Department's thriving black-market trade in antique railings, door jambs and window frames looted from hundreds of derelict sites. The 1813 town hall, due for resurrection as the Museum of Calcutta, had already had a facelift and looked good; so did the Victorian High Court. Even the statues of former viceroys, including Lord Curzon and Sir Robert Peel, were said to be on their way back from banishment to reinstatement on the Calcutta waterfront where, it was optimistically predicted, a chain of heritage hotels would soon join them. This city still has plenty to offer connoisseurs of the British past: regal canvases by the acre in the Victoria Memorial; the handsome eighteenth-century frontage of Government House; a handful of Georgian churches. My mother and the legal uncle were enthusiastic foragers through the New Market, the Thieves' Bazaar, the dusty bookstalls of Dhurramtollah Street. I thought of them as we rummaged round the second-hand bookstacks that line the university quarter. Here, my mother found a battered novel entitled Hartly House, Calcutta which she later edited. First published in 1789, it records the girlish effusions of fictional Sophia Goldborne, newly arrived in the East India Company's capital. Sophia's experiences made companionable holiday reading. She casts off her stays, learns to drink a bottle of claret a day and falls in love with 'a young Brahmin', the nephew of her father's notary. Neither her father nor, apparently, any of the British official circles in which she moved appear to have disapproved of this alliance, nor of Sophia's espousal of the Gentoo (Hindu) faith. The Calcutta of the early Company days had not yet acquired the racial snobberies of the Raj. Sophia notices 'a new church erecting, on quite an European model, with galleries, a set of bells and every suitable etcetera'. She forms 'very high expectations of the superstructure' and is right to do so. I was glad to be reacquainted with some of St John's suitable etceteras: the Zoffany Last Supper , depicting British Calcutta's city fathers as the 12 apostles; the tomb of Mrs Frances Johnson who, at 13, married the first of her four husbands, the irresistibly named Parry Purple Templer. Like us, Sophia was affected by the well-turned walks of South Park Street Cemetery, whose classical monuments stand witness to the ravages of cholera, childbirth, shipwreck and melancholia among the appallingly youthful ranks of incomers. Almost every epitaph begins on the lines of: 'If ever tears deservedly were shed...' But wherever we travelled - and that included a startlingly efficient modern underground system - Calcutta elbowed nostalgia out of the frame. Poverty? Of course. Abject poverty? We had seen much worse in Central Africa. Overwhelmed by its energy, Edward Lear called Calcutta Hustlefussabad. Beyond the lawns of the Tollygunge Club where he (and we) stayed, the streets heave with activity: with sugar-cane crushers, sellers of paan and plaster goddesses, shoeshiners, barbers, sorters of scrap paper and worshippers at pavement shrines; stalls totter under piles of lentils and spark plugs, floral-patterned tin trunks, clay pots and day-old chicks. Goats and mangy dogs, children swinging trays of teacups from bamboo poles, rickshaws laden with 12 mattresses at a time dice insouciantly with death in the roaring traffic lanes. Images of transcendent beauty remain: piles of tuberoses in the flower market, the parrot-coloured silks of a student festival, the lovers sitting on a bank in the Botanic Gardens like figures from a willow pattern plate. Totting up the members of my family who spent at least part of their working lives in India, I can count seven generations, not always direct forebears but a wavering line stretching back to the late eighteenth century. One had fought in the Maratha Wars, a campaign during which the troops had been warned not to stop cannon balls with their feet. An 18-year-old ensign had perished in the Mutiny, now widely known as the First War of Independence. One of my grandfathers planted tea; the other, a military chaplain, rejoiced in the Thackerayean moniker of Canon Clough of Jabalpore. As one of the last of this now somewhat un-PC line, I feel immensely privileged when I remember the welcome we had in February: the Indian friends who invited us to a family party at the Bengal Club; the English Stayers On who told us stories of my carefree young parents I had never heard before. The owner of Kewpie's Kitchen in Elgin Lane, Calcutta's hottest new Bengali restaurant, had worked for the same tea company as my father and said he would 'always have a table for anyone called Clough'. 'Happy Journey Mother Dear!' read the cheerily illuminated departures board at Howrah Station as we pursued our porter over a multitude of sleeping bodies towards the Varanasi night train. India may, understandably, have consigned its British past to the same historical fancy dress box that contains the Mongols and the Moguls but I knew that, once again, I was leaving home.

      "body": "<p>Florence is one of those great cultural cities where it is all too easy to get bogged down in guide book 'must see' recommendations, meaning that all you really do is go from sight to sight, spending interminable hours in queues that stretch outside the Renaissance Duomo to the masterpieces of the Uffizi, from the steps leading up to the medieval Palazzo Vecchio, to the 15 visitors at a time who are allowed in every half hour to witness the exceptional pastel frescoes decorating the Medici's chapel. </p> <p>But don't be fooled into thinking that Florence is a kind of living museum: far from it, there is a lively fashion industry here, craftsmen and artisans are flourishing rather than dying out, and there's a vast fun-loving student population, including thousands of foreigners who flock here either to learn Italian or study art. </p> <p>Florence has always been the capital, the birthplace, of Italian gastronomy, offering the chance to eat in grand gourmet restaurants or at the simple red-checked tablecloths of a typical trattoria. </p> <p>The city borders on the great vineyards of Chianti, and there is certainly no lack of wine bars to start trying the local vino, from rough and ready backstreet fiaschetterie bars, to a chic enoteca that will have dozens of wines ready to be tasted by the glass. </p> <p>So for at least a day or so, think shopping rather than sightseeing, be prepared for long, romantic meals rather than grabbing a quick pizza, and rather than collapsing in your hotel in the early evening, save some of your energy to sample Florence's newly revitalised nightlife scene. </p> <p>That way, you will at least have a feeling of having discovered the city of the Florentines rather than the guide book's Florence. </p> <p><strong> Shopping</strong></p> <p> <strong> Perfume</strong> <br> Officina Profumo Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella<br> Via della Scala 16. (0039 055 216 276) </p> <p>Dating back to the sixteenth century, when Dominican friars began experimenting with elixirs and potions, this is no simple 'pharmacy', but the world's oldest perfume maker, near Santa Maria Novella, one of the city's most famous churches. Walking into the frescoed chapel which serves as a showroom, the ambience is more like a museum than a shop, with scores of heady aromas. In the Heath Robinson-like workshops, artisans produce not just perfumes but herbal remedies, soaps, shaving balm and a unique 'eau-de-cologne' based on, of all things, vinegar. Call in advance, and a guided tour can be arranged too. </p> <p> <strong> Silk</strong><br> Antico Setifico Fiorentino<br>Via Bartolini 4. (0039 055 213 861)</p> <p>Just across the Ponte Vecchio, away from all the usual sights, is the peaceful old artisans' neighbourhood of Oltrarno. Down a narrow backstreet, watch out for a minuscule metal sign by an anonymous black metal gate announcing the Antico Setificio Fiorentino, the city's most famous silk-weavers. </p> <p>The moment you step into the verdant courtyard is like going back into the past, as these ateliers and showrooms date back to the eighteenth century, with very little having changed. Noisy wooden looms, hand-operated, produce dazzling, opulent silk and velvet cloth, many in traditional Renaissance designs. Although anyone with the right budget can place an order, their most recent international client was the Kremlin. </p> <p> <strong> Couture</strong><br> Gianfranco Lotti<br> Via Tornabuoni 57. (0039 055 210 226) </p> <p>The Via Tornabuoni could be called the Fashion Avenue of Florence, with beefy security guards, immaculately dressed in black suits, standing to attention outside the likes of Prada, Ferregamo, Trussardi, Versace, Herm\u00e9s, Louis Vuitton, not to mention dozens of priceless jewellers, from Cartier to Bulgari. But hidden amid the globally famous names is a local designer too. Walking into the elegant boutique of Gianfranco Lotti, you come face to face with a perfect reproduction of an ancient Florentine fresco, as if to reassure customers that all the high-fashion leather bags and accessories are actually designed and made in local ateliers. </p> <p> <strong> Fabrics</strong><br> L'Elefante Verde<br> Borgo la Croce 70. (0039 055 234 2882) </p> <p>A couple of minutes' walk behind the Chiesa Santa Croce, well away from the normal shopping circuit, is a jewel of a boutique, the recently opened showroom of local designer Loriana Bergantini. This is only a tiny space but it resembles a treasure chest crammed with exotic fabrics. Signora Bergantini imports beautiful velvet and silk fabrics from Burma, India, China and Japan, then adapts them to her own vividly colourful designs, which range from stylish skirts, jackets and waistcoats, to plush cushions and curtains, bedspreads, bags and scarves. </p> <p> <strong> Paper</strong><br> Giannini Giulio &amp; Figlio<br>Piazza Pitti 37. (0039 055 280 814)</p> <p>While crowds of tourists stream into the Palazzo Pitti, stop off instead in the Aladdin's Cave of master craftsman Giulio Giannini. Since 1856, his family has been operating out of an ancient workshop, right above the boutique, producing hand-made and handprinted paper. Today, there are scores of imitators dotted around the city, but both the quality and inventiveness of Giannini's work sets him apart - hand-sewn leather diaries or sketchbooks, marbled paper books to write down recipes, address and birthday books, even items as simple as a stylish bookmark. </p> <p>Be warned, though, it is impossible to come out of here without buying something. </p> <p> <strong> Eating out</strong></p> <p> <strong> Modern</strong><br> Garga<br> Via del Moro 48. (0039 055 239 8898)</p> <p>Garga is really not like any other dining spot in Florence, and though foodies in-the-know may track it down, its elusive location, hidden away down a dark alleyway, is well off the sightseeing route of most tourists. From the outside it looks like an ordinary trattoria, but walk inside and you enter the rather surrealist world of Giuliano Gargani. </p> <p>Not only is 'Garga' the master chef running the kitchen, but he is an artist too, and has painted the entire restaurant with his psychedelic murals. The cuisine is a modern take on traditional Tuscan dishes, and if you like the food, Garga and his friendly Canadian wife, Sharon, also run a cooking school in a palazzo across the street. </p> <p> <strong> Classic</strong><br> Il Latini<br> Via dei Palchetti 6. (039 055 210 916)</p> <p>Florence is the home of Italian gastronomy, and to sample the the most typical dishes there really is no better place in town than this atmospheric restaurant run by the Latini family. Forget gastronomic pretensions and definitely don't think you're coming here for a quiet, romantic dinner. Queues form the moment the doors open, and although plenty of tourists turn up, you're just as likely to find yourself seated next to local Florentines at one of the noisy, communal, wooden tables. The 80-year-old Narciso Latini slices off hunks of prosciutto crudo behind the bar for those waiting for a table, and don't eat too many of the tantalising appetizers or pasta, as this is the place to try a classic bistecca alla fiorentina , a gigantic T-bone steak. </p> <p> <strong> Chic</strong><br> Cibreo<br> Via del Verrocchio 8. (0039 055 234 1100)</p> <p>Extrovert chef Fabio Picchi runs what many people believe is Florence's finest restaurant, and it is well worth the short trek from the city centre. The restaurant looks out over a lively street market, brimming with fresh Tuscan vegetables. On one side of the street is Cibreo Caffe, perfect for an aperitif, while to enter the restaurant itself, you must pass through the Cibreo Delicatessen, stacked with truffles, olive oil and other irresistible delica cies. There are then two dining rooms, one an unpretentious trattoria, where reservations are not accepted, the other a chic restaurant where smartly dressed waiters effortlessly explain, in any language, the numerous exquisite dishes that arrive, such as passato di pepperoni gialli - a rich soup of yellow peppers - or a delicate ricotta and parmesan souffl\u00e9. </p> <p> <strong> Romantic</strong><br> Osteria del Caffe Italiano<br> Via Isola delle Stinche 11. (0039 055 289 368)</p> <p>Only recently opened, this beautifully restored osteria is a great new find, near the Santa Croce church. Housed on the ground floor of the fourteenth-century Palazzo Salviati, at first it seems you are entering a rather smart wine bar, because at lunchtime, the bar serves mainly Tuscan sausages and cheeses, accompanied by a wide choice of local wines. But past the bar is a refined dining room, just right for a romantic evening meal. The cuisine is excellent, but the real attraction is the incredible wine list - this is the ultimate place to start tasting great Chiantis. They also offer a limited menu for diners arriving late from the theatre or concerts, and there is a selection of solely vegetarian dishes. </p> <p> <strong> Traditional</strong><br> Alla Vecchia Bettola<br> Viale Ariosto 32. (0039 055 224 158)</p> <p>On the other side of the Ponte Vecchio, the Oltrarno is a food lovers' paradise with dozens of simple, reasonably priced restaurants, providing hearty cucina casalinga , home-cooked meals. The best is undoubtedly Alla Vecchia Bettola, away from the traffic-congested main streets, sitting on a quiet tree-lined piazza. Enter this beautifully restored butcher's shop, complete with tiled walls, vast, marble-topped tables and an antique but functioning fogher , an Italian Aga, and it is like discovering Florence a century ago. And the dishes are equally faithful to local customs - topini (mini gnocchi) al pomodoro , huge crunchy crostini Toscani , toasts topped with chicken liver pate, lingua con salsa verde , ox tongue covered with a tart parsley sauce - but make sure you leave enough room for dessert, as the ice creams come direct from the city's finest gelateria , Vivoli. </p> <p><strong> Bars and caf\u00e9s</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Friendly</strong><br> Le Volpe e l'Uva<br> Piazza de'Rossi. (0039 055 239 8132) </p> <p>Thousand of tourists each day stream over the Ponte Vecchio, heading straight for the narrow street that leads to the Palazzo Pitti. But those who know some of the secrets of Florence immediately branch off left after the bridge, into Piazza de'Rossi, a square so tiny it doesn't even feature on most maps. Here is one of Florence's finest and friendliest enotecas, Le Volpe e l'Uva. Tall bar stools surrounding marble tables are always packed outside on the terrace, and the owners, Emilio and Riccardo, will guide you through their ever-changing selection of more than 40 different wines served by the glass. There are delicious bar snacks, too, including a wide choice of Italian cheeses, from the sharp pecorino , a local sheep's cheese, to the delicious Asiago, from the foothills of the Dolomite mountains. </p> <p> <strong> Central </strong> <br> Pork's<br> Piazza del Mercato Centrale. (0039 055 216 184) </p> <p>Florence's bustling morning food market, the Mercato Centrale, is one sight not to be missed, just to witness a real slice of local life as Florentines choose the finest olive oil, freshest mushroom and most delicate hams. Ignore all the tacky stalls selling rip-off leather goods that surround the market - keeping a sharp eye out for pickpockets too - and once inside the mercato , ask any stallholder for directions to Pork's. This is one of several hole-in-the-wall bars where shoppers mix with thirsty butchers, fishmongers and fruit vendors, and everyone tucks into panini bursting with the great Tuscan delicacy, porchetta , crispy roast pork sliced off in big chunks by the genial owner, Franco. </p> <p> <strong> Hip</strong><br> Cabiria, Piazza Santo Spirito 4. (0039 055 215 732)</p> <p>Florence's most fashionable spot for restaurants, caf\u00e9s and late-night bars, is the pretty Piazza Santo Spirito. Here you might see Daniel Day Lewis eating at one of the trendy diners, the Borgo Antico, or wannabe fashion models sitting out on the sunny terrazza of Caffe Ricchi, but the best place to head for, whatever the hour, is the hip bar, Cabiria. </p> <p>Laid-back during the day, the atmosphere heats up and the crowds start to jam the place after dark, when hip hop and house DJs play an eclectic choice of music till three or four in the morning. </p> <p> <strong> After hours</strong><br> Dolce Vita, Piazza del Carmine,5. (0039 055 280 018)</p> <p>Despite a fashionable image and lively student population, Florence is surprisingly quiet after midnight, with few clubs or late-night bars of note. </p> <p>So to catch up with a fun after-hours crowd, head over to the piazza dominated by the baroque Carmine church, where you can't miss the gleaming metal and glass entrance of the Dolce Vita. Although the club's comfortable backrooms, with velvet armchairs and crystal chandeliers, double as a restaurant, the real action at Dolce Vita takes place at the bar and spreads outside on to the terrace. With the DJ starting up around midnight, you'll still find big crowds here in the early hours of the morning.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Florence is one of those great cultural cities where it is all too easy to get bogged down in guide book 'must see' recommendations, meaning that all you really do is go from sight to sight, spending interminable hours in queues that stretch outside the Renaissance Duomo to the masterpieces of the Uffizi, from the steps leading up to the medieval Palazzo Vecchio, to the 15 visitors at a time who are allowed in every half hour to witness the exceptional pastel frescoes decorating the Medici's chapel. But don't be fooled into thinking that Florence is a kind of living museum: far from it, there is a lively fashion industry here, craftsmen and artisans are flourishing rather than dying out, and there's a vast fun-loving student population, including thousands of foreigners who flock here either to learn Italian or study art. Florence has always been the capital, the birthplace, of Italian gastronomy, offering the chance to eat in grand gourmet restaurants or at the simple red-checked tablecloths of a typical trattoria. The city borders on the great vineyards of Chianti, and there is certainly no lack of wine bars to start trying the local vino, from rough and ready backstreet fiaschetterie bars, to a chic enoteca that will have dozens of wines ready to be tasted by the glass. So for at least a day or so, think shopping rather than sightseeing, be prepared for long, romantic meals rather than grabbing a quick pizza, and rather than collapsing in your hotel in the early evening, save some of your energy to sample Florence's newly revitalised nightlife scene. That way, you will at least have a feeling of having discovered the city of the Florentines rather than the guide book's Florence. Shopping Perfume Officina Profumo Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella Via della Scala 16. (0039 055 216 276) Dating back to the sixteenth century, when Dominican friars began experimenting with elixirs and potions, this is no simple 'pharmacy', but the world's oldest perfume maker, near Santa Maria Novella, one of the city's most famous churches. Walking into the frescoed chapel which serves as a showroom, the ambience is more like a museum than a shop, with scores of heady aromas. In the Heath Robinson-like workshops, artisans produce not just perfumes but herbal remedies, soaps, shaving balm and a unique 'eau-de-cologne' based on, of all things, vinegar. Call in advance, and a guided tour can be arranged too. Silk Antico Setifico Fiorentino Via Bartolini 4. (0039 055 213 861) Just across the Ponte Vecchio, away from all the usual sights, is the peaceful old artisans' neighbourhood of Oltrarno. Down a narrow backstreet, watch out for a minuscule metal sign by an anonymous black metal gate announcing the Antico Setificio Fiorentino, the city's most famous silk-weavers. The moment you step into the verdant courtyard is like going back into the past, as these ateliers and showrooms date back to the eighteenth century, with very little having changed. Noisy wooden looms, hand-operated, produce dazzling, opulent silk and velvet cloth, many in traditional Renaissance designs. Although anyone with the right budget can place an order, their most recent international client was the Kremlin. Couture Gianfranco Lotti Via Tornabuoni 57. (0039 055 210 226) The Via Tornabuoni could be called the Fashion Avenue of Florence, with beefy security guards, immaculately dressed in black suits, standing to attention outside the likes of Prada, Ferregamo, Trussardi, Versace, Herm\u00e9s, Louis Vuitton, not to mention dozens of priceless jewellers, from Cartier to Bulgari. But hidden amid the globally famous names is a local designer too. Walking into the elegant boutique of Gianfranco Lotti, you come face to face with a perfect reproduction of an ancient Florentine fresco, as if to reassure customers that all the high-fashion leather bags and accessories are actually designed and made in local ateliers. Fabrics L'Elefante Verde Borgo la Croce 70. (0039 055 234 2882) A couple of minutes' walk behind the Chiesa Santa Croce, well away from the normal shopping circuit, is a jewel of a boutique, the recently opened showroom of local designer Loriana Bergantini. This is only a tiny space but it resembles a treasure chest crammed with exotic fabrics. Signora Bergantini imports beautiful velvet and silk fabrics from Burma, India, China and Japan, then adapts them to her own vividly colourful designs, which range from stylish skirts, jackets and waistcoats, to plush cushions and curtains, bedspreads, bags and scarves. Paper Giannini Giulio &amp; Figlio Piazza Pitti 37. (0039 055 280 814) While crowds of tourists stream into the Palazzo Pitti, stop off instead in the Aladdin's Cave of master craftsman Giulio Giannini. Since 1856, his family has been operating out of an ancient workshop, right above the boutique, producing hand-made and handprinted paper. Today, there are scores of imitators dotted around the city, but both the quality and inventiveness of Giannini's work sets him apart - hand-sewn leather diaries or sketchbooks, marbled paper books to write down recipes, address and birthday books, even items as simple as a stylish bookmark. Be warned, though, it is impossible to come out of here without buying something. Eating out Modern Garga Via del Moro 48. (0039 055 239 8898) Garga is really not like any other dining spot in Florence, and though foodies in-the-know may track it down, its elusive location, hidden away down a dark alleyway, is well off the sightseeing route of most tourists.

Amid the hills of slag, vast buildings and cranes rise out of a flat wasteland, punctuated occassionally by grinding open conveyor belts and pools of filthy water. But for all its dreariness, the mine and its 7,500 miners, who produce half of all Serbia's coal, is a place resonant in Serbian folk lore. It was here the Serbs fought and won their most famous victory of the First World War, when they turned back the Austro-Hungarian army.</p> <p>The Kolubarska Bitka - the Kolubara Battle - became part of modern nationalist mythology when Dobrica Cosic featured it in his novel Time of Death. Today the mine is being celebrated for a different reason: as the place that finally brought down Slobodan Milosevic; as Serbia's own Gdansk.</p> <p>If the beginning of the end of Slobodan Milosevic's bloody reign came anywhere, it was not in the dreary corridors of power, nor in the cramped offices of the Yugoslav electoral commission which tried to steal last month's elections, but under the vast arc lights of Kolubara where Milosevic made his most serious mistake, misinterpreting the mood of a group of workers he had relied on throughout his regime.</p> <p>That mistake, as he clung on to power in his last days, was to send his army chief of staff General Nebojsa Pavkovic late last Monday night to try to persuade the striking miners to stop their protests. The general is the son of a miner. Milosevic's hope was that this would help him talk the miners' language and tell them their strike was counter-productive.</p> <p>It backfired. Instead it was the miners who did the talking, persuading the man who controls the Yugoslav armed forces that their anger and determination was such that to use force against them would be too risky.</p> <p>As Pavkovic travelled between the different areas of the huge open-cast pit he was politely received. Crucially, however, the miners refused to promise they would halt their action. And following behind him was a second military figure whose presence was to prove the key to holding the strike. This man was General Momcilo Perisic, Pavkovic's predecessor as chief of the general staff, sacked by Milosevic early on in the Kosovo crisis after warning the President that it was futile to use the army as a tool of repression there. Now Perisic was standing with the Opposition. His interventions over the next week - first with the miners then with his former army colleagues as hundreds of thousands took to the streets of Belgrade - would prove his ex-master's undoing.</p> <p>'I got to two sections of the mine after Pavkovic and managed to firm up their line,' he told The Observer yesterday. 'Then I moved on to the third section and talked to the men there shortly before Pavkovic arrived. As a result, he didn't even get a hearing. They whistled and refused to listen'.</p> <p>It was both a lesson and a humiliation for Pavkovic, an ultra-loyalist, who was totally dependent on the President. His wife is related to Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic, and he is building a mansion in Uzicka Street in the posh suburb of Dedinje, not far from the Milosevics' former home.</p> <p>If even Pavkovic was hesitant about using troops against the protesters, who else would be willing to do so? 'I was in contact with 80 per cent of the generals, urging them not to let the army be abused,' says Perisic, 'though it was the role of the colonels which was crucial.'</p> <p>Instead Pavkovic's public statements were ambiguous - which in itself was bad for Milosevic. The army chief repeated that the army would uphold the constitution and respect the will of the people. The words were mealy-mouthed but they were enough. On the streets people interpreted his statement as meaning that there would be no intervention.</p> <p>It was, perhaps, as well. For as the full story of the past three days has slowly emerged it has been revealed that many of the Opposition supporters who poured into Belgrade for the decisive showdown with Milosevic on Thursday had come prepared to fight if they were attacked.</p> <p>According to reliable opposition sources, up to 10,000 activists were armed, while several squads of former soldiers had been specially trained to storm Yugoslavia's parliament and television station, as part of a high-risk strategy to oust Milosevic. According to the same sources, former reservists from the opposition towns of Mladenovac, just south of Belgrade, and Kragujevac and Cacak in central Serbia came ready to fight in a strategy organised by Democratic Party leader Zoran Djindjic.</p> <p>'They were all males. They were ready to fight and some of them told me that they left and said goodbye to their wives and children as if they were going to war. They had decided that they had to win. It is scary, but it worked,' said one source. Reliable sources said: 'The guys who came from Cacak are all reservists who have been actively trained for a couple of days as to what they were going to do.'</p> <p>Yesterday, as Vojislav Kostunica was inaugurated as Yugoslavia's new President, the miners of the Kolubara pit were being feted as the heroes of a week that the graffiti artists on every Belgrade street corner are celebrating as the October Revolution. And as Serbs gathered to mark their new President's ascent to office, they had other news to celebrate: the flight of Slobodan Milosevic's hated son Marko and his family on a scheduled flight for Moscow.</p> <p>The news of his escape came as Zarko Korac, one of the leading members of the opposition coalition behind Kostunica, told The Observer that they intended to press criminal charges that 'the former President had tried to order the police and army to fire on demonstrators on Thursday'. They were orders that his security forces ignored, taking the same view as Pavkovic that the game was up for Slobo.</p> <p>It was a message that was not lost on the junior ranks of the army and police, who for long had indicated privately to the opposition that to turn their weapons on their own people was the atrocity they judged too far. The crunch moment that saw the end of Milosevic's 13-year rule came on Thursday afternoon as it had become clear that police units were siding with the protesters, or at least making no moves against them.</p> <p>It was not just in Belgrade that the police surrendered to the will of people power. In Nis, Pirot and other provincial towns police officers had refused orders to come to Belgrade on Thursday to defend the capital. Even the army units that were deployed on Thursday in Belgrade - the 72nd Brigade - were held at their barracks with instructions to defend the Dedinje home of Milosevic and the presidential offices rather than to intervene.</p> <p>Final confirmation of Milosevic's defeat came from General Pavkovic himself - the man Milosevic had asked to save him - when he too finally recognised the new President after talking to both Perisic and Kostunica.</p> <p>But if Pavkovic's acceptance of Kostunica was the most important confirmation that the opposition was safe in power, the bizarrest moment was the turnaround of both Yugoslavia's Constitutional Court and Federal Election Commission which on Friday said that they had been behind an attempt to defraud Kostunica of his election victory but, since they had been rumbled, were now happy to confess the fact and that Kostunica had in fact been duly elected President on 24 September.</p> <p>It was what everyone had always known: Milosevic had attempted his most ambitious coup, and lost, by lying to the people who had for so long supported him.</p> <p>'You just don't understand,' said Professor Korac, snatching a Coke as he rushed between meetings. 'This is not a transition, it is an absolute revolution, it is a collapse!' Korac said that opposition leaders were now debating what to do as they would have preferred to take over in a legal manner. On paper both the Serbian and Yugoslav governments still exist. Korac said that it was now clear that no one was in control in either Serbian or Federal Yugoslav ministries as the former Ministers had gone to ground while employees were appealing to opposition leaders to take over. 'They are empty, no one is in charge.' Korac said that the only institution which was still working properly was 'thankfully' the army.</p> <p>One worry for the opposition and Kostunica is that Milosevic's allies still control the organs of power in Serbia. That is because in Yugoslavia's federal system most power is devolved to the Serbian and Montenegrin republican institutions. In principle, the police in Serbia are still answerable to the Serbian Minister of Interior and the Serbian president is Milan Milutinovic, an indicted war criminal.</p> <p>'We were in touch with Milutinovic,' said Korac yesterday 'but he just does not understand what is going on. These people are all like orphans without Milosevic. You know when Stalin died the people around him were so frightened they could not touch his body for 15 minutes! It is like that here.'</p> <p>And despite announcing that they intended to press charges against Milosevic, opposition politicians admitted yesterday that they did not actually know where he was. It is believed that he came specially to Belgrade on Friday for meetings with both Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Kostunica and then left the city again.</p> <p>That Russian meeting appears to have been the key to Milosevic's surrender of power as Ivanov informed him that he would have no support from Moscow if he attempted to cling on.</p> <p>Yesterday, Ivanov was coy about that crucial meeting, although he said that he and Milosevic did not discuss guarantees for the outgoing Yugoslav President during the meeting. 'I will be honest, we did not touch upon it. We spoke not about the fate of a concrete person or party, but about the fate of Yugoslavia.'</p> <p>And it is the very fate of Yugoslavia itself - the federation of Serbia and its reluctant smaller republic of Montenegro that is now on the table, as Montenegro vowed yesterday to bolt for independence from Yugoslavia unless the new President immediately withdrew troops from its territory placed there by Milosevic to prevent secession. The tiny republic said it would consign the Yugoslav federation to history unless its ultimatum was met within days.</p> <p>Tension in the Montenegrin capital Podgorica mounted as the government waited for Belgrade's response. Streets remained bereft of the jubilant crowds thronging Serbia. 'We are waiting for Kostunica to dismantle the structures set up by Milosevic which are creating horrible numbers of provocations. He should withdraw these troops now,' said Dragisa Burzan, Montenegro's deputy Prime Minister. Relief at Milosevic's fall was tinged with fear that his successor may prove even more hostile to separatist desires. Montenegro and Serbia are the last two republics in the federation of Yugoslavia.</p> <p>'We are expecting dialogue. We are expecting the West to influence Kostunica and to tone down his rhetoric,' said Burzan.</p> <p>Unless rapid agreement was reached on key demands a referendum would be called, he said. Burzan's comments reflect deep disquiet within Montenegro over the future direction for Kostunica over issues such as Montenegro and Kosovo, with some Montenegrins privately expressing deep disquiet. 'Kostunica could be even worse than Slobo,' said one.</p> <p>At issue is Kostunica's warning during the election that he would defend the federation. Indeed his impeccable credentials as a strong Serb who would not kowtow to the West was one of the reasons he won. Fears over Kostunica's policy over Montenegro are also being driven by his need to make a deal with former Milosevic supporters who want to keep ties with Belgrade. Because independence supporters boycotted the 24 September election, the SNP swept up all of Montenegro's seats in the federal parliament, presenting a formidable block which Kostunica needs to consolidate power, it claimed.</p> <p>Yesterday the people of Belgrade had little time for the question of Montenegro's future amid jubilant scenes as the city prepared for the swearing-in of its new president. The 178 deputies of the Yugoslav Chamber of Citizens and the upper house, the Chamber of Republics, elected 13 days ago, met in the Sava convention centre to bring down the curtain on the Milosevic era with due formality there was one notable absentee from the gathering - Mira Markovic, Milosevic's wife and leader of the YUL party. It was perhaps a wise decision, for as the Milosevic loyalist and Serbian President Milan Milutinovic walked in, the chamber echoed to the sound of boos.</p> <p>The mood was summed up by former Yugoslav president Dobrica Cosic who said Serbia was at a crossroads and that the revolt showed the deep suffering of the Yugoslav people. 'Awakened by terrible national losses and long suffering, humiliated by poverty and injustice in a backward, corrupt and criminal society, people decided to change that order: the federal state, authorities, economy, judiciary, education, army, police and all other social institutions,' Cosic said.</p> <p>The new mood was echoed around the Serbian capital, whose residents were plunged into despair by last year's Nato bombing of Yugoslavia and years of West-imposed sanctions. At one store, a shopkeeper handed out a bag of free bread to a passer-by, to celebrate.</p> <p>The most poignant scenes, however, were reserved for the exclusive Dedinje suburb, site of the official presidential residence, once the heavily guarded home of Milosevic and his wife. In the early hours of yesterday morning, Milosevic's opponents finally reached the gates of his former house, as cars drove through the streets of Dedinje waving flags out of their windows and hooting their horns in a symbolic gesture of people power triumphing over repression.</p> <p>Indeed, cries of 'Let's go to Dedinje!' had long been a rallying call for the hundreds of protest marches against him during Milosevic's 13-year rule. Almost every time protesters tried to reach the suburb, home to Milosevic and his close associates as well as diplomats and former Socialist apparatchiks, lines of riot police blocked their path and beat back anyone who tried to break through.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, the guards deserted the White Palace, which became his home after a cruise missile hit the residence in Uzicka street where he lived until the Nato bombing campaign last year.</p> <p>'We were in shock how everything Milosevic epitomised collapsed so quickly,' said opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic yesterday, surveying the demise of Milosevic's regime. 'We always though that Milosevic would not go without a bloody fight. But we were wrong. We overestimated the strength of the dictator and his pillars of power,' he added.</p> <p><b>Useful Links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.izbori2000.net\" target=\"_NEW\">www.izbori2000.net</a> Free Serbia</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dos.org.yu\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dos.org.yu</a> Democratic Opposition of Serbia</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Faces: the Creative Process behind Great Portraits</strong><br>Jane Bown<br> Collins &amp; Brown \u00a319.99, pp160</p> <p> Last summer, the National Portrait Gallery was in the last stages of organising an exhibition, Faces of a Century. It involved 10 people choosing 10 photographs to document their and the nation's experience of the last century. We realised that we were going to need good quality photographs of the selectors themselves in order to indicate that the interest of the exhibition was as much in their prejudices and preoccupations as in what they selected. </p> <p>So we needed a professional photographer who could work quickly, who was not going to antagonise the selectors and who could produce images with an appropriate sense of authority. </p> <p>There was only one person who fitted the bill: Jane Bown, The Observer's house photographer.

      "bodyText": "Faces: the Creative Process behind Great Portraits Jane Bown Collins &amp; Brown \u00a319.99, pp160 Last summer, the National Portrait Gallery was in the last stages of organising an exhibition, Faces of a Century. It involved 10 people choosing 10 photographs to document their and the nation's experience of the last century. We realised that we were going to need good quality photographs of the selectors themselves in order to indicate that the interest of the exhibition was as much in their prejudices and preoccupations as in what they selected. So we needed a professional photographer who could work quickly, who was not going to antagonise the selectors and who could produce images with an appropriate sense of authority. There was only one person who fitted the bill: Jane Bown, The Observer's house photographer. She took nine of the 10 photographs we needed in the space of a month without fuss, with minimal payment, and producing images which everyone, including the selectors, greatly admired. Jane Bown has now published an account of her working method, which is admirably straightforward, unfussy and professional, the result of years of experience as a newspaper photographer and light years away in every aspect from the narcissism of the American studio photographers who arrive for a sitting with a panoply of professional assistants, a lorry-load of equipment, and then take rolls and rolls of film from which one shot may be selected, too often over-contrived. Jane Bown, on the other hand, arrives wherever she is asked to go with an old Olympus dating from the early 1960s, finds a good spot, preferably close a good source of natural daylight, fiddles with the exposure and then takes a single roll of film, occasionally two, from which she almost invariably selects either the first photograph or the last.

      "body": "<p>It would really be jumping the gun, churlish even, to announce that the honeymoon is over. Of course it isn't. It has barely begun! Tomorrow European Union Ministers will begin the process of dismantling the sanctions that have helped to keep Serbia isolated and impoverished. The US and other Western nations will follow suit. Within weeks diplomatic relations will be restored with Belgrade.</p> <p>With joyous small ceremonies there'll be a rush of flag-raising over embassies and, if all goes well, Tito's ghost, which haunts Manhattan's East River, will finally be laid to rest.</p> <p>That ghost is, of course, the old Yugoslavia that died at the hands of Slobodan Milosevic. Thanks to a bizarre series of diplomatic manoeuvrings the old Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which stretched from the Alpine hills of Slovenia to the dry plains of Macedonia, still exists as a 'member' of the United Nations. The East River and the UN's Palais des Nations in Geneva are the last places on Earth where the old red-starred flag of Tito's country still flies.</p> <p>Not for long. Soon, no doubt, President Kostunica's Yugoslavia will have sorted out its status along with its re-entry into the plethora of international bodies - primarily the financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p> <p>Western Ministers should also soon begin signing cheques for the millions of dollars earmarked for a post-Milosevic Serbia under the terms of the Stability Pact, intended to aid and integrate all of the Balkan states.</p> <p>So far so good. But, then a few weeks or months down the line the country will wake with a sore head. The empty coffers, the factories good for nothing but scrap, the small farmers who find it hard to compete in a global market. And, of course, the equally tough questions of Kosovo and responsibility for almost a decade of wars.</p> <p>In the short term Kostunica and his supporters will have to clear out the institutions of all the vestiges of the ancien regime . Because of the curious nature of Yugoslavia's constitutional set-up Milosevic's allies still control the parliament, government and presidency of Serbia. The recent elections were for the Yugoslav parliament and presidency. But as Milosevic and all his friends began to congratulate Kostunica on his victory on Friday, it began to look suspiciously as if many of them intended to try to hang on to their posts.</p> <p>Until Friday it had been assumed that once Milosevic had gone the whole apparatus of state he had created would go with him. Now, the situation is less clear, despite the obvious power vacuum.</p> <p>In principle, President Kostunica should soon be able to lay the ghost of Montenegrin secessionism because most Montenegrins were not anti-Yugoslav as much as anti-Milosevic. But this may be far more difficult than it at first appeared, because Kostunica and his supporters need the votes of the Montenegrin party that used to support Milosevic in the federal parliament if they are to form the next Yugoslav Government. They may succeed but if they do, they will alienate the pro-Western President of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic.</p> <p>As the economists begin to examine the accounts of Serbian industry, they will discover not only the mass of debt but also that, as Serbia is rapidly reintegrated into the rest of Europe, most of it will no longer be able to compete. Ten years ago, for example, there was little to choose between a Yugo car and a Czech Skoda. Now Skodas compete on an equal footing with cars from the world's top manufacturers but the old Zastava factory which makes Yugos produces barely 5,000 a year. Unemployment will rise. Sanctions and isolation have impoverished Serbia but they have also helped protect uncompetitive domestic production. That shield will go.</p> <p>The war criminals issue is one that is bound to dog Kostunica. A lawyer by training, he has denounced the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as a 'monstrous institution' and regards it as a political court set up to condemn Serbs. The question is whether the West will decide to keep quiet over the issue or continue to demand that Serbia hand over Milosevic.</p> <p>Until Friday it looked as though Milosevic was a hunted man. Then he met Kostunica, congratulated him on his victory and said that he intended to remain as head of the Socialist Party of Serbia and continue in political life. If he does this, with Kostunica's blessing - and if other high-level indictees, including the President of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, do the same thing - then a frost may descend on relations between Serbia and the West. So far it is too early to say: yesterday morning opposition sources said that they intended to press criminal charges against Milosevic for ordering the police to fire on demonstrators last Thursday.</p> <p>In Belgrade, human rights activists are divided as to what the recent developments mean. Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Centre, says that she believes the international community 'will not stop talking about the issue'. Others are more sceptical, fearing that in their rush to welcome back Serbia to the fold of normal countries the whole question will simply be swept under the carpet.</p> <p>Kosovo is another issue that is bound to help end the Kostunica honeymoon. Kostunica has said that Nato troops are in Kosovo thanks to Milosevic. He has emphasised that Kosovo is part of Serbia and he intends to seek its return. In fact, whatever any Serbian leader says, Kosovo's Albanians will never agree to any association with Belgrade again, and in the short-term attacks on Kosovo Serbs may increase lest anyone think that a new spirit of reconciliation is abroad.</p> <p>Until the early hours of yesterday morning tens of thousands were still literally dancing in the streets of Belgrade. Serbia has changed and is changing. But, over the next few weeks and months we may find that it has changed less than expected.</p> <p>Tim Judah is the author of The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia</p> <p><b>Dictators: Where are they now?</b></p> <p><b> Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier</b></p> <p>Former dictator of Haiti, Duvalier fled in 1986, snatching millions of dollars from the Central Bank. Moved to the French Riviera and lived in style with his wife and two children until the money, and the wife, ran out. In 1994, a broke Duvalier downsized to a small bungalow. He went to ground in 1995, but is still believed to be in France.</p> <p><b>Raoul Cedras </b></p> <p>Another Haitian autocrat, C\u00e9dras ruled for three years and was responsible for up to 2,000 deaths. In 1994, in a US-brokered deal, he fled to Panama, where he lives in luxury in a sea-view apartment. When C\u00e9dras left, he was accompanied by his wife and three children. As part of the deal negotiated by Jimmy Carter, the Americans agreed to pay C\u00e9dras $5,000 a month.</p> <p><b>Alfredo Stroessner</b>, known as 'El Generalissimo'.</p> <p>A butcher and torturer, Stroessner ruled Paraguay for 35 years. He came to power with a coup until his reign was ended by a military uprising in 1989. Stroessner, 76 at the time, was given 12 hours to leave and was granted asylum by Brazil. He lives in a mansion in an upmarket area of Brasilia, the country's federal capital.</p> <p><b>Manuel Noriega</b>, 'Old Pineapple Face'.</p> <p>Panama's former dictator is in a Florida jail. He has served 11 years of a 40-year sentence for drug trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering. Once a CIA informant, relations between Noriega and the United States soured over his drug-running.Captured by the US in 1989.</p> <p><b>Mengistu Haile Mariam</b></p> <p>Ethiopia's former dictator, who ruled from 1974 to 1991. After he overthrew the Ethiopian Emperor, his 'Red Terror' led to thousands of deaths. Later policies resulted in the deaths of hundreds and thousands of Ethiopians through war and famine. Mengistu resigned in 1991 and fled to Zimbabwe and lives a handsome existence on Robert Mugabe handouts.</p> <p><b>Idi Amin</b></p> <p>Uganda's dictator from 1971 to 1979, Amin was responsible for the murder of an average of 7,000 Ugandans every week under his rule. Amin expelled the entire population of Ugandan Indians, causing the country's economy to fall apart. In 1979, Amin was dethroned by a Tanzanian-backed invasion. He was given refuge by Saudi Arabia and is now a devout Muslim. He lives with his wife in a coastal villa and takes a daily swim.</p>",

As the economists begin to examine the accounts of Serbian industry, they will discover not only the mass of debt but also that, as Serbia is rapidly reintegrated into the rest of Europe, most of it will no longer be able to compete. Ten years ago, for example, there was little to choose between a Yugo car and a Czech Skoda. Now Skodas compete on an equal footing with cars from the world's top manufacturers but the old Zastava factory which makes Yugos produces barely 5,000 a year. Unemployment will rise. Sanctions and isolation have impoverished Serbia but they have also helped protect uncompetitive domestic production. That shield will go. The war criminals issue is one that is bound to dog Kostunica. A lawyer by training, he has denounced the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague as a 'monstrous institution' and regards it as a political court set up to condemn Serbs. The question is whether the West will decide to keep quiet over the issue or continue to demand that Serbia hand over Milosevic. Until Friday it looked as though Milosevic was a hunted man. Then he met Kostunica, congratulated him on his victory and said that he intended to remain as head of the Socialist Party of Serbia and continue in political life. If he does this, with Kostunica's blessing - and if other high-level indictees, including the President of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, do the same thing - then a frost may descend on relations between Serbia and the West. So far it is too early to say: yesterday morning opposition sources said that they intended to press criminal charges against Milosevic for ordering the police to fire on demonstrators last Thursday. In Belgrade, human rights activists are divided as to what the recent developments mean. Natasa Kandic, director of the Humanitarian Law Centre, says that she believes the international community 'will not stop talking about the issue'. Others are more sceptical, fearing that in their rush to welcome back Serbia to the fold of normal countries the whole question will simply be swept under the carpet. Kosovo is another issue that is bound to help end the Kostunica honeymoon. Kostunica has said that Nato troops are in Kosovo thanks to Milosevic. He has emphasised that Kosovo is part of Serbia and he intends to seek its return. In fact, whatever any Serbian leader says, Kosovo's Albanians will never agree to any association with Belgrade again, and in the short-term attacks on Kosovo Serbs may increase lest anyone think that a new spirit of reconciliation is abroad. Until the early hours of yesterday morning tens of thousands were still literally dancing in the streets of Belgrade. Serbia has changed and is changing. But, over the next few weeks and months we may find that it has changed less than expected. Tim Judah is the author of The Serbs: History, Myth and the Destruction of Yugoslavia Dictators: Where are they now? Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier Former dictator of Haiti, Duvalier fled in 1986, snatching millions of dollars from the Central Bank. Moved to the French Riviera and lived in style with his wife and two children until the money, and the wife, ran out. In 1994, a broke Duvalier downsized to a small bungalow. He went to ground in 1995, but is still believed to be in France. Raoul Cedras Another Haitian autocrat, C\u00e9dras ruled for three years and was responsible for up to 2,000 deaths. In 1994, in a US-brokered deal, he fled to Panama, where he lives in luxury in a sea-view apartment. When C\u00e9dras left, he was accompanied by his wife and three children. As part of the deal negotiated by Jimmy Carter, the Americans agreed to pay C\u00e9dras $5,000 a month. Alfredo Stroessner, known as 'El Generalissimo'. A butcher and torturer, Stroessner ruled Paraguay for 35 years. He came to power with a coup until his reign was ended by a military uprising in 1989. Stroessner, 76 at the time, was given 12 hours to leave and was granted asylum by Brazil. He lives in a mansion in an upmarket area of Brasilia, the country's federal capital. Manuel Noriega, 'Old Pineapple Face'. Panama's former dictator is in a Florida jail. He has served 11 years of a 40-year sentence for drug trafficking, conspiracy and racketeering. Once a CIA informant, relations between Noriega and the United States soured over his drug-running.Captured by the US in 1989. Mengistu Haile Mariam Ethiopia's former dictator, who ruled from 1974 to 1991. After he overthrew the Ethiopian Emperor, his 'Red Terror' led to thousands of deaths. Later policies resulted in the deaths of hundreds and thousands of Ethiopians through war and famine. Mengistu resigned in 1991 and fled to Zimbabwe and lives a handsome existence on Robert Mugabe handouts. Idi Amin Uganda's dictator from 1971 to 1979, Amin was responsible for the murder of an average of 7,000 Ugandans every week under his rule. Amin expelled the entire population of Ugandan Indians, causing the country's economy to fall apart. In 1979, Amin was dethroned by a Tanzanian-backed invasion. He was given refuge by Saudi Arabia and is now a devout Muslim. He lives with his wife in a coastal villa and takes a daily swim.",

The report of the Commission on the Future of Multi-Ethnic Britain, many of whose members are close to New Labour, will embarrass Home Secretary Jack Straw, who has invested huge political capital in improving race relations.

      "body": "<p>Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. </p> <p>Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race.</p> <p>Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home.</p> <p>Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.'</p> <p>As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. </p> <p>A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. </p> <p>There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. </p> <p>While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?'</p> <p>He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby.</p> <p>Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' </p> <p>Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. </p> <p>The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.'</p> <p>'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career.</p> <p>Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.'</p> <p>In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years.</p> <p>Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!'</p> <p>Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.'</p> <p>The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. </p> <p>Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple.</p> <p>But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. </p> <p>'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.'</p> <p>Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. </p> <p>'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.'</p> <p>I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.'</p> <p>The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.</p> <p>By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film.</p> <p>'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.'</p> <p>But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition.</p> <p>In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers.

'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. </p> <p>'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.'</p> <p>The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.'</p> <p>Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist.</p> <p>'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.'</p> <p>The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?'</p> <p>'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate.</p> <p>'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"'</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' </p> <p>Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. </p> <p>'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' </p> <p>I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.'</p> <p>Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says.</p> <p>Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee.</p> <p>'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' </p> <p>The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.'</p> <p>We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.observer.co.uk/life/story/0,6903,379015,00.html\">Read Philip French's analysis of Poitier's career here</a>.</p> <p>\u0095 The Measure of a Man by Sidney Poitier is published by Simon &amp; Schuster for \u00a316.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race. Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home. Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.' As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?' He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby. Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.' 'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career. Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.' In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years. Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!' Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.' The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple. But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. 'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.' Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. 'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.' I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.' The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident.

And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. 'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.' Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says. Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee. 'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.' We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.

      "byline": "Anthony Browne  and  Robin McKie",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In a few days, fertilisation expert Dr Paul Serhal will attempt a historic operation to eradicate an inherited cancer that has blighted a British family for generations. </p> <p>The disease - a form of bowel cancer known as familial polyposis - has hung like a curse over families, killing half of those afflicted by it. The majority of those who die do so when in their forties and fifties. </p> <p>Now Serhal, based at University College Hospital, London, believes he can free future generations of these families from the grim impact of familial polyposis. He will use 'pre-implantation genetic diagnosis' - growing embryos outside the womb with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), testing to check they don't carry the gene and implanting only healthy embryos. </p> <p>It will be the first time that IVF technology will have been used in Britain to produce children unaffected by the taint of a specific cancer. </p> <p>News of the operation could not come at a more inflammatory time. Last week genetics was propelled on to front pages and news broadcasts. First there was the story of Molly Nash. Finding their daughter afflicted by deadly, inherited Fanconi anaemia, Jack and Lisa Nash, from Colorado, used genetic diagnoses of embryos to give birth to a second child, Adam, who was not only unaffected by the disease, but whose umbilical cord provided life-saving transplant material for Molly. </p> <p>The next day it emerged that a Scottish couple, Alan and Louise Masterton, were planning to use human rights legislation to ensure they could employ similar techniques to ensure they had a daughter, and not a son, to replace their three-year-old Nicole, who died in a fire. </p> <p>We are plunging into a brave new world of designer babies, said the pundits. We have created a realm, they claimed, in which parents can use the slightest excuse to discard 'tainted' embryos, or have children genetically selected as organ factories for other family members. </p> <p>Serhal's work seem to support this fear. After all, familial polyposis does not kill if it is tackled promptly. Those who carry the guilty gene can simply have their colons removed before the disease has a chance to manifest. itself. Discarding affected embryos is unnecessary, say opponents. </p> <p>Serhal is unrepentant. The urge to have a healthy child is natural, he argues. 'All I am doing is ensuring the birth of a child that will be unaffected by cancer in 40 years and will not need major surgery. I am giving parents, and their offspring, peace of mind.' </p> <p>After years of being little more than scientific speculation, genetic testing of embryos is swiftly moving centre stage in the furore over modern medical ethics. Only five hospitals in the UK are licensed to carry out tests - for conditions including spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy - and they have produced a mere total of about 20 'pure' babies. However, as science and acceptance advance, numbers are expected to grow rapidly. </p> <p>British doctors say they are comfortable about screening out the most severe genetic diseases, but are bracing themselves for dilemmas like the Nashes' - of a second test to ensure a baby is genetically acceptable as a tissue donor for a diseased relative. </p> <p>When the Nash story was first made public at a scientific conference earlier this summer, the hall echoed with the sound of stunned scientists gasping. Now the practice is out in the open. So what will happen when it arrives in Britain? Will there be an even greater outcry? Answers remain elusive - though a key factor will be the exact nature of the transplant involved. In the Nashes' case, it involved using cells from the new baby's umbilical cord - rather than any of its own tissue. </p> <p>'This seems an absolutely ideal use of technology for humane purposes,' says Alastair Kent, director of the Genetic Interest Group, an umbrella organisation for people suffering genetic diseases. 'It's win-win.' </p> <p>Sara Nathan, who sits on the ethics committee of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, also has few concerns: 'Given you are having the first set of tests, I don't find that the second set of tests is repugnant, and I would be surprised if others did. Did he need his umbilical cord by then? He'd been born!' </p> <p>But even as doctors arrive at this frontier, they find it is moving forward yet again. What if the person who needs help is not the new baby's sibling but its parents? Will people have a baby to cure themselves? Serhal is planning to carry out a similar procedure for the genetic blood disorder thalassemia, where the umbilical cord of the child could help cure the father. 'I don't see a problem,' he says. 'It is just an added bonus to having a healthy child.' </p> <p>But the ethics get even trickier if organs, not disposable umbilical cells, are sought. What if blood or bone marrow - or entire organs like kidneys - are needed to save a doomed relative? </p> <p>'Babies shouldn't principally be seen as a source of spare parts for the family,' says Kent. 'However, if that's a by-product of a baby who is wanted and loved anyway, it may not be a problem.' </p> <p>Nathan is not so sure, however. 'I have greater reservations about things that harm or hurt the child,' cautions Nathan. 'Kidneys - I would find that hard to deal with.' </p> <p>Serhal agrees. 'There is a simple line in the sand here,' he says. 'You don't have a second child if you are going to cut it or operate on it. You do have a second child if you want one and use discarded material - like an umbilical cord - to save another.' </p> <p>But in some cases, it could be acceptable to operate on the new baby, according to Kent: 'If it's an invasive procedure with very little risk, and if the chance of benefit is great, weigh the balance of harm and good, and let the thing go ahead.' </p> <p>And, of course, parents are emotionally involved. If the choice is between watching one child die of kidney disease and having another to donate a kidney, Tim Hedgley, chairman of the fertility charity Issue, knows what his choice would be: 'Parents do all they can to save their child.

      "bodyText": "In a few days, fertilisation expert Dr Paul Serhal will attempt a historic operation to eradicate an inherited cancer that has blighted a British family for generations. The disease - a form of bowel cancer known as familial polyposis - has hung like a curse over families, killing half of those afflicted by it. The majority of those who die do so when in their forties and fifties. Now Serhal, based at University College Hospital, London, believes he can free future generations of these families from the grim impact of familial polyposis. He will use 'pre-implantation genetic diagnosis' - growing embryos outside the womb with in vitro fertilisation (IVF), testing to check they don't carry the gene and implanting only healthy embryos. It will be the first time that IVF technology will have been used in Britain to produce children unaffected by the taint of a specific cancer. News of the operation could not come at a more inflammatory time. Last week genetics was propelled on to front pages and news broadcasts. First there was the story of Molly Nash. Finding their daughter afflicted by deadly, inherited Fanconi anaemia, Jack and Lisa Nash, from Colorado, used genetic diagnoses of embryos to give birth to a second child, Adam, who was not only unaffected by the disease, but whose umbilical cord provided life-saving transplant material for Molly. The next day it emerged that a Scottish couple, Alan and Louise Masterton, were planning to use human rights legislation to ensure they could employ similar techniques to ensure they had a daughter, and not a son, to replace their three-year-old Nicole, who died in a fire. We are plunging into a brave new world of designer babies, said the pundits. We have created a realm, they claimed, in which parents can use the slightest excuse to discard 'tainted' embryos, or have children genetically selected as organ factories for other family members. Serhal's work seem to support this fear. After all, familial polyposis does not kill if it is tackled promptly. Those who carry the guilty gene can simply have their colons removed before the disease has a chance to manifest. itself. Discarding affected embryos is unnecessary, say opponents. Serhal is unrepentant. The urge to have a healthy child is natural, he argues. 'All I am doing is ensuring the birth of a child that will be unaffected by cancer in 40 years and will not need major surgery. I am giving parents, and their offspring, peace of mind.' After years of being little more than scientific speculation, genetic testing of embryos is swiftly moving centre stage in the furore over modern medical ethics. Only five hospitals in the UK are licensed to carry out tests - for conditions including spinal muscular atrophy, cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy - and they have produced a mere total of about 20 'pure' babies. However, as science and acceptance advance, numbers are expected to grow rapidly. British doctors say they are comfortable about screening out the most severe genetic diseases, but are bracing themselves for dilemmas like the Nashes' - of a second test to ensure a baby is genetically acceptable as a tissue donor for a diseased relative. When the Nash story was first made public at a scientific conference earlier this summer, the hall echoed with the sound of stunned scientists gasping. Now the practice is out in the open. So what will happen when it arrives in Britain? Will there be an even greater outcry? Answers remain elusive - though a key factor will be the exact nature of the transplant involved. In the Nashes' case, it involved using cells from the new baby's umbilical cord - rather than any of its own tissue. 'This seems an absolutely ideal use of technology for humane purposes,' says Alastair Kent, director of the Genetic Interest Group, an umbrella organisation for people suffering genetic diseases. 'It's win-win.' Sara Nathan, who sits on the ethics committee of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, also has few concerns: 'Given you are having the first set of tests, I don't find that the second set of tests is repugnant, and I would be surprised if others did. Did he need his umbilical cord by then? He'd been born!' But even as doctors arrive at this frontier, they find it is moving forward yet again. What if the person who needs help is not the new baby's sibling but its parents? Will people have a baby to cure themselves? Serhal is planning to carry out a similar procedure for the genetic blood disorder thalassemia, where the umbilical cord of the child could help cure the father. 'I don't see a problem,' he says. 'It is just an added bonus to having a healthy child.' But the ethics get even trickier if organs, not disposable umbilical cells, are sought. What if blood or bone marrow - or entire organs like kidneys - are needed to save a doomed relative? 'Babies shouldn't principally be seen as a source of spare parts for the family,' says Kent. 'However, if that's a by-product of a baby who is wanted and loved anyway, it may not be a problem.' Nathan is not so sure, however. 'I have greater reservations about things that harm or hurt the child,' cautions Nathan. 'Kidneys - I would find that hard to deal with.' Serhal agrees. 'There is a simple line in the sand here,' he says. 'You don't have a second child if you are going to cut it or operate on it. You do have a second child if you want one and use discarded material - like an umbilical cord - to save another.' But in some cases, it could be acceptable to operate on the new baby, according to Kent: 'If it's an invasive procedure with very little risk, and if the chance of benefit is great, weigh the balance of harm and good, and let the thing go ahead.' And, of course, parents are emotionally involved. If the choice is between watching one child die of kidney disease and having another to donate a kidney, Tim Hedgley, chairman of the fertility charity Issue, knows what his choice would be: 'Parents do all they can to save their child. If the circumstances arose, parents would have to choose between two children or none. I would go for two children. Who in their right mind wouldn't?' As we enter this brave new world, and as the frontiers are pushed back, people's ethics are also likely to evolve. What seems shocking now may seem ethical in the future. 'If I had said to you 20 years ago I knew a consultant who wanted to rip the heart out of a dead body and put it in a living person and attach electrodes to it to restart it, you'd think I was mad,' says Hedgley. 'But now heart transplants are normal'. Hedgley is convinced that ethics will only be a few steps behind science: 'I think people would accept the harvesting of blood products, or bone marrow products - and maybe in time they could live with kidneys.' Intriguingly, new laws may soon force the ethicist to keep pace with the scientist.

It would have to justify why it was interfering in terms of public health or morals,' he says. Serhal says that, even if Britain keeps the ban on sex selection, it will become routine.'I have already helped four families get such operations in Brazil.

In such a future, thousands of others would join the Millers in being given the chance to put an end to afflictions that have dogged their families for generations. For them, that truly would be a Brave New World.

      "body": "<p>Every time, they say: 'Well, that was the last of the popular revolutions.' They say: 'Such a nineteenth-century anachronism, from days when politicians dealt in crowds and masses! Such a hangover from the age of the People, that collective unicorn which doesn't exist!'</p> <p>And every time, they are wrong. There, outside the Serbian parliament, appeared this terrifying, fabulous beast whose name is Legion, rushing, recoiling, twisting this way and that like a mounting flock of wild geese and then all in a moment hurling itself upwards through the buckling doors of power. No leaders, no savvy controllers, not even any heroes except those grotesque figures, famous only to their families, who appear for an instant with a flag on a parapet or with blazing papers at a window and then vanish back into namelessness.</p> <p>Revolution, the real thing, is always like what the world saw in Belgrade. That is why it helps to understand what people hoped for as the Bastille fell, or as the German empire was flung down in Berlin in 1919, or as Hungarians raised barricades in 1956, or as Czechs jingled their keys and sang and wept in November 1989. The collapse of the Serbian dictatorship is a chance to renew Europe - and not just the south-eastern lands we call the Balkans. How will the Serbian people and their new leaders look at their country, their region and their continent on the morning after the revolution?</p> <p>In almost all national revolutions (and Belgrade was one), the idea of freedom is many-sided. It means no more censorship and no more secret police. It hopes for a better and more abundant life. But it also means the smashing-open of the gates to the outside world. The prisoners in Fidelio mount singing into the light; they can travel, they can trade, they can listen to the entrancing conversations of all humanity and proudly contribute a Serbian word to them.</p> <p>The most common and poignant complaint of young Serbs has been: 'Why have we been denied our 1989?' They envied that year not so much as a revolt against the Soviet imperium but as a breaking out of prison into a brilliantly lit, innovative world where individual joy and curiosity were supreme values. Now they, too, are blinking in the glare of daylight.</p> <p>In that light of liberation, Serbia, the Balkans, Europe itself, may all now change their shape as they are seen from Belgrade. Miraculously, the Serbian revolution caused only one accidental death. There is not likely to be a murderous witch-hunt for collaborators with the Milosevic regime, even though so many angry people promised themselves just that until the great breakthrough. Corruption trials for pillaging the state will probably happen. Purges and denunciations may come later, if at all, when it suits some politician to dish his rivals by raiding the secret police files.</p> <p>It may be that feelings about the ex-Yugoslav neighbours will change shape, too. Nobody expects President Kostunica to give up on the Kosovo Serbs or forgive the expulsion of the Krajina Serbs from their homes. But xenophobia and ultranationalism have always been fomented by dictatorships which run out of ideology. The day before the revolution, the patriot longs to slay the oppressors of his kith and kin across the borders. The day after, he puts all that on the backburner and rushes out to read free newspapers and book the kids to EuroDisney.</p> <p>After the 1989 revolutions, all the forgotten minority disputes in east-central Europe lit up again with horrible clarity. But then it turned out that people no longer cared about them in the old way. The Poles couldn't be bothered to weep for their Polish-speaking cousins in Lithuania; the Hungarians put their oppressed kith and kin in Transylvania on hold; the ethnic Romanians of Moldova decided they could wait indefinitely for reunion with the fatherland.</p> <p>With a little tact from the 'international community', this Free Yugoslavia may reduce the need to help Serbs in Bosnia or Kosovo from a passionate blood-oath to a practical, long-term commitment. The Serbs will not fall in love with the Croats, but a good, confident partnership between democratic Belgrade and democratic Zagreb is now achievable.</p> <p>If this happens, then some coherence may return to the Balkans. The hole that was Serbia will be filled by a state ready to co-operate with its neighbours in repairing war damage, re-opening Danube navigation, co-ordinating approaches to the European Union and negotiating the return of refugees. The Balkan Stability Pact, so far little more than a clumsy anti-Milosevic propaganda exercise, might just possibly be filled with meaning and channel significant infrastructure and social investment into the region.</p> <p>Nothing sensible can be done in the Balkans without Serbia, which means that nothing sensible has been done for 10 years. Now plans can be made.</p> <p>The first commandment is to keep international interference out of the Balkans. The worst problem here is the existence of two international 'protectorates', Bosnia and Kosovo. Everyone knows why they are there. But they now form a bridgehead from which the West - above all, the United States, Britain and France - can meddle powerfully in Balkan affairs. Only a democratic Yugoslavia, patient about its stake in both territories, can lead a rescue mission to tow these two floating wrecks back into a regional security system.</p> <p>The second commandment is to acquire a healthy scepticism about the European Union. Brussels just loves the idea of smaller, poorer nations forming 'regional blocs', in which small, poor aspirants to full European status could be conveniently forgotten. The new Yugoslavia, emerging from pariah status, can also take up the utterly scandalous neglect of Romania and Bulgaria by the EU after bombing closed the Danube and ruined their economies.</p> <p>But the Belgrade revolution has changed Europe itself, not only its south-eastern corner. One enormous consequence is the extinction of the last outpost of Russian influence west of the Black Sea. The gamble on Milosevic has failed. The transfer of the bet to the possibility of a democratic Serbia was left until it was too late. The Serbs will always like the Russians, for reasons rooted in history and religion. But the spectacle of Russia acting as the protecting power to a Balkan client is now over for good. So much for the better - for European stability and for the unity of the Balkan states.</p> <p>But the Belgrade Thursday, with its pride and hope, asked the biggest of all questions about Europe.

      "bodyText": "Every time, they say: 'Well, that was the last of the popular revolutions.' They say: 'Such a nineteenth-century anachronism, from days when politicians dealt in crowds and masses! Such a hangover from the age of the People, that collective unicorn which doesn't exist!' And every time, they are wrong. There, outside the Serbian parliament, appeared this terrifying, fabulous beast whose name is Legion, rushing, recoiling, twisting this way and that like a mounting flock of wild geese and then all in a moment hurling itself upwards through the buckling doors of power. No leaders, no savvy controllers, not even any heroes except those grotesque figures, famous only to their families, who appear for an instant with a flag on a parapet or with blazing papers at a window and then vanish back into namelessness. Revolution, the real thing, is always like what the world saw in Belgrade. That is why it helps to understand what people hoped for as the Bastille fell, or as the German empire was flung down in Berlin in 1919, or as Hungarians raised barricades in 1956, or as Czechs jingled their keys and sang and wept in November 1989. The collapse of the Serbian dictatorship is a chance to renew Europe - and not just the south-eastern lands we call the Balkans. How will the Serbian people and their new leaders look at their country, their region and their continent on the morning after the revolution? In almost all national revolutions (and Belgrade was one), the idea of freedom is many-sided. It means no more censorship and no more secret police. It hopes for a better and more abundant life. But it also means the smashing-open of the gates to the outside world. The prisoners in Fidelio mount singing into the light; they can travel, they can trade, they can listen to the entrancing conversations of all humanity and proudly contribute a Serbian word to them. The most common and poignant complaint of young Serbs has been: 'Why have we been denied our 1989?' They envied that year not so much as a revolt against the Soviet imperium but as a breaking out of prison into a brilliantly lit, innovative world where individual joy and curiosity were supreme values. Now they, too, are blinking in the glare of daylight. In that light of liberation, Serbia, the Balkans, Europe itself, may all now change their shape as they are seen from Belgrade. Miraculously, the Serbian revolution caused only one accidental death. There is not likely to be a murderous witch-hunt for collaborators with the Milosevic regime, even though so many angry people promised themselves just that until the great breakthrough. Corruption trials for pillaging the state will probably happen. Purges and denunciations may come later, if at all, when it suits some politician to dish his rivals by raiding the secret police files. It may be that feelings about the ex-Yugoslav neighbours will change shape, too. Nobody expects President Kostunica to give up on the Kosovo Serbs or forgive the expulsion of the Krajina Serbs from their homes. But xenophobia and ultranationalism have always been fomented by dictatorships which run out of ideology. The day before the revolution, the patriot longs to slay the oppressors of his kith and kin across the borders. The day after, he puts all that on the backburner and rushes out to read free newspapers and book the kids to EuroDisney. After the 1989 revolutions, all the forgotten minority disputes in east-central Europe lit up again with horrible clarity. But then it turned out that people no longer cared about them in the old way. The Poles couldn't be bothered to weep for their Polish-speaking cousins in Lithuania; the Hungarians put their oppressed kith and kin in Transylvania on hold; the ethnic Romanians of Moldova decided they could wait indefinitely for reunion with the fatherland. With a little tact from the 'international community', this Free Yugoslavia may reduce the need to help Serbs in Bosnia or Kosovo from a passionate blood-oath to a practical, long-term commitment. The Serbs will not fall in love with the Croats, but a good, confident partnership between democratic Belgrade and democratic Zagreb is now achievable. If this happens, then some coherence may return to the Balkans. The hole that was Serbia will be filled by a state ready to co-operate with its neighbours in repairing war damage, re-opening Danube navigation, co-ordinating approaches to the European Union and negotiating the return of refugees. The Balkan Stability Pact, so far little more than a clumsy anti-Milosevic propaganda exercise, might just possibly be filled with meaning and channel significant infrastructure and social investment into the region. Nothing sensible can be done in the Balkans without Serbia, which means that nothing sensible has been done for 10 years. Now plans can be made. The first commandment is to keep international interference out of the Balkans. The worst problem here is the existence of two international 'protectorates', Bosnia and Kosovo. Everyone knows why they are there. But they now form a bridgehead from which the West - above all, the United States, Britain and France - can meddle powerfully in Balkan affairs. Only a democratic Yugoslavia, patient about its stake in both territories, can lead a rescue mission to tow these two floating wrecks back into a regional security system. The second commandment is to acquire a healthy scepticism about the European Union. Brussels just loves the idea of smaller, poorer nations forming 'regional blocs', in which small, poor aspirants to full European status could be conveniently forgotten. The new Yugoslavia, emerging from pariah status, can also take up the utterly scandalous neglect of Romania and Bulgaria by the EU after bombing closed the Danube and ruined their economies. But the Belgrade revolution has changed Europe itself, not only its south-eastern corner. One enormous consequence is the extinction of the last outpost of Russian influence west of the Black Sea. The gamble on Milosevic has failed. The transfer of the bet to the possibility of a democratic Serbia was left until it was too late. The Serbs will always like the Russians, for reasons rooted in history and religion. But the spectacle of Russia acting as the protecting power to a Balkan client is now over for good. So much for the better - for European stability and for the unity of the Balkan states. But the Belgrade Thursday, with its pride and hope, asked the biggest of all questions about Europe. Are you serious about one Europe? Or do you still secretly mean to have two: a rich Europe in the West which uses the East and the Balkans - stripped of their industries - as a colonial backyard to provide cheap labour and raw materials? That is what the old German vision of Mitteleuropa meant before 1914, and what Hitler's plan for European empire entailed. After the revolutions of 1989, some post-communist countries, such as Poland and Hungary, seemed to survive the trauma of transition to capitalism.

      "body": "<p>Shirley Maclaine 's advice for life is that one should 'be like a bamboo' (bend with the prevailing wind), and many have argued that that has been the mantra of any politician intent on power and likely to achieve it. How refreshing it would be believe that the soundbites from last week's Tory conference in Bournemouth betray a fine commitment not to be swayed by the vulgar mood of the electorate.</p> <p>But proposals to fine dope-smokers \u00a3100 per joint and to reward with special tax breaks women who have the decency to get married before having children were not made in the spirit of brave defiance. These battle cries were nothing but erroneous opportunism.</p> <p>Which is not to say the notion of a married mothers' tax allowance isn't going to have its champions. It would hardly be surprising if those who'd benefit were in favour of it - as a matter of principle, you understand. But this isn't in itself any kind of justification: after all, there are many possible unjust taxes which would attract support, but that wouldn't make them right. I am far from being in favour of mob-rule or government by opinion poll, but even so I cannot believe that this suggestion could truly be electorally expedient.</p> <p>It is just shabby politics, made shabbier still because the Conservatives have made it their task to decry the social engineering of the Left. What is this but social engineering? You could argue that this is what all politics comes down to. But the problem about social engineering is not that it is vicious but that it is limited. People have a way of going about their lives without regard to governmental approval. True, financial incentives can sway, but poverty rather than marital status is the greatest indicator of familial distress. Single-parent families are statistically more likely to be live in poverty, so how can it possibly help society - which the Tories now apparently believe in - to reward those who are better off in the first place?</p> <p>And surely even a politician knows you have to deal with the world as it is not the world as you'd like it to be. Yes, I think William Hague is right to say that marriage 'marks a public commitment' but unfortunately marriages go wrong in private. And if one cared about the victims, the children in every case, it doesn't make sense to penalise them further by making it clear that their lives were less worthy in the first place. Children do need both their parents, but those who have witnessed the fragmentation of their family - and in many cases the outcome of separation or divorce is not just a distant father but an absent one - are hardly going to benefit from feeling abandoned by that big symbolic daddy, the Government, too. You cannot reward married mothers without punishing unmarried ones and, most crucially, you cannot punish any parents without injuring their children.</p> <p>Something around 60 per cent of families are single parent units now, which makes me feel there is going to be a great deal more sympathy for that other announcement of financial impetus and social intent made this week by J.K. Rowling. Like Jerry Hall, she believes that a single parent can provide a more happy home than a rowing pair. Research suggests, however, that this is not correct; the Exeter Family Study of the mid-Nineties concluded that family breakdown had a much more pernicious influence on a child's well-being than parental conflict. But surely, a vital part must be played by the level of environmental and social upset brought about by divorce? I can see why Jerry Hall might feel that divorce might be preferable to unhappy parents: after all, in her case getting a divorce hasn't lowered her or her children's standard of living. But that isn't usually the case - and, again, this is where the trouble lies.</p> <p>J.K. Rowling's case is more persuasive. Yes, she's rich now, but wasn't always, having suffered the social disapproval aimed at the lone mother: in doing what she felt was best for her daughter she was made to feel that she was inferior and, by implication, so was her daughter. She's right, too, to highlight the wilfully incorrect stereotyping: the dangerous brigade of feckless teenage single mums account for just 3 per cent of all single-parent families. Most don't set out to be single parents.</p> <p>Children naturally want their mummy and daddy to love each other and stay together. Those who suffer most when their parents separate are those whose parents fail to remain united about the care of their children even when distant from one another. Barbara Ellen was quite right when she stated in these pages that divorce doesn't necessarily give rise to single-parent families, but often, and more desirably, families with two parents who live separately. Unfortunately, this isn't the always the case. Mothers and children are often abandoned and the family is not merely fragmented but destroyed. Men move on and want to put their emotional and financial energies into their new families. I wonder if the automatic social downgrading of the single-parent household the fleeing male creates doesn't provide a certain corroboration for the absent father.

      "bodyText": "Shirley Maclaine 's advice for life is that one should 'be like a bamboo' (bend with the prevailing wind), and many have argued that that has been the mantra of any politician intent on power and likely to achieve it. How refreshing it would be believe that the soundbites from last week's Tory conference in Bournemouth betray a fine commitment not to be swayed by the vulgar mood of the electorate. But proposals to fine dope-smokers \u00a3100 per joint and to reward with special tax breaks women who have the decency to get married before having children were not made in the spirit of brave defiance. These battle cries were nothing but erroneous opportunism. Which is not to say the notion of a married mothers' tax allowance isn't going to have its champions. It would hardly be surprising if those who'd benefit were in favour of it - as a matter of principle, you understand. But this isn't in itself any kind of justification: after all, there are many possible unjust taxes which would attract support, but that wouldn't make them right. I am far from being in favour of mob-rule or government by opinion poll, but even so I cannot believe that this suggestion could truly be electorally expedient. It is just shabby politics, made shabbier still because the Conservatives have made it their task to decry the social engineering of the Left. What is this but social engineering? You could argue that this is what all politics comes down to. But the problem about social engineering is not that it is vicious but that it is limited. People have a way of going about their lives without regard to governmental approval. True, financial incentives can sway, but poverty rather than marital status is the greatest indicator of familial distress. Single-parent families are statistically more likely to be live in poverty, so how can it possibly help society - which the Tories now apparently believe in - to reward those who are better off in the first place? And surely even a politician knows you have to deal with the world as it is not the world as you'd like it to be. Yes, I think William Hague is right to say that marriage 'marks a public commitment' but unfortunately marriages go wrong in private. And if one cared about the victims, the children in every case, it doesn't make sense to penalise them further by making it clear that their lives were less worthy in the first place. Children do need both their parents, but those who have witnessed the fragmentation of their family - and in many cases the outcome of separation or divorce is not just a distant father but an absent one - are hardly going to benefit from feeling abandoned by that big symbolic daddy, the Government, too. You cannot reward married mothers without punishing unmarried ones and, most crucially, you cannot punish any parents without injuring their children. Something around 60 per cent of families are single parent units now, which makes me feel there is going to be a great deal more sympathy for that other announcement of financial impetus and social intent made this week by J.K. Rowling. Like Jerry Hall, she believes that a single parent can provide a more happy home than a rowing pair. Research suggests, however, that this is not correct; the Exeter Family Study of the mid-Nineties concluded that family breakdown had a much more pernicious influence on a child's well-being than parental conflict. But surely, a vital part must be played by the level of environmental and social upset brought about by divorce? I can see why Jerry Hall might feel that divorce might be preferable to unhappy parents: after all, in her case getting a divorce hasn't lowered her or her children's standard of living. But that isn't usually the case - and, again, this is where the trouble lies. J.K. Rowling's case is more persuasive. Yes, she's rich now, but wasn't always, having suffered the social disapproval aimed at the lone mother: in doing what she felt was best for her daughter she was made to feel that she was inferior and, by implication, so was her daughter. She's right, too, to highlight the wilfully incorrect stereotyping: the dangerous brigade of feckless teenage single mums account for just 3 per cent of all single-parent families. Most don't set out to be single parents. Children naturally want their mummy and daddy to love each other and stay together. Those who suffer most when their parents separate are those whose parents fail to remain united about the care of their children even when distant from one another. Barbara Ellen was quite right when she stated in these pages that divorce doesn't necessarily give rise to single-parent families, but often, and more desirably, families with two parents who live separately. Unfortunately, this isn't the always the case. Mothers and children are often abandoned and the family is not merely fragmented but destroyed. Men move on and want to put their emotional and financial energies into their new families. I wonder if the automatic social downgrading of the single-parent household the fleeing male creates doesn't provide a certain corroboration for the absent father. What he's left behind is deemed less worthy and he might well feel curiously confirmed in valuing it less himself. The issue can never be about who's good, who's bad or even what this says about society as a whole. Who wouldn't like every child to be brought up in a happy, stable, united family? But to think that this can be brought about by turning the welfare system into a kind of school prize day, with rewards for those who follow the rules, is not merely wrong, it's sick.",

      "body": "<p>Irvine Welsh, Nick Hornby, Helen Fielding... Nick Duerden? In the past few years, a huge number of novelists have woken up, bewildered, to the news that their work has been chosen for big screen treatment. Perhaps I could join them. </p> <p>Last month, my novel Sidewalking - about a young man who comes into a lot of dirty money with calamitous consequences - came out to a handful of decent reviews, and several suggestions regarding its cinematic possibilities. Like the naive fool I am, I wasted no time in having my inside leg measured for the tuxedo I'd wear to the premiere. </p> <p>'It goes in cycles,' says Rocket Pictures's Steve Hamilton-Shaw, whose Disney affiliated company (owned by Elton John) is about to start adapting A L Kennedy's So I Am Glad. </p> <p>'In the last few years, there have been a lot of high-profile successes, adaptations like Trainspotting and High Fidelity. Inevitably, this starts some kind of trend, and so lots of novels are being snapped up, often even before being published. It's certainly a primary source of inspiration for film-makers, especially British ones.' </p> <p>In America, he explains, writers can often make a very good living churning out film scripts purely on spec, then hawking them around Hollywood with a good chance of getting a development deal. This doesn't tend to happen over here, and so the industry inevitably looks instead towards that most primary area of storytelling: books. </p> <p>'If a book sells well,' says FilmFour's Jim Wilson, currently adapting both Sebastian Faulks's Charlotte Gray and Giles Fodon's The Last King Of Scotland, 'then it has a ready-made audience, which is naturally appealing for us. Everyone who read The Beach, for example, went to see the film. I think the profile alone of Bridget Jones will keep this trend in place for some time.' </p> <p>Despite the fact that it's not released in cinemas for the better part of a year, hype for the film version of Helen Fielding's The Diary Of Bridget Jones is already colossal. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger may well have recently appeared in Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty and the Farrelly Brothers' Me, Myself &amp; Irene, but the only questions British journalists wish to pose to her concern the fictional character she is about to bring to 70mm life. </p> <p>Bridget isn't alone. Louis de Berni\u00e8res's million-selling Captain Corelli's Mandolin, starring Nicolas Cage, is also on its way amid a never-ending pre-release fanfare, as of course is J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Everything is attracting cinematic interest: in recent months, Kevin Sampson's football hooligan novel Awaydays, Colin Butts's lurid account of holiday reps in Ibiza, Is Harry On The Boat?, and Harland Miller's nostalgic tale about a David Bowie obsessive, Slow Down Arthur, Stick To Thirty, have all been snapped up.</p> <p>'Basically, we are always on the lookout for good stories,' says Wilson. 'And ideally, we're looking for something that really sticks out and marks it as a true original.' He swings around in his office chair and points to a poster of the new FilmFour-funded Lars Von Trier film, Dancer In The Dark. 'And often, I must say, that's not particularly easy. Look at something like Being John Malkovich (by US screenwriter Charlie Kaufman). I very much doubt screenplays with that kind of scope and depth exist in this country. And if they do, I haven't seen them. The UK has always been far stronger in its original fiction than screenwriting, which is why we do scour for new talent in books. But every time I read what I consider to be an excellent novel, I wish with all my heart it was already in screenplay form, because, believe me, that's when the hard work begins.' </p> <p>Which brings us to the cloud behind the silver lining - my own book's adaptation possibilities. During my research, I learnt a sobering statistic: 97 per cent of all books optioned within the UK will never make it to the screen. With mathematics like these, England are far more likely to win the World Cup than Sidewalking is to reach Leicester Square. My 32in inside leg would have to wait. </p> <p>One author who seems to have a good strike rate is Colin Bateman, the former Belfast newspaper man-turned-best-selling author and, subsequently, screenwriter, whose credits include Divorcing Jack and Cycle Of Violence. But even he concedes it's a colossal struggle. </p> <p>'It's essential to have someone who understands your work and will fight off people who try to dilute it,' he says. 'You have to realise that, at least as far as the UK is concerned, 90 per cent of the people who express an interest in turning your book into a film won't have money of their own. Generally, they will go to a large company for development money, then, when the script is written, they go looking for other companies to invest, and there can be half a dozen of those, so you end up working and re-writing to the whims of what is essentially a committee.' </p> <p> Divorcing Jack (for which he wrote the screenplay) was savaged by the critics and didn't, consequently, find the home-grown success it deserved, while Cycle Of Violence (re-titled Crossmaheart) failed to find distribution and went straight to video. His third, Empire State, which he sold for no money at all to a small British company, has already gone through three directors before a single frame has been shot. And Bateman is a success story? This is not reassuring. </p> <p>This next one, however, may be. This year, Harland Miller - a 36-year-old east London-based artist and peer of Jay Joplin and Sam Taylor Wood - published Slow Down Arthur, Stick To Thirty, his debut novel, for a reported \u00a3150,000. Agents flew in from Hollywood for several tense pow-wows. The film rights eventually went to Danny Boyle and Andrew MacDonald's production company, DNA, and it was reported that Jarvis Cocker, Miller's long-time friend, was down to direct, with Jude Law desperate for the lead role.

      "bodyText": "Irvine Welsh, Nick Hornby, Helen Fielding... Nick Duerden? In the past few years, a huge number of novelists have woken up, bewildered, to the news that their work has been chosen for big screen treatment. Perhaps I could join them. Last month, my novel Sidewalking - about a young man who comes into a lot of dirty money with calamitous consequences - came out to a handful of decent reviews, and several suggestions regarding its cinematic possibilities. Like the naive fool I am, I wasted no time in having my inside leg measured for the tuxedo I'd wear to the premiere. 'It goes in cycles,' says Rocket Pictures's Steve Hamilton-Shaw, whose Disney affiliated company (owned by Elton John) is about to start adapting A L Kennedy's So I Am Glad. 'In the last few years, there have been a lot of high-profile successes, adaptations like Trainspotting and High Fidelity. Inevitably, this starts some kind of trend, and so lots of novels are being snapped up, often even before being published. It's certainly a primary source of inspiration for film-makers, especially British ones.' In America, he explains, writers can often make a very good living churning out film scripts purely on spec, then hawking them around Hollywood with a good chance of getting a development deal. This doesn't tend to happen over here, and so the industry inevitably looks instead towards that most primary area of storytelling: books. 'If a book sells well,' says FilmFour's Jim Wilson, currently adapting both Sebastian Faulks's Charlotte Gray and Giles Fodon's The Last King Of Scotland, 'then it has a ready-made audience, which is naturally appealing for us. Everyone who read The Beach, for example, went to see the film. I think the profile alone of Bridget Jones will keep this trend in place for some time.' Despite the fact that it's not released in cinemas for the better part of a year, hype for the film version of Helen Fielding's The Diary Of Bridget Jones is already colossal. Ren\u00e9e Zellweger may well have recently appeared in Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty and the Farrelly Brothers' Me, Myself &amp; Irene, but the only questions British journalists wish to pose to her concern the fictional character she is about to bring to 70mm life. Bridget isn't alone. Louis de Berni\u00e8res's million-selling Captain Corelli's Mandolin, starring Nicolas Cage, is also on its way amid a never-ending pre-release fanfare, as of course is J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter. Everything is attracting cinematic interest: in recent months, Kevin Sampson's football hooligan novel Awaydays, Colin Butts's lurid account of holiday reps in Ibiza, Is Harry On The Boat?, and Harland Miller's nostalgic tale about a David Bowie obsessive, Slow Down Arthur, Stick To Thirty, have all been snapped up. 'Basically, we are always on the lookout for good stories,' says Wilson. 'And ideally, we're looking for something that really sticks out and marks it as a true original.' He swings around in his office chair and points to a poster of the new FilmFour-funded Lars Von Trier film, Dancer In The Dark. 'And often, I must say, that's not particularly easy. Look at something like Being John Malkovich (by US screenwriter Charlie Kaufman). I very much doubt screenplays with that kind of scope and depth exist in this country. And if they do, I haven't seen them. The UK has always been far stronger in its original fiction than screenwriting, which is why we do scour for new talent in books. But every time I read what I consider to be an excellent novel, I wish with all my heart it was already in screenplay form, because, believe me, that's when the hard work begins.' Which brings us to the cloud behind the silver lining - my own book's adaptation possibilities. During my research, I learnt a sobering statistic: 97 per cent of all books optioned within the UK will never make it to the screen. With mathematics like these, England are far more likely to win the World Cup than Sidewalking is to reach Leicester Square. My 32in inside leg would have to wait. One author who seems to have a good strike rate is Colin Bateman, the former Belfast newspaper man-turned-best-selling author and, subsequently, screenwriter, whose credits include Divorcing Jack and Cycle Of Violence. But even he concedes it's a colossal struggle. 'It's essential to have someone who understands your work and will fight off people who try to dilute it,' he says. 'You have to realise that, at least as far as the UK is concerned, 90 per cent of the people who express an interest in turning your book into a film won't have money of their own. Generally, they will go to a large company for development money, then, when the script is written, they go looking for other companies to invest, and there can be half a dozen of those, so you end up working and re-writing to the whims of what is essentially a committee.' Divorcing Jack (for which he wrote the screenplay) was savaged by the critics and didn't, consequently, find the home-grown success it deserved, while Cycle Of Violence (re-titled Crossmaheart) failed to find distribution and went straight to video. His third, Empire State, which he sold for no money at all to a small British company, has already gone through three directors before a single frame has been shot. And Bateman is a success story? This is not reassuring. This next one, however, may be. This year, Harland Miller - a 36-year-old east London-based artist and peer of Jay Joplin and Sam Taylor Wood - published Slow Down Arthur, Stick To Thirty, his debut novel, for a reported \u00a3150,000. Agents flew in from Hollywood for several tense pow-wows. The film rights eventually went to Danny Boyle and Andrew MacDonald's production company, DNA, and it was reported that Jarvis Cocker, Miller's long-time friend, was down to direct, with Jude Law desperate for the lead role. Bingo. Six months on, however, and Miller has yet to pop the champagne cork. 'There was a lot of hype initially,' he says, hesitantly, 'which was good, if a little misleading. To be honest with you, I think the book is currently sitting in a drawer right now, gathering dust.' Given DNA's schedule - they are working on a couple of films back-to-back, as well as developing a TV series - Miller's novel isn't due to go into production until some time next year. All being well, of course. Whether Law will take the title role is now no longer certain, and the Pulp frontman has yet to sign on. 'Books often stall along the way for a number of reasons,' explains Hamilton-Shaw. So what chance, I ask, does Sidewalking have? 'As good a chance as any, really. I do think that it does have potential to be developed as a small British independent film, so you never know.' FilmFour's Jim Wilson is also cautiously optimistic. 'Essentially, it treads very familiar ground, and gangland London has been done to death, but you tried to subvert it, which is clever because what do you do when you're working in a very well-established genre?

It must eliminate 26,000 jobs and halve real wages for the remaining workers by 50 per cent in four steps in months specified by the IMF. It must begin to transfer ownership of its biggest water system to foreign operators by July and grant BP's Arco subsidiary the right to build and own an oil pipeline over the Andes.</p> <p>That's for starters. In all, the IMF's 167 loan conditions look less like an assistance plan and more like a blueprint for a financial coup d'etat.</p> <p>The IMF would say it has no choice.

They are the 8 per cent of the nation's population who have the Aids virus. The financial 'rescuers' found a brilliant neo-liberal solution: require Tanzania to charge for hospital visits, previously free.

      "body": "<p><strong>1 Phil Tufnell England (1990-) </strong></p> <p>There have been some poor and unproductive number elevens over the years but none has looked so terrified as Phil Tufnell as he goes out to bat against an international pace bowler. Clearly he'd rather be at the dentist's. He employs all the modern equipment available - helmet, inside-thigh pads, chest pads - but still pain seems inevitable. In fact Tufnell has a reasonable eye for a ball. Throughout his highest innings - 67 not out against Worcestershire at Lord's - he kept smashing over extra cover. That was before Glenn McGrath played for Worcestershire; medium-pacer Stuart Lampitt was their fastest bowler. Tufnell might enjoy the notoriety of being No1 but his lack of ability with the bat has cost him Test caps. <br> <strong> Finest hour </strong>(and 21 minutes) 2 not out in 81 minutes in Bombay (the spinners were on). <br> <strong>Test record </strong>41 Tests, 146 runs, average 5.03</p> <p><strong>2 Bhagwat Chandrasekhar India (1964-1979) </strong> </p> <p>Had more excuse than Tufnell to be terrified. The Indian leg-spinner played before the advent of helmets and his right arm was withered by polio at the age of five (he bowled right-handed, threw left-handed and - for what it's worth - batted right-handed, but not for long). In Jamaica in 1976 when the Indian second innings was brought to a close on 97-5 - a lead of 13 - Chandra would have been relieved; captain Bishen Bedi claimed that four of his players were injured so they did not have to face up to the fearsome quartet of West Indian pacemen.<br> <strong>Finest hour </strong>In 1978 the Australians presented him with a bat with a hole in the middle to commemorate his batting prowess. Chandra apparently was amused. Acquired a record four pairs in Test cricket.<br> <strong>Test record </strong>58 Tests, 167 runs, average 4.07</p> <p><strong>3 Devon Malcolm England (1989-1997)</strong> </p> <p>Was brave enough but appeared to have problems seeing the ball. He could hit it vast distances if he connected. Occasionally he did (see finest hour, below). More often than not he missed. Sometimes he frustrated opponents long enough for them to bowl short at him. Courtney Walsh, stretching the laws to breaking point and beyond, peppered him in Jamaica, and at the Oval in 1994 he was hit on the helmet by the South African paceman, Fanie DeVilliers. This prompted the famous Malcolm outburst, 'You guys are history', and 9-57 in South Africa's second innings. In those days a nasty conundrum for England captains was whether to bat Malcolm or Tufnell at number 10. <br> <strong>Finest hour</strong> Adelaide in 1995, when he hit Shane Warne for two mammoth sixes. <br> <strong>Test record</strong> 40 Tests, 236 runs, average 6.05</p> <p><strong>4 Pommie Mbwanga Zimbabwe (1996-) </strong> </p> <p>The Zimbabwean swing bowler still has scope to rise up the list. His figures are awful, but he has not played many Tests yet and the Zimbabweans claim that he knows how to hold a bat. We have seen no evidence of this so far. However, deep research reveals that he averaged 31 for Dean Close School in 1995 (top score 72 not out). Test cricket is proving more demanding than the English public school circuit. <br> <strong>Finest hour</strong> He made a stunning 8 against England in May 2000 at Lord's, his highest Test score, before he was clean bowled by Andy Caddick.<br> <strong>Test record </strong>14 Tests, 29 runs , average 1.81</p> <p><strong>5 Glenn McGrath Australia (1993-)</strong> </p> <p>No doubt the Aussies will protest that we have the gall to include any of their number, but McGrath ( pronounced, according to the ACB website, 'magraa' just in case he sounds too friendly) is pretty useless. He's tried hard to improve when Steve Waugh, the best possible tutor; took him under his wing. This summer batting for Worcestershire, he did manage to record his maiden half-century in first-class cricket, but his Test record still warrants his inclusion here. He's brave though. Early on in his Test career he adopted the policy of bouncing the West Indian fast bowlers in the certain knowledge that he himself would be liberally bounced back and that he was incapable of coping with the barrage. <br> <strong>Finest hour</strong> His highest Test score of 39 against the West Indies in Port of Spain in 1999, in which he shared a last-wicket stand of 66 with Jason Gillespie, out of Australia's total of 269. He was man-of-the-match, although his 10 wickets might have had something to do with that.<br> <strong>Test record </strong>62 Tests, 316 runs, average 5.96</p> <p><strong>6 Peter Such England (1993-1999)</strong></p> <p>Another brave man given his lack of ability. He tries like fury, steels himself to get into line against the fast bowlers and occasionally astounds us. In one Ashes Test he took it upon himself to charge Merv Hughes, an odd thing for one of the most reliable and professional of pros to attempt. Like Tufnell he would have played more Tests if he could bat - just a bit. <br> <strong>Finest hour</strong> The longest duck in English Test history against New Zealand at Old Trafford in 1999. He lasted 72 minutes.<br> <strong>Test record</strong> 11 Tests, 67 runs, average 6.09 </p> <p><strong>7 Jim Griffiths Northamptonshire (1974-1986)</strong></p> <p>Our solitary non-Test player, but Griffiths' exploits with the bat for Northamptonshire live on in cricketing folklore. He was hopeless; in 138 first-class innings he averaged 3.33 and notched 51 noughts. But like most rabbits he enjoyed one moment of glory... <br> <strong>Finest hour</strong> It was the NatWest semi-final of 1981. Northamptonshire needed 13 runs off eight overs to beat Lancashire when last man Griffiths strode out to join Allan Lamb. One problem: Michael Holding was bowling. So there followed a duel that was realistically described as 'the best bowler in the world against the worst batsman'. Somehow Griffiths got something in the way during Holding's final overs and from the penultimate ball of the match, Northamptonshire won. Lamb scored the runs, but it was Griffiths who was carried shoulder-high from the field.</p> <p><strong>8 Alan Mullally England (1996-) </strong></p> <p>Has too much ability to be in this list. He can be the cleanest striker of a cricket ball. Supposedly laid back and unflappable he often loses his marbles with the bat in his hand - especially when playing for England. Wild swishes, totally out of order in the context of the game, result. The most damning statistic of all is that Devon Malcolm averages more for England.<br><strong> Finest hour</strong> Riling McGrath in Melbourne 18 months ago while scoring a vital 16.<br><strong>Test record</strong> 18 Tests, 127 runs, average 5.77</p> <p><strong>9 Jim Higgs Australia (1978-1981)</strong></p> <p>This Australian leg-spinner of the Seventies and Eighties, and more recently one of their Test selectors, was a poor batsman. However he is inordinately proud of his record on the 1975 Ashes tour of England. During that summer he failed to make the Test team, but he played in eight first-class matches. Yet he did not score a run on the tour. He had two innings and faced only one delivery, which bowled him.<br><strong>Finest hour</strong> He made his top Test score of 16 at Adelaide against England in 1979 before being run out.<br><strong>Test record</strong> 22 Tests, 116 runs, average 5.55</p> <p><strong>10 Courtney Walsh West Indies (1984-)</strong></p> <p>Just scrapes in. He's scored more Test ducks than anyone. He's hugely entertaining, a comic mime artist in pads in contrast to the clinically ruthless destroyer we see when he has the ball in his hands. He has been there when the West Indies have recorded epic victories, most notably alongside Brian Lara at Bridgetown when the Australians were beaten by one wicket in one of the greatest matches of this era. And occasionally he hits the ball massive distances. Usually he gets out, though he can point to the highest batting average on this list.<br><strong>Finest hour</strong> An unbeaten 30 against Australia in Melbourne 1988. During this innings he outscored Desmond Haynes, Richie Richardson and Viv Richards.<br><strong>Test record</strong> 122 Tests, 896 runs, average 8.14</p> <p><strong>Justifying his selection...</strong></p> <p>This month's 10 were selected by Observer cricket writer Vic Marks. Here he explains his choices:</p> <p>Rabbits are a dying breed on the cricket field. Hopeless batsmen used to provoke sympathetic smiles from captains and coaches and great anticipation and hilarity among spectators. But they are not so readily tolerated nowadays when cricketers are required to be 'multi-dimensional', which I think means they must all be able to bat a bit as well as catch and throw. Out-and-out specialists are increasingly scorned, unless they are absolutely brilliant like Glenn McGrath or Courtney Walsh. Examine England's tour party for Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Arguably the best two spinners in the country are still Phil Tufnell and Peter Such, yet they won't be going anywhere this winter. The selecters have preferred Ashley Giles and Ian Salisbury, not because they are better bowlers but because they might score a few runs. Both Tufnell and Such make my top ten. I've tried to restrict myself to Test cricketers of recent vintage, but the claims of Northamptonshire's Jim Griffiths, were irresistible. Those unlucky not to make the list include New Zealand's Geoff Allott (average 3.37), Zimbabwe's Henry Olonga (4.56), Angus Fraser (7.46 from 46 Tests) and Ed Giddins (2.50 but from just four Tests). Commiserations to all of them. <strong>Vic Marks's finest hour </strong>There were three fifties, but the top score was 83 against Pakistan in Faisalabad, in 1984. <strong>And his Test record </strong> 6 Tests, 249 runs, average 27.66 </p> <p><strong>OSM Letters</strong></p> <p>OSM welcomes letters from readers.

Wales hosted a hitherto unbeaten New Zealand, on December 16th 1905, in a match heralded as the \"World Championship of Rugby\".

Welsh scrum-half legend Dicky Owen feinted a blind-side attack from a scrum and threw a long pass, wrong-footing the All Blacks and giving Wales an overlapping runner and Teddy Morgan his try in the left corner.

In 1936 England beat New Zealand for the first time in a rugby international, thanks to two splendid tries by 19-year-old Alexander Obolensky, the Russian Prince who came to England as a baby. The second try sealed a 13-0 victory and brought the crowd to its feet. Obolensky took a pass on the right, inside his own half and as the All Black cover raced across to intercept, he veered diagonally across the field leaving the entire defence wrong footed to score a historic try out on the left wing. <br><strong>Mr Harrison </strong><br> Torquay, Devon </p> <p>1 Mike Slemen (British Lions v SA Invitation XV 1980) <br>2 Scott Gibbs (Wales v England 1999)<br> 3 Phil Bennett (Wales v Scotland 1977) <br>4 Stu Wilson (New Zealand v France 1977)<br> 5 Ieuan Evans (Wales v England 1993) <br>6 John Kirwan (New Zealand v Italy 1987)<br> 7 David Campese (Australia v Scotland 1984)<br> 8 Jonah Lomu (New Zealand v Australia 2000)<br> 9 Graham Price (Wales v France 1975) <br>10 Noel Mannion (Ireland v Wales 1989) <br><strong> Martin Evans </strong><br> via email</p> <p>I must question your inclusion of Tony Stanger's try as the ball was not grounded.

It was soon clear that young David was football-mad. Won the Bobby Charlton Soccer Skills award aged 11.

'If you stuck a girl or a ball in front of David he'd pick up the ball,' said John Bullock, his school games' teacher. <br><strong>Marital status </strong>Married Victoria 'Posh Spice' Adams last year, an event that generated more column inches than the royal marriage of Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones which happened later that summer. 'I like Victoria for herself... I'd like her if she worked in Tesco,' said Becks. The couple have one son, Brooklyn (after the New York district where he was conceived), now aged 18 months. <br><strong>United he stands </strong>Signed as a trainee with Manchester United on 8 July 1991. Part of United's all-star youth team which won the FA Youth Cup in 1992. <br><strong> First-team debut</strong> At the age of 17 on 23 September 1992, coming on as a substitute in a Rumbelows Cup tie against Brighton. He was loaned to Preston North End in 1995 to toughen him up. Made his league debut on 2 April 1995 against Leeds at Old Trafford. The match ended goalless. <br><strong>Early impressions</strong> 'Although the 19-year-old Beckham did well on his Premiership debut, he could not be expected to provide the service that Cole has come to expect from Kanchelskis,' read The Guardian match report after Beckham's league debut.<br><strong> Rising star</strong> Made his name in 1996 when, on the first day of the season, he lobbed Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan from inside his own half. <br><strong> Inspiration?</strong> Former team-mate Eric Cantona. 'Eric was my role model. He's the best I've ever played with. A great guy. One day I'd like to be as charismatic as him.' <br><strong> Johan Cruyff on Beckham</strong> 'Beckham thrills me. He is one of the elite players in Europe. He is truly gifted. When my son Jordi joined Manchester United he told me of Beckham's great abilities and I took notice.' <br><strong> George Best on Beckham</strong> 'I don't think he's a great player. He can't kick with his left foot, he doesn't score many goals, he can't head a ball and he can't tackle. Apart from that he's all right.' <br><strong> Red mist</strong> Sent off in the 1998 World Cup for kicking out at Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone, and promptly blamed for costing England victory. Had to have police protection on his return to training with Man United and was mercilessly jeered by opposition fans for months afterwards. Becks' grandmother is one of his biggest critics: 'My nan is always remarking how often I seem to argue with referees. Worse than that is that my nan is an excellent lip-reader, so she knows exactly what I'm saying.' <br><strong>Voice coach </strong>'I only have to open my mouth and I get totally slaughtered,' says Becks of his Cockney accent. Ryan Giggs on Beckham's accent 'When he wants you to kick the ball he yells \"'It it\", which sounds really funny.

      "byline": "Ian Ridley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the camera is trained on him, he goes immediately, automatically, into that famous and familiar moody, brooding look. You wonder if Sir Alex Ferguson has it right when he talks about the fun-loving boy having become an introverted young man, or whether it is just a professional pose that Manchester United and England's golden vision has picked up from his wife Victoria. </p> <p>After all, a similar attitude to the lens has proved marketable and profitable for her in another branch of showbiz. Either way, David Beckham is yer average snapper's dream, a top photographer's challenge. Because of his good looks and natural relationship with a camera, it is as easy to get a cracking shot out of Beckham as it is for United to get one from a free kick 25 yards out. Because he has been changed by painful experience of these eagle-eyed, green-eyed times - where the price of talent and fame is death threats, an attempt to snatch his son and a stalker - that guarded, sullen, photogenic look is both non-committal mask and a way of telling people he doesn't yet know or trust not to come too close.</p> <p>It could be that which Ferguson has sought to understand and explain. But it is not the essence of Beckham and the challenge is to find the hidden reality. It emerges when you spend some time with the man who is a supposedly shallow media face but a substantial figure on the football field. It is to hear and glimpse the unexpected. </p> <p>To the people who believe life is an intellectual exercise, rather than an emotional journey, Beckham appears to be a dumbbell. For a man whose eloquence and intelligence is best with a ball at his feet, he doesn't do half bad in revealing some unsuspected feelings and thoughts, however. 'Absolutely,' he says when you ask him if he agrees that those who have it all are not allowed to have down days. And he admits to having them, admits to having the potential to 'crack up' over remarks about his wife and son. </p> <p>In private, this is not the man whose public image is supposed to echo Dorothy Parker's comment about the actor who 'ran the gamut of emotions from A to B'. You ask him something routine, for example, about the recent goalless draw in Kiev. 'It's always hard going over to places like that,' he begins to reply and you anticipate him saying something like it being because Eastern European teams are so well-organised, but then he adds 'and you see the poverty over there and then come back to your life.' </p> <p>He pauses and looks pensive for a moment before expanding. 'When we were coming back from training the main streets were pitch black. There was, like, a little lamp on each street corner. It was hard to sign autographs over there because the people were so, sort of, intense, but I did the best I could, signing as many as I could because that, and I'm not sounding big-headed, but that to someone, stopping and signing autographs, means a lot. You look at these people and realise how lucky you are.'</p> <p>The first unexpected aspect to Beckham had come an hour earlier. We were sat, the photographer, one of Beckham's agents and I, at a pavement caf* in the well-heeled Cheshire village that is his northern base. With the stealth that disarms full-backs, he suddenly appeared from nowhere, having noticed us on his way home from training and pulled up his silver BMW, one of the fleet of cars he so loves driving, especially at 2am for 'the freedom of the road'. </p> <p>When introduced, he smiles, offers a hand and fixes you with an eye contact surprisingly prolonged and confident for one said to be so shy. His flat surprises, too. No sign of the stereotypical footballer's World of Leather interior here. The wide halls are lined with favourite framed photos from matches and intimate pictures of the Spice Girls, like Mel C on stage in a Brazil shirt and Mel B plucking the eyebrows of her now estranged husband Jimmy Gulzar. </p> <p>There is also a copy of that tableau painting by Michael Browne, The Art of the Game, autographed by the subjects, which features Eric Cantona in imperial Roman pose with his young team-mates, including Beckham, at his feet and Ferguson at his head. In the kitchen, there look to be at least 100 greetings cards urging Victoria - at home with her parents today recovering from viral meningitis - to get well. Behind a door with a silver star on it inscribed 'Brooklyn's Room,' their son naps under wall paintings of cartoon characters. </p> <p>Beckham himself likes to relax by drawing Disney characters but he wanted someone better for the murals, he says. We settle in the tasteful lounge, in two of the three deep, cream fabric sofas set around a thakat table and the widest of widescreen televisions. It does not dominate the room, though. Nor does a touching photo of Victoria and him in embrace. That falls to a 3ft-high Buddha. Only Brooklyn's toys, which include a mini sit-in sports car, disturb the ambience here, as does a bag of Pampers back down the corridor. </p> <p>You can bet Beckham knows that Feng Shui is not the name of some Japanese full-back he may encounter in the next World Cup finals. It's funny. You think you know everything there is to know about Beckham because he seems to be such public property these days and you wonder what new questions you can ask him. You soon realise how much time you would need to get a full picture. </p> <p>He has a new book out, My World, and it contains some fascinating insights, both verbal and pictorial. It is, it should be said, a quick response to the prospective publication of an unauthorised book which was contested in the courts by Beckham and his wife, by Andrew Morton, formerly the controversial chronicler of Diana, Princess of Wales. In retaliation, Beckham has clearly been advised to launch a charm offensive, of which a television appearance with Michael Parkinson and quite probably this interview are parts.</p> <p>There is more in his book than I thought there would be, I tell him. 'A lot more than I wanted there to be,' Beckham says, and that dilemma between wanting to open up and fearing the consequences surfaces. It courses through his conversation. Yes, Manchester United would beat England, he says instantly, before adding 'No. I don't know. I can't really answer that.' You find out that he has been, he admits, inches and seconds away from thumping an abusive member of a crowd and that he understands 'totally' what Cantona did five years ago when he leapt feet first at a fan. He quickly has to add the politically correct rider that what Eric did was wrong. </p> <p>You find out, too, that he wears a new pair of custom-made boots for almost every game, unlike most professionals who prefer a worn old pair, because he likes to look smart and feel good. That makes around 300 pairs so far around this mid-point of the 25-year-old's career. He keeps all the used-once pairs 'somewhere in London', he says, but is hesitant to tell you where. It takes a while for you to realise why he is so reticent, then you understand; some budding Imelda Marcos out there could well be tempted into a bit of breaking and entering. </p> <p>We start, once he has finished his chip butty with ketchup, by talking about Manchester United. It is, after all, for all the peripheral matters, the blood that courses through the veins of his varied life. With United so dominant in the Premiership in early season, the title is already as good as won, isn't it? </p> <p> 'People always say when we are playing well that we've won it already but I think to us it's never over until the last ball's kicked in the last game of the season. We play till then. If we were to believe what people say about the team and the players, we probably wouldn't be as ambitious as we are.' You wonder if it ever gets boring, winning games so comfortably, and whether this might be behind some uncharacteristic recent squandering of comfortable leads. </p> <p>'It never, ever gets boring,' he says. 'Against Everton, the first half was probably the most enjoyable game of football I've played in, not because we were hammering them, or winning two or three-nil, but just the way we were playing. It was such good football, such enjoyable football, the way we were passing the ball about, the times I was getting on the ball. </p> <p>'Even when I'm not involved in some of the moves, I can look at it and smile because I think how lucky I am to be in a team like this that plays this football. There is a lapse in concentration sometimes for five or 10 minutes and a team gets back into the game but I don't think we're a team that takes the mick out of teams. The respect thing is always there towards other teams because they are professional players playing their best and trying their hardest. We are taught that as we come through the ranks at United. Like we're taught that it's important not just to be playing good football at the start of a game but also at the end of the season.' </p> <p>Never was that better seen than in United's Treble year, when they won the European Cup with the last two kicks of the campaign. Is this team even better? 'I wouldn't say we were better but we are a more experienced team. I think we have learnt from our experiences of playing in Europe and winning the Premier League. We go into Europe and know what to expect from these teams most of the time.' Like the routine goalless draw in Kiev? 'That's the good thing about it.'</p> <p> The 3-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven intruded as motivation anew. It is remarkable, love them or hate them, that United retain the same thirst for trophies season after season, just when you think they may have peaked. </p> <p>'I don't think I'm at my peak yet and I don't think this team is at its peak yet,' says Beckham. 'Because most of us are still young, still 25 and 26, we've still got a lot to learn from the game. There are still a lot of trophies to be won. We are not getting ahead of ourselves and we're not being big-headed.' </p> <p>Remarkable, too, that United maintain an astonishing appetite for work during games, the factor which distinguishes them from rivals who may have as much talent. 'That's the good thing about our team,' he says. 'You don't get players hiding during a game. Players work hard not just for themselves but for the team. If you look around the team, every player works for each other. If one player goes forward, another will step in. </p> <p>'That was the work ethic we have had pumped into us since we were apprentices. Me, Gary, Phil, Scholesy, Butty, Giggsy, we were brought up to work hard at our game and we knew the rewards in front of us if we did. We had to go back in the afternoons and some of us went back in the evenings to work with the kids who were coming up when we were apprentices.' </p> <p>Now in the afternoons, Beckham will sometimes go back and practise free-kicks with bare feet, to improve his feel for the ball. 'It's something I have always done,' he says, and no, it doesn't bruise or damage his feet. 'I did have bad toenails and a fungal infection in all my toes around the World Cup but I got put on tablets for six months and that cleared it up.' Was it true that the youth team coach Eric Harrison's motto to the apprentices was to play the game and not the occasion? </p> <p>'Yeah. It was the best thing to say to us really. Because when you are at a team like Man United you can step on to the pitch and look around and think, \"Oh my God, what am I doing here?\"' Has he ever felt that? 'Never. Sometimes I look around and think, \"Jesus, I am a lucky person.\"' It echoes what Sir Alex, who often speaks of what makes a Manchester United player, once said of Eric Cantona; that he walked into Old Trafford and stuck out his chest as if to ask if the club was big enough for him. </p> <p>'You have got to have a certain amount of arrogance to play at Man United, whether people like it or not,' adds Beckham. 'It is such a big club with so many expectations of you as a player. If you look through the United teams over the last 10 years, they have had players who have got the arrogance and the determination to win. That's pumped into us even at a young age. We have all got the aggression. It's been proved a number of times. We all stick together and that's the important thing.' </p> <p>The criticism arising from their attitude, you put to him, is that United are ungracious in victory, let alone defeat. 'We are ungracious in the extent of we just hate, despise losing. It's not like we won't shake players' hands. We are not that sort of team. We'll accept it if we've been beaten but we hate it. That's what makes us the players and the team we are. People always sing \"we hate Man United\" but you always get them asking for your autograph afterwards.'</p> <p>The affinity for United, the club given to him by his dad Ted, is deep. Has he never thought of leaving, not even when dropped last season for the match against Leeds after an argument with the manager over him missing training to look after Brooklyn? 'Never,' he replies, quick as a flash. 'There was something in the papers that weekend that this could be it but I never even thought about it. </p> <p>'I was on international duty that week and me and Gary [ Neville, his best friend and best man at his wedding] just talked about what had happened. We decided the best thing I could do was get my head down, get it sorted and get playing again.' There was a suggestion that Neville had told him to cut out the showbiz lifestyle. 'No,' adds Beckham. 'Gary would never say that. I might be pictured at a party or be in the papers but he knows that even though my wife's in the pop life, I am level-headed and concentrating on my football.' </p> <p>You suggest that what he is going through, with all the public scrutiny, resembles George Best in the Sixties, when United didn't understand the phenomenon of stardom. 'I still don't think they do,' he mutters. Beckham is clearly a different personality from Best, however. He cites his favourite night in as a video and Chinese takeaway with Victoria, and night out a meal in a restaurant with her. Perhaps it is even worse these days, with all the media outlets. 'Most of the stuff that goes into the papers is a load of crap,' he says. 'There was a story saying Walkers wanted to bring out Smoky Beckham crisps and I was supposed to be going to court and taking proceedings because I didn't know anything about it. I was asked about a year ago but I didn't think it was right for me. </p> <p>'People believe stories about me spending \u00a31,200 on a pair of jeans and they think, \"He's big' or whatever.' Then he laughs. 'I buy a lot of clothes and I do spend most of my money on clothes but unless I really liked them I wouldn't buy them. And I didn't like them.' The story about the new boots for every game, told to me by an England player, is true. 'I like the look of new boots and I feel good in new boots,' he says, agreeing that he has a need to feel clean and smart all the time. He breaks the routine only if he has done especially well in one pair, or scored a particularly good goal, in which case he will wear them again. </p> <p>'I used to give some of the old ones with \"Becks\" on the tongue away to charity or back to adidas but since I had \"Brooklyn\" on the tongue I don't give none of them away any more. 'We get phoned up about stories every day. Some you just laugh at and others are hurtful, saying things that are so not true. There was a story saying me and Victoria were arguing because she was spending so much time doing her new single. Which is a load of crap. [The story, not the single, you should explain on his behalf.] I don't know whether they are trying to get to us or make people not like us but it's things like that that upset us.'</p> <p>Actually, the two are probably well aware that doting celebrity couples may be interesting to the well-paying glam mags but are less exciting to the mass market red-top papers who know that rifts sell better. Along with controversy. 'People say, \"Oh he's going off the rails, he's down in London, or living in London,\"' adds Beckham. 'I've never lived in London while I've been with Man United. People like to stir things up and make the manager believe things.' So does the legendarily watchful Ferguson phone him to see what he is up to? </p> <p>'He's done it once but I think he rings other people around me. There was one occasion about two months after the Leeds game. It was said I was flying here, there and everywhere, to Italy, to Spain, and he rang me up one afternoon when I was going for a sauna in Manchester. He said, \"Where the eff are you?\" I said, \"In the car.\" He went, \"Oh right. I've just had a call saying someone's sat next to you in Barcelona airport.\" I think he gets calls all the time about me. Some of them he doesn't believe and some of them he's got to check out because they could be true.' </p> <p>It is a, shall we say, interesting relationship with the manager. 'Beyond whatever has gone on between me and the manager or whatever's been in the papers,' he replies, 'I think there will always be that respect from me to him and hopefully him to me.' Is it true that the players privately call him Taggart, after the dour Scottish TV detective? 'I don't. I don't think so. They wouldn't get away with it.' And did Beckham have that shaved haircut to avoid the notorious 'hairdryer' treatment, when Ferguson stands in a player's face to berate him? He smiles. 'I've had it a few times. I had it with Eric Harrison in the youth team.'</p> <p>Beckham no longer keeps it secret that he would prefer to play in the centre of United's midfield, as he did for England last month against France. 'I look at players like Zidane and they are playing in the middle and getting more involved in the game than I am on the right,' he says. 'That's the position I want to play and in years to come hopefully I will. It's just something I want to do and have always wanted to do. But it won't be until the manager gets another right winger, I don't think. He has said in the past that I could if he finds a player who can cross the ball as well as I do. But you never know. He might just get rid of me if he gets another right winger.' </p> <p>Is it therefore possible that he might have to leave Manchester United to fulfil that ambition, to overtake Rivaldo, to whom he finished runner-up last year as World Player of the Year? 'Not really. Even though I want to play in the middle, I am still playing quite good football on the right. At the end of the day, if I am happy in my life and my football at Man United, then I won't make any changes in it. It's up to me and my family, up to me if I am happy football-wise. And I am happy. I've had the offers, you see things in the papers about Barcelona and Milan and Madrid and you think about it, but if I am happy I don't see why I should move anywhere else.' </p> <p>It might be difficult, you suggest, to find such a well-oiled team into which he would slip so easily. 'That's the thing that makes my football enjoyable. I have grown up with these players, we know each other's strengths and weaknesses and we gel. People can always have their opinions, like to become a great player you have got to play in Italy or Spain, but happiness is more important. It's my decision. People will say, \"Oh it's Victoria who's making the decisions.\" It will never be Victoria who will take me away from Manchester United.' And the suggestions that he is under her thumb? 'I'm not even bothered,' he says. 'People can think what they like. I know the truth.' </p> <p>You venture that it's a nice thumb to be under. 'Course it is. It could be a horrible, nasty thumb but it's a very beautiful thumb. People are always going to stir things up between me and Victoria. They say she's the boss but we know the truth.' </p> <p>Might it be the abuse he has endured, notably after the sending-off against Argentina in France '98, that could ultimately drive him away? It seems not. 'I had a lot go on after the World Cup. Victoria was away on tour and I was in the house, the old house in north Manchester, on my own. I used to go driving at two in the morning a lot because I couldn't sleep. I was missing her and I don't need that much sleep anyway [though he also admits, when he does nod off, to being able to sleep through the loudest of alarms]. I like it at that time of the morning and I do like driving. You have just got the freedom of the road. I don't do it so much now because I can sleep now I am a father. </p> <p>'But all that stuff definitely made me stronger as a person. Made me change the way I thought about things and people. A lot of good came out, not that I want it to happen again but looking back, it was good for me in a weird way. I was glad it did. If that hadn't happened, something else would over the next couple of years.' Here, that steely side of his personality appears, as you ask him about certain critics' reaction to the Argentina red card. He repeats the remarks of the new book, which stick out amid all the generally good-natured text, just as his self-destructive periodic spits of temper on the field punctuate his largely creative game. </p> <p>'I'll get them back one day, a lot of people who said things about me on TV and in the papers, a mixture of people,' he says calmly. 'I couldn't name names at this point in time but in my own way maybe I won't get them back but I'll always remember that. I don't hold grudges but if someone has said something nasty about me and my family, then I remember it.' You suggest that putting them in a wall 10 yards away from a free-kick of his might be satisfying. 'That would be nice,' he replies. </p> <p> And the stalker? 'That was six or seven months ago. She just used to come up to the front door. Appear. She got put in care and we've not seen her again, touch wood.' Then you curse yourself for your insensitivity in suggesting that you know you've made it when you've got your own stalker. He smiles a wide smile, as if he's heard that one in the dressing room. 'It's not nice, though,' he says. Then, what about the attempted snatching of Brooklyn outside Harrods last year?</p> <p>'It's something that happened that was a warning for us. We knew from letters we had got and things people had said that he's not going to have the most normal of lives but as parents we are trying to get him to live a normal life. It is going to be difficult to find a school but as long as we are happy with what's going on inside the school then I don't think there will be a problem. You can be paranoid to a certain extent but in the end it'll start affecting your life and we don't want that.' </p> <p>You can imagine he is actually looking forward, as a proud dad, to standing outside the school gates waiting for the bell. It is the comments about Brooklyn from the stands that get to him most. The worst elements seem to have moved on from Posh Spice's imagined sexual preferences to, disgracefully and depressingly, hoping that Beckham's son gets cancer. And he confesses to having been close to emulating Cantona's assault on a fan. </p> <p>'I totally understand it. Things happen on the pitch and things happen off the pitch. What fans shout these days is horrendous, even worse than five years ago with Eric. Eric knows he was wrong but at the end of the day, that's his way.' And when has he been tempted to react similarly? 'Most of the time it's been at Chelsea or West Ham. West Ham are bad. Southampton as well, they're one of the worst. The things they say are the worst I have ever experienced. I have even got used to stuff about Brooklyn now. I've got to. Because if I don't, then I will just crack up. </p> <p>'I just get on with it. I don't like it. It upsets me. It kills me them saying it about either of them. Victoria has always said to me, \"Just think what they are doing. They are getting their aggression out on you and going home to probably a sad life.\" She always turns round and says that if you are ever at that point, just think about what you've got and what you are doing. These people would do anything to be playing for Man United and England. I've got to think of that straightaway or I could do something.' </p> <p>He has, he says, confronted abusers. 'I have turned round sometimes to the crowd when someone's, like, shouting and I can actually hear them saying what they are saying and I look them in the face and they will just stop because they are embarrassed.' Then his sense of humour breaks through. 'Unless it's Chelsea or West Ham. Then I look away again.' </p> <p>He has sensed some change in mood, he says, since Euro 2000, during which he gestured back towards abusive fans after England's defeat by Portugal. He was, after all, one of the country's few successes of the tournament and says of the developing attitude to him: 'It stunned me in a way when I got a player of the year award from the fans [in a recent television poll]. To get that after what people sing and chant about me, that was something that meant a lot to me.'</p> <p>So has he feared playing for England? 'I don't fear it. I don't enjoy it probably as much as I could do but I enjoy it more than I used to. At the end of the day, people shouting at me would like to be out there.' Has he ever thought to himself, I don't need this? 'Never. Jimmy Greaves said in an article that players are paid all this money and not even bothered about playing for England but that's a load of crap.' </p> <p>Then there is a veiled criticism of Glenn Hoddle, once a personal hero who turned into a villain when he dropped Beckham in the World Cup. 'The atmosphere has changed now,' adds Beckham. 'Players always want to play for England but the week leading up to the game has got to be interesting and I think that's changed now. Players enjoy the week more.' </p> <p>What about the criticism of Kevin Keegan, that he may not be up to the job internationally? 'I don't think it can be done any better than it is being done by the staff and the manager. They are doing their best. They can pick the team and organise us but it's up to us to go out there and do the right things and win, which we didn't in Euro 2000. Against France, I felt that the team was so much better the way we played, more like playing for a club team because of the atmosphere between the players and the way they stuck together. </p> <p>'Because I have played so many games now for England I do feel more comfortable than I have ever felt. I love playing for England. I get a buzz stepping out in front of 90,000 fans. Some of them like you, some of them don't. But they all cheer when you score.' And then he laughs at himself. 'Or when I scored,' he adds, referring to the under-performing return of one goal, a brilliant free kick against Colombia, from his first 35 appearances. And for all the abuse, he would clearly like to be captain. You tell him that Keegan has been on the radio, saying that he would consider Beckham as captain if Tony Adams is injured. His face breaks into a broad smile. 'That's cheered me up. Interesting,' he responds.</p> <p>For all the craziness of the past few years, Beckham confesses that he will miss it when it is over. 'Of course. I know I have got things I want to do after I finish playing [skiing is one, though being anonymous enough to take Victoria and Brooklyn and future children camping may be fanciful] but I enjoy football so much it's weird not to think I will be doing it all the time. </p> <p>'I don't want to be a manager or a coach. I'd rather put myself into kids football. I will have had stress and hassle for the last 20 years so it will be a relief not to. I just like to see kids playing football and having a laugh.' He himself still gets that childish feeling of when he was a teenager and he would pass up the opportunity to drink cider on street corners with his mates because he wanted to be in watching Match of the Day then to bed in anticipation of his Sunday morning game. </p> <p>'I hate night games because of the waiting,' he says. 'I love playing in the mornings. Up early, playing early. It's a good feeling. I love playing Saturday-Wednesday, Saturday-Wednesday because at Sunday League level I used to play on a Saturday and Sunday, a Wednesday, a Friday, then Saturday and Sunday again.' </p> <p>As he has gradually opened up, it seems like a good time to ask him about all the jokes, the Becks and Posh, thick and thin, stuff. 'It's a laugh. Them sort of things are funny,' he says. 'It's different when people are slagging you off and being personal.' He hasn't seen the Alistair McGowan impression he says, but laughs politely when you tell him about it. </p> <p>Then it is time for the photographer, time for me to help keep the now-awake, toddling cutie Brooklyn (whose vocabulary seems to consist of 'mamma', 'dada' and 'foo'ball') amused by kicking about his 'Fred the Red' Manchester United ball with him. 'What shall I wear?' Beckham asks his agent. And all of a sudden the look, what the Americans call the 'game face', is back. </p> <p>\u0095 'David Beckham - My World' is published by Hodder and Stoughton at \u00a316.99.

      "bodyText": "When the camera is trained on him, he goes immediately, automatically, into that famous and familiar moody, brooding look. You wonder if Sir Alex Ferguson has it right when he talks about the fun-loving boy having become an introverted young man, or whether it is just a professional pose that Manchester United and England's golden vision has picked up from his wife Victoria. After all, a similar attitude to the lens has proved marketable and profitable for her in another branch of showbiz. Either way, David Beckham is yer average snapper's dream, a top photographer's challenge. Because of his good looks and natural relationship with a camera, it is as easy to get a cracking shot out of Beckham as it is for United to get one from a free kick 25 yards out. Because he has been changed by painful experience of these eagle-eyed, green-eyed times - where the price of talent and fame is death threats, an attempt to snatch his son and a stalker - that guarded, sullen, photogenic look is both non-committal mask and a way of telling people he doesn't yet know or trust not to come too close. It could be that which Ferguson has sought to understand and explain. But it is not the essence of Beckham and the challenge is to find the hidden reality. It emerges when you spend some time with the man who is a supposedly shallow media face but a substantial figure on the football field. It is to hear and glimpse the unexpected. To the people who believe life is an intellectual exercise, rather than an emotional journey, Beckham appears to be a dumbbell. For a man whose eloquence and intelligence is best with a ball at his feet, he doesn't do half bad in revealing some unsuspected feelings and thoughts, however. 'Absolutely,' he says when you ask him if he agrees that those who have it all are not allowed to have down days. And he admits to having them, admits to having the potential to 'crack up' over remarks about his wife and son. In private, this is not the man whose public image is supposed to echo Dorothy Parker's comment about the actor who 'ran the gamut of emotions from A to B'. You ask him something routine, for example, about the recent goalless draw in Kiev. 'It's always hard going over to places like that,' he begins to reply and you anticipate him saying something like it being because Eastern European teams are so well-organised, but then he adds 'and you see the poverty over there and then come back to your life.' He pauses and looks pensive for a moment before expanding. 'When we were coming back from training the main streets were pitch black. There was, like, a little lamp on each street corner. It was hard to sign autographs over there because the people were so, sort of, intense, but I did the best I could, signing as many as I could because that, and I'm not sounding big-headed, but that to someone, stopping and signing autographs, means a lot. You look at these people and realise how lucky you are.' The first unexpected aspect to Beckham had come an hour earlier. We were sat, the photographer, one of Beckham's agents and I, at a pavement caf* in the well-heeled Cheshire village that is his northern base. With the stealth that disarms full-backs, he suddenly appeared from nowhere, having noticed us on his way home from training and pulled up his silver BMW, one of the fleet of cars he so loves driving, especially at 2am for 'the freedom of the road'. When introduced, he smiles, offers a hand and fixes you with an eye contact surprisingly prolonged and confident for one said to be so shy. His flat surprises, too. No sign of the stereotypical footballer's World of Leather interior here. The wide halls are lined with favourite framed photos from matches and intimate pictures of the Spice Girls, like Mel C on stage in a Brazil shirt and Mel B plucking the eyebrows of her now estranged husband Jimmy Gulzar. There is also a copy of that tableau painting by Michael Browne, The Art of the Game, autographed by the subjects, which features Eric Cantona in imperial Roman pose with his young team-mates, including Beckham, at his feet and Ferguson at his head. In the kitchen, there look to be at least 100 greetings cards urging Victoria - at home with her parents today recovering from viral meningitis - to get well. Behind a door with a silver star on it inscribed 'Brooklyn's Room,' their son naps under wall paintings of cartoon characters. Beckham himself likes to relax by drawing Disney characters but he wanted someone better for the murals, he says. We settle in the tasteful lounge, in two of the three deep, cream fabric sofas set around a thakat table and the widest of widescreen televisions. It does not dominate the room, though. Nor does a touching photo of Victoria and him in embrace. That falls to a 3ft-high Buddha. Only Brooklyn's toys, which include a mini sit-in sports car, disturb the ambience here, as does a bag of Pampers back down the corridor. You can bet Beckham knows that Feng Shui is not the name of some Japanese full-back he may encounter in the next World Cup finals. It's funny. You think you know everything there is to know about Beckham because he seems to be such public property these days and you wonder what new questions you can ask him. You soon realise how much time you would need to get a full picture. He has a new book out, My World, and it contains some fascinating insights, both verbal and pictorial. It is, it should be said, a quick response to the prospective publication of an unauthorised book which was contested in the courts by Beckham and his wife, by Andrew Morton, formerly the controversial chronicler of Diana, Princess of Wales. In retaliation, Beckham has clearly been advised to launch a charm offensive, of which a television appearance with Michael Parkinson and quite probably this interview are parts. There is more in his book than I thought there would be, I tell him. 'A lot more than I wanted there to be,' Beckham says, and that dilemma between wanting to open up and fearing the consequences surfaces. It courses through his conversation. Yes, Manchester United would beat England, he says instantly, before adding 'No. I don't know. I can't really answer that.' You find out that he has been, he admits, inches and seconds away from thumping an abusive member of a crowd and that he understands 'totally' what Cantona did five years ago when he leapt feet first at a fan. He quickly has to add the politically correct rider that what Eric did was wrong. You find out, too, that he wears a new pair of custom-made boots for almost every game, unlike most professionals who prefer a worn old pair, because he likes to look smart and feel good. That makes around 300 pairs so far around this mid-point of the 25-year-old's career. He keeps all the used-once pairs 'somewhere in London', he says, but is hesitant to tell you where. It takes a while for you to realise why he is so reticent, then you understand; some budding Imelda Marcos out there could well be tempted into a bit of breaking and entering. We start, once he has finished his chip butty with ketchup, by talking about Manchester United. It is, after all, for all the peripheral matters, the blood that courses through the veins of his varied life. With United so dominant in the Premiership in early season, the title is already as good as won, isn't it? 'People always say when we are playing well that we've won it already but I think to us it's never over until the last ball's kicked in the last game of the season. We play till then. If we were to believe what people say about the team and the players, we probably wouldn't be as ambitious as we are.' You wonder if it ever gets boring, winning games so comfortably, and whether this might be behind some uncharacteristic recent squandering of comfortable leads. 'It never, ever gets boring,' he says. 'Against Everton, the first half was probably the most enjoyable game of football I've played in, not because we were hammering them, or winning two or three-nil, but just the way we were playing. It was such good football, such enjoyable football, the way we were passing the ball about, the times I was getting on the ball. 'Even when I'm not involved in some of the moves, I can look at it and smile because I think how lucky I am to be in a team like this that plays this football. There is a lapse in concentration sometimes for five or 10 minutes and a team gets back into the game but I don't think we're a team that takes the mick out of teams. The respect thing is always there towards other teams because they are professional players playing their best and trying their hardest. We are taught that as we come through the ranks at United. Like we're taught that it's important not just to be playing good football at the start of a game but also at the end of the season.' Never was that better seen than in United's Treble year, when they won the European Cup with the last two kicks of the campaign. Is this team even better? 'I wouldn't say we were better but we are a more experienced team. I think we have learnt from our experiences of playing in Europe and winning the Premier League. We go into Europe and know what to expect from these teams most of the time.' Like the routine goalless draw in Kiev? 'That's the good thing about it.' The 3-1 defeat at PSV Eindhoven intruded as motivation anew. It is remarkable, love them or hate them, that United retain the same thirst for trophies season after season, just when you think they may have peaked. 'I don't think I'm at my peak yet and I don't think this team is at its peak yet,' says Beckham. 'Because most of us are still young, still 25 and 26, we've still got a lot to learn from the game. There are still a lot of trophies to be won. We are not getting ahead of ourselves and we're not being big-headed.' Remarkable, too, that United maintain an astonishing appetite for work during games, the factor which distinguishes them from rivals who may have as much talent. 'That's the good thing about our team,' he says. 'You don't get players hiding during a game. Players work hard not just for themselves but for the team. If you look around the team, every player works for each other. If one player goes forward, another will step in. 'That was the work ethic we have had pumped into us since we were apprentices. Me, Gary, Phil, Scholesy, Butty, Giggsy, we were brought up to work hard at our game and we knew the rewards in front of us if we did. We had to go back in the afternoons and some of us went back in the evenings to work with the kids who were coming up when we were apprentices.' Now in the afternoons, Beckham will sometimes go back and practise free-kicks with bare feet, to improve his feel for the ball. 'It's something I have always done,' he says, and no, it doesn't bruise or damage his feet. 'I did have bad toenails and a fungal infection in all my toes around the World Cup but I got put on tablets for six months and that cleared it up.' Was it true that the youth team coach Eric Harrison's motto to the apprentices was to play the game and not the occasion? 'Yeah. It was the best thing to say to us really. Because when you are at a team like Man United you can step on to the pitch and look around and think, \"Oh my God, what am I doing here?\"' Has he ever felt that? 'Never. Sometimes I look around and think, \"Jesus, I am a lucky person.\"' It echoes what Sir Alex, who often speaks of what makes a Manchester United player, once said of Eric Cantona; that he walked into Old Trafford and stuck out his chest as if to ask if the club was big enough for him. 'You have got to have a certain amount of arrogance to play at Man United, whether people like it or not,' adds Beckham. 'It is such a big club with so many expectations of you as a player. If you look through the United teams over the last 10 years, they have had players who have got the arrogance and the determination to win. That's pumped into us even at a young age. We have all got the aggression. It's been proved a number of times. We all stick together and that's the important thing.' The criticism arising from their attitude, you put to him, is that United are ungracious in victory, let alone defeat. 'We are ungracious in the extent of we just hate, despise losing. It's not like we won't shake players' hands. We are not that sort of team. We'll accept it if we've been beaten but we hate it. That's what makes us the players and the team we are. People always sing \"we hate Man United\" but you always get them asking for your autograph afterwards.' The affinity for United, the club given to him by his dad Ted, is deep. Has he never thought of leaving, not even when dropped last season for the match against Leeds after an argument with the manager over him missing training to look after Brooklyn? 'Never,' he replies, quick as a flash. 'There was something in the papers that weekend that this could be it but I never even thought about it. 'I was on international duty that week and me and Gary [ Neville, his best friend and best man at his wedding] just talked about what had happened. We decided the best thing I could do was get my head down, get it sorted and get playing again.' There was a suggestion that Neville had told him to cut out the showbiz lifestyle. 'No,' adds Beckham. 'Gary would never say that. I might be pictured at a party or be in the papers but he knows that even though my wife's in the pop life, I am level-headed and concentrating on my football.' You suggest that what he is going through, with all the public scrutiny, resembles George Best in the Sixties, when United didn't understand the phenomenon of stardom. 'I still don't think they do,' he mutters. Beckham is clearly a different personality from Best, however. He cites his favourite night in as a video and Chinese takeaway with Victoria, and night out a meal in a restaurant with her. Perhaps it is even worse these days, with all the media outlets. 'Most of the stuff that goes into the papers is a load of crap,' he says. 'There was a story saying Walkers wanted to bring out Smoky Beckham crisps and I was supposed to be going to court and taking proceedings because I didn't know anything about it. I was asked about a year ago but I didn't think it was right for me. 'People believe stories about me spending \u00a31,200 on a pair of jeans and they think, \"He's big' or whatever.' Then he laughs. 'I buy a lot of clothes and I do spend most of my money on clothes but unless I really liked them I wouldn't buy them. And I didn't like them.' The story about the new boots for every game, told to me by an England player, is true. 'I like the look of new boots and I feel good in new boots,' he says, agreeing that he has a need to feel clean and smart all the time. He breaks the routine only if he has done especially well in one pair, or scored a particularly good goal, in which case he will wear them again. 'I used to give some of the old ones with \"Becks\" on the tongue away to charity or back to adidas but since I had \"Brooklyn\" on the tongue I don't give none of them away any more. 'We get phoned up about stories every day. Some you just laugh at and others are hurtful, saying things that are so not true. There was a story saying me and Victoria were arguing because she was spending so much time doing her new single. Which is a load of crap. [The story, not the single, you should explain on his behalf.] I don't know whether they are trying to get to us or make people not like us but it's things like that that upset us.' Actually, the two are probably well aware that doting celebrity couples may be interesting to the well-paying glam mags but are less exciting to the mass market red-top papers who know that rifts sell better. Along with controversy. 'People say, \"Oh he's going off the rails, he's down in London, or living in London,\"' adds Beckham. 'I've never lived in London while I've been with Man United. People like to stir things up and make the manager believe things.' So does the legendarily watchful Ferguson phone him to see what he is up to? 'He's done it once but I think he rings other people around me. There was one occasion about two months after the Leeds game. It was said I was flying here, there and everywhere, to Italy, to Spain, and he rang me up one afternoon when I was going for a sauna in Manchester. He said, \"Where the eff are you?\" I said, \"In the car.\" He went, \"Oh right. I've just had a call saying someone's sat next to you in Barcelona airport.\" I think he gets calls all the time about me. Some of them he doesn't believe and some of them he's got to check out because they could be true.' It is a, shall we say, interesting relationship with the manager. 'Beyond whatever has gone on between me and the manager or whatever's been in the papers,' he replies, 'I think there will always be that respect from me to him and hopefully him to me.' Is it true that the players privately call him Taggart, after the dour Scottish TV detective? 'I don't. I don't think so. They wouldn't get away with it.' And did Beckham have that shaved haircut to avoid the notorious 'hairdryer' treatment, when Ferguson stands in a player's face to berate him? He smiles. 'I've had it a few times. I had it with Eric Harrison in the youth team.' Beckham no longer keeps it secret that he would prefer to play in the centre of United's midfield, as he did for England last month against France. 'I look at players like Zidane and they are playing in the middle and getting more involved in the game than I am on the right,' he says. 'That's the position I want to play and in years to come hopefully I will. It's just something I want to do and have always wanted to do. But it won't be until the manager gets another right winger, I don't think. He has said in the past that I could if he finds a player who can cross the ball as well as I do. But you never know. He might just get rid of me if he gets another right winger.' Is it therefore possible that he might have to leave Manchester United to fulfil that ambition, to overtake Rivaldo, to whom he finished runner-up last year as World Player of the Year? 'Not really. Even though I want to play in the middle, I am still playing quite good football on the right. At the end of the day, if I am happy in my life and my football at Man United, then I won't make any changes in it. It's up to me and my family, up to me if I am happy football-wise. And I am happy. I've had the offers, you see things in the papers about Barcelona and Milan and Madrid and you think about it, but if I am happy I don't see why I should move anywhere else.' It might be difficult, you suggest, to find such a well-oiled team into which he would slip so easily. 'That's the thing that makes my football enjoyable. I have grown up with these players, we know each other's strengths and weaknesses and we gel. People can always have their opinions, like to become a great player you have got to play in Italy or Spain, but happiness is more important. It's my decision. People will say, \"Oh it's Victoria who's making the decisions.\" It will never be Victoria who will take me away from Manchester United.' And the suggestions that he is under her thumb? 'I'm not even bothered,' he says. 'People can think what they like. I know the truth.' You venture that it's a nice thumb to be under. 'Course it is. It could be a horrible, nasty thumb but it's a very beautiful thumb. People are always going to stir things up between me and Victoria. They say she's the boss but we know the truth.' Might it be the abuse he has endured, notably after the sending-off against Argentina in France '98, that could ultimately drive him away? It seems not. 'I had a lot go on after the World Cup. Victoria was away on tour and I was in the house, the old house in north Manchester, on my own. I used to go driving at two in the morning a lot because I couldn't sleep. I was missing her and I don't need that much sleep anyway [though he also admits, when he does nod off, to being able to sleep through the loudest of alarms]. I like it at that time of the morning and I do like driving. You have just got the freedom of the road. I don't do it so much now because I can sleep now I am a father. 'But all that stuff definitely made me stronger as a person. Made me change the way I thought about things and people. A lot of good came out, not that I want it to happen again but looking back, it was good for me in a weird way. I was glad it did. If that hadn't happened, something else would over the next couple of years.' Here, that steely side of his personality appears, as you ask him about certain critics' reaction to the Argentina red card. He repeats the remarks of the new book, which stick out amid all the generally good-natured text, just as his self-destructive periodic spits of temper on the field punctuate his largely creative game. 'I'll get them back one day, a lot of people who said things about me on TV and in the papers, a mixture of people,' he says calmly. 'I couldn't name names at this point in time but in my own way maybe I won't get them back but I'll always remember that. I don't hold grudges but if someone has said something nasty about me and my family, then I remember it.' You suggest that putting them in a wall 10 yards away from a free-kick of his might be satisfying. 'That would be nice,' he replies. And the stalker? 'That was six or seven months ago. She just used to come up to the front door. Appear. She got put in care and we've not seen her again, touch wood.' Then you curse yourself for your insensitivity in suggesting that you know you've made it when you've got your own stalker. He smiles a wide smile, as if he's heard that one in the dressing room. 'It's not nice, though,' he says. Then, what about the attempted snatching of Brooklyn outside Harrods last year? 'It's something that happened that was a warning for us. We knew from letters we had got and things people had said that he's not going to have the most normal of lives but as parents we are trying to get him to live a normal life. It is going to be difficult to find a school but as long as we are happy with what's going on inside the school then I don't think there will be a problem. You can be paranoid to a certain extent but in the end it'll start affecting your life and we don't want that.' You can imagine he is actually looking forward, as a proud dad, to standing outside the school gates waiting for the bell. It is the comments about Brooklyn from the stands that get to him most. The worst elements seem to have moved on from Posh Spice's imagined sexual preferences to, disgracefully and depressingly, hoping that Beckham's son gets cancer. And he confesses to having been close to emulating Cantona's assault on a fan. 'I totally understand it. Things happen on the pitch and things happen off the pitch. What fans shout these days is horrendous, even worse than five years ago with Eric. Eric knows he was wrong but at the end of the day, that's his way.' And when has he been tempted to react similarly? 'Most of the time it's been at Chelsea or West Ham. West Ham are bad. Southampton as well, they're one of the worst. The things they say are the worst I have ever experienced. I have even got used to stuff about Brooklyn now. I've got to. Because if I don't, then I will just crack up. 'I just get on with it. I don't like it. It upsets me. It kills me them saying it about either of them. Victoria has always said to me, \"Just think what they are doing. They are getting their aggression out on you and going home to probably a sad life.\" She always turns round and says that if you are ever at that point, just think about what you've got and what you are doing. These people would do anything to be playing for Man United and England. I've got to think of that straightaway or I could do something.' He has, he says, confronted abusers. 'I have turned round sometimes to the crowd when someone's, like, shouting and I can actually hear them saying what they are saying and I look them in the face and they will just stop because they are embarrassed.' Then his sense of humour breaks through. 'Unless it's Chelsea or West Ham. Then I look away again.' He has sensed some change in mood, he says, since Euro 2000, during which he gestured back towards abusive fans after England's defeat by Portugal. He was, after all, one of the country's few successes of the tournament and says of the developing attitude to him: 'It stunned me in a way when I got a player of the year award from the fans [in a recent television poll]. To get that after what people sing and chant about me, that was something that meant a lot to me.' So has he feared playing for England? 'I don't fear it. I don't enjoy it probably as much as I could do but I enjoy it more than I used to. At the end of the day, people shouting at me would like to be out there.' Has he ever thought to himself, I don't need this? 'Never. Jimmy Greaves said in an article that players are paid all this money and not even bothered about playing for England but that's a load of crap.' Then there is a veiled criticism of Glenn Hoddle, once a personal hero who turned into a villain when he dropped Beckham in the World Cup. 'The atmosphere has changed now,' adds Beckham. 'Players always want to play for England but the week leading up to the game has got to be interesting and I think that's changed now. Players enjoy the week more.' What about the criticism of Kevin Keegan, that he may not be up to the job internationally? 'I don't think it can be done any better than it is being done by the staff and the manager. They are doing their best. They can pick the team and organise us but it's up to us to go out there and do the right things and win, which we didn't in Euro 2000. Against France, I felt that the team was so much better the way we played, more like playing for a club team because of the atmosphere between the players and the way they stuck together. 'Because I have played so many games now for England I do feel more comfortable than I have ever felt. I love playing for England. I get a buzz stepping out in front of 90,000 fans. Some of them like you, some of them don't. But they all cheer when you score.' And then he laughs at himself. 'Or when I scored,' he adds, referring to the under-performing return of one goal, a brilliant free kick against Colombia, from his first 35 appearances. And for all the abuse, he would clearly like to be captain. You tell him that Keegan has been on the radio, saying that he would consider Beckham as captain if Tony Adams is injured. His face breaks into a broad smile. 'That's cheered me up. Interesting,' he responds. For all the craziness of the past few years, Beckham confesses that he will miss it when it is over. 'Of course. I know I have got things I want to do after I finish playing [skiing is one, though being anonymous enough to take Victoria and Brooklyn and future children camping may be fanciful] but I enjoy football so much it's weird not to think I will be doing it all the time. 'I don't want to be a manager or a coach. I'd rather put myself into kids football. I will have had stress and hassle for the last 20 years so it will be a relief not to. I just like to see kids playing football and having a laugh.' He himself still gets that childish feeling of when he was a teenager and he would pass up the opportunity to drink cider on street corners with his mates because he wanted to be in watching Match of the Day then to bed in anticipation of his Sunday morning game. 'I hate night games because of the waiting,' he says. 'I love playing in the mornings. Up early, playing early. It's a good feeling. I love playing Saturday-Wednesday, Saturday-Wednesday because at Sunday League level I used to play on a Saturday and Sunday, a Wednesday, a Friday, then Saturday and Sunday again.' As he has gradually opened up, it seems like a good time to ask him about all the jokes, the Becks and Posh, thick and thin, stuff. 'It's a laugh. Them sort of things are funny,' he says. 'It's different when people are slagging you off and being personal.' He hasn't seen the Alistair McGowan impression he says, but laughs politely when you tell him about it. Then it is time for the photographer, time for me to help keep the now-awake, toddling cutie Brooklyn (whose vocabulary seems to consist of 'mamma', 'dada' and 'foo'ball') amused by kicking about his 'Fred the Red' Manchester United ball with him. 'What shall I wear?' Beckham asks his agent. And all of a sudden the look, what the Americans call the 'game face', is back. \u0095 'David Beckham - My World' is published by Hodder and Stoughton at \u00a316.99.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>What a fortnight it has been for sport. The feel-good Olympic Games showed just what Great Britain could do when athletes are properly developed and funded, Tony Blair duly capturing the mood and moment opportunely with his announcement at the Labour Party conference that his government were making \u00a3750 million available for grass-roots sport. </p> <p>Then Wembley yesterday, bursting at the seams with nostalgia as the wealthy national game reasserted itself. The FA, laughing all the way to the bank with their Premiership clubs enjoying a licence to print money and the England team continuing to coin it in, are doing their bit. They have earmarked \u00a311m over three years for junior schools to convert to the laudable mini-soccer scheme. So that's all right then. </p> <p>Actually, no. Figures make headlines for a day or two but sustaining the momentum is the key. The reality can often be less impressive. And the reality currently is that schools football around the country at the key developmental ages of 10 and 11 has been thrown into chaos due to the ill-conceived rush to play the mini-game with financially hard-pressed teachers unable to implement the scheme. As a result, they have little option but to flout FA rules. One worry, consequently, is that injured youngsters may not be covered by insurance. </p> <p>Few would argue that mini-soccer is not, in principle, admirable. Gone are the days when tiny goalkeepers were dots in huge goals and little legs tried to cover long pitches. To end that sorry state, the FA sent a task force abroad, including the technical director Howard Wilkinson. 'They studied best practice in countries like Holland and came up with a game they thought would be right for us,' says the FA's head of football development, Kelly Simmons. </p> <p>At under-eight level, pitches could be no more than 40 yards by 30 yards and teams would be five-a-side. At under-10, it would be seven against seven on pitches measuring 60 yards by 40 yards. Goals would be 6ft by 12ft. Good stuff. Players get time on the ball and space to develop skills. The rules would be mandatory from September 1999 and the FA would help finance the change, paying 65 per cent of the cost.</p> <p>The experience of one local schools secretary - whose leagues were eight versus eight for smaller schools and 11 against 11 for the bigger ones - causes concern, however. He does not wish to be identified as he believes his pressing of the issue over the past 18 months has already caused him enough problems with his county association. </p> <p>On hearing of the new rules in April 1999, he checked with the local schools. None had received any notification or grants. School budgets had already been determined and there was no money to pay \u00a3199.95 for a set of goals or to get the local council to mark out pitches in a new pattern. The league continued as usual, but with all matches being eight versus eight. </p> <p> Over the winter, he wrote to the FA, the English Schools Football Association, the FA's regional officer and his county association, and several times each, but all passed the buck. In exasperation this summer, he wrote to the Minister for Sport, Kate Hoey, and the FA chairman, Geoff Thompson. Finally, he received handbooks and brochures. The goals would be available to schools at the discounted price of \u00a368 and they could claim back the VAT. Too late for this season - and they are still in contra vention of FA rules - but ready for next. </p> <p> All's well that ends well. Not quite. Teachers still have huge reservations about the scheme. Why, for example, they wonder, are goals 6ft by 12ft when the ratio in the full-sized game is one to three, 8ft high by 24ft? The practical experience is that too few goals are scored. I can vouch for this having seen my son play five matches in a tournament, three of which finished 0-0. That result is common. And why seven-a-side? Eight makes more sense - one defender, one midfielder and one attacker withdrawn, giving the game more balance. And the \u00a368, it may sound paltry, but consider that junior schools can have a budget of \u00a3100 for sports. And why fork out if the goals are obsolete after a year or two because it is found they are too small? </p> <p>There is another anomaly. It is not mandatory for 11-year-olds to play mini-soccer and so junior school teams can be 11-a-side, as can Sunday morning clubs. Thus Year-five children are not allowed to play with Year-sixes. Many schools will therefore play mini-soccer to accommodate both but with only one school team. Thus, with schools struggling for one games teacher let alone two, there is football for fewer pupils. Then there is the confusion for players taking part in mini-soccer in midweek and 11-a-side on Sundays. </p> <p>'I would have thought it useful for them to get the benefits of small-sided games and take them into bigger games,' responds Kelly Simmons. She had not heard of the criticism of the size of the goals, she said. </p> <p>No matter what both bodies say, the FA and the ESFA, the professionals and the amateurs, are in conflict over player development. </p> <p>The FA clearly have trouble in reconciling 'sport for all' with developing the elite. The ESFA's ethos has always been that 'we provide football for boys (make that girls as well, these days), not boys for football'. They worry that mini-soccer just enables noisy, misguided parents to get closer to the action. </p> <p>Neither are they convinced that mini-soccer for over-10s is beneficial. 'We played a mini-soccer tournament which included a team from Feyenoord and the Dutch said they don't play it very often,' the ESFA's director of coaching John Morton told me. 'They believed that at 11, players should have learned enough to play 11-a-side.' </p> <p>'We believe in and encourage good skills and teamwork,' wrote our schools secretary to Kate Hoey and Geoff Thompson. 'We are offended when we hear it is not being done properly. We are glad the government are making funds available and working with the clubs. The love of the game and the basics are taught by primary schools. I can just see Manchester United spending hours lacing up boots and teaching basic passing. </p> <p>'It does not matter what new things are brought in if associations are treated the way we have been. Nothing will work.' </p> <p>A couple of weeks ago I stood on a touchline watching my son play and got chatting to a West Ham youth coach who happened to be an interested spectator. 'All the problems of the game are at this level,' he told me. That was when I could hear him between the angry shouts directed at his 10-year-olds by a team manager, who was also swearing within earshot. </p> <p>The FA have made a start and perhaps all these are just teething troubles. The concept of mini-soccer is surely worth pursuing. But for whom and how long? And it is not just about money.

      "bodyText": "What a fortnight it has been for sport. The feel-good Olympic Games showed just what Great Britain could do when athletes are properly developed and funded, Tony Blair duly capturing the mood and moment opportunely with his announcement at the Labour Party conference that his government were making \u00a3750 million available for grass-roots sport. Then Wembley yesterday, bursting at the seams with nostalgia as the wealthy national game reasserted itself. The FA, laughing all the way to the bank with their Premiership clubs enjoying a licence to print money and the England team continuing to coin it in, are doing their bit. They have earmarked \u00a311m over three years for junior schools to convert to the laudable mini-soccer scheme. So that's all right then. Actually, no. Figures make headlines for a day or two but sustaining the momentum is the key. The reality can often be less impressive. And the reality currently is that schools football around the country at the key developmental ages of 10 and 11 has been thrown into chaos due to the ill-conceived rush to play the mini-game with financially hard-pressed teachers unable to implement the scheme. As a result, they have little option but to flout FA rules. One worry, consequently, is that injured youngsters may not be covered by insurance. Few would argue that mini-soccer is not, in principle, admirable. Gone are the days when tiny goalkeepers were dots in huge goals and little legs tried to cover long pitches. To end that sorry state, the FA sent a task force abroad, including the technical director Howard Wilkinson. 'They studied best practice in countries like Holland and came up with a game they thought would be right for us,' says the FA's head of football development, Kelly Simmons. At under-eight level, pitches could be no more than 40 yards by 30 yards and teams would be five-a-side. At under-10, it would be seven against seven on pitches measuring 60 yards by 40 yards. Goals would be 6ft by 12ft. Good stuff. Players get time on the ball and space to develop skills. The rules would be mandatory from September 1999 and the FA would help finance the change, paying 65 per cent of the cost. The experience of one local schools secretary - whose leagues were eight versus eight for smaller schools and 11 against 11 for the bigger ones - causes concern, however. He does not wish to be identified as he believes his pressing of the issue over the past 18 months has already caused him enough problems with his county association. On hearing of the new rules in April 1999, he checked with the local schools. None had received any notification or grants. School budgets had already been determined and there was no money to pay \u00a3199.95 for a set of goals or to get the local council to mark out pitches in a new pattern. The league continued as usual, but with all matches being eight versus eight. Over the winter, he wrote to the FA, the English Schools Football Association, the FA's regional officer and his county association, and several times each, but all passed the buck. In exasperation this summer, he wrote to the Minister for Sport, Kate Hoey, and the FA chairman, Geoff Thompson. Finally, he received handbooks and brochures. The goals would be available to schools at the discounted price of \u00a368 and they could claim back the VAT. Too late for this season - and they are still in contra vention of FA rules - but ready for next. All's well that ends well. Not quite. Teachers still have huge reservations about the scheme. Why, for example, they wonder, are goals 6ft by 12ft when the ratio in the full-sized game is one to three, 8ft high by 24ft? The practical experience is that too few goals are scored. I can vouch for this having seen my son play five matches in a tournament, three of which finished 0-0. That result is common. And why seven-a-side? Eight makes more sense - one defender, one midfielder and one attacker withdrawn, giving the game more balance. And the \u00a368, it may sound paltry, but consider that junior schools can have a budget of \u00a3100 for sports. And why fork out if the goals are obsolete after a year or two because it is found they are too small? There is another anomaly. It is not mandatory for 11-year-olds to play mini-soccer and so junior school teams can be 11-a-side, as can Sunday morning clubs. Thus Year-five children are not allowed to play with Year-sixes. Many schools will therefore play mini-soccer to accommodate both but with only one school team. Thus, with schools struggling for one games teacher let alone two, there is football for fewer pupils. Then there is the confusion for players taking part in mini-soccer in midweek and 11-a-side on Sundays. 'I would have thought it useful for them to get the benefits of small-sided games and take them into bigger games,' responds Kelly Simmons. She had not heard of the criticism of the size of the goals, she said. No matter what both bodies say, the FA and the ESFA, the professionals and the amateurs, are in conflict over player development. The FA clearly have trouble in reconciling 'sport for all' with developing the elite. The ESFA's ethos has always been that 'we provide football for boys (make that girls as well, these days), not boys for football'. They worry that mini-soccer just enables noisy, misguided parents to get closer to the action. Neither are they convinced that mini-soccer for over-10s is beneficial. 'We played a mini-soccer tournament which included a team from Feyenoord and the Dutch said they don't play it very often,' the ESFA's director of coaching John Morton told me. 'They believed that at 11, players should have learned enough to play 11-a-side.' 'We believe in and encourage good skills and teamwork,' wrote our schools secretary to Kate Hoey and Geoff Thompson. 'We are offended when we hear it is not being done properly. We are glad the government are making funds available and working with the clubs. The love of the game and the basics are taught by primary schools. I can just see Manchester United spending hours lacing up boots and teaching basic passing. 'It does not matter what new things are brought in if associations are treated the way we have been. Nothing will work.' A couple of weeks ago I stood on a touchline watching my son play and got chatting to a West Ham youth coach who happened to be an interested spectator. 'All the problems of the game are at this level,' he told me. That was when I could hear him between the angry shouts directed at his 10-year-olds by a team manager, who was also swearing within earshot. The FA have made a start and perhaps all these are just teething troubles. The concept of mini-soccer is surely worth pursuing. But for whom and how long? And it is not just about money. The system needs revising, and a programme of education for parents and coaches implemented, if young players are not to grow up in such a chaotic atmosphere - the development of the best hampered and the enjoyment of the rest impaired. That revision should not happen in an office at Lancaster Gate. It should be examined anew from touchlines around the country.",

Perhaps, he said, he would buy one just like it. In seven years at Ajax he had never previously considered moving into Amsterdam, living instead in the unlovely commuter town of Diemen, because all he thought about was football. </p> <p>The apartment that evening was stuffed with Holland's most august football trivia experts. Some of them, at an Amsterdam dinner years before, had shamed Nick Hornby with their grasp of Arsenal history. But in this toughest of contests, the greatest Finnish footballer ever held his own. </p> <p>He would have done even better had he been a less generous man. For when the question designed for him came up 'Who is Finland's most-capped international?' it turned out that the other footballer present, the then Ajax captain Danny Blind, knew the answer too. (Ari Hjelm with 100 caps, as any fule kno.) Litmanen turned to Blind in amazement. 'But,' he stammered, 'it's months since I told you that.' </p> <p>That level of obsession is probably required if you want to become a great Finnish footballer. There are no one-man teams in international football, but as England may discover on Wednesday, Finland are probably the closest thing to it. Christoph Daum, the German coach-elect who watched them beat Albania 2-1 in their first World Cup qualifier last month, wrote afterwards: 'Jari Litmanen is the heart and soul of the team.' </p> <p>To some degree this was predestined 29 years ago, when Litmanen was born the son of two footballers. His mother, Liisa, was a gifted libero, while his father Olavi played for Reipas Lahti, the club founded by Finns expelled from Karelia by the Russians in World War Two. Litmanen's Karelian heritage has made him a Finnish patriot, who always sings the national anthem. 'With gooseflesh,' he adds. </p> <p>As a child he kicked a ball around in the vast family back garden, where he imagined, in the place of the usual snow, the grass of his beloved Anfield. In a school essay he wrote that he would be a team footballer, not an individualist. That he nonetheless acquired the nickname of 'Diego' seems to have been a tribute to his dark hair. </p> <p>He planned his career with the care normally associated with young politicians. In his late teens he set off on a veritable European tour to find the club where he would learn most. Leeds United, managed by Howard Wilkinson, rejected him, as did Bobby Robson's PSV Eindhoven, while Litmanen had never expected to win a contract at Barcelona. However, the club's manager, Johan Cruyff, recommended him to Ajax, and in 1992 Litmanen landed in Amsterdam. </p> <p>Ajax then already possessed a decent No 10 - Dennis Bergkamp. It was as a substitute for him that the Finn made his club debut on August 23, 1992, in the 87th minute of a 3-1 victory over Go Ahead Eagles. For most of that season, however, he sat on the bench studying Bergkamp like a stalker. </p> <p>A year later he replaced him, and by 1995 Litmanen was probably the world's best attacking midfielder. There is an anonymity to his brilliance: Litmanen seldom dribbles or flies in with a tackle or fires home from 30 yards. Typically, he sends a precise ball out to the wing, and then surges stiffly into the box to finish off. Passing and scoring, passing and scoring. He says: 'Zidane is fantastic on the ball, he also defends well, but he scores too seldom. Ver\u00f3n passes with feeling, is an outstanding playmaker, scores too seldom.' </p> <p>Litmanen scored 24 goals in 44 European matches with Ajax, a club record. Of all the players they lost in the Nineties - Davids, Bergkamp, Kluivert, Kanu, the De Boers - the crowd misses the Finn most. Occasionally the Amsterdam Arena still resounds to his special song: 'Oh oh Litmanen, oh oh oh oh.' </p> <p>Last year virtually every self-respecting club in Europe courted him. He chose Barcelona partly because they have a large squad. When it comes to injuries, Litmanen is the Finnish Bryan Robson ('he has the legs of a 35-year-old,' says a friend), and he did not want to join a club like Liverpool where he would have been under pressure to play weekly. But his choice of Barcelona worked rather too well. These days he rarely even makes the subs' bench. Barca now want to sell him - there are many bidders - but Litmanen feels mistreated and insists on staying while pocketing his weekly net salary of \u00a340,000. </p> <p>This may make the above paean to his brilliance sound hyperbolic. However, Litmanen's main problem at Barca is probably that he is a Finn. Being a great Finnish footballer is like being a great Czech car: you never get the respect you deserve. Had Litmanen not been Finnish he would surely have been voted European Footballer of the Year in 1995, when Ajax won the Champions League and World Club Cup. Instead George Weah won and the Finn came third. </p> <p>Notionally, Wednesday's game is a World Cup qualifier. In fact, the closest Litmanen will ever get to a World Cup is his hard-drinking tour of France 98 with a bunch of old ice-hockey friends. Bound for undeserved oblivion, poor old Litmanen will soon be just a quiz question himself.</p>",

When it comes to injuries, Litmanen is the Finnish Bryan Robson ('he has the legs of a 35-year-old,' says a friend), and he did not want to join a club like Liverpool where he would have been under pressure to play weekly. But his choice of Barcelona worked rather too well. These days he rarely even makes the subs' bench. Barca now want to sell him - there are many bidders - but Litmanen feels mistreated and insists on staying while pocketing his weekly net salary of \u00a340,000. This may make the above paean to his brilliance sound hyperbolic. However, Litmanen's main problem at Barca is probably that he is a Finn. Being a great Finnish footballer is like being a great Czech car: you never get the respect you deserve. Had Litmanen not been Finnish he would surely have been voted European Footballer of the Year in 1995, when Ajax won the Champions League and World Club Cup. Instead George Weah won and the Finn came third. Notionally, Wednesday's game is a World Cup qualifier. In fact, the closest Litmanen will ever get to a World Cup is his hard-drinking tour of France 98 with a bunch of old ice-hockey friends. Bound for undeserved oblivion, poor old Litmanen will soon be just a quiz question himself.",

      "byline": "Jay Rayner",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Until last week Antony Worrall Thompson was solely a man of food. He had nifty ways with Raspberry Fool. He could show you how to knock up a Shepherd's Pie. He believed in shop-bought custard and stock cubes. Then, last Tuesday, he turned up on the platform at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth giving William Hague the backing of his substantial celebrity - along with Jim Davidson, Mike Yarwood and Dana. Instantly, Antony Worrall Thompson became a man of politics. </p> <p>Now, as a man of politics, he must have policies. Here he is, then, on fox hunting: 'I think it's awful the way foxes are finally killed but the hunt is still the only way to get the animals out of the ground. So, once they've got them out of the ground, then they should shoot the poor things.'As definitions of caring Conservatism go, they don't get much better than that: keep fox hunting. Just make sure the fox is killed nicely. </p> <p>So how do you get the fox away from the baying hounds? He looks pensive for a moment. 'It's a difficult one, isn't it,' he says. 'You're never going to please everyone, are you?' We are sitting in the carefully tended back garden of his five-acre estate in Oxfordshire, an inherited property made beautiful on the proceeds of his various successful restaurant businesses. Around us a BBC crew are setting up the next shot for the Food and Drink show of which, for the past two series, Worrall Thompson, 49, has been main presenter and which is now recorded here at his home, hard by the Thames. He lights a cigarette - one of many - and points away towards the fields out front of the house where his three dozen chickens are penned. 'Personally I catch the foxes over there and then release them in woods 20 miles away.' But it wouldn't work if everybody did that would it, because people would come and release their foxes by your fields? He agrees. That wouldn't work either. Tricky business, this politics. No matter. He's still keen to be involved. 'I would like to be a politician some day,' he announces. What? An MP? Really? He nods. There has only just been a selection process for a new MP in his local constituency of Henley, currently occupied by Michael Heseltine who is stepping down. The local Conservative Party chose Boris Johnson, editor of the Spectator , to succeed him. 'In five years time I might have gone for it,' Worrall Thompson says, 'But Heseltine resigned too early for me. I'm not ready just yet.' </p> <p>The prospect of Antony Worrall Thompson MP seems at first absurd. He has a cosy, soft, even huggsy persona which is reflected perfectly in the kind of modern comfort food he now cooks on screen; the fishcakes and stews and roasts. He does not seem at all suited to the flinty cut and thrust of political life. Then again perhaps the world of television chefdom has provided him with the ideal training. Last month, during a interview, Delia Smith laid into Worrall Thompson. She called him 'dreadful, just repulsive' and described Food and Drink as 'the most disgusting thing on television'. He hit back, calling her 'the coldest woman on television'. </p> <p>'I also called her the Volvo of cooking which I meant as a term of endearment.' He shrugs. 'I just meant she was safe but obviously she thought I meant she was boring. But she does make lousy scrambled eggs. They're horrible and runny.' </p> <p>And what about Gordon Ramsay, who came to Delia's defence, announcing that he always gives her books to his wife as Christmas presents? 'Ramsay and I have always had a spat,' Worrall Thompson says. 'The sort of food he cooks is outmoded, outdated and not what people want any more. It's destined to sit next to the dinosaurs in the Natural History Museum.' The honourable member for Henley smiles. He may want the fox dispatched humanely but he's clearly more than happy to see Mr Gordon Ramsay ripped limb from metaphorical limb. </p> <p>For all his political ambitions the TV chef is undoubtedly happiest talking about food. Last week Tim Yeo, Shadow Agriculture Minister, announced that he would appoint him as an adviser on organic food if the Conservatives win the next election. Worrall Thompson is definitely up for the job. 'I want to get the message across that food is an important part of people's lives,' he says. 'Nobody's working out what's wrong with our food production. I mean, why in the age of more sprays and pesticides are we suffering from more allergies? Our immune systems are shot to hell and organic food can change that.' </p> <p>He practises what he preaches: as well as the chickens, he keeps pigs, two Middle Whites called Lunch and Dinner, from which he hopes to breed. He uses their manure to fertilise a large organic vegetable garden which supplies both of his London restaurants and a nearby pub that he has recently taken over. At weekends he and his wife Jay run a stall in a farmer's market at Henley selling organic chutneys and eggs. He is, in short, a big believer in the organic food movement. Unfortunately it turns out that he's not such a big believer in the Conservatives' policy on food. 'Tim Yeo said we should push ahead with GM testing in this country. Well, I'm against that. This country is too small. If we get it wrong then we've ruined nature for life and you can't go back.' </p> <p>So why give his support to the Tory party if he doesn't agree with them? 'I want to change them. I believe they can be changed.' OK, then, he doesn't see eye to eye with them on food policy. And, I suggest, while we're at it, he can't really agree with their stance on single mothers, can he? After all, now into his third marriage, he's created a few of those himself. He has two teenage sons living in Australia by one former wife, whom he supports, and another child by a previous relationship whom he does not see. (He now has two more children by Jay, Toby-Jack, five and Billie-Lara, three.) 'No,' he says, 'I don't agree with that. But then I'm not going to agree with any government on every policy, am I?' </p> <p>What about Ann Widdecombe's stance on cannabis? Have you, Mr Worrall Thompson, ever been stoned? 'No.' What, you've never smoked dope? 'Oh yeah, I've smoked dope. It just made my legs go to sleep. All right, no, I didn't agree with Widdecombe on that. Yes, we must get tough on law and order. We all want that but the police haven't got time to go chasing after every cannabis user.' </p> <p>We move on. Asylum seekers? 'The majority of the people in this country don't want us to be a dumping ground for every foreign national,' he says. 'Yes, they want the deserving ones to get in but not every chancer.' Ah, progress. That sounds like the voice of Toryism. 'But I don't agree with the idea of penning them all up in compounds.' Oh dear. And we were so close to what political pundits call consensus. </p> <p>On taxation Worrall Thompson has a whole raft of policies. He would like to see VAT raised to 21 per cent and direct taxation lowered. But at the same time he thinks that a 50 per cent tax rate on high earnings of \u00a3150,000-\u00a3200,000 might not be the worst idea in the world. These are both interesting policies in themselves, innovative policies perhaps. They just don't happen to be Conservative Party policies at the moment. Finally we find something he does agree with the Tories on: the retention of Clause 28. 'I'm an open-minded person but most of the country do not want homosexual education stuffed down their kids' throats.' He thinks William Hague is 'a great orator - he knocks spots off Blair. But I do sometimes wonder if Hague is the right leader. He does have to create an image outside the chamber. He's a brilliant politician but maybe he's not number one.' </p> <p>Still, for the moment, Hague's the man. 'More Tories have to come out of the closet,' he says. 'I reckon there are a lot out there but I think they're frightened to admit it. You've got to be brave to be in the Tory party right now.' Perhaps you have to be particularly brave if you are in the restaurant business. It is driven almost entirely by fashion and Worrall Thompson knows that. He made his name in the Eighties with a restaurant called M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois, which served only starters and puddings and caught the mood of diners who wanted to go to restaurants to see and be seen rather than to eat. (It was a favourite of Princess Diana.) In the late Eighties he moved on to restaurants like dell'Ugo, serving up an early form of fusion cooking. Now, with his London restaurant Woz, which does one set menu a day, served family style in the middle of the table, he has simplified everything just when it was becoming hip to do so. </p> <p>Is he concerned that some punters might not want to eat in his restaurants because of his unfashionable politics? He drags deeply on another unfashionable cigarette. 'I'll lose the 10 per cent who are radical, maybe, but that's not much is it?' </p> <p>Anyway, he says, he has never pursued trends. 'I'm the one who sets the fashions that others follow.' Perhaps he's right. If so, expect the Conservatives to come up with new policies on GM foods, fox hunting, asylum seekers, single mothers, taxation and drugs any day soon.</p>",

'Personally I catch the foxes over there and then release them in woods 20 miles away.' But it wouldn't work if everybody did that would it, because people would come and release their foxes by your fields? He agrees. That wouldn't work either. Tricky business, this politics. No matter. He's still keen to be involved. 'I would like to be a politician some day,' he announces. What? An MP? Really? He nods. There has only just been a selection process for a new MP in his local constituency of Henley, currently occupied by Michael Heseltine who is stepping down. The local Conservative Party chose Boris Johnson, editor of the Spectator , to succeed him. 'In five years time I might have gone for it,' Worrall Thompson says, 'But Heseltine resigned too early for me. I'm not ready just yet.' The prospect of Antony Worrall Thompson MP seems at first absurd. He has a cosy, soft, even huggsy persona which is reflected perfectly in the kind of modern comfort food he now cooks on screen; the fishcakes and stews and roasts. He does not seem at all suited to the flinty cut and thrust of political life. Then again perhaps the world of television chefdom has provided him with the ideal training. Last month, during a interview, Delia Smith laid into Worrall Thompson. She called him 'dreadful, just repulsive' and described Food and Drink as 'the most disgusting thing on television'. He hit back, calling her 'the coldest woman on television'. 'I also called her the Volvo of cooking which I meant as a term of endearment.' He shrugs. 'I just meant she was safe but obviously she thought I meant she was boring. But she does make lousy scrambled eggs. They're horrible and runny.' And what about Gordon Ramsay, who came to Delia's defence, announcing that he always gives her books to his wife as Christmas presents? 'Ramsay and I have always had a spat,' Worrall Thompson says. 'The sort of food he cooks is outmoded, outdated and not what people want any more. It's destined to sit next to the dinosaurs in the Natural History Museum.' The honourable member for Henley smiles. He may want the fox dispatched humanely but he's clearly more than happy to see Mr Gordon Ramsay ripped limb from metaphorical limb. For all his political ambitions the TV chef is undoubtedly happiest talking about food. Last week Tim Yeo, Shadow Agriculture Minister, announced that he would appoint him as an adviser on organic food if the Conservatives win the next election. Worrall Thompson is definitely up for the job. 'I want to get the message across that food is an important part of people's lives,' he says. 'Nobody's working out what's wrong with our food production. I mean, why in the age of more sprays and pesticides are we suffering from more allergies? Our immune systems are shot to hell and organic food can change that.' He practises what he preaches: as well as the chickens, he keeps pigs, two Middle Whites called Lunch and Dinner, from which he hopes to breed. He uses their manure to fertilise a large organic vegetable garden which supplies both of his London restaurants and a nearby pub that he has recently taken over. At weekends he and his wife Jay run a stall in a farmer's market at Henley selling organic chutneys and eggs. He is, in short, a big believer in the organic food movement. Unfortunately it turns out that he's not such a big believer in the Conservatives' policy on food. 'Tim Yeo said we should push ahead with GM testing in this country. Well, I'm against that. This country is too small. If we get it wrong then we've ruined nature for life and you can't go back.' So why give his support to the Tory party if he doesn't agree with them? 'I want to change them. I believe they can be changed.' OK, then, he doesn't see eye to eye with them on food policy. And, I suggest, while we're at it, he can't really agree with their stance on single mothers, can he? After all, now into his third marriage, he's created a few of those himself. He has two teenage sons living in Australia by one former wife, whom he supports, and another child by a previous relationship whom he does not see. (He now has two more children by Jay, Toby-Jack, five and Billie-Lara, three.) 'No,' he says, 'I don't agree with that. But then I'm not going to agree with any government on every policy, am I?' What about Ann Widdecombe's stance on cannabis? Have you, Mr Worrall Thompson, ever been stoned? 'No.' What, you've never smoked dope? 'Oh yeah, I've smoked dope. It just made my legs go to sleep. All right, no, I didn't agree with Widdecombe on that. Yes, we must get tough on law and order. We all want that but the police haven't got time to go chasing after every cannabis user.' We move on. Asylum seekers? 'The majority of the people in this country don't want us to be a dumping ground for every foreign national,' he says. 'Yes, they want the deserving ones to get in but not every chancer.' Ah, progress. That sounds like the voice of Toryism. 'But I don't agree with the idea of penning them all up in compounds.' Oh dear. And we were so close to what political pundits call consensus. On taxation Worrall Thompson has a whole raft of policies. He would like to see VAT raised to 21 per cent and direct taxation lowered. But at the same time he thinks that a 50 per cent tax rate on high earnings of \u00a3150,000-\u00a3200,000 might not be the worst idea in the world. These are both interesting policies in themselves, innovative policies perhaps. They just don't happen to be Conservative Party policies at the moment. Finally we find something he does agree with the Tories on: the retention of Clause 28. 'I'm an open-minded person but most of the country do not want homosexual education stuffed down their kids' throats.' He thinks William Hague is 'a great orator - he knocks spots off Blair. But I do sometimes wonder if Hague is the right leader. He does have to create an image outside the chamber. He's a brilliant politician but maybe he's not number one.' Still, for the moment, Hague's the man. 'More Tories have to come out of the closet,' he says. 'I reckon there are a lot out there but I think they're frightened to admit it. You've got to be brave to be in the Tory party right now.' Perhaps you have to be particularly brave if you are in the restaurant business. It is driven almost entirely by fashion and Worrall Thompson knows that. He made his name in the Eighties with a restaurant called M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois, which served only starters and puddings and caught the mood of diners who wanted to go to restaurants to see and be seen rather than to eat. (It was a favourite of Princess Diana.) In the late Eighties he moved on to restaurants like dell'Ugo, serving up an early form of fusion cooking. Now, with his London restaurant Woz, which does one set menu a day, served family style in the middle of the table, he has simplified everything just when it was becoming hip to do so. Is he concerned that some punters might not want to eat in his restaurants because of his unfashionable politics? He drags deeply on another unfashionable cigarette. 'I'll lose the 10 per cent who are radical, maybe, but that's not much is it?' Anyway, he says, he has never pursued trends. 'I'm the one who sets the fashions that others follow.' Perhaps he's right. If so, expect the Conservatives to come up with new policies on GM foods, fox hunting, asylum seekers, single mothers, taxation and drugs any day soon.",

      "body": "<p>It is a mistake to think of a path as a gap between the things that it leads to, a kind of horticultural no-man's-land. As much as anything else in the garden, it is where the action is. Analyse the paths of a garden and you learn much about the gardener. Are they straight and grid-like, or curving and meandering? Is the planting geared around the paths with flanking avenues, markers at the intersections of other paths and careful gradations of plants working down to the path's edges, or does the path become sublimated into the planting, as it often does in a vegetable patch or in wilder, softer planting schemes? </p> <p>Nothing connects a garden so clearly to the building it belongs to than the paths leading from the house. If they line up with the doors and windows, they immediately impose a symmetry and proportion dictated by the house. I think this is often highly desirable, but it can just as easily be used in reverse to free the garden from the potential restrictions of the house.</p> <p>The first law of any garden path is to get you from A to B. If it is the main route to the compost heap, herb bed or greenhouse, then it wants to be as direct as possible. </p> <p>It is an absolute rule that people will eventually work out the quickest route and use it, even if that means ignoring a beautifully made, dry path to slice diagonally across a muddy lawn or step through a flowerbed. If you don't want this, you must block off the alternatives with impenetrable planting or a more solid barrier. And it is not just humans that this applies to; our dogs, rather weirdly, leave the straight path down to the front door and do a little curving diversion on to the grass, making a worn, doggy groove in winter.</p> <p>It is always a mistake to have a path like a runway taking you down to a point that is visible throughout the whole journey. They must lead to places you cannot see without going to the very end. People who are more interested in plants than gardens tend to assume that one's eyes will be cast down to look at the plants, treating a path rather like a gangway at a flower show. This is nonsense. If you can see everything without progressing from the beginning, then the incentive to move down the path is greatly reduced - however rare the plants along the way. Either the path must curve you round and away from the goal so that you are drawn back to it or else you must take the path through at least one entrance. This might just be a gap in the hedge - the hedge might be there solely to provide the said gap - but some kind of screen there must be.</p> <p>It is not enough just to have paths looking good. They must work, if they are to be used. This is not always easy to get right. When we first moved in eight years ago, I believed that we could simply cut beds from the grass of the field, mow the bits in between and call them paths. It is not a bad policy, if you have limited funds, and half our paths are still just mown field and need only a pass with a mower once a week to keep them that way. I especially like the paths made by cutting the orchard grass at different lengths, with the mown, gently curving strip fringed by the tall meadow grasses. Dead simple, but dead lovely.</p> <p>But grass is useless in the rainy season, which, with the unstoppable roll of global warming, lasts for at least eight months of the year. And even in summer, every time you set foot on the path, let alone wheel a heavy barrow on it, you are compacting the soil down, worsening the drainage and increasing the subsequent winter quagmire.</p> <p>OK, I speak from jaundiced experience, living in one of the wettest places in England with heavy soil to boot, but even the fastest draining ground loses some of its allure after a week's rain in November. Certainly in my own garden, the lovely springy grass paths of summer are just a photo in the book. Feet can't remember them. Going outside to get a sprig of rosemary means taking off your shoes and putting on wellingtons. Only frost brings sufficient hard dryness to walk unprotected.</p> <p>So, over the years, as money and time have allowed, we have been converting our paths from grass to hard surfaces. The luxury of walking dry-shod is worth the work and expense. It also opens up a whole range of colours, textures and structure to the garden. A grass path can somehow hardly be called structural, whereas a brick path is a wall on edge. One of the features of all grand gardens is that they have yards and yards of stone or brick paths. Grand gardens tend to belong to wealthy people, who discovered long ago that if a path is to be any use for most of the year, it must be made of almost anything except grass.</p> <p>So, I have been pouring my enormous wealth into paths. Brick paths, stone paths, gravel paths and cobbled paths. My fortune is invested in paths. The first paths we made were from stone and cobbles. They were intended to be all stone but, after the first few yards, it became apparent that what seemed like a huge pile bought as a random job lot at a knock-down price was not going to do anything like the required stretch. So, we started mixing in cobbles to fill the gaps and make the stone go further. It worked very well, despite the fact that cobbles do not make good paths. They are too knobbly and slippery to walk on with ease. But if you have sufficient stone, they're fine. Cobbles are reasonably cheap to buy and we have dug up loads and used them to edge paths and as a surface barrier in areas where we don't want people to walk.</p> <p>Then we progressed to brick. Sarah had given me the bricks for a path for my 40th birthday. She hunted for ages until she found second-hand bricks from the same brickyard (small, local, closed down in 1884) as those at the back of the house from where the path leads. Choosing bricks that relate to those of the house or any existing walls is the most important aspect of any brick path. It is laid basket-weave fashion and I love it, although the shadiest bit gets incredibly slippery.</p> <p>We then made what I think is our best path. It is very narrow, curves through the spring garden and is made entirely from all the leftover bits and pieces of the first phase of building work. The only consistent materials are concrete blocks laid sideways a block's length apart. The gap between them is infilled with anything that could be used, including quarry tiles, cobbles, bricks and paving stones. The only brief was that no two sections should be alike. In the vegetable garden, we now have brick pavers. These are like bricks, but baked much harder so that they take more wear and tear and, crucially, will not break up when they freeze. The down side is that they are brittle and prone to cracking when you lay them, and they look very new. I don't mind the latter, but we had to look through scores of variations before finding a paver that worked with the existing brick paths.</p> <p>Pavers are not cheap, so we then used them as narrow 'paths-within-a-path' down the centre of some of the grass paths. This is both handsome and practical, as you can mow over them and yet walk and wheel a barrow down the centre in the slushiest of weather. The plan is to continue this throughout the garden. The problem is not just the expense of the pavers but that beneath them is what amounts to a trench 12 to 18in deep, half of which is filled with hardcore, then a generous layer of scalpings tamped down very hard, then a thick layer of sand on which the pavers are laid. If you have very well-drained soil, you won't need such elaborate measures to ensure drainage, but for us it is essential.</p> <p>Our final paths, in the Jewel garden, are topped with a material called Redgra. This is a kind of pink sand with an element of clay that binds it solid when laid. You prepare the path with hardcore and a layer of scalpings, then spread a thin layer of this binding surface which you bang in with a whacker plate. It goes on almost as sand, but after 24 hours it is pretty solid. It is much cheaper and easier to lay than paving or brick, but if it doesn't have really sharp drainage it can get almost muddy in very wet weather and has less integral character.</p> <p>In the end, a path has to work. Feet and wheels must find them easy the year round. But what materials you use will influence the way your garden looks as much as the surrounding planting, so choose well.</p> <p><strong>My roots</strong></p> <p>I finally got round to cutting the box balls last week. Not balls - pebbles. Even I balk at the pretension of this, so will wait a while until their pebbleness manifests itself more obviously than as mere lopsided balls. But they are in an active state of becoming pebbles, and I must admit that this gives me a huge amount of excited pleasure. </p> <p>Once a year, when I cut them, I know for sure that I am doing the right thing. I have put off the job for months - I would normally expect to do it in June - because of the palaver of clearing the clippings up. Not because I am too grand to do that part of the chore, but because the 63 box pebbles are set in cobbles. Geddit? Big, green, living cobbles set in small stone ones. Everything all of a piece. </p> <p>However, the thousands of knobbles of stone make sweeping a nightmare, with box-leaf confetti wedged in the cobbled interstices. So I put off cutting it until I could get hold of a garden vacuum cleaner. I had one years ago and it was useless for me then, in a brand new garden made up of a bare field, dreams and 18in hedges, so I gave it to my father-in-law. But, over the years, I have secretly hankered after a garden vacuum cleaner again and, the other day, I finally got round to hiring one for these box blobs. It worked a treat. Fantastic. </p> <p>The only fly in the ointment was that the electric hedge trimmer decided to stop working while I went for a cup of tea. It worked beautifully until I stopped it and put it down, and then it refused to cut a thing. I fiddled with it for an hour, made it worse, and did the rest with shears. </p> <p>Before I started, I took cuttings from the most vigorous of the box ovoids, lining them out directly into the seed bed in the vegetable garden. I'll keep them cloched over winter and they should form the stock for my plan to line all the vegetable beds with box hedges. I like the idea of these vigorous spheroids spawning sharp-edged boxes of box-edged vegetables.</p> <p>We have had a week of wind and heavy rain, which has bashed the poor garden. Two tepees of Burro d'ingenoli climbing beans blew down in the night, snapping six stout hazel rods in the process. This is not so much due to the force of the wind but the incredible top growth of the beans. </p> <p>I have never seen any like it. They are delicious, too, with a buttery, slippy texture, cooked whole regardless of size. I shall definitely grow more next year.</p>",

Despite the popularity of the new British film Billy Elliot - with its uplifting story of a boy who discovers he can express himself through dance - most British secondary school children see no point in learning how to paint or play a musical instrument, let alone learn ballet. A philistine picture of British education has emerged through the research which has been compiled from case studies, interviews and questionnaires involving thousands of GCSE pupils nationwide. While sport is still accepted as a natural school activity, the research conducted by the National Foundation for Educational Research for the Royal Society of Arts reveals that the teaching of the performance arts in particular has been pushed to the margins of the school timetable and beyond.

      "body": "<p>Last week, British mainstream TV news and current affairs journalism took another step to its grave. It wasn't presented that way, of course. But if you think that it matters that our broadcasters take the dissemination of information about public affairs seriously and hold private and public power to account - surely a central component of any definition of public service broadcasting in a democracy - then last week was important. It was another milestone towards the disintegration of that conception. </p> <p>This vision has been disappearing from the screens and schedules of independent television for more than a decade. The march of the quest for maximising shareholder value has hit ITV hard, exacerbated by weak regulation and a lack of any consensus about to what degree public service obligations should extend to the private sector - and what 'public service' might be in any case. What has mattered is market share and immediate programme popularity. If there has been secular decline in interest in news and current affairs programmes, the reaction has not been to invest in them or back them with editorial bravery; instead, there has been retreat and weakening commitment, so creating a vicious circle in which their marginalisation has been guaranteed. </p> <p>The most spectacular examples were the abolition of World in Action and the move of News at Ten to 11pm, a move initiated solely by a concern to put profit before public interest. Yet the rule of finance directors anxious to cut costs and chief executives anxious to have a high enough share price to emerge as the winner predator in the inevitable deals that would restructure ITV around one contractor - why inevitable? - has meant that they could not even successfully exploit the opportunity they created. A key ITV brand - News at Ten - has been sullied and no powerful programmes have been developed to fill the gap. But expect no less when those at the top are propelled by the vision of the next deal rather than an idea of what television might be and become. </p> <p>This is the world against which the BBC is competing. In its own terms, the announcement last week that it would move its 9pm news to 10pm in a fortnight's time while shifting Panorama to after 10pm on Sundays was a short-term coup. Now, it has the maximum room to build BBC1 as a popular, generic entertainment channel, taking on ITV1 head to head, because the mid-evening obstacle of the news has gone. </p> <p>But because its six-days-a-week 10pm news is to compete with a return of ITV's News at Ten for only three days a week after a recent ruling by the new regulator (and which precipitated the BBC's announcement), BBC news is guaranteed to emerge as the senior partner. Public service obligations and a BBC1 that can look more like ITV1 are thus both secured at a stroke. Small wonder there was unanimity at the BBC at the cleverness of its move, with the chairman of the governors - Sir Christopher Bland - cockily insisting that what it had done was beyond the provenance of mere politicians. </p> <p>But the politicians, along with anybody else concerned about the future of television news and current affairs, are right to be concerned. It may be true that while Panorama will be watched by more social class ABs in its new slot, its potential mass audience will be very much smaller. The chance of it being brought back to a mainstream place in the schedules if the move fails, as one senior BBC executive claimed to me, is nil, for it then will be draped in the mantle of being a failing programme. We should be under no illusions. This marks the BBC following the ITV companies into ending its commitment to mass audience current affairs journalism. </p> <p>The upper echelons of TV management no longer believe in current affairs TV. Prickly, obsessive journalists hazard writs and unpleasantness and their programmes are expensive to support. In any case, audiences are interested in the personal, the private world of relationships, Big Brother , gardening and cooking - not exploring the public realm. But TV current affairs only has any chance of working if it holds the powerful to account and that implies taking risks. Once you enter the world of risk aversion because you have doubts, you undermine the entire esprit on which current affairs depends, thus warranting its marginalisation. Begun by Birt and now sealed by Dyke, this is where the BBC has arrived. </p> <p>This is not an argument against The Naked Chef or Big Brother; rather, it is for an idea of journalism that must have its place on mainstream television alongside them, even if must adapt how it presents itself to have the same appeal. But it should be there. Let it go and soon news, with which it is umbilically linked, will be in the same position - fighting to earn its place in the schedules rather than having it by right. </p> <p>This is what has happened in the US. The three terrestrial networks are all in the hands of larger groups obsessed by their share price, and news has been locked in a self-reinforcing pattern of decline. Its audiences are older and less attractive to advertisers; so it loses its prime slots; so its audiences get smaller; so it deserves even less support. In the five years between 1993 and 1998, regular audiences for network nightly news have plunged by more than half. And the argument that Americans now get their news from the net and CNN does not hold water; as the net has exploded, visits to news sites have declined, while it is CNN viewers who disproportionately watch the network news. Put bluntly, market forces have made news a ghetto, with knock-on consequences for American democracy that scarcely need detailing. </p> <p>The same process is now threatened here. The ITV companies will soon be arguing that falling audiences do not justify two half-hour bulletins at 10, hoping to leave the BBC holding the news baby as they follow the lead offered by the American networks - pleading the same commercial imperatives and putting intense pressure on a regulator with weak powers to bend to their will. The TV ecology changes again, so justifying further retreat at the BBC. </p> <p>To break this, especially in the coming world of digital, more generic channels, requires a clear-sighted view of what constitutes public service broadcasting - and that can no longer be left to the BBC. The custodianship of the public interest must pass to a newly empowered regulator of the entire industry and the next round of franchises must have clearly articulated specifications for news and current affairs broadcasting. </p> <p>We should require our TV companies to stay TV companies rather than be subsumed into larger media groups, and that implies tough cross-ownership rules. Above all, we have to champion a powerful TV journalistic culture that can prosper in the digital future. </p> <p>The lesson of last week is that the BBC is no longer powerful and determined enough to do this by itself, a lesson it may come to wish that it had never articulated so clearly.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It was like a wonder goal scored on the counter-attack by his beloved Manchester United. ITV chiefs, arguing among themselves over what to do about News at Ten, took their eyes off the ball. Greg Dyke and Sir Christopher Bland (the Nobby Stiles and Sir Bobby Charlton of the TV world) saw their chance. </p> <p>Dyke put in one of his trade-mark crunching tackles while the ref wasn't looking, got the ball and threaded it to Blandie with only the out-of-form goalkeeper Chris 'Butterfingers' Smith to beat. Bang - the ball is in the back of the net. Offside? Despite protests, the flag stays down. One-nil to Dyke's barmy BBC army! The crowd goes wild. </p> <p>Dyke has spent much of the nine months since becoming director-general making deep cuts in BBC overheads and building up a programming war chest. Now comes phase two, a year earlier than planned. Dyke has started to spend the extra cash on a schedule so aggressive that it produces a double bang for every buck. Suddenly the hopeless old BBC, the whipping boy of British TV for two decades, is ahead of game. </p> <p>His dabbling with the magic 10pm slot for the nation's 20 million viewers goes back to the early Nineties when, as chairman of the ITV companies' association, he first tried to remove News at Ten from the schedule. The show bunged up the entire evening. The regulators' 'family viewing' watershed meant, as it still does, that most hit movies - and much modern, sex-laden infotainment - could not start until 9pm, which meant interrupting a film halfway through to show the news. </p> <p>In the newly competitive world of British television deliberately brought into being by the 1990 Broadcasting Act, most senior ITV people thought that it absurd that the country's main mixed entertainment channel could not show movies on weeknights because of regulation. Dyke led the lobbying for News at Ten to be axed. </p> <p>His logic seemed unanswerable. The new cable and satellite channels, which the Government was then keen to see launched, were not bound to show news at any particular time. The new channels were making painful inroads into ITV audiences by scheduling their best (or least worst) material against News at Ten. </p> <p>But Dyke was frustrated then, and ended up being vilified and by his old foe Gerald Kaufman at the Commons National Heritage Select Committee. He was fingered as the ultimate ITV fat cat who was putting ratings, profits and personal gain before programme quality and the health of democracy. </p> <p>Dyke had been prepared to tough it out, and was aghast when the new commercial owners of key ITV companies, such as Carlton and Granada, caved in to the politicians. He claimed that Granada's Gerry Robinson and Carlton's Michael Green had at first supported the move but blocked it when they realised that, in return, the Government might at last allow the series of profitable ITV mergers they were planning to go ahead. </p> <p>Those mergers ended Dyke's career in ITV. And to rub salt into Dyke's wounds, Robinson and Green dumped News at Ten soon after the mergers started to take place. </p> <p>Against this background it would churlish to deny the director-general a moment of personal pleasure in putting one over on ITV last week. The move will leave ITV, Channel 5 and, to a lesser extent, Sky on the back foot in the ratings war. </p> <p>Channel 5, as Dyke, its former chief, knows, has built its modest ratings but huge financial success by playing a movie at 9pm nightly. This cleverly exploitsthe BBC's Nine O'Clock News, using it as a sort of free 'advert' - reminding millions that it is show time further along the dial the minute the Nine's upmarket graphics - Belgrade, Jerusalem, Timbuktu and weird minimalist music - come on the screen. </p> <p>Channel Five was annoyed by Dyke's coup, complaining like the heads of ITV and Sky that competition for viewers which threatened their profits was not what they bought their licences for. </p> <p>As ever, the licence is what the argument is all about. The BBC's critics, led by the Times - itself financially dependent on Rupert Murdoch's media empire, including direct BBC rivals such as Sky - say the fee should be spent on expensive programmes which draw relatively few viewers. </p> <p>The paper which, on other occasions, has campaigned for the abolition of the fee and opposed its increase, defines the BBC's 'public service' role as a non-commercial safety net where material such as saturation coverage of the Queen Mother's birthday ought to be shown, leaving the commercial broadcasters to rake in huge profits from Who Wants to be a Millionaire and Premier League football without effective competition from Auntie. But Dyke defines public service differently, more in line with what the BBC's charter actually says and the way in which it is thus established by law. This 'public service' simply means providing the public with the best possible service in return for the licence fee. </p> <p>So, returning to a football metaphor, Dyke knows audiences will only continue to pay cheerfully for their licence 'season tickets' if the BBC keeps putting the ball in the net. Anything less risks relegation from Premier League broadcasting towards semi-professional status (the fate of almost every other public sector broadcaster in the world), leaving the UK field clear for private would-be monopolists such as the emerging national ITV and BSkyB. </p> <p> Chris Horrie is co-author of 'Citizen Greg', published by Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>",

His dabbling with the magic 10pm slot for the nation's 20 million viewers goes back to the early Nineties when, as chairman of the ITV companies' association, he first tried to remove News at Ten from the schedule. The show bunged up the entire evening. The regulators' 'family viewing' watershed meant, as it still does, that most hit movies - and much modern, sex-laden infotainment - could not start until 9pm, which meant interrupting a film halfway through to show the news. In the newly competitive world of British television deliberately brought into being by the 1990 Broadcasting Act, most senior ITV people thought that it absurd that the country's main mixed entertainment channel could not show movies on weeknights because of regulation. Dyke led the lobbying for News at Ten to be axed. His logic seemed unanswerable. The new cable and satellite channels, which the Government was then keen to see launched, were not bound to show news at any particular time. The new channels were making painful inroads into ITV audiences by scheduling their best (or least worst) material against News at Ten. But Dyke was frustrated then, and ended up being vilified and by his old foe Gerald Kaufman at the Commons National Heritage Select Committee. He was fingered as the ultimate ITV fat cat who was putting ratings, profits and personal gain before programme quality and the health of democracy. Dyke had been prepared to tough it out, and was aghast when the new commercial owners of key ITV companies, such as Carlton and Granada, caved in to the politicians. He claimed that Granada's Gerry Robinson and Carlton's Michael Green had at first supported the move but blocked it when they realised that, in return, the Government might at last allow the series of profitable ITV mergers they were planning to go ahead. Those mergers ended Dyke's career in ITV. And to rub salt into Dyke's wounds, Robinson and Green dumped News at Ten soon after the mergers started to take place. Against this background it would churlish to deny the director-general a moment of personal pleasure in putting one over on ITV last week. The move will leave ITV, Channel 5 and, to a lesser extent, Sky on the back foot in the ratings war. Channel 5, as Dyke, its former chief, knows, has built its modest ratings but huge financial success by playing a movie at 9pm nightly. This cleverly exploitsthe BBC's Nine O'Clock News, using it as a sort of free 'advert' - reminding millions that it is show time further along the dial the minute the Nine's upmarket graphics - Belgrade, Jerusalem, Timbuktu and weird minimalist music - come on the screen. Channel Five was annoyed by Dyke's coup, complaining like the heads of ITV and Sky that competition for viewers which threatened their profits was not what they bought their licences for. As ever, the licence is what the argument is all about. The BBC's critics, led by the Times - itself financially dependent on Rupert Murdoch's media empire, including direct BBC rivals such as Sky - say the fee should be spent on expensive programmes which draw relatively few viewers. The paper which, on other occasions, has campaigned for the abolition of the fee and opposed its increase, defines the BBC's 'public service' role as a non-commercial safety net where material such as saturation coverage of the Queen Mother's birthday ought to be shown, leaving the commercial broadcasters to rake in huge profits from Who Wants to be a Millionaire and Premier League football without effective competition from Auntie. But Dyke defines public service differently, more in line with what the BBC's charter actually says and the way in which it is thus established by law. This 'public service' simply means providing the public with the best possible service in return for the licence fee. So, returning to a football metaphor, Dyke knows audiences will only continue to pay cheerfully for their licence 'season tickets' if the BBC keeps putting the ball in the net. Anything less risks relegation from Premier League broadcasting towards semi-professional status (the fate of almost every other public sector broadcaster in the world), leaving the UK field clear for private would-be monopolists such as the emerging national ITV and BSkyB.

      "body": "<p>In Mel Brook's 1968 cult classic, The Producers, his main character, played by the late Zero Mostel, was looking for a Broadway vehicle to produce which would be a sure-fire flop so that he would never have to pay back his gullible investors. He settled on a musical, Springtime for Hitler , complete with high-stepping Nazi chorus lines dancing in a jolly swastika formation. Surely, believed Mostel and his side-kick, Gene Wilder, anything to do with Hitler would be a guaranteed disaster. </p> <p>Jodie Foster, who was six and had already been acting for three years when The Producers was originally released, is discovering that even a film about the woman who made 'The Film' about the Nazis provokes the sort of feelings that The Producers were hoping for. The controversy over her desire to tackle the subject of Leni Riefenstahl, who made the Triumph of the Will as an official record of the 1934 Nuremberg rally and was later charged and eventually cleared of Nazi collaboration, has surfaced once more with a fellow-Oscar winner saying that he was horrified that such a film should be made. </p> <p>Arnold Schwartzman, who won an Academy Award for his documentary, Genocide, said last week: 'A lot of people in Hollywood are horrified at this... There will be many objections. Leni Riefenstahl was probably the best propaganda tool that Hitler had and a lot of terrible things that happened were as a consequence of what she did.' </p> <p>For Foster, who will be 38 next month, the reaction to her project would have come as no surprise. 'I'm going to catch shit on that one,' she told Rachel Abramowitz, the author of the recently-published Is That A Gun In Your Pocket? , an analysis of women's experience of power in Hollywood. She has not underestimated the capacity that Riefenstahl, now 98, has to arouse enormous passions more than 60 years after she made her epic and spectacular homage to Aryan supremacy. </p> <p>Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, which starts with a shot of Hitler descending from the skies in his plane in 1934, was one of the most famously powerful pieces of propaganda ever filmed and was banned for years after the war for fear that it still had the potency to spark a Nazi revival. Her film Olympia, about the 1936 Olympic games and a hymn to physical perfection, won the Mussolini prize, then the top award at the Venice Film Festival. She covered the Nazi invasion of Poland as a photo-journalist and is alleged to have used Gypsy concentration camp victims as extras in what was to be her last film, Tiefland, which was only finally finished in 1954. </p> <p>At the end of the war Riefenstahl was jailed first by the Americans and then the French and spent four years behind bars before being eventually cleared of collaboration by a West German de-Nazification court. She became a photo-journalist in Africa, made a famous photographic study of the Nuba tribes in Sudan and came to America to receive an award at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado, where she was roundly booed by Holocaust survivors. Her memoirs, published seven years ago, claimed that she had been na\u00efve and ignorant rather than a Nazi supporter but a 1993 documentary, directed by Ray Mueller and entitled The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl, cast doubt on those claims. </p> <p>It is this strange life that attracted the attention of Foster and it is Foster's interest that has attracted the attention of those who have attacked the project of the film. </p> <p>'I think it will be the most challenging film of my life, but it's something I've wanted to do for a long time,' Foster told the Ottawa Citizen earlier this year. 'There is no other woman in the twentieth century who has been so adored and so vilified simultaneously.' </p> <p>Foster knew that it would be a controversial choice and she is not deterred by the fact that a German company is already working with Riefenstahl's co-operation on one version of the story. Foster, as well as planning to star in the Riefenstahl film, is co-producer with her production company, Egg Pictures, backing the movie. </p> <p>While some have attacked the very idea of making such a film, a fellow director said yesterday that the project was a valid one as there was no suggestion that Foster would act in any way as an apologist for her subject. </p> <p>This is not the first time that the actor-director has been faced with having to defend her work. The Los Angeles-born Disney child star was still only 14 when she played Iris, the under-age prostitute in Taxi Driver and the Martin Scorcese film was heavily criticised at the time for its bleak and nihilistic content and for its portrayal of the sexuality of a child. </p> <p>Foster later described how her mother, Brandy, had steered her to the part: 'My mother was a real fan of movies. She saw Cassavetes and was into Fassbinder. She talked to me the way she would talk to an adult. Taxi Driver is a really important movie. It's a social statement. It's a movie about alienation. Is this something you feel comfortable with?\"' </p> <p>Foster impressed the Cannes Film Festival when she attended as a young teenager and with her flawless French - she was educated at the Lyc\u00e9e Francais in Los Angles - translated for Scorcese and De Niro to the amazement of the film press. </p> <p>When she was still a child she had already played a gangster's moll in Bugsy Malone and a little murderess in The Little Girl Who Lived Down the Lane . Playing 11-year-old Audrey in Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore , she asks another child: 'Wanna get high on Ripple?' But unlike many other child stars, she was simultaneously an academic star and turned down many parts so that she could eventually take her BA in literature at Yale. </p> <p>In the meantime, she had attracted the unwelcome attention of John Hinckley Jnr, the man who tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan in 1981 and claimed he had done so to win Foster's approbation. She was subjected to a hellish experience of threats and stalking by both Hinckley and one of his imitators that has understandably made her protective of her privacy and that of her two-year-old son, Charles Foster. She has, in fact, remained adamantly closed-mouthed about who might be Charles's father, and refused to even to comment on speculation that he may have been conceived artificially. </p> <p>She made the graduation from child actor to adult actor so successfully that she won Oscars both for her part as a rape victim in The Accused in 1988 and for FBI agent Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs in 1991. She has subsequently turned down the chance to reprise the role in the sequel. There have been lesser known films such as Five Corners, Stealing Home, Candleshoe, Moi , Fleur Bleu (Stop Calling Me Baby!), and Nell in 1994 for which she was Oscar-nominated again. She also made a little-seen Italian film called Il Casotto in 1977. </p> <p>She made her first move into directing with Little Man Tate in 1991 of which the French director Louis Malle said: 'Jodie's film is basically about the profound loneliness of childhood and she's dealing with it head on. I would be happy and proud to have made the film she did.' Home for the Holidays, which she made four years later with actors Holly Hunter, Robert Downey Jnr, Anne Bancroft and Geraldine Chaplin, was less well received. She has run into problems not of her making with Flora Plum , a circus story which has been delayed after one of its stars, Russell Crowe, injured his shoulder and shooting had to stop. She has not given up the day job: Anna and the King , last year's non-musical version of the King and I, allowed her a chance to play an English governess for a fee of $15 million. The Riefenstahl film would provide a further test of both her directorial and acting skills. </p> <p>Whatever happens to the Riefenstahl project, which would have to examine the way in which the Nazis justified cruelty and the justification of horrific acts, is something Jodie Foster addressed when she won her first Oscar for The Accused .

MPs, unions and motoring groups demanded they be punished for this blatant breach of goodwill. Big oil, after all, was benefiting upstream from swollen revenues generated by crude at more than $30 a barrel at the same time as taking advantage of a national emergency downstream. </p> <p>'There was talk that week and since of a windfall tax on oil companies,' said a Whitehall source. Its practicability was 'being considered'. </p> <p>Such a tax now looks less likely, and the Government would be unlikely to make any move until after an election. </p> <p>But the Chancellor's options do not end there. As Gordon Brown readies his pre-Budget report, the discontented argue that the companies' cavalier attitude last month offers an opportunity to move from a narrow focus on fuel duty to a wider review of the taxation of North Sea oil revenues. </p> <p>The Government considered North Sea taxation in 1998, and left it untouched after the companies warned they could scale down investment.

It proposes that duty should be reduced progressively to help motorists as the oil price rises within a band between $20 and $30 a barrel.

For the fields developed before 1982, where royalties and petroleum revenue tax are paid, the rate is 69 per cent.

      "bodyText": "On Thursday 14 September a man at one of Esso's service stations in Edinburgh climbed up to the forecourt price display to increase the price of petrol. It was the height of the fuel crisis, and the petrol pumps were running dry in the face of the refinery blockade by militant farmer and haulier protesters. Esso's action immediately caused amazement and fury, not just among motorists, but with officials and Ministers co-ordinating civil contingency plans from a bunker under the Cabinet Office just around the corner from Downing Street. The immediate opprobrium sparked what could turn out to be longer-term problems for oil companies. MPs, unions and motoring groups demanded they be punished for this blatant breach of goodwill. Big oil, after all, was benefiting upstream from swollen revenues generated by crude at more than $30 a barrel at the same time as taking advantage of a national emergency downstream. 'There was talk that week and since of a windfall tax on oil companies,' said a Whitehall source. Its practicability was 'being considered'. Such a tax now looks less likely, and the Government would be unlikely to make any move until after an election. But the Chancellor's options do not end there. As Gordon Brown readies his pre-Budget report, the discontented argue that the companies' cavalier attitude last month offers an opportunity to move from a narrow focus on fuel duty to a wider review of the taxation of North Sea oil revenues. The Government considered North Sea taxation in 1998, and left it untouched after the companies warned they could scale down investment. But that was when oil was at $10 a barrel. Recent political and economic pressures may force a re-evaluation. In his party conference speech, Tony Blair said: 'Of the 14p rise [in petrol prices] since the Budget last year, 12p has been in the world oil price.' Last week it emerged that rates of return in the North Sea were 33.1 per cent in the second quarter of this year, compared with 6 per cent among UK manufacturers.

      "body": "<p>Public protest against high fuel prices in Britain has drawn all eyes to the consumer taxes that have been pushing up UK prices much more than the rising dollar price of oil. Increased excise taxes and higher VAT have added about 30p per litre to the pump price over the last eight years. But what about producer taxes? The companies who were awarded licences to extract oil from the North Sea are, like members of Opec, beneficiaries of rising oil prices. Have they been paying their fair share of taxes? </p> <p>Consider the historical record of North Sea oil profits and the tax-take since Opec first raised oil prices in the 1970s. The table reveals that when company profits were running at peak levels of over \u00a318 billion per annum in the mid-1980s, the government tax-take was about \u00a312 bn, ie a share of about 60 per cent. But when profits peaked again at about \u00a316 bn in 1996/7, the tax-take had fallen to less than \u00a34 bn, ie these companies were only paying a quarter of gross profits in tax. </p> <p>In the early years of North Sea oil production, UK oil companies were, in addition to standard corporation tax, subject to specific taxes, namely Royalties and PRT (petroleum revenue tax - payable after investment costs had been recouped). Why these extra taxes? The reason is that the oil companies were not charged anything for licences to extract oil: these licences were, and still are, allocated free after a 'beauty contest'. The specific taxes were designed to recoup some of the potential profits in transferring rights to oil in this way. </p> <p>Subsequently, however, changes in both UK corporation tax and in the North Sea taxes have made it 'one of the weakest oil tax regimes in the world', according to economists Philip Wright and Ian Rutledge. Thus in 1983 Royalties were abolished on new fields and the phasing out of PRT was begun because of fears that that high tax levels were discouraging exploration. Meanwhile corporation tax was steadily falling from 52 per cent at the time the North Sea began full development down to its current level of 30 per cent - lower than the US and other European countries. Finally, in the 1993 budget, PRT was reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent on existing fields and abolished for new fields. So for fields developed after 1993 (so called 'non-taxable' fields), only corporation tax at 30 per cent is payable. As Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies put it in a letter to the FT in 1994, it is 'as if the Government handed out buildings rent free to business and simply charged them corporation tax on their profits'. </p> <p>It was hardly surprising that, in 1997, when the oil price was about $20 per barrel, the incoming Labour Government should set up a review of the fiscal regime 'to ensure the Government is taxing an appropriate share of North Sea profits'. Submissions from the industry were received and it was expected that the new Government would reintroduce taxes on North Sea oil. But with oil prices falling towards $10 a barrel in 1998, the plans were shelved. </p> <p>Now, with oil prices soaring above $30 a barrel, it is surely time to put in place fiscal changes that give the Treasury a bigger share of the extra revenues generated for North Sea oil companies when Opec raises the price of oil. </p> <p>Some favour a 'windfall tax', eg a special tax on profits whenever the price of oil rises above $25 a barrel. But in proposals made earlier this year for collecting economic rent, I and colleagues Martin Cripps, Norman Ireland and Lei Zhang of Warwick University favour a reformed fiscal regime, which collects the extra tax automatically when oil prices go up without the need for ad hoc taxes. </p> <p>It was a mistake to slash PRT in 1993 when oil prices were low and it was yielding next to nothing. When prices rise, it delivers fatter revenues. Now the Government could reimpose PRT on the 'non-taxed' oil-fields at the 50 per cent rate applying to all other fields. In addition, encouraged by the experience of raising a staggering \u00a322 bn in selling licences, the Government might try auctioning offshore development licences. This is already done in the US. An ingenious variant was proposed by the group: instead of 'ascending price bidding', this would involve 'descending share bidding', the winning bidder being the company which leaves the largest share with the Government. </p> <p>With consumers taking to the streets against what they see as excessive taxation, it's surely time to look again at the taxes paid by oil companies. With a reformed fiscal regime, the 'pain' suffered by UK consumers whenever the world price of oil rises would be mitigated by the 'gain' of a greater tax-take from 'our oil' in the North Sea. With the yield of more efficient producer taxes, the Chancellor could, if he so wished, take action to reduce pump prices without having to cut other public expenditures or raise other taxes - by using the proceeds to ease the burden of consumer fuel taxes. If not now, when will the Chancellor increase the nation's share of the profits from 'black gold' in the North Sea? </p> <p> Marcus Miller is Professor of Economics at Warwick University</p>",

      "body": "<p>So call me a liar. I was standing in front of the New York Hilton Hotel when the limousine carrying International Monetary Fund director Horst Kohler zoomed by, hitting a bump. Out flew a confidential report, Ecuador Interim Country Assistance Strategy. You suspect that's not how I got it, but you can trust me that it contains the answer to a puzzling question. </p> <p>Inside the Hilton, Professor Anthony Giddens told an earnest crowd of London School of Economics alumni that 'globalisation is a fact, and it is driven by the communications revolution'. </p> <p>Wow. That was an eye-opener. The screeching green-haired freaks outside the hotel demonstrating against the IMF had it all wrong. </p> <p>Globalisation, Giddens seems to say, is about giving every villager in the Andes a Nokia internet-enabled mobile phone. What puzzled me is why anyone would protest against this happy future. </p> <p>So I thumbed through my purloined IMF Strategy for Ecuador seeking a chapter on connecting the country's schools to the world wide web. Instead, I found a secret schedule. By 1 November this year, it says, its government is ordered to raise the price of cooking gas by 80 per cent. It must eliminate 26,000 jobs and halve real wages for the remaining workers by 50 per cent in four steps in months specified by the IMF. It must begin to transfer ownership of its biggest water system to foreign operators by July and grant BP's Arco subsidiary the right to build and own an oil pipeline over the Andes. </p> <p>That's for starters. In all, the IMF's 167 loan conditions look less like an assistance plan and more like a blueprint for a financial coup d'\u00e9tat. </p> <p>The IMF would say it has no choice. Ecuador is broke, thanks to the implosion of its commercial banks. But how did Ecuador, an Opec member with resources to spare, end up in such a pickle? </p> <p>For that, we have to turn back to 1983, when the IMF forced its government to take over the soured private debts owed by Ecuador's elite to foreign banks. For this bail-out of US and local financiers, Ecuador borrowed $1.5 billion. </p> <p>To repay this loan, the IMF dictated price hikes for electricity and other necessities. And when that didn't drain off enough cash, yet another assistance plan required the state to eliminate 120,000 jobs. </p> <p>Furthermore, while trying to meet the mountain of IMF obligations, Ecuador foolishly 'liberalised' its tiny financial market, cutting local banks loose from government controls and letting private debt and interest rates explode. </p> <p>Who pushed Ecuador into this nutty romp with free-market banking? Hint: the initials are IMF. It made bank liberalisation a condition of another berserk assistance plan. The facts of this nasty little history come from the IMF report marked: 'Please do not cite.' Pretend I didn't. </p> <p>The IMF and the World Bank have lent a sticky helping hand to scores of nations. Take Tanzania. Today, 1.4 million people there are getting ready to die. They are the 8 per cent of the nation's population who have the Aids virus. The financial 'rescuers' found a brilliant neo-liberal solution: require Tanzania to charge for hospital visits, previously free. This cut the number of patients treated in the three big public hospitals in the capital, Dar es Salaam, by 53 per cent. The financial cures must be working. </p> <p>The bodies told Tanzania to charge school fees. Now the bank expresses surprise that school enrolment is down from 80 per cent to 66 per cent. </p> <p>Altogether the Bank and IMF have 157 other helpful suggestions for Tanzania, and the Tanzanian government secretly agreed last April to adopt them all. It was sign or starve. No developing nation can borrow hard currency without IMF blessing (except China, whose output grows at 5 per cent a year thanks to it studiously following the reverse of IMF policies). </p> <p>The IMF and World Bank have effectively controlled Tanzania's economy since 1985. Admittedly, when they took charge they found a socialist nation mired in poverty, disease and debt. </p> <p>Their experts wasted no time in cutting trade barriers, limiting government subsidies and selling off state industries. This worked wonders. According to bank-watcher Nancy Alexander of the Washington-based Globalisation Challenge Initiative,in just 15 years Tanzania's GDP has dropped from $309 to $210 per capita, the literacy rate is falling and the rate of abject poverty has jumped to 51 per cent of the population. </p> <p>Yet somehow the bank has failed to win over the hearts and minds of Tanzanians to its free-market gameplan. Last June, the bank reported in frustration: 'One legacy of socialism is that most people continue to believe the state has a fundamental role in promoting development and providing social services.' </p> <p>The World Bank and the IMF were born in 1944 with simple, laudable mandates: between them to fund post-war reconstruction and development projects and lend hard currency to nations left skint by temporary balance of payments deficits. </p> <p>But in 1980 they seemed to take on an alien form. In the early Eighties, Third World nations, haemorrhaging after the fivefold increases in oil prices and a similar jump in dollar interest payments, brought their begging bowls to the two bodies. But instead of debt relief, they received structural assistance plans listing an average of 114 'conditionalities' in return for capital. </p> <p>The particulars varied from nation to nation, but in every case, they had to remove trade barriers, sell national assets to foreign investors, slash social spending and make labour 'flexible' (that is, crush unions). </p> <p>Some say the vicious policy change resulted from the election that year of Ronald Reagan as US President, the quickening of Margaret Thatcher's powers and the beginning of the neo-liberal ascendency. (My own information is that the IMF and World Bank were taken over by a space alien named Larry. It's obvious that 'Larry' Summers, once World Bank chief economist and now US Treasury Secretary, is really a platoon of extra- terrestrials sent to turn much of the human race into a source of cheap protein. But I digress.) </p> <p>So what have The Aliens accomplished with their e free-market prescriptions? An article by Samuel Brittan in last week's Financial Times declared that the new world capital markets and free trade have 'brought about an unprecedented increase in world living standards'.

      "bodyText": "So call me a liar. I was standing in front of the New York Hilton Hotel when the limousine carrying International Monetary Fund director Horst Kohler zoomed by, hitting a bump. Out flew a confidential report, Ecuador Interim Country Assistance Strategy. You suspect that's not how I got it, but you can trust me that it contains the answer to a puzzling question. Inside the Hilton, Professor Anthony Giddens told an earnest crowd of London School of Economics alumni that 'globalisation is a fact, and it is driven by the communications revolution'. Wow. That was an eye-opener. The screeching green-haired freaks outside the hotel demonstrating against the IMF had it all wrong. Globalisation, Giddens seems to say, is about giving every villager in the Andes a Nokia internet-enabled mobile phone. What puzzled me is why anyone would protest against this happy future. So I thumbed through my purloined IMF Strategy for Ecuador seeking a chapter on connecting the country's schools to the world wide web. Instead, I found a secret schedule. By 1 November this year, it says, its government is ordered to raise the price of cooking gas by 80 per cent. It must eliminate 26,000 jobs and halve real wages for the remaining workers by 50 per cent in four steps in months specified by the IMF. It must begin to transfer ownership of its biggest water system to foreign operators by July and grant BP's Arco subsidiary the right to build and own an oil pipeline over the Andes. That's for starters. In all, the IMF's 167 loan conditions look less like an assistance plan and more like a blueprint for a financial coup d'\u00e9tat. The IMF would say it has no choice. Ecuador is broke, thanks to the implosion of its commercial banks. But how did Ecuador, an Opec member with resources to spare, end up in such a pickle? For that, we have to turn back to 1983, when the IMF forced its government to take over the soured private debts owed by Ecuador's elite to foreign banks. For this bail-out of US and local financiers, Ecuador borrowed $1.5 billion. To repay this loan, the IMF dictated price hikes for electricity and other necessities. And when that didn't drain off enough cash, yet another assistance plan required the state to eliminate 120,000 jobs. Furthermore, while trying to meet the mountain of IMF obligations, Ecuador foolishly 'liberalised' its tiny financial market, cutting local banks loose from government controls and letting private debt and interest rates explode. Who pushed Ecuador into this nutty romp with free-market banking? Hint: the initials are IMF. It made bank liberalisation a condition of another berserk assistance plan. The facts of this nasty little history come from the IMF report marked: 'Please do not cite.' Pretend I didn't. The IMF and the World Bank have lent a sticky helping hand to scores of nations. Take Tanzania. Today, 1.4 million people there are getting ready to die. They are the 8 per cent of the nation's population who have the Aids virus. The financial 'rescuers' found a brilliant neo-liberal solution: require Tanzania to charge for hospital visits, previously free. This cut the number of patients treated in the three big public hospitals in the capital, Dar es Salaam, by 53 per cent. The financial cures must be working. The bodies told Tanzania to charge school fees. Now the bank expresses surprise that school enrolment is down from 80 per cent to 66 per cent. Altogether the Bank and IMF have 157 other helpful suggestions for Tanzania, and the Tanzanian government secretly agreed last April to adopt them all. It was sign or starve. No developing nation can borrow hard currency without IMF blessing (except China, whose output grows at 5 per cent a year thanks to it studiously following the reverse of IMF policies). The IMF and World Bank have effectively controlled Tanzania's economy since 1985. Admittedly, when they took charge they found a socialist nation mired in poverty, disease and debt. Their experts wasted no time in cutting trade barriers, limiting government subsidies and selling off state industries. This worked wonders. According to bank-watcher Nancy Alexander of the Washington-based Globalisation Challenge Initiative,in just 15 years Tanzania's GDP has dropped from $309 to $210 per capita, the literacy rate is falling and the rate of abject poverty has jumped to 51 per cent of the population. Yet somehow the bank has failed to win over the hearts and minds of Tanzanians to its free-market gameplan. Last June, the bank reported in frustration: 'One legacy of socialism is that most people continue to believe the state has a fundamental role in promoting development and providing social services.' The World Bank and the IMF were born in 1944 with simple, laudable mandates: between them to fund post-war reconstruction and development projects and lend hard currency to nations left skint by temporary balance of payments deficits. But in 1980 they seemed to take on an alien form. In the early Eighties, Third World nations, haemorrhaging after the fivefold increases in oil prices and a similar jump in dollar interest payments, brought their begging bowls to the two bodies. But instead of debt relief, they received structural assistance plans listing an average of 114 'conditionalities' in return for capital. The particulars varied from nation to nation, but in every case, they had to remove trade barriers, sell national assets to foreign investors, slash social spending and make labour 'flexible' (that is, crush unions). Some say the vicious policy change resulted from the election that year of Ronald Reagan as US President, the quickening of Margaret Thatcher's powers and the beginning of the neo-liberal ascendency. (My own information is that the IMF and World Bank were taken over by a space alien named Larry. It's obvious that 'Larry' Summers, once World Bank chief economist and now US Treasury Secretary, is really a platoon of extra- terrestrials sent to turn much of the human race into a source of cheap protein. But I digress.) So what have The Aliens accomplished with their e free-market prescriptions? An article by Samuel Brittan in last week's Financial Times declared that the new world capital markets and free trade have 'brought about an unprecedented increase in world living standards'. Brittan cites the huge growth in GDP per capita, life expectancy and literacy in the less developed world from 1950 to 1995. Now hold on a minute. Until 1980, virtually every nation in his survey was either socialist or welfare statist. They were developing on the 'Import Substitution Model', by which locally-owned industry was built through government investment and high tariffs, anathema to the neoliberals. In those dark ages of increasing national government control and ownership (1960-1980), per capita income grew by 73 per cent in Latin America and by 34 per cent in Africa. By comparison, since 1980, Latin American growth has come to a virtual halt, growing by less than 6 per cent over 20 years - and African incomes have declined by 23 per cent. Now let's count the corpses. From 1950 to 1980, socialist and statist welfare policies added more than a decade of life expectancy to virtually every nation on the planet. From 1980 to today, life under structural assistance has become brutish and shorter. Since 1985, the total number of illiterate people has risen and life expectancy is falling in 15 African nations. Brittan attributes this to 'bad luck, [not] the international economic system'. In the former Soviet states, where IMF and World Bank shock plans hold sway, life expectancy has plunged, adding 1.4 million a year to the death rate in Russia alone. Admittedly, the World Bank and IMF are reforming. The dreaded structural assistance plans have been renamed 'poverty reduction strategies'. Doesn't that make you feel better? Recently, the IMF admitted that 'in the recent decades, nearly one-fifth of the world population have regressed' - arguably 'one of the greatest economic failures of the twentieth century.'

She would turn in her grave at the tribe of interviewers who not only ask questions but take pride in asking them rudely. (In last week's TV Times , there is a top 10 of rudest TV personalities - a swanking list that includes Anne Robinson, Jeremy Paxman, Clive Anderson, Mark Lamarr.) </p> <p>But it is not only the media that revels in rudeness. As a nation we have become much more surly. Why are we dazzled by people who dare not to be polite? Is this new respect for rudeness an affliction? Or are we in rude health? </p> <p>'Give Anthony Powell a ring, ' said Auberon Waugh, my former boss on Literary Review , 'and see if he would like to review a book on cats. He is very fond of cats.' It was 1987 and I had just started as deputy editor. I was as green and thin-skinned as a mangetout. I wholeheartedly admired Powell's Dance to the Music of Time - but did not know about his fondness for cats nor that it was matched in intensity by his antipathy to Waugh. I rang, in trepidation. Anthony Powell did not purr. He erupted. He shouted down the line, berating me for - among other things - my rudeness in phoning at such an uncivilised time. He was right. It was lunchtime. I scraped my way out of the call, mortified by his rudeness - and by mine. </p> <p>Rudeness is memorable. Politeness is not. And rudeness is personal. I once interviewed - or tried to interview - Vanessa Redgrave (whom I held, as I had Powell, in the highest regard). She was in The Three Sisters with her sister, Lynn, and niece, Gemma. I was to write a piece, touching on their relationships with each other. I felt overwhelmed by having to interview them all at once - and said so. 'You don't expect us to believe that do you, Kate Kellaway?' Vanessa Redgrave said, making a sneer of my name. I asked a question about their childhood. 'Is this an article for Nursery World ?' said Vanessa. I asked a safer question about The Three Sisters . Her reply began: 'If you'd ever read Chekhov, you'd know that...' Afterwards, I wept with humiliation. The next day, a letter from Lynn Redgrave arrived, apologising for her sister. The day after, I went back and tried again. Vanessa was charming but remote. One word would sum her performance up - 'polite'. </p> <p>Politeness oils the works. And yet we could float downstream forever using 'pleases' and 'thank yous' as our rafts and leave no trace behind us. Rudeness often is the works: at least, it shows us how the engine runs. Politeness is often hypocritical. The only polite answer to 'how are you?' is 'fine'; it is not 'have you got all night? Let's start with my toes and work upwards'. </p> <p>At the heart of our rejoicing in rudeness is the sense that we are on to the truth in some way. So if Jeremy Paxman is aggressive, there is the feeling that he is getting somewhere: rudeness as authenticity. And when Tom Paulin reviews a book or a film with coruscating eloquence, he is more convincing than the soporific critic who damns with faint praise. And when we are rude, our integrity is never in doubt. </p> <p>It should come as no surprise then that the language of politeness has become emasculated. This is politeness that communicates itself as rudeness. Directness would be preferable. People who do not know you at all say 'take care', when you know it wouldn't matter to them if you walked under a bus. Give me some rudeness any day - especially if it is entertaining. </p> <p>The trouble is that not enough modern rudeness is. It is debased.

      "bodyText": "Asking questions was not considered, by my grandmother's generation, 'a form of polite conversation among gentlemen'. She would turn in her grave at the tribe of interviewers who not only ask questions but take pride in asking them rudely. (In last week's TV Times , there is a top 10 of rudest TV personalities - a swanking list that includes Anne Robinson, Jeremy Paxman, Clive Anderson, Mark Lamarr.) But it is not only the media that revels in rudeness. As a nation we have become much more surly. Why are we dazzled by people who dare not to be polite? Is this new respect for rudeness an affliction? Or are we in rude health? 'Give Anthony Powell a ring, ' said Auberon Waugh, my former boss on Literary Review , 'and see if he would like to review a book on cats. He is very fond of cats.' It was 1987 and I had just started as deputy editor. I was as green and thin-skinned as a mangetout. I wholeheartedly admired Powell's Dance to the Music of Time - but did not know about his fondness for cats nor that it was matched in intensity by his antipathy to Waugh. I rang, in trepidation. Anthony Powell did not purr. He erupted. He shouted down the line, berating me for - among other things - my rudeness in phoning at such an uncivilised time. He was right. It was lunchtime. I scraped my way out of the call, mortified by his rudeness - and by mine. Rudeness is memorable. Politeness is not. And rudeness is personal. I once interviewed - or tried to interview - Vanessa Redgrave (whom I held, as I had Powell, in the highest regard). She was in The Three Sisters with her sister, Lynn, and niece, Gemma. I was to write a piece, touching on their relationships with each other. I felt overwhelmed by having to interview them all at once - and said so. 'You don't expect us to believe that do you, Kate Kellaway?' Vanessa Redgrave said, making a sneer of my name. I asked a question about their childhood. 'Is this an article for Nursery World ?' said Vanessa. I asked a safer question about The Three Sisters . Her reply began: 'If you'd ever read Chekhov, you'd know that...' Afterwards, I wept with humiliation. The next day, a letter from Lynn Redgrave arrived, apologising for her sister. The day after, I went back and tried again. Vanessa was charming but remote. One word would sum her performance up - 'polite'. Politeness oils the works. And yet we could float downstream forever using 'pleases' and 'thank yous' as our rafts and leave no trace behind us. Rudeness often is the works: at least, it shows us how the engine runs. Politeness is often hypocritical. The only polite answer to 'how are you?' is 'fine'; it is not 'have you got all night? Let's start with my toes and work upwards'. At the heart of our rejoicing in rudeness is the sense that we are on to the truth in some way. So if Jeremy Paxman is aggressive, there is the feeling that he is getting somewhere: rudeness as authenticity. And when Tom Paulin reviews a book or a film with coruscating eloquence, he is more convincing than the soporific critic who damns with faint praise. And when we are rude, our integrity is never in doubt. It should come as no surprise then that the language of politeness has become emasculated. This is politeness that communicates itself as rudeness. Directness would be preferable. People who do not know you at all say 'take care', when you know it wouldn't matter to them if you walked under a bus. Give me some rudeness any day - especially if it is entertaining. The trouble is that not enough modern rudeness is. It is debased. We can't compete with Kent in King Lear : 'Thou whoreson zed! Thous unnecessary letter', must be the best curse in English literature. Even Jonsons's 'A turd i'th teeth to you' has its uses. We need to revitalise rudeness but, alas, we are more likely to hang up a sign: 'Thank you for not swearing'.",

      "body": "<p>There is a mysterious kind of movie title that is not explained in the film itself and demands some special knowledge. A Clockwork Orange, Straw Dogs and O Brother, Where Art Thou? are examples. The amiable Where the Money Is, directed by Marek Kanievska, a British filmmaker best known for Another Country, from a script by three Americans, belongs in this category. </p> <p>Nobody uses the phrase in the film and, surprisingly, it is not in any dictionary of quotations I possess. But it is generally attributed to the legendary American criminal Willie Sutton, who spent most of his life in jail and the rest of it planning heists. Asked in old age why he persisted in robbing banks, Willie replied: 'Because that's where the money is', and it is clear that Henry, the elderly thief played by Paul Newman, is modelled on Willie Sutton. </p> <p>This clever comedy-thriller begins with Henry, a convict well into his seventies, being temporarily installed in a public geriatric hospital in Oregon. He is speechless and paralysed from a stroke two years before, and thus considered harmless by the state and no threat to the largely female inmates. But his notorious career staging ingenious hold-ups coast to coast causes a flutter among his fellow patients and excites the special interest of Carol (the seductive Linda Fiorentino), an attractive nurse whose marriage to her boorish high-school sweetheart, Wayne (Dermot Mulroney), has gone sour. </p> <p>The frustrated Carol suspects that Henry is feigning his condition, or perhaps unconsciously hopes he is. Anyway, after a leisurely, interestingly detailed opening half-hour, she rumbles Henry. </p> <p>Having studied autohypnosis, this brilliant, amoral loner has managed to convince doctors, psychiatrists and warders that he has been permanently incapacitated by the stroke. </p> <p>'It's not enough to play possum,' the sprightly charmer tells his two new pupils. 'You've got to be possum.' That is as good a description of method acting as you can get; Newman and Henry are consummate performers whom you rarely catch acting. </p> <p>Henry subsequently masterminds from his wheel-chair his last big heist.

      "bodyText": "There is a mysterious kind of movie title that is not explained in the film itself and demands some special knowledge. A Clockwork Orange, Straw Dogs and O Brother, Where Art Thou? are examples. The amiable Where the Money Is, directed by Marek Kanievska, a British filmmaker best known for Another Country, from a script by three Americans, belongs in this category. Nobody uses the phrase in the film and, surprisingly, it is not in any dictionary of quotations I possess. But it is generally attributed to the legendary American criminal Willie Sutton, who spent most of his life in jail and the rest of it planning heists. Asked in old age why he persisted in robbing banks, Willie replied: 'Because that's where the money is', and it is clear that Henry, the elderly thief played by Paul Newman, is modelled on Willie Sutton. This clever comedy-thriller begins with Henry, a convict well into his seventies, being temporarily installed in a public geriatric hospital in Oregon. He is speechless and paralysed from a stroke two years before, and thus considered harmless by the state and no threat to the largely female inmates. But his notorious career staging ingenious hold-ups coast to coast causes a flutter among his fellow patients and excites the special interest of Carol (the seductive Linda Fiorentino), an attractive nurse whose marriage to her boorish high-school sweetheart, Wayne (Dermot Mulroney), has gone sour. The frustrated Carol suspects that Henry is feigning his condition, or perhaps unconsciously hopes he is. Anyway, after a leisurely, interestingly detailed opening half-hour, she rumbles Henry. Having studied autohypnosis, this brilliant, amoral loner has managed to convince doctors, psychiatrists and warders that he has been permanently incapacitated by the stroke. 'It's not enough to play possum,' the sprightly charmer tells his two new pupils. 'You've got to be possum.' That is as good a description of method acting as you can get; Newman and Henry are consummate performers whom you rarely catch acting. Henry subsequently masterminds from his wheel-chair his last big heist. To assist him, he inducts Carol and Wayne into the art of theft, the way Sean Connery does Catherine Zeta Jones in Jon Amiel's Entrapment and Burt Reynolds does Casey Siemaszko in Bill Forsyth's Breaking In (American movies that also happen to have British directors). Wayne wants the wages of sin, but lacks the spirit to enjoy transgression. Carol, on the other hand, becomes radiant, is renewed and liberated by embarking on a life of crime, in a manner reminiscent of Peggy Cummins in the subversive classic Gun Crazy and Faye Dunaway in Bonnie and Clyde. However, a violent bout of vomiting before setting out on the final job reveals suppressed qualms and fear. The chosen target is not a bank but an armoured car, and the scheme is to hijack one and then themselves make the nightly collection at supermarkets, bars, filling stations, an amusement park and a sports stadium. 'You don't rob the route, you rob the crew,' says Henry, explaining why they need to study the behaviour of the armoured-car drivers. His object as always is to carry out the operation without shooting; in fact, almost the film's only act of violence comes in some well-deserved revenge on a crooked male nurse. There are some holes in the plot and a few improbabilities in Where the Money Is, but generally this beguiling film goes its antisocial way in a stately, magisterial manner befitting the age and stature of its protagonist and its star. The script is peppered with sharp dialogue that Newman handles impeccably. He tells a cautionary tale about a friend's greyhound on a Florida racetrack that caught up with the hare and was electrocuted - 'He got what he wanted, but not what he expected.' His best line comes when the police surround them at Fiorentino's house and a sheriff barks through a megaphone: 'Come out with your hands on your heads.' Newman's blue eyes sparkle: 'You haven't lived till you've heard someone say that to you.' Newman, who is 75, has said that this will be his last movie. One hopes not, as he has done fine work during the past decade. He emerged on the screen 45 years ago under the shadow of his fellow Actors Studio graduates, Marlon Brando and James Dean, and because of Dean's early death and Brando's professional indolence, he has long since outstripped them. He has also been, while living an orderly life and conducting a disciplined career, a greater rebel than either. Newman has proved himself equally adept at comedy and drama (think of The Sting and Butch Cassidy), though only occasionally has he been an orthodox hero, as in Exodus, one of the few occasions he has played a Jew. His great strength over the years is the insight he has brought to outsiders, anti-authoritarian rebels as different as the eponymous heroes of Hud, Hombre and Cool Hand Luke . On the other hand, he gave one of his finest performances in Mr and Mrs Bridge, playing the very embodiment of middle-class, small-town conformity. Possibly his greatest film is The Hustler (1961), which established him as an actor of stature and, 25 years later, in The Color of Money, Newman was able to revisit the same character, to see how he had changed and grown, and at last win an Oscar.",

      "body": "<p>Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. </p> <p>Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race.</p> <p>Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home.</p> <p>Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.'</p> <p>As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. </p> <p>A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. </p> <p>There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. </p> <p>While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?'</p> <p>He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby.</p> <p>Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' </p> <p>Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. </p> <p>The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.'</p> <p>'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career.</p> <p>Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.'</p> <p>In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years.</p> <p>Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!'</p> <p>Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.'</p> <p>The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. </p> <p>Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple.</p> <p>But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. </p> <p>'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.'</p> <p>Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. </p> <p>'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.'</p> <p>I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.'</p> <p>The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor.</p> <p>By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film.</p> <p>'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.'</p> <p>But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition.</p> <p>In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers. According to a certain taste that was coming into ascendancy at the time, I was an 'Uncle Tom', even a 'house Negro', for playing roles that were non-threatening to white audiences, for playing the 'noble Negro' who fulfils white liberal fantasies.'</p> <p>Aware of his diminishing cachet as a leading man, Poitier turned to directing. 'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. </p> <p>'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.'</p> <p>The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.'</p> <p>Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist.</p> <p>'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.'</p> <p>The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?'</p> <p>'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate.</p> <p>'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"'</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' </p> <p>Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. </p> <p>'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' </p> <p>I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.'</p> <p>Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says.</p> <p>Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee.</p> <p>'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.'

      "bodyText": "Vincent Canby, The New York Times's worldly-wise film critic, once wrote of Sidney Poitier that the actor 'does not make movies, he makes milestones'. In the age of Denzel Washington, Wesley Snipes and Chris Rock, Poitier's influence runs the gamut of American cinema. Put simply, the man has few peers. Poitier interviews are a rarity - he has always shrouded his lives, both personal and professional, in secrecy. Now well into the autumn of his life, he takes his place alongside Muhammad Ali, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr as one of the 20th century's most eloquent voices on race. Poitier's office, replete with several thousand feet of deep pile carpeting, varnished floorboards, books and paintings, is set within the Sierra Towers apartment block. The building nudges the postcode margins of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. His assistant Marlene greets me at the door of the fifth-floor office - closely followed by Poitier. The actor's apartment is next door. 'Good to see you,' he says, offering up a palsy handshake. He holds a patio door open to a balcony and ushers me out on to a wraparound walkway that leads to his home. Poitier's reception room is congested with furniture - antique Italian, French and African collectables. Stools, mini-tables and chairs compete for every inch of available space. The historical gumbo is impossible to steer a path through, and I tiptoe carefully across the floor. Coffee tables heave under the weight of bric-a-brac: beach pebbles, gilded paperweights, pens, markers, trinkets, timepieces, statuettes and trays filled with loose change and ornamental wood carvings. 'Make yourself at home,' says Poitier. 'We'll get started soon.' As he wanders back on to the balcony to have his photograph taken, I saunter around Poitier's apartment. Next door, a TV room - fitted with pastel-green cupboards - is adorned with books and videos: The Illustrated Twentieth Century, The Green Mile, Heat and his own In the Heat of the Night. A sofa cushion proclaims a blank machismo universal to American marketing, 'If You Want Breakfast in Bed, Then Sleep in the Kitchen'. There are dozens of framed photographs - Bill Cosby and Poitier, Mandela and Poitier, Harry Belafonte and Poitier, a promotional photograph for The Blackboard Jungle, pictures of his six children, and Poitier and his second wife, Joanne Shimkus. A mantelpiece stores numerous awards - a 1963 Nato trophy for 'Star of the Year', the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award from 1992, and an Oscar for Best Actor, awarded to him in 1963, for Lilies of the Field. While waiting for The Observer's photographer to assemble his photographic equipment, Poitier slides into an armchair by the balcony walkway. 'Sit you doon,' he says, gesturing towards a dinky, gold-lacquered Italian stool nearby. I perch myself on the edge, and we traffic a quick exchange on photography. 'I sometimes like the pictures photographers take of me,' says Poitier. 'I don't know what they see, though,' he adds, thoughtfully. 'What are they looking to capture?' He looks at me and I lean forward to adjust my T-shirt. Only then am I aware of a sinking gravitational pull, augmented by a thwack as the stool gives way. I find myself splayed on the ground, staring at the ceiling, knees bent before me. Rolling over on to my front, neither manfully nor gracefully, I gawk embarrassedly at the extent of my destruction -a broken stool leg lies nearby. Fumble, fumble. 'Was there something defective with the stool? Surely I couldn't have done that.' I'm genuinely mortified. Poitier shoots me a refrigerated frown, examining the stool's broken leg. 'No. You did that,' he says. I exaggerate my incredulity: 'Er, did I really do that? Are you absolutely sure there was nothing wrong with the stool? I mean, I'm not that big.' Turning the stool over, Poitier grimaces at the splinters of mahogany that once made up the joist. 'Yes, you definitely did that.' His eyes give me the look of finality. 'I can get it fixed. I'll bill the London Observer,' he pronounces. 'A coupla grand should do it.' I smile meekly, find myself a sofa with all the sturdiness of a Humvee Jeep, and collapse into it. The conversation, logically, begins with his soon to be published memoirs. The Measure of a Man, part-memoir, part-spiritual survey, has all the quiet resilience of Poitier himself. The book's 250-odd pages harbour a quasi-intellectual thesis on modern masculinity - the author finds tools of male potency in family, nature and self-evaluation. He writes: 'I felt called to write about certain values, such as integrity and commitment, faith and forgiveness, about the virtues of simplicity, about the differences between \"amusing ourselves to death\" and finding meaningful pleasures - even joy.' 'It isn't the kind of book I could have written at the age of 20,' he says. 'Or even 30. I am what I am. This is the journey that I undertook all those years ago. It has been an incredible journey - I remind myself of that every day. I hope it signals something.' The book is a joy to read, warm-natured and scholarly - The Measure of a Man reinforces the argument that Poitier, indeed, has few peers imbued with a similar gravitas. It also, naturally, embellishes an already extraordinary career. Sidney Poitier was born in 1927 in Miami during a mainland visit by his parents. The infant Poitier weighed only 3lb - his dejected father went to look for a shoebox in which to bury the child. He grew up on Cat Island in the Bahamas, a meagre spit of land 46 miles long and three miles wide. His father, Reginald James Poitier was a tomato farmer who raised six other children. 'It was a land unspoiled by capitalism,' says Poitier. 'We lived off the land - wore cloth sacks. It was the pre-industrial age.' In 1936, keen to resuscitate the domestic market, the state of Florida forced an embargo on tomatoes grown in the Bahamas. The following year, Poitier and his mother set off for Nassau. Reggie Poitier would wrestle a meagre living off an agrarian existence for a further 30 years. Nassau in the 30s was a land of grubby opportunism as a slew of migrants from the Bahamas siphoned a path of cheap labour. It was also Poitier's first introduction to race and class. In The Measure of a Man, he recalls an early experience with white supremacy. Aged 13, Poitier, while walking up West Bay Street, noticed ahead an older white teenager cycling towards him on the opposite pavement. Poitier walked on undeterred - even as the boy steered his bicycle towards him. 'He rode up, and as he got abreast of me he took his right hand off the handlebar and punched me in the face. Boom!' Poitier's awakening to a white-dominant culture became a rivulet of his waking angst. 'I went looking for the cyclist,' Poitier tells me. 'That was my instinctive response. I was not afraid. I was not afraid of this guy who rode up and punched me on the mouth. First, I thought it cowardly. And I was angry, and I went chasing after him. I couldn't find him, though.' The family moved to Miama and Poitier, still in his teens, ran off to New York. He had given up school after only a year and a half of formal education. In New York, and Harlem more specifically (a fabled destination for Southern migrants), Poitier's formative years were defined by a succession of odd jobs - dishwasher, cleaner, construction worker and a year in the US army. The work was unsteady and often dangerous. He slept in bus stations and on pavements. Poitier's first foray into acting was accidental from the outset. In 1945, jobless and politically untutored, he stepped into The American Negro Theatre on 127th Street. His audition was a disaster, but acting drew from him a self-expression he could rarely articulate in the outside world. Regular stage work became a guarantee with theatre tours that wandered throughout the country. In his early roles, such as 1950's No Way Out and 1951's Cry, The Beloved Country, Poitier was the antithesis of Paul Robeson, until then Hollywood's only mainstream black actor. While Robeson championed civil rights and socialism - his vocal attacks led to his eventual blacklisting by Hollywood - Poitier's hip dynamism hinted at the all-American strength of freshly hewn maple. But it was his first mainstream picture The Blackboard Jungle, released in 1955 and based on Evan Hunter's ferocious attack on inner city schooling, that iconised Poitier in the popular consciousness - 45 years later, the film stands as a seminal piece of theatrical cinema. And Poitier, as Gregory W Miller, a juvenile delinquent eventually rehabilitated by Glen Ford, broke all the wider stereotypes of the teenage black threat. The film - decried by Congresswoman Clare Booth Luce as 'un-American' - was released in the same year as the Brown vs Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that unanimously voted in integrated education. 'Was I amazed that the film was considered subversive? No, not really,' says Poitier. 'Hollywood hadn't made these kinds of films. The social conscious movement that was creeping up elsewhere hadn't ingrained itself in the film industry yet.' Following The Blackboard Jungle, Poitier relocated to Los Angeles with his wife, Juanita Hardy, consolidating his success with roles in 1957's Edge of the City, 1958's The Defiant Ones (Poitier was the first black actor to be nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award), 1961's Raisin' in the Sun and Lilies of the Field, for which he won an Academy Award in 1963. Before Poitier, black mainstream talent had rarely expressed itself in mainstream cinema. African-American filmmakers shot reels on shoddy budgets, parading their home movies in specialist cinemas. Poitier, young, eloquent and characterising an immaculately tailored sexuality, was a post-war poster boy idolised by suburban housewives. 'It was a strange time for me,' says Poitier. Why, I ask? He pauses, fidgeting with his hands, then tells me he spent most of his Hollywood years in psychoanalysis. 'I lived in a country where I couldn't live where I wanted to live. I lived in a country where I couldn't go where I wanted to eat. I lived in a country where I couldn't get a job, except for those put aside for people of my colour or caste.' I was surprised to discover that Poitier, ingrained in the cannon of American cinema for roles displaying fortitude, stoicism and quiet storms, should seek the benefits of counselling. He visited Viola Bernard, the 1968 founder of the American Committee on Psychoanalysis, Community and Society, for 11 years. 'I had to think twice or three times about every step I took,' says Poitier. 'I was in a culture that denied me my very existence. And I had no forces behind me. When I walked the streets outside of 'The Neighbourhood' which I was confined to, I had to be constantly on the alert. The America I am speaking of was a different place back then: the dominant culture did not care about my survival as a human being.' The psychoanalysis also allowed Poitier the emotional foundations with which to tackle an impending divorce. 'My father was very big on marriage. And divorce, I believed, was so stigmatic. So stigmatic. I considered it a failing on my part - a flaw in my character.' Still, the strong characterisation of genre breaking parts continued: A Patch of Blue in 1965, and, in the same year, The Bedford Incident. Never completely a Hollywood insider, Poitier soldiered on for most of the decade, introducing the town to fresh talent like Bill Cosby and Richard Pryor. By the summer of 1968, Poitier held the top three spots on the takings list -To Sir, With Love, co-starring Lulu and Judy Geeson; In the Heat of the Night, with Rod Steiger and Lee Grant; and Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, with Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. More than 30 years later, In the Heat of the Night, directed by Norman Jewison, is still American cinema's most profound evocation of racial inequality - a dignified portrayal of black and white in shades of grey. As Philadelphian Detective Tibbs, pulled into a murder investigation run by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a small town in the Deep South, the film provided Poitier with his most considered screen persona. And the production is now an academic protectorate - both Poitier and Steiger are regular speakers at American symposiums dedicated to the film. 'Up until then, you just didn't get that kind of exchange between black and white actors,' commented Steiger, at a Long Island, New York film seminar in the summer of 1998. 'The races in cinema, much as in real life, didn't mix. In the Heat of the Night wasn't just risky cinema: it was a revolution. Suddenly, police brutality, government crackdowns, the civil rights movement - they were all thrown into the American consciousness. Hell, the South hated the film so much it was banned down there.' But as succinctly as Poitier seemed to embody all the aspirational, majestic grandeur of the post-war African-American migrants to the North, he was ostracised by a force as immovable as racism: the counter culture. Black rage annihilated apple-pie America in 1968; over 200 cities burned following the assassinations of Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was blighted by 500 arrests. And on the West Coast, Huey P Newton's Black Panther Party For Self Defense marched across California, delivering food and soup to the impoverished, arming barrios and projects with the rhetoric of revolt. Meanwhile, at the Mexico Olympics, American athletes Tommy Smith and John Carlos shook black fists of defiance on the medallist's rostrum. White teenage America quickly followed suit, and 'the pukes', as Frank Sinatra dubbed the rock'n'roll generation, took to campus grounds in Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles in a war of political attrition. In The Measure of a Man, Poitier writes: 'There was more than a little dissatisfaction rising up against me in certain corners of the black community The issue boiled down to why I wasn't more angry and confrontational. New voices were speaking for African-Americans, and in new ways. Stokely Carmichael, H Rap Brown, the Black Panthers. According to a certain taste that was coming into ascendancy at the time, I was an 'Uncle Tom', even a 'house Negro', for playing roles that were non-threatening to white audiences, for playing the 'noble Negro' who fulfils white liberal fantasies.' Aware of his diminishing cachet as a leading man, Poitier turned to directing. 'I decided I had to reconfigurate, redesign my career.' He piloted four successful features for Universal Studios: 1972's Buck and the Preacher, 1973's A Warm December, 1975's Let's Do It Again and most memorably, the 1974 screwball comedy Uptown Saturday Night, starring Bill Cosby and Harry Belafonte. Privately, however, Poitier occasionally unveiled a deep-set depression and disillusionment with the film industry. 'I viewed him as very much part of the establishment,' says Al Young, scriptwriter for the anarchic 1981 Richard Pryor vehicle Bustin' Loose. Young, now 61, was invited to collaborate with Poitier in 1976 on A Piece of the Action - a film sanctioned by a Universal Studio's sub-division, First Artists International. The baby studio was designed to grant creative control to the Hollywood acting elite - Sidney Poitier, Steve McQueen, Barbara Streisand, Paul Newman and later, Dustin Hoffman. Young remembers: 'Sidney wasn't having a good time. There seemed to be some kind of personal crisis. I was young and radical, definitely one of the Berkeley set. It was the age of rebellion and mass demonstrations. Perhaps Poitier thought some of my hip credentials would rub off on him.' The ethics of cultural dissent - intuitive to Young, then 37 - were new to both Poitier and his characters. And Young eventually withdrew from A Piece of the Action before completion. Almost 25 years later, armed with an engine of charming anecdotes, Young chortles loudly: 'I have memories of a kind and warm man. Someone genuinely dedicated to his craft. But someone, nevertheless, deeply troubled by his fame. It seemed like success, in return, had exacted some horrible price. It's like I remember his Oscar - it was permanently displayed on the floor, keeled over.' Young recalls an incident at the Poitier residence in 1976. 'Sidney always made a big thing out of the fact that he never owned a Rolls-Royce nor a Mercedes. It seemed to keep him in touch with the working classes, so instead,' says Young, laughing, 'he had all these Cadillacs. He displayed a natural empathy towards the working class, but in many ways he was the classic poolside socialist. 'Anyway, one day his car breaks down, so he calls the repairman. The guy who showed up was black. He took an instant dislike to Sidney - and treated him with contempt. The look of disgust was unbelievable. It was like Poitier embodied all the evils of someone who had sold out the cause. And Poitier took that very badly. It upset him a great deal.' The popular denunciation of Poitier throughout the late 60s and 70s knew no limits. Black nationalist H Rap Brown deplored his 'Uncle Tom' characterisations. Poitier was more famously immortalised in Amiri Baraka's 1978 play, Sidney Poetical Heroical -a cruel satire that ridiculed the actor as a cheap white liberal gambit on race relations. And three years later, The New York Times published an article, entitled 'Why do white folks love Sidney Poitier so?' 'I don't wanna get into that,' Poitier tells me, wringing his hands. 'It's all so deep and so complicated.' His stoicism rarely permits him to elucidate on those barbed attacks. In The Measure of a Man, he notes: 'The heated tempers of that time have long since cooled, and ideological fashions have come and gone.' The line indicates a fractional victory, but better illustrates, on the whole, his seclusion from the counter cultural debate. 'He just wasn't of those times,' says Young. 'His was an era of polite gentlemanly etiquette. Hollywood was warming to blaxploitation movies like Shaft. I remember going to his house in 1976, and Sidney and his wife left me in the garden. I sat down on the grass and started reading a copy of Rolling Stone magazine - I was a writer for them. Suddenly, the upstairs window opened and there was Sidney. \"Al,\" he exclaimed. \"What are you doing?\" I told him I was sitting on the grass. \"But we never do that!\" he yelled. \"My God! Can I get you a chair?\"' Later in the afternoon, Poitier, un-prompted, revisits his period of wretchedness. His voice is hushed. In fact, his hands better demonstrate his emotions. 'It was a time when rage had matured to an uncontrollable response,' he breathes. 'The black community had made almost no dent in what was a bogus democracy that said it was a democracy. And the people who looked at my career saw two things. They saw what these liberal white filmmakers were doing, and they loved it. Because it was new and it was saying, \"We are unique.\" The revolutionaries, however, had this convoluted attitude, because it was time for revolution, or whatever. They thought I was too good, too well educated, too refined.' Poitier laughs, and shakes his head. 'Hell, partner,' he winks. 'I couldn't fight that. I didn't even try.' Poitier's wife glides into view from a back room. Joanna Shimkus, 57, is a local TV star in Hollywood; the couple married in 1976. 'Why don't you take the young man out for some lunch? Aren't you hungry, dear?' she tells Poitier. Shimkus wanders off back to the kitchen, through the lounge, idly inspecting Poitier's cultural bric-a-brac. 'Sidney?' she exclaims. Poitier rises to his feet, 'Yes, darling?' Shimkus holds up a leg from the stool broken earlier. 'We really do have to get something done about these antique chairs. This one keeps breaking.' I throw a determined glare at Poitier, who blankly stares back. 'You're a damn liar!' I yell. 'Do you have any idea how self-conscious that incident made me feel all afternoon?' Poitier throws his head back and laughs. He slaps me on the knees, 'C'mon kid, let's get some food.' Downstairs at the Sierra Towers's reception desk, Poitier kicks back with the receptionist. 'Isn't she sweet?' he says. He points at me, 'You don't wanna get involved with this guy.' The receptionist, tall, black, lithe, her clothes seemingly lacquered on to her skeleton, giggles and flashes her eyebrows. 'Mr Poitier,' she writhes. 'I'll remember to take your advice.' Poitier glides into his black BMW and the car sails towards Beverly Hills. 'Fuck it, let's have a proper lunch,' he murmurs. At traffic lights, pedestrians stop and squint through his open driver's window. Poitier ignores the squeals of recognition. 'You'll love this restaurant,' he says. Poitier steers the BMW into the car park behind Spago, the renowned Beverley Hills eatery, whose kitchen is directed by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. Going past 3pm, we've missed lunch. 'But we might just catch something,' says Poitier. A dim hallway leads us inside, where four waiters sit .around a table, anticipating the evening melee. 'Mr Poitier, always good to see you,' cries one. Locally, his name is pronounced 'Poy-tiere'. Another waiter leaps to attention: 'Lunch, Mr Poy-tiere? No problem, let me show you to your favourite table.' We are both hustled into our seats amid a flurry of newly spread tablecovers, fresh napkins and polished crockery. Puck walks by, double-takes, and halts at the table. 'Sidney,' he laughs, fondly. 'Always good to see you. I have a wonderful salad. A dressing to die for.' The lunch is magnificent. Methodically working through a green salad, Poitier says: 'I get offered work these days.' He is currently considering resigning from his post as ambassador to Japan from the Bahamas - he was appointed to the position in 1997. And he last appeared in cinemas in The Jackal, a 1997 remake of the original, starring Bruce Willis. 'But something's always wrong, either the scripts or the directors.' He looks at me: the burden of his 50-year long filmography etched on to his face. He says, 'I have to consider my past, all those other films. Anything after it has to fit in.' We drive back to Sierra Towers and for the first time all day the conversation is conducted by goofy fascinations and trivial interests. Poitier laughs at my accent, and I guffaw at this elderly man's still-intact wonderment of life. 'I think I have an average curiosity,' he admits. He stops the car in front of the apartment block and shakes my hand - there's that firm, diplomatic grip again. 'I guess I'll get that chair fixed now,' he laughs. And Poitier, who signalled in the era of intelligentsia in post-war filmmaking, disappears soundlessly into the building.

From his rectory at the Regina Coeli church in the upstate New York town of Hyde Park, LeBar is more open about his calling. 'It's not a question of whether I like it or not,' he says. 'It's what I've been asked to do by the late Cardinal O'Connor.

'It's a compilation of things that happen in different real exorcisms; the levitation, the expectoration, the screaming. All of those things take place in every exorcism'. LeBar describes occasions in which his subjects do howl when sprayed with holy water and speak in languages they have never studied. 'Sometimes they have great strength and what we call clairvoyance.'</p> <p>Even the pea-green vomit is only an exaggeration.

'Before we would agree on an exorcism, we would have a psychological examination, a medical check-up and a psychiatric evaluation as well.'</p> <p>Many Christians remain unconvinced of a rise in 'Satanic' crime and are hostile to exorcism in such cases.

Last week it was revealed that the archdiocese of Chicago has secretly appointed a full-time exorcist to combat the rise in Satan-worship and what the Church insists is demonic possession. The unnamed exorcist will only speak through church officials to say that his task is 'to heal those afflicted by the Evil One'. From his rectory at the Regina Coeli church in the upstate New York town of Hyde Park, LeBar is more open about his calling. 'It's not a question of whether I like it or not,' he says. 'It's what I've been asked to do by the late Cardinal O'Connor. But I do find it an uplifting of my faith.' He is now preparing for his next exorcism a few weeks from now, but has been casting out demons for five years. His expertise has never been in such high demand, he says. Grey-haired and bespectacled, the 64-year-old looks a little like Max von Sydow, who plays the veteran exorcist in the film, and he insists that the exorcism scene in the movie is realistic. 'It pretty much shows what it can be like,' he says. 'It's a compilation of things that happen in different real exorcisms; the levitation, the expectoration, the screaming. All of those things take place in every exorcism'. LeBar describes occasions in which his subjects do howl when sprayed with holy water and speak in languages they have never studied. 'Sometimes they have great strength and what we call clairvoyance.' Even the pea-green vomit is only an exaggeration. 'In one or two cases, there has been an extraordinary amount of gagging,' he said. In one instance, he says, a 'victim' glided across the room on a chair, without touching the ground. LeBar receives 'several hundred' applications a year from the possessed or their relatives, but many will be dealt with by medical experts, he points out. 'Before we would agree on an exorcism, we would have a psychological examination, a medical check-up and a psychiatric evaluation as well.' Many Christians remain unconvinced of a rise in 'Satanic' crime and are hostile to exorcism in such cases. Near LeBar's church, Jeffrey Viktor, a sociologist, works at the Community College in Jamestown, where a supposedly 'possessed' man went on a rampage three Halloweens ago, spreading his Aids virus among teenage girls. He is scornful of America's gullibility about both possession and exorcism. In a book called The Satanic Panic, he says: 'There are juvenile delinquents who have killed and called themselves Satanists. More commonly, they commit less vicious crimes, like killing domestic animals or turning over tombstones. Teenagers may read about Satanism, do some hocus-pocus and call themselves Satanists. 'But sociologically speaking, a gang of juvenile delinquents does not constitute a religion.'",

      "trailText": "<p> In the mid-Fities when I was 14 or 15, I told my mother I was homosexual: that was the word, back then, homosexual, in its full satanic majesty, a combination of evil and sickness. </p>",

      "body": "<p> In the mid-Fities when I was 14 or 15, I told my mother I was homosexual: that was the word, back then, homosexual, in its full satanic majesty, a combination of evil and sickness. </p> <p>Of course, I'd learned the word from her. She was a psychologist. Throughout my early childhood, she'd been studying part-time for a master's degree in child psychology. Since I was not only her son but also her best friend, she confided everything she was learning about me - her live-in guinea pig - to me. </p> <p>When I was seven, my parents divorced. My mother had ordered my father to choose between her and his mistress (who doubled as his secretary); he chose the mistress. My mother was devastated. Although she had a giant capacity for reinterpreting every loss as a gain, even she couldn't find something positive in divorce. </p> <p>It was a good thing she'd taken that degree because now, at 45, she had to go to work to supplement her meagre alimony. She laboured long hours for low pay as a state psychologist in Illinois and Texas, administering IQ tests to hundreds of grade school students and even 'projective' tests (the Rorschach, the House-Tree-Person) to children suspected of being 'disturbed'. </p> <p>I was tested frequently. She, who was so often overwrought at home, given to rages or fits of weeping, would become strangely calm and professional when administering a test. Her hands would make smoothing gestures, her voice was lowered and given a story-telling sweetness ('Now, Eddie, could you tell me everything you see in this ink blot?'). I, too, was transformed when tested, but toward anxiety, since a psychological test was like an X-ray or a blood test, likely to reveal a lurking disease: hostility, perversion or craziness or, even worse, a low intelligence. </p> <p>There was nothing consistent or logical about my mother's thinking. She found me wise to the point of genius and often said she wanted to write a book about raising the Exceptional Child ('Let him take the lead - he will teach you what he wants to learn'). But then I was also half-crazy, dangerously unbalanced, 'borderline psychotic' with 'strong schizophrenic tendencies', suspiciously apt at imitating wisdom and understanding, a flatterer, a robot programmed to resemble a thinking, feeling human being.</p> <p> I'd read in one of my mother's psychological manuals a long entry on homosexuality that I could scarcely understand. But I did take in that whereas adult homosexuality was an entrenched ego disorder caused by an unresolved Oedipus complex and resulting in secondary narcissistic gains that were especially hard to uproot, in every early adolescence, the individual, the boy, passes through a homosexual stage that is perfectly normal, a brief swirl around the Scylla of orality and the Charybdis of anality before surging to the sunny, open seas of mature genitality. I could only hope that I was just passing through a phase. </p> <p>After I told her I was homosexual, my mother sent me to a Freudian psychiatrist for an evaluation. I had just read Oscar Wilde and was determined to be as brittle and brilliant as his characters. I sat on the edge of my chair, hectic red flowers blowing in my cheeks, and rattled on and on about my condition, my illness, which I was no more able to defend than Wilde could. </p> <p>The psychiatrist told my mother that I was 'unsalvageable', that I should be locked up and the key thrown away. My mother reported this scary judgment to me, and to my father, though I begged her not to. Of course, neither she nor I was capable of dismissing this diagnosis as a dangerously narrow-minded prejudice held by a banal little suburbanite in a brown suit. No, it came from a doctor and was as unquestionable as a diagnosis of diabetes or cancer. The doctor's level of sophistication or humanity was irrelevant. I began to read books about psychoanalysis - Freud himself, especially The Introduction to Psychoanalysis and The Interpretation of Dreams, but also the softer, less pessimistic American adaptations of his thought by Erich Fromm. I couldn't find much about homosexuality in any book, but enough to know it was sterile, inauthentic, endlessly repetitious and infantile. </p> <p>Somewhere, I came across the theory that homosexuality was caused by an absent father and a suffocating mother. Perhaps my mother had been the one to suggest that my father's absence had queered me, for she was always eager to work out the multiple ways in which his desertion had harmed us all. </p> <p>Eventually, I asked my father to send me to a shrink. The father of a schoolfriend was a psychiatrist who recommended me to James Clark Moloney. </p> <p>I had no idea what to expect at Dr Moloney's practice in a Detroit suburb, but I certainly thought he'd be a small man with a varnished pate and an inky comb-over, many books (some in German) and in his waiting-room the sorry smell of old tobacco. I was in no way prepared for the cages of shrieking birds, the Papuan deities and, in the garden as seen through a plate-glass window, a gilt statue of a meditating bodhisattva. I fancied myself a Buddhist but of the austere Theravada sort, and I sniffed at Dr Moloney's idolatry, even though I'd come here precisely because I sought a compassionate intercessor, a bodhisattva of my own. </p> <p>He had a leonine mane of white hair, a bulbous nose with a sore on one side, close to the tip, which he kept vaguely clawing at, as an old dog will half-heartedly try to free itself of its collar. He wore sandals on big, yellow-nailed feet, shapeless trousers held up with a rope, a short-sleeved Hawaiian shirt. He licked his lips constantly. He made me feel very prim, especially since I'd put on my favourite Brooks Brothers suit. </p> <p>Moloney had but one master theory and he proposed it to everyone as an answer to every ill. He believed in the introjected mother. Every infant has the right to expect and enjoy unconditional love from his mother, at full throttle and all the time. Modern women, however, are deformed by societal inhibitions and their own deprivations as children. They are incapable of giving complete, nourishing love; when I told Dr Moloney that my mother hadn't breast-fed me because she had inverted nipples, he slapped his knees, let out a great cry and leapt to his feet. 'You see!' </p> <p>The emotionally starved, alienated child decides to mother himself. The faint, elusive image of his mother's face and warmth he incorporates into his inner pantheon. Now he is no longer dependent on her vagaries and caprices. Now he can beam her up whenever he needs her. If he sucks his thumb, he is nursing himself. He has become a closed circuit - with only one crucial disadvantage: such total independence is virtually synonymous with madness. He has lost all vital connection to the outside world. </p> <p>When he thinks he has fallen in love with a real woman, in point of fact all he has done is to project his mother's imago on to a neutral screen. Since he's not relating to a real person in all her shifting specificity but instead to the fixed outlines of the introjected mother, he cannot interact with the flesh-and-blood woman. As an infant, he learned how dangerous it was to open up to an actual, autonomous Other. I was taught all this during my very first hour with Dr Moloney - or rather my first 90 minutes, since he was eager to prove to me he was not like one of those goddamn tightass Freudians with their finicky, fucking 50-minute hours. He also needed to lay out his entire theory during our first encounter so that it could begin to sink in. </p> <p>As I learned in session after session, Dr Moloney had served in the Pacific as an army doctor. There, in Okinawa, he had observed that infants were fearless and happy because they never left their mother's side; they were carried everywhere, papoose-style, bound to their mother's back, their heads looking out above hers - 'that way they feel united to her but in charge'. Moloney loved to insult my parents ('Don't think I'm a castrating asshole like your father, an anal perfectionist...') and believed he could give me the unconditional love that he thought I craved and that his version of my mother had denied me. He would often interrupt me to say: 'I love you, goddamn it.' His eyes would fill with tears and he'd idly pick at his infected nose or come at the sore on his forehead from above, fat fingers stretching down, his elbow cocked to the ceiling. But on some days he had to search for my name. </p> <p>As best I could figure out, he'd had a more conventional past, reflected in his first, unimpeachably Freudian book, but now he'd become cracked over the introjected mother and the Okinawan papoose cure. He wore heavy turquoise and silver bracelets, black amulets on his hairy chest and lived surrounded by bobbing, chiming deities from the Pacific, Asia and Africa (Freud had inaugurated this taste for carved African statues, as photos of his Vienna cabinet revealed). </p> <p>The other Freudian remnant was the couch. As I lay on it, Moloney, out of sight behind me, took notes (or wrote something, perhaps one of his pamphlets). I could hear him back there at his desk coughing or rummaging around for something or scratching with his pen. More than once, I caught him dozing. That he was asleep changed his preceding silence in my eyes from a sharp, therapeutic instrument into an obtuse abnegation. I bored him. This man who claimed to love me was zoning out on me. 'I know what you're thinking,' he shouted. 'You're probably mad as hell. And you have a right to be. You have a right to unqualified love. No time limits, no lapses, eternal, unqualified love. But even Homer nods. The baby squalls, and he's completely in his rights. If I were perfect - and you deserve perfection, it's your birthright.' Here he got confused and scratched his nose. </p> <p>He considered my tendency to over-intellectualise one of my most serious defences. If I disagreed with one of his interpretations, he'd laugh, show his small white teeth and say: 'If you go on winning every argument this way you'll soon enough lose every chance at happiness. No one around here doubts your intelligence. It's just that I want you to break out of your closed circuit and touch another living human being, goddamn it.' And here he groped for my name before sketching in a feeble gesture that ended in a shrug. I learned to question all my impulses, to second-guess my motives, to ascribe a devious, unconscious purpose to my most unobjectionable actions. If I had a dream about making love to Marilyn Monroe, Moloney would interpret it as a 'flight into health', a ruse I'd invented to throw him off my track by appearing normal, cured. 'In this dream, I'm Marilyn Monroe,' he'd say, perfectly seriously. 'Like her I have long hair, a wide mouth, I'm voluptuously put together.'</p> <p> I saw Moloney three times a week during my last two years at school but I could never get him to concentrate on my homosexuality. 'You'll see, old boy,' he'd assure me, 'Once we clear away the psychic underbrush all that will wither away.' He wasn't even very interested in my sexual adventures at school and elsewhere, though he warned me that 'excessive acting out' would make me less sensitive to treatment. If I entered into detail about my love for a teacher or my sexual bribery of a football star, he'd wave his hand as if brushing cobwebs out of his face and say: 'Spare me, spare me.' When I asked him if smoking marijuana was dangerous, he assured me it led directly to heroin addiction. </p> <p>The only moment when Moloney would truly pay attention to me was when I reported a dream to him. He was Freudian, I suppose, in believing that a dream was 'the royal road to the unconscious'. Now I agree with an Italian doctor friend who ascribes the primacy of dreams in Freud's system to the Viennese habit of eating cheese after dinner. Like Freud, Moloney felt that one of the analyst's main tools is picking through the transference. Freud, however, insists that the patient must know nothing concrete about the analyst, so that it will be clear even to him that he has invented everything and attributed it to the doctor. In the classic Freudian transference, the analysand recreates with his analyst his damaging relationship with his parents; when he recognises that the doctor has done nothing at all to justify such wrath, resentment or fear, he is forced to admit (and abandon) his habit of endlessly 'projecting' bad motives and harmful feelings on to everyone around him. </p> <p>With Moloney, however, the experiment was compromised. Because he constantly chattered about himself I did know a lot about him, which I had the right to interpret as I saw fit. He might say: 'Stop projecting!' but only his authority lent credibility to such an objection. He was my first shrink, I had nothing to compare him to and he was my only chance of becoming a heterosexual, of ending the terrible suffering I was enduring as an outcast. He told me so himself; he was certain he was the only qualified doctor around. I contemplated suicide more than once. </p> <p>Moloney convinced me that I should not go away for school (I had been accepted at Harvard) but should attend a nearby state university so that I could continue my sessions with him. He had close to 50 patients now and was seeing them from six in the morning till midnight, seven days a week. To stay awake, he was swallowing handfuls of Dexedrine and then coming down in the evening with constant swigs of bourbon. I'd drive every week the 50 miles from Ann Arbor into Detroit in a borrowed car. I'd have the 11pm hour, when Moloney was smiley and drunk, then I'd sleep on the analytic couch and awaken him, with great difficulty, for the 6am session. I'd have to blast him out of bed by playing his favourite record, 'There Is Nothing Like a Dame'. </p> <p>His own life was beginning to come apart, he told me. He'd fallen in love with a patient who was seriously ill and he'd left his wife for her. But then, when his wife was diagnosed with a terminal illness, he'd gone back to her. Now his wife was dead and the patient was in a mental hospital. </p> <p>Moloney seemed more and more disoriented. He was often confused, no longer just the overworked, sometimes indifferent, forgetful doctor but someone obviously lost. He'd aged quickly. He forgot to shave and sometimes he smelled of hangover. His hands trembled and he no longer took notes. His old bravado still hung from him in rags, as if he were a scarecrow in a field the farmer had let go fallow. I was bitter because I saw I had sacrificed my academic career to him, to the forsaken prospect of being cured. At the same time, I felt a deep affection for him, because he was vulnerable and hurt. </p> <p>I discovered that despite his medical training and his years of psychoanalytic experience, he was sure that there was nothing in a male homosexual that couldn't be straightened out by a good woman - or even just a woman. I decided to break with him but when I thought of driving into Birmingham to tell him, my unconscious invented several excuses. My eyes swelled up - 'angio-neurotic oedema' was Moloney's diagnosis over the phone: 'skin rage'. He added: 'The baby is swelling up like a poisonous toad in order to scare off the Good Mother, me, in this case.' My foot became swollen and infected; I was hospitalised in the school infirmary. </p> <p>At last, I decided I'd never get well until I broke with Moloney. When I limped into his office, I saw that the sore on his nose had become the size of a quarter and he'd let his brows grow so shaggy that they half covered his eyes. Through this white fringe, he looked out at me with huge, red eyes. For some reason I thought of a white plant feasting on shadow and decay - a mushroom. </p> <p>'I'm leaving you,' I said, my voice hard and unsteady. 'I can't go on seeing you. It's not working out.' I had prepared many arguments but I didn't need them. Moloney said: 'You're right. I think you're right.' </p> <p>I was never sure of what became of him. One of his old patients said he had given up his practice and moved to Mexico. Another said he'd lost his mind and been confined to an asylum. </p> <p> After him, I had an orthodox Freudian from Vienna who'd renamed herself Alice Chester. At least her name didn't really go with her heavy German accent and her Jewishness; I invented a difficult war for her, possibly a concentration camp. I probably invented her Jewishness as well as her name change. I knew nothing about her except that she was a small, heavy-lidded woman who smiled with an irony that seemed at once exhausted and twinkly, if that's possible. She almost never 'offered an interpretation'. I knew from my reading that a strict Freudian, the sort I'd been longing to see, didn't offer interpretations during the first half-year of treatment. Although I was analysed by her for two years, she never said much. I longed for a detailed reconstruction of my infancy and childhood, week by week, but she never delivered. Sometimes, I feared she didn't really understand English; her constant, ironic smile could just as well have been benign incomprehension or a frightened camouflage of her ignorance. </p> <p>Once, when I was talking about how I 'identified' with Harry Haller, the suicidal hero of Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf , she exhaled smoke, then suddenly lit up with recognition and eagerly exclaimed, ' Ach! Der Steppenwolf! ' She nodded vigorously and smiled hugely. The air was juicy with the explosive German words. </p> <p>How she must have missed Vienna as she sat there in her tidy little house in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, a thousand miles from the nearest caf\u00e9. How she must have resented that dim, larval life of Detroit, to which irony or self-consciousness would have seemed as irrelevant and unusable as jalape\u00f1os in Cracow. I sometimes told friends at school that my shrink was a member of 'the original Vienna Circle', as if she'd worked with Freud himself, which was just possible chronologically if she was as old as the century (I had no idea of her age). </p> <p>Once she said she thought my school friends sounded as if they were self-amused and non-relating, which I instantly repeated with whoops of exaggerated laughter to them. For I'd discovered a few other gay guys in Ann Arbor and I regaled them with stories about my shrink. They'd hold their sides, weep with merriment and shout: ' Ach! Der Steppenwolf !' We thought we were terminally sophisticated.</p> <p> When I graduated and moved to New York in 1962, I was too poor to afford a psychoanalyst. I was no longer on my father's payroll. Besides, I was too immersed in Greenwich Village gay life to want to be cured right away. Two years later, however, I was back in psychotherapy, this time with Frances Alexander, a PhD psychologist who conducted groups and practised something called 'transactional therapy'. At that time, in 1965, even sophisticates had not yet learned to ridicule 'New Age' or 'California feel-good' systems. I never read the bestselling book on which that system (now forgotten) was based, but apparently it labelled most exchanges between people according to a fairly limited taxonomy of games or transactions. </p> <p>Therapy, as best I could tell from our group sessions, was aimed at unmasking these strategies in order to force the participants to return to (or invent) a sincere, heartfelt communication of feeling. We learned not to play the martyr ('Poor Me!' another client would cry out triumphantly), nor to invoke authority, nor to induce guilt in others, nor to cloak our healthy anger in humble depression ('Let it out, goddamn it!'). Freudian psychoanalysis, with its high fees, its glacial slowness, its obsession with childhood sexuality, incest, dreams, the unconscious, the patriarch, the anus, with its arrogant conviction that the patient should be kept ignorant of its methods and theories, was already foundering, challenged by the more democratic group therapy and its principle of every man his own shrink. </p> <p>And then Stonewall came along, the uprising in Greenwich Village in June 1969, which announced the beginning of gay liberation. Feminism, the sexual revolution and the Vietnam War protests were in full force. It was just a matter of moments before the cards were reshuffled and someone shouted 'Gay is good,' to make a grand slam with 'Black is beautiful'. </p> <p>Not immediately but soon enough, Freudian psychology went up in flames and became no more powerful or present than the smell of ashes in a cold fireplace the morning after. Most of the problems Freudianism had addressed were no longer experienced as an individual need to adapt to conventions, but as conventions that needed to adapt to individuals. Everyone asserted his or her rights. In the Fifties, people had been ashamed to admit they were inadequate; in the Sixties, they became proud to announce they were victims. Psychoanalysis had been addressed to shame culture; identity politics addressed a culture of complaint. Rilke had said: 'You must change yourself!' but now people said: 'Everyone else must change.' </p> <p>In the mid-Seventies, during an unhappy love affair, I sought help from Charles Silverstein, a gay psychotherapist. He was one of the psychologists who had led the so-called 'nomenclature' battle in the American Psychological Association. A band of gay therapists had convinced the larger organisation to reclassify homosexuality as falling within the normal range of behaviour instead of as being an ego disorder. Just by going to him, I'd already scrambled all the rules of the game; now I wanted to be a happy gay rather than a rehabilitated homosexual. </p> <p>Charles was as eccentric as Dr Moloney had been but not at all crazy. Charles was fat and chain-smoked, wore sandals and sloppy clothes and, of course, he had the usual carved African deities in his West Side living-room. He was pleasant but made no protestations of love. Love was irrelevant, which seemed more honest. For the first time, I'd found a shrink who listened with what I might call a fresh ear. </p> <p>He seemed to have few preconceived ideas. When I complained of low self-esteem, he had me look in a mirror and list all my weak points and strong points; I was shocked to find out the strengths were twice as numerous. Sexual dysfunctions he approached in a straightforward behaviourist fashion - he refused to psychologise them. </p> <p>For the more mysterious regions of the psyche, he traced out surprising new cause-and-effect relationships, tailor-made to me. I'd imagine I'd ended one subject (my father's death) and begun another (writer's block), but he'd show how the first caused the second. He taught me the ways in which internalised homophobia had left its traces all over me, like a lapdog's muddy footprints on clean sheets. He gave a strong impression that he didn't see himself as an authority, much less as a judge, but rather as a technician, someone who could put his professional training at my disposal. The possibility of transference was never discussed. </p> <p>He was a Gestalt psychologist. I never figured out what that meant except in dream interpretation. Where someone like Alice Chester would interpret the props and personages in a dream as stand-ins for real events and people, Silverstein saw each element in the dream as one part of the personality interacting with every other. He'd invite me to be the sail and the compass, the sun and the shark, and to speak for them. The dialogue felt more complex and representative, even if in the end it was just as arbitrary. </p> <p> Two decades later, in the fall of 1993, I started seeing my last or at least latest shrink. My young French lover, Hubert Sorin, was dying. I found a gay American therapist, Rik Gitlin, who hailed from San Francisco. Although I had been living in Paris for a decade I didn't want a French psychoanalyst. I despised Lacan, France's answer to Freud, a charlatan who counted his money while his patients talked and who invented the 20-minute 'hour' and felt authorised to reduce it to five minutes if the spirit so moved him, probably so he could cram in an even more lucrative turnover. I wanted to talk to my own kind of funny, disabused American gay man, someone who would laugh when I laughed and who developed his ideas by moving from anecdote to anecdote. </p> <p>Rik was perfect. He was in his thirties, cute, bright, respectful (I was nearly twice his age). We sat in good chairs and looked at each other; the couch had been relegated to the Freudian attic. He took notes after each session and kept track of my numerous friends, as complicated as those cast lists that used to appear at the beginning of nineteenth-century Russian novels. Rik was one of the 'What-I'm-hearing-is-a-certain-amount-of-shame' school of therapy in which the psychologist peers through the client's social smiles and ironic demurrals to discern the stark outlines of his real feelings, often the opposite of those he intends to convey. This method depends on sound instincts, a nearly canine perception of signals pitched above the ordinary range of human hearing. Rik was gifted with this sort of sensitivity. He was also very companionable. </p> <p>When I reflect upon my life, which has been touched by psychotherapy in every decade, I realise that during my youth, Freudianism was my main form of intellectuality, a severe, engrossing discipline too devoid of comforting to serve as a substitute for religion. Freudianism developed in me an interest in the individual and his or her sexual development and a strong sense that the progression from one stage to another could go in only one direction in someone healthy. </p> <p>The 'residue' of this indoctrination was a narrow, normative view of humanity. But when I came to reject Freudianism in my late twenties, I replaced it with its opposite - an interest in groups rather than individuals, a morality that was situationist rather than absolute, and a rejection of every urge to 'totalise,' if that means to submit experience to one master theory. Psychoanalysis did leave me with a few beliefs, including the conviction that everyone is worthy of years and years of intense scrutiny, not a bad credo for a novelist. </p> <p>I remember that Nabokov (or one of his characters) argues that Freud thought we admire a woman's hair because we desire her body, whereas the truth is we want to sleep with her because we're so awestruck by her beautiful hair. A novelist can work with Nabokov's insight because it respects the details, the sensuous surface, of experience, but not with Freud's, which is arid and reductive. I sought out therapy when I was deeply unhappy, driven by desires I wanted to eradicate because I felt they were infantile, grotesque, damaging and isolating. I was never cured, but society changed and redefined homosexuality as an orientation that was acceptable, or nearly so. </p> <p> This is an edited version of Edmund White's essay, 'Shrinks', which appears in this month's issue of Granta.

      "bodyText": "In the mid-Fities when I was 14 or 15, I told my mother I was homosexual: that was the word, back then, homosexual, in its full satanic majesty, a combination of evil and sickness. Of course, I'd learned the word from her. She was a psychologist. Throughout my early childhood, she'd been studying part-time for a master's degree in child psychology. Since I was not only her son but also her best friend, she confided everything she was learning about me - her live-in guinea pig - to me. When I was seven, my parents divorced. My mother had ordered my father to choose between her and his mistress (who doubled as his secretary); he chose the mistress. My mother was devastated. Although she had a giant capacity for reinterpreting every loss as a gain, even she couldn't find something positive in divorce. It was a good thing she'd taken that degree because now, at 45, she had to go to work to supplement her meagre alimony. She laboured long hours for low pay as a state psychologist in Illinois and Texas, administering IQ tests to hundreds of grade school students and even 'projective' tests (the Rorschach, the House-Tree-Person) to children suspected of being 'disturbed'. I was tested frequently. She, who was so often overwrought at home, given to rages or fits of weeping, would become strangely calm and professional when administering a test. Her hands would make smoothing gestures, her voice was lowered and given a story-telling sweetness ('Now, Eddie, could you tell me everything you see in this ink blot?'). I, too, was transformed when tested, but toward anxiety, since a psychological test was like an X-ray or a blood test, likely to reveal a lurking disease: hostility, perversion or craziness or, even worse, a low intelligence. There was nothing consistent or logical about my mother's thinking. She found me wise to the point of genius and often said she wanted to write a book about raising the Exceptional Child ('Let him take the lead - he will teach you what he wants to learn'). But then I was also half-crazy, dangerously unbalanced, 'borderline psychotic' with 'strong schizophrenic tendencies', suspiciously apt at imitating wisdom and understanding, a flatterer, a robot programmed to resemble a thinking, feeling human being. I'd read in one of my mother's psychological manuals a long entry on homosexuality that I could scarcely understand. But I did take in that whereas adult homosexuality was an entrenched ego disorder caused by an unresolved Oedipus complex and resulting in secondary narcissistic gains that were especially hard to uproot, in every early adolescence, the individual, the boy, passes through a homosexual stage that is perfectly normal, a brief swirl around the Scylla of orality and the Charybdis of anality before surging to the sunny, open seas of mature genitality. I could only hope that I was just passing through a phase. After I told her I was homosexual, my mother sent me to a Freudian psychiatrist for an evaluation. I had just read Oscar Wilde and was determined to be as brittle and brilliant as his characters. I sat on the edge of my chair, hectic red flowers blowing in my cheeks, and rattled on and on about my condition, my illness, which I was no more able to defend than Wilde could. The psychiatrist told my mother that I was 'unsalvageable', that I should be locked up and the key thrown away. My mother reported this scary judgment to me, and to my father, though I begged her not to. Of course, neither she nor I was capable of dismissing this diagnosis as a dangerously narrow-minded prejudice held by a banal little suburbanite in a brown suit. No, it came from a doctor and was as unquestionable as a diagnosis of diabetes or cancer. The doctor's level of sophistication or humanity was irrelevant. I began to read books about psychoanalysis - Freud himself, especially The Introduction to Psychoanalysis and The Interpretation of Dreams, but also the softer, less pessimistic American adaptations of his thought by Erich Fromm. I couldn't find much about homosexuality in any book, but enough to know it was sterile, inauthentic, endlessly repetitious and infantile. Somewhere, I came across the theory that homosexuality was caused by an absent father and a suffocating mother. Perhaps my mother had been the one to suggest that my father's absence had queered me, for she was always eager to work out the multiple ways in which his desertion had harmed us all. Eventually, I asked my father to send me to a shrink. The father of a schoolfriend was a psychiatrist who recommended me to James Clark Moloney. I had no idea what to expect at Dr Moloney's practice in a Detroit suburb, but I certainly thought he'd be a small man with a varnished pate and an inky comb-over, many books (some in German) and in his waiting-room the sorry smell of old tobacco. I was in no way prepared for the cages of shrieking birds, the Papuan deities and, in the garden as seen through a plate-glass window, a gilt statue of a meditating bodhisattva. I fancied myself a Buddhist but of the austere Theravada sort, and I sniffed at Dr Moloney's idolatry, even though I'd come here precisely because I sought a compassionate intercessor, a bodhisattva of my own. He had a leonine mane of white hair, a bulbous nose with a sore on one side, close to the tip, which he kept vaguely clawing at, as an old dog will half-heartedly try to free itself of its collar. He wore sandals on big, yellow-nailed feet, shapeless trousers held up with a rope, a short-sleeved Hawaiian shirt. He licked his lips constantly. He made me feel very prim, especially since I'd put on my favourite Brooks Brothers suit. Moloney had but one master theory and he proposed it to everyone as an answer to every ill. He believed in the introjected mother. Every infant has the right to expect and enjoy unconditional love from his mother, at full throttle and all the time. Modern women, however, are deformed by societal inhibitions and their own deprivations as children. They are incapable of giving complete, nourishing love; when I told Dr Moloney that my mother hadn't breast-fed me because she had inverted nipples, he slapped his knees, let out a great cry and leapt to his feet. 'You see!' The emotionally starved, alienated child decides to mother himself. The faint, elusive image of his mother's face and warmth he incorporates into his inner pantheon. Now he is no longer dependent on her vagaries and caprices. Now he can beam her up whenever he needs her. If he sucks his thumb, he is nursing himself. He has become a closed circuit - with only one crucial disadvantage: such total independence is virtually synonymous with madness. He has lost all vital connection to the outside world. When he thinks he has fallen in love with a real woman, in point of fact all he has done is to project his mother's imago on to a neutral screen. Since he's not relating to a real person in all her shifting specificity but instead to the fixed outlines of the introjected mother, he cannot interact with the flesh-and-blood woman. As an infant, he learned how dangerous it was to open up to an actual, autonomous Other. I was taught all this during my very first hour with Dr Moloney - or rather my first 90 minutes, since he was eager to prove to me he was not like one of those goddamn tightass Freudians with their finicky, fucking 50-minute hours. He also needed to lay out his entire theory during our first encounter so that it could begin to sink in. As I learned in session after session, Dr Moloney had served in the Pacific as an army doctor. There, in Okinawa, he had observed that infants were fearless and happy because they never left their mother's side; they were carried everywhere, papoose-style, bound to their mother's back, their heads looking out above hers - 'that way they feel united to her but in charge'. Moloney loved to insult my parents ('Don't think I'm a castrating asshole like your father, an anal perfectionist...') and believed he could give me the unconditional love that he thought I craved and that his version of my mother had denied me. He would often interrupt me to say: 'I love you, goddamn it.' His eyes would fill with tears and he'd idly pick at his infected nose or come at the sore on his forehead from above, fat fingers stretching down, his elbow cocked to the ceiling. But on some days he had to search for my name. As best I could figure out, he'd had a more conventional past, reflected in his first, unimpeachably Freudian book, but now he'd become cracked over the introjected mother and the Okinawan papoose cure. He wore heavy turquoise and silver bracelets, black amulets on his hairy chest and lived surrounded by bobbing, chiming deities from the Pacific, Asia and Africa (Freud had inaugurated this taste for carved African statues, as photos of his Vienna cabinet revealed). The other Freudian remnant was the couch. As I lay on it, Moloney, out of sight behind me, took notes (or wrote something, perhaps one of his pamphlets). I could hear him back there at his desk coughing or rummaging around for something or scratching with his pen. More than once, I caught him dozing. That he was asleep changed his preceding silence in my eyes from a sharp, therapeutic instrument into an obtuse abnegation. I bored him. This man who claimed to love me was zoning out on me. 'I know what you're thinking,' he shouted. 'You're probably mad as hell. And you have a right to be. You have a right to unqualified love. No time limits, no lapses, eternal, unqualified love. But even Homer nods. The baby squalls, and he's completely in his rights. If I were perfect - and you deserve perfection, it's your birthright.' Here he got confused and scratched his nose. He considered my tendency to over-intellectualise one of my most serious defences. If I disagreed with one of his interpretations, he'd laugh, show his small white teeth and say: 'If you go on winning every argument this way you'll soon enough lose every chance at happiness. No one around here doubts your intelligence. It's just that I want you to break out of your closed circuit and touch another living human being, goddamn it.' And here he groped for my name before sketching in a feeble gesture that ended in a shrug. I learned to question all my impulses, to second-guess my motives, to ascribe a devious, unconscious purpose to my most unobjectionable actions. If I had a dream about making love to Marilyn Monroe, Moloney would interpret it as a 'flight into health', a ruse I'd invented to throw him off my track by appearing normal, cured. 'In this dream, I'm Marilyn Monroe,' he'd say, perfectly seriously. 'Like her I have long hair, a wide mouth, I'm voluptuously put together.' I saw Moloney three times a week during my last two years at school but I could never get him to concentrate on my homosexuality. 'You'll see, old boy,' he'd assure me, 'Once we clear away the psychic underbrush all that will wither away.' He wasn't even very interested in my sexual adventures at school and elsewhere, though he warned me that 'excessive acting out' would make me less sensitive to treatment. If I entered into detail about my love for a teacher or my sexual bribery of a football star, he'd wave his hand as if brushing cobwebs out of his face and say: 'Spare me, spare me.' When I asked him if smoking marijuana was dangerous, he assured me it led directly to heroin addiction. The only moment when Moloney would truly pay attention to me was when I reported a dream to him. He was Freudian, I suppose, in believing that a dream was 'the royal road to the unconscious'. Now I agree with an Italian doctor friend who ascribes the primacy of dreams in Freud's system to the Viennese habit of eating cheese after dinner. Like Freud, Moloney felt that one of the analyst's main tools is picking through the transference. Freud, however, insists that the patient must know nothing concrete about the analyst, so that it will be clear even to him that he has invented everything and attributed it to the doctor. In the classic Freudian transference, the analysand recreates with his analyst his damaging relationship with his parents; when he recognises that the doctor has done nothing at all to justify such wrath, resentment or fear, he is forced to admit (and abandon) his habit of endlessly 'projecting' bad motives and harmful feelings on to everyone around him. With Moloney, however, the experiment was compromised. Because he constantly chattered about himself I did know a lot about him, which I had the right to interpret as I saw fit. He might say: 'Stop projecting!' but only his authority lent credibility to such an objection. He was my first shrink, I had nothing to compare him to and he was my only chance of becoming a heterosexual, of ending the terrible suffering I was enduring as an outcast. He told me so himself; he was certain he was the only qualified doctor around. I contemplated suicide more than once. Moloney convinced me that I should not go away for school (I had been accepted at Harvard) but should attend a nearby state university so that I could continue my sessions with him. He had close to 50 patients now and was seeing them from six in the morning till midnight, seven days a week. To stay awake, he was swallowing handfuls of Dexedrine and then coming down in the evening with constant swigs of bourbon. I'd drive every week the 50 miles from Ann Arbor into Detroit in a borrowed car. I'd have the 11pm hour, when Moloney was smiley and drunk, then I'd sleep on the analytic couch and awaken him, with great difficulty, for the 6am session. I'd have to blast him out of bed by playing his favourite record, 'There Is Nothing Like a Dame'. His own life was beginning to come apart, he told me. He'd fallen in love with a patient who was seriously ill and he'd left his wife for her. But then, when his wife was diagnosed with a terminal illness, he'd gone back to her. Now his wife was dead and the patient was in a mental hospital. Moloney seemed more and more disoriented. He was often confused, no longer just the overworked, sometimes indifferent, forgetful doctor but someone obviously lost. He'd aged quickly. He forgot to shave and sometimes he smelled of hangover. His hands trembled and he no longer took notes. His old bravado still hung from him in rags, as if he were a scarecrow in a field the farmer had let go fallow. I was bitter because I saw I had sacrificed my academic career to him, to the forsaken prospect of being cured. At the same time, I felt a deep affection for him, because he was vulnerable and hurt. I discovered that despite his medical training and his years of psychoanalytic experience, he was sure that there was nothing in a male homosexual that couldn't be straightened out by a good woman - or even just a woman. I decided to break with him but when I thought of driving into Birmingham to tell him, my unconscious invented several excuses. My eyes swelled up - 'angio-neurotic oedema' was Moloney's diagnosis over the phone: 'skin rage'. He added: 'The baby is swelling up like a poisonous toad in order to scare off the Good Mother, me, in this case.' My foot became swollen and infected; I was hospitalised in the school infirmary. At last, I decided I'd never get well until I broke with Moloney. When I limped into his office, I saw that the sore on his nose had become the size of a quarter and he'd let his brows grow so shaggy that they half covered his eyes. Through this white fringe, he looked out at me with huge, red eyes. For some reason I thought of a white plant feasting on shadow and decay - a mushroom. 'I'm leaving you,' I said, my voice hard and unsteady. 'I can't go on seeing you. It's not working out.' I had prepared many arguments but I didn't need them. Moloney said: 'You're right. I think you're right.' I was never sure of what became of him. One of his old patients said he had given up his practice and moved to Mexico. Another said he'd lost his mind and been confined to an asylum. After him, I had an orthodox Freudian from Vienna who'd renamed herself Alice Chester. At least her name didn't really go with her heavy German accent and her Jewishness; I invented a difficult war for her, possibly a concentration camp. I probably invented her Jewishness as well as her name change. I knew nothing about her except that she was a small, heavy-lidded woman who smiled with an irony that seemed at once exhausted and twinkly, if that's possible. She almost never 'offered an interpretation'. I knew from my reading that a strict Freudian, the sort I'd been longing to see, didn't offer interpretations during the first half-year of treatment. Although I was analysed by her for two years, she never said much. I longed for a detailed reconstruction of my infancy and childhood, week by week, but she never delivered. Sometimes, I feared she didn't really understand English; her constant, ironic smile could just as well have been benign incomprehension or a frightened camouflage of her ignorance. Once, when I was talking about how I 'identified' with Harry Haller, the suicidal hero of Hermann Hesse's Steppenwolf , she exhaled smoke, then suddenly lit up with recognition and eagerly exclaimed, ' Ach! Der Steppenwolf! ' She nodded vigorously and smiled hugely. The air was juicy with the explosive German words. How she must have missed Vienna as she sat there in her tidy little house in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, a thousand miles from the nearest caf\u00e9. How she must have resented that dim, larval life of Detroit, to which irony or self-consciousness would have seemed as irrelevant and unusable as jalape\u00f1os in Cracow. I sometimes told friends at school that my shrink was a member of 'the original Vienna Circle', as if she'd worked with Freud himself, which was just possible chronologically if she was as old as the century (I had no idea of her age). Once she said she thought my school friends sounded as if they were self-amused and non-relating, which I instantly repeated with whoops of exaggerated laughter to them. For I'd discovered a few other gay guys in Ann Arbor and I regaled them with stories about my shrink. They'd hold their sides, weep with merriment and shout: ' Ach! Der Steppenwolf !' We thought we were terminally sophisticated. When I graduated and moved to New York in 1962, I was too poor to afford a psychoanalyst. I was no longer on my father's payroll. Besides, I was too immersed in Greenwich Village gay life to want to be cured right away.

And then Stonewall came along, the uprising in Greenwich Village in June 1969, which announced the beginning of gay liberation. Feminism, the sexual revolution and the Vietnam War protests were in full force. It was just a matter of moments before the cards were reshuffled and someone shouted 'Gay is good,' to make a grand slam with 'Black is beautiful'. Not immediately but soon enough, Freudian psychology went up in flames and became no more powerful or present than the smell of ashes in a cold fireplace the morning after. Most of the problems Freudianism had addressed were no longer experienced as an individual need to adapt to conventions, but as conventions that needed to adapt to individuals. Everyone asserted his or her rights. In the Fifties, people had been ashamed to admit they were inadequate; in the Sixties, they became proud to announce they were victims.

A band of gay therapists had convinced the larger organisation to reclassify homosexuality as falling within the normal range of behaviour instead of as being an ego disorder. Just by going to him, I'd already scrambled all the rules of the game; now I wanted to be a happy gay rather than a rehabilitated homosexual. Charles was as eccentric as Dr Moloney had been but not at all crazy. Charles was fat and chain-smoked, wore sandals and sloppy clothes and, of course, he had the usual carved African deities in his West Side living-room. He was pleasant but made no protestations of love. Love was irrelevant, which seemed more honest. For the first time, I'd found a shrink who listened with what I might call a fresh ear. He seemed to have few preconceived ideas. When I complained of low self-esteem, he had me look in a mirror and list all my weak points and strong points; I was shocked to find out the strengths were twice as numerous. Sexual dysfunctions he approached in a straightforward behaviourist fashion - he refused to psychologise them. For the more mysterious regions of the psyche, he traced out surprising new cause-and-effect relationships, tailor-made to me. I'd imagine I'd ended one subject (my father's death) and begun another (writer's block), but he'd show how the first caused the second. He taught me the ways in which internalised homophobia had left its traces all over me, like a lapdog's muddy footprints on clean sheets. He gave a strong impression that he didn't see himself as an authority, much less as a judge, but rather as a technician, someone who could put his professional training at my disposal. The possibility of transference was never discussed. He was a Gestalt psychologist. I never figured out what that meant except in dream interpretation. Where someone like Alice Chester would interpret the props and personages in a dream as stand-ins for real events and people, Silverstein saw each element in the dream as one part of the personality interacting with every other. He'd invite me to be the sail and the compass, the sun and the shark, and to speak for them. The dialogue felt more complex and representative, even if in the end it was just as arbitrary. Two decades later, in the fall of 1993, I started seeing my last or at least latest shrink. My young French lover, Hubert Sorin, was dying. I found a gay American therapist, Rik Gitlin, who hailed from San Francisco. Although I had been living in Paris for a decade I didn't want a French psychoanalyst. I despised Lacan, France's answer to Freud, a charlatan who counted his money while his patients talked and who invented the 20-minute 'hour' and felt authorised to reduce it to five minutes if the spirit so moved him, probably so he could cram in an even more lucrative turnover. I wanted to talk to my own kind of funny, disabused American gay man, someone who would laugh when I laughed and who developed his ideas by moving from anecdote to anecdote. Rik was perfect. He was in his thirties, cute, bright, respectful (I was nearly twice his age). We sat in good chairs and looked at each other; the couch had been relegated to the Freudian attic. He took notes after each session and kept track of my numerous friends, as complicated as those cast lists that used to appear at the beginning of nineteenth-century Russian novels. Rik was one of the 'What-I'm-hearing-is-a-certain-amount-of-shame' school of therapy in which the psychologist peers through the client's social smiles and ironic demurrals to discern the stark outlines of his real feelings, often the opposite of those he intends to convey. This method depends on sound instincts, a nearly canine perception of signals pitched above the ordinary range of human hearing. Rik was gifted with this sort of sensitivity. He was also very companionable. When I reflect upon my life, which has been touched by psychotherapy in every decade, I realise that during my youth, Freudianism was my main form of intellectuality, a severe, engrossing discipline too devoid of comforting to serve as a substitute for religion. Freudianism developed in me an interest in the individual and his or her sexual development and a strong sense that the progression from one stage to another could go in only one direction in someone healthy. The 'residue' of this indoctrination was a narrow, normative view of humanity. But when I came to reject Freudianism in my late twenties, I replaced it with its opposite - an interest in groups rather than individuals, a morality that was situationist rather than absolute, and a rejection of every urge to 'totalise,' if that means to submit experience to one master theory. Psychoanalysis did leave me with a few beliefs, including the conviction that everyone is worthy of years and years of intense scrutiny, not a bad credo for a novelist. I remember that Nabokov (or one of his characters) argues that Freud thought we admire a woman's hair because we desire her body, whereas the truth is we want to sleep with her because we're so awestruck by her beautiful hair. A novelist can work with Nabokov's insight because it respects the details, the sensuous surface, of experience, but not with Freud's, which is arid and reductive. I sought out therapy when I was deeply unhappy, driven by desires I wanted to eradicate because I felt they were infantile, grotesque, damaging and isolating. I was never cured, but society changed and redefined homosexuality as an orientation that was acceptable, or nearly so.

The disaster of the Dome, the grunge of traffic, the cost, the crime, the desolation living rough beneath its arches. Familiar fodder from familiar headlines. Moan, moan, moan (as my Spanish grandson says when he comes to visit). But here, by way of antidote, is something wonderful - 'the London of labyrinth, half of stone and half of flesh', the London Peter Ackroyd was born to write about. </p> <p>He calls it a 'biography' because there can be no steady march of history to 'this wilderness of alleys and passages': London is simply too various, too impossible to define, unless given half-human character. Yet, in truth, that formulation does not quite fit either. What we really have here are some 800 pages of excavation, anecdote, explanation and observation by a man who has come to cherish every sight and sound of the great metropolis which enfolds him. Variations on a theme called London. </p> <p>Does it always work? Inevitably not, especially in the earlier reaches when information itself is hard to come by. If you do not know where the very name of London came from - maybe Llyndon, the town by the stream; Laindon, the long hill; londos, the Celtic for 'fierce'? - you're doomed to patrol through the years of the Romans, Danes and Saxons in occasionally lumpen travelogue mode, making much out of little.

The disaster of the Dome, the grunge of traffic, the cost, the crime, the desolation living rough beneath its arches. Familiar fodder from familiar headlines. Moan, moan, moan (as my Spanish grandson says when he comes to visit). But here, by way of antidote, is something wonderful - 'the London of labyrinth, half of stone and half of flesh', the London Peter Ackroyd was born to write about. He calls it a 'biography' because there can be no steady march of history to 'this wilderness of alleys and passages': London is simply too various, too impossible to define, unless given half-human character. Yet, in truth, that formulation does not quite fit either. What we really have here are some 800 pages of excavation, anecdote, explanation and observation by a man who has come to cherish every sight and sound of the great metropolis which enfolds him. Variations on a theme called London. Does it always work? Inevitably not, especially in the earlier reaches when information itself is hard to come by. If you do not know where the very name of London came from - maybe Llyndon, the town by the stream; Laindon, the long hill; londos, the Celtic for 'fierce'? - you're doomed to patrol through the years of the Romans, Danes and Saxons in occasionally lumpen travelogue mode, making much out of little. Persevere, though, for as soon as Ackroyd sets foot in the past four centuries he is instantly at home, the master of diverting detail. Do you fancy a steak at Dolly's Chop-house in Paternoster Row, or a pie in the cook-shops of Porridge Island? A coffee with the artists at Old Slaughter's in St.Martin's Lane or with Tories and Jacobites at the Cocoa-Tree in Pall Mall?

I, too, remember that dwarf, and people gingerly crossing the road to give him wide berth, caught between amusement and embarrassment; but I could not, for the life of me, recall the time of his vanishing. Yet here he is again, returned as a part of the quintessential London, a memory to stand alongside those of Boswell, Hogarth or Defoe. So past and present conjoin. So this is much more than history; it is a tapestry of inspiration and love. Could such love letters be written to any city, anywhere in the world? Perhaps, in some measure: wherever there are throngs of humanity there is the richness of city life. But Ackroyd aims to go much further than that, to define London's uniqueness. 'It is not civilised or graceful... but tortuous, inexact and oppressive... It is a city built upon profit and speculation, not upon need, and no mayor or sovereign could withstand its organic will.' There you have it. Not Paris, grandly all of a piece. Not New York, where concrete is king, nor Los Angeles, where the freeways are arteries. The world is full of great cities, but London is different. It possesses that organic will. Take the South Bank in the past 10 years. Has central authority decreed the Tate Modern, the Globe, the wharfs and walkways of regeneration and reclamation right along the Thames? Hardly.

Yet more than anything else language is the anvil on which Scottish poetry and its 'flytings' (quarrels) have been forged. </p> <p>For a long time, the demise of Scots as a literary vehicle appeared to be historically inevitable and the poetry of Burns seemed like the last shower of sparks from a dying star. Scots received three blows from which it surely could never recover. The Church adopted the Authorised Version of the Bible; the union of the Crowns took the court and aristocratic patronage to London; and the union of the Parliaments, a century later in 1707, made English the language of government. </p> <p>Yet generations of artists have resisted assimilation, sometimes to the disapproval of their countrymen. When he published his anthology, The Northern Muse in 1924, that archetypal Scotsman-on-the-make, John Buchan, primly recommended that Scots poets should add 'only a word here or there' to provide a 'Northern tone'.</p> <p>The advice was essentially political, reflecting Buchan's unionism and anglophilia. In fact, Robert Louis Stevenson had already shown that using Scots did not inevitably mean sinking into the sentimental sump of the Kailyard and could sound perfectly natural. Later, Hugh MacDiarmid's Scots, filtered by a true ear for the speech of his native Langholm, acquired a higher octane by culling words from Jamieson's etymological dictionary. MacDiarmid reacted against Kailyard sentimentality, Burns idolatry and T. S. Eliot's assertion in 1919 that there was no such thing as Scottish literature. If none existed, it would be necessary to invent one. </p> <p>Oddly enough, in their mutual detestation of the mawkish school, MacDiarmid, the restless political extremist, and Buchan, the tireless lickspittle of the state, forged an unlikely literary alliance. </p> <p>Thus, three linguistic strains are instantly apparent. The first is standard English, perhaps with what Douglas Dunn called a 'Scottish intonation'. The second is English with a mild Scots additive according to the Buchan formula. The third is no-holds-barred Scots itself and even though scholars like David Murison, editor of the Scottish National Dictionary, argued that it was a language in its own right, with its own rules of spelling and grammar, it has, in practice, proved itself to be more plastic in the best and worst senses, more regionally fragmented and, occasionally, more dangerous. </p> <p>Writers like Burns and Robert Fergusson and, afterwards, Charles Murray and Robert Garioch, used a language resonant of the old self-confident Scots tongue. MacDiarmid's constructed poetic instrument in lesser hands degenerated into a language as artfully concocted as the Azed crossword and about as accessible. If the Kailyard was the unwanted consequence of Burns, then obscure verse is the downside of MacDiarmid, a kind of poetic bebop designed to make things difficult for the audience. Then there is the late twentieth-century flowering of the urban demotic, represented in this anthology by the diamond-hard poems of Tom Leonard. </p> <p>The language question gave rise to the bitterest dispute of the twentieth century, when Edwin Muir rejected MacDiarmid's advocacy of Scots as the instrument of renaissance, although MacDiarmid himself reverted to English when he immersed his poetry in science, politics and philosophy. Indeed, Muir mocked the idea that Scotland in itself was a concept strong enough to inspire a literature, dismissing Scott and Burns and the 'sham bards of a sham nation'.</p> <p>Then there is Gaelic, the language of the first Scottish kingdom. James Macpherson's spurious translations of Ossian briefly entranced Europe, but discredited the old bardic muse for generations to come. In the twentieth century, Sorley Maclean reasserted its often intensely local traditions, though one of his most powerful poems is about the death of a German soldier in the Desert War, where he himself was wounded. </p> <p>The anthology opens at the dawn of Scotland, with St Columba's 'Altus Prosator' (Maker on High, in Edwin Morgan's exuberant translation from the Latin). The editors, Robert Crawford, professor of modern Scottish literature at St Andrews, and Aberdeen-born Mick Imlah, poetry editor at the Times Literary Supplement, traverse the dominant peaks - William Dunbar, the Border Ballads, Burns, MacDiarmid and Muir. They even find a place for Byron, who was educated in Aberdeen. </p> <p>But they also offer some digressions. Douglas Young, when he compiled his own Scottish Verse 1851-1951, found those 100 years produced 'probably no more than six' poets of the higher order - John Davidson, Muir, MacDiarmid, Maclean, Sydney Goodsir Smith and George Campbell Hay.</p> <p>To the list of superior talents, a contemporary critic would add Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig and Douglas Dunn. But the anthology also includes curiosities, such as the Paisley poet Marion Bernstein, and William Topaz MacGonagall's paean to the Beautiful Bridge over the Silvery Tay.

      "bodyText": "The New Penguin Book of Scottish Verse edited by Robert Crawford and Mick Imlah Allen Lane, the Penguin Press \u00a320, pp554 Buy it at BOL What makes a poet Scottish comes down to voice and identity rather than linguistic choice. Yet more than anything else language is the anvil on which Scottish poetry and its 'flytings' (quarrels) have been forged. For a long time, the demise of Scots as a literary vehicle appeared to be historically inevitable and the poetry of Burns seemed like the last shower of sparks from a dying star. Scots received three blows from which it surely could never recover. The Church adopted the Authorised Version of the Bible; the union of the Crowns took the court and aristocratic patronage to London; and the union of the Parliaments, a century later in 1707, made English the language of government. Yet generations of artists have resisted assimilation, sometimes to the disapproval of their countrymen. When he published his anthology, The Northern Muse in 1924, that archetypal Scotsman-on-the-make, John Buchan, primly recommended that Scots poets should add 'only a word here or there' to provide a 'Northern tone'. The advice was essentially political, reflecting Buchan's unionism and anglophilia. In fact, Robert Louis Stevenson had already shown that using Scots did not inevitably mean sinking into the sentimental sump of the Kailyard and could sound perfectly natural. Later, Hugh MacDiarmid's Scots, filtered by a true ear for the speech of his native Langholm, acquired a higher octane by culling words from Jamieson's etymological dictionary. MacDiarmid reacted against Kailyard sentimentality, Burns idolatry and T. S. Eliot's assertion in 1919 that there was no such thing as Scottish literature. If none existed, it would be necessary to invent one. Oddly enough, in their mutual detestation of the mawkish school, MacDiarmid, the restless political extremist, and Buchan, the tireless lickspittle of the state, forged an unlikely literary alliance. Thus, three linguistic strains are instantly apparent. The first is standard English, perhaps with what Douglas Dunn called a 'Scottish intonation'. The second is English with a mild Scots additive according to the Buchan formula. The third is no-holds-barred Scots itself and even though scholars like David Murison, editor of the Scottish National Dictionary, argued that it was a language in its own right, with its own rules of spelling and grammar, it has, in practice, proved itself to be more plastic in the best and worst senses, more regionally fragmented and, occasionally, more dangerous. Writers like Burns and Robert Fergusson and, afterwards, Charles Murray and Robert Garioch, used a language resonant of the old self-confident Scots tongue. MacDiarmid's constructed poetic instrument in lesser hands degenerated into a language as artfully concocted as the Azed crossword and about as accessible. If the Kailyard was the unwanted consequence of Burns, then obscure verse is the downside of MacDiarmid, a kind of poetic bebop designed to make things difficult for the audience. Then there is the late twentieth-century flowering of the urban demotic, represented in this anthology by the diamond-hard poems of Tom Leonard. The language question gave rise to the bitterest dispute of the twentieth century, when Edwin Muir rejected MacDiarmid's advocacy of Scots as the instrument of renaissance, although MacDiarmid himself reverted to English when he immersed his poetry in science, politics and philosophy. Indeed, Muir mocked the idea that Scotland in itself was a concept strong enough to inspire a literature, dismissing Scott and Burns and the 'sham bards of a sham nation'. Then there is Gaelic, the language of the first Scottish kingdom. James Macpherson's spurious translations of Ossian briefly entranced Europe, but discredited the old bardic muse for generations to come. In the twentieth century, Sorley Maclean reasserted its often intensely local traditions, though one of his most powerful poems is about the death of a German soldier in the Desert War, where he himself was wounded. The anthology opens at the dawn of Scotland, with St Columba's 'Altus Prosator' (Maker on High, in Edwin Morgan's exuberant translation from the Latin). The editors, Robert Crawford, professor of modern Scottish literature at St Andrews, and Aberdeen-born Mick Imlah, poetry editor at the Times Literary Supplement, traverse the dominant peaks - William Dunbar, the Border Ballads, Burns, MacDiarmid and Muir. They even find a place for Byron, who was educated in Aberdeen. But they also offer some digressions. Douglas Young, when he compiled his own Scottish Verse 1851-1951, found those 100 years produced 'probably no more than six' poets of the higher order - John Davidson, Muir, MacDiarmid, Maclean, Sydney Goodsir Smith and George Campbell Hay. To the list of superior talents, a contemporary critic would add Edwin Morgan, Norman MacCaig and Douglas Dunn. But the anthology also includes curiosities, such as the Paisley poet Marion Bernstein, and William Topaz MacGonagall's paean to the Beautiful Bridge over the Silvery Tay. Crawford, with whom I exchanged emails, reasons that the 'crazed acoustic' of the self-styled tragedian, much mocked in Dundee when peddling his rhymes there, has achieved its own classic status. Another large issue in Scottish verse sets rural purity against urban stink. Poets like MacDiarmid and Muir were united, for once, in their detestation of Glasgow. Sorley Maclean also used that great city, melting pot of Highlanders, true-blue Lowland Protestants and Donegal Catholics, as a metaphor for corruption, rot and evil, drowning out Alexander Smith's earlier celebration of its 'noise and smoky breath'.

In this collection, Tom Leonard speaks pungently for the 'scruff' banished from the BBC's polite microphones. 'I remember being ashamed of my father/ when he whispered the words out loud/ reading the newspaper...'

She complains of loss of sleep, sense, good looks, conversation. A self-pitying whinge? On the contrary, her stories are shot through with love for children. It is complicated. She is saying: loving your children is not - cannot ever be - the whole story.

She writes about mothers with careers and without. She is not militant but gently judgmental. And her writing mutinies against its subject in a wonderful manner.

Her stories are - for those who, like me, recognise the truth in every word - like a reprieve. </p> <p>This is Simpson's third collection and her best. It is beautifully structured: some names recur in more than one story, suggesting the way our several lives are threaded together. The opening story, 'Lentils and Lilies', is about Jade, a young woman suffused with promise. She is determined never to 'go dead inside'. One moment she is 'moving like a panther into the long jewelled narrative which was her future'; the next, she is castigating her mother for being a career woman.</p> <p>At the end, Jade bumps into a struggling mother whose child has a lentil stuck up its nose.

The third person is Ben, a savage toddler with cafe-wrecking potential who does a good line in buoyantly insulting strangers. It is funny and awful. Neither of the women is working full time. One has gone 'freelance' - a euphemism for having given up. </p> <p>Sally's face is not so much described as diagnosed: 'This woman Sally has a drinker's face but her lustreless grey skin and saurian eye come not from alcohol but from prolonged lack of sleep.' The cafe with its cracked Formica, 'dead ham' and 'tired old tuna' shares their mood. The women's thoughts are conveyed in speechless italics. I felt glad and sorry not to be able to join them at their table. But they left me uneasy: for this is a book as much about what we owe to children as what we deserve ourselves. </p> <p>If this sounds pious or suggests that these are stories for tormented mothers only, then I have misrepresented them. Nobody who admires good writing should miss them. They are sharp, poetic and marvellously witty. And Simpson is at her funniest when circumstances forbid a smile. In the title story, Dorrie is struggling against the clock to get the children to school on time. She steps round them 'like a slave during a palace orgy'.</p> <p>As the adults become ever more jaded and unpreposessing, so, as if in direct response, the children thrive. They are resplendent, sensuous - well. Dorrie revels in her son: 'His chest was like a huge warm baroque pearl. She satined the side of her face against it for a moment...' It is Dorrie who fusses over the carrot sticks in her older son's lunchbox and gets told by him: 'Hey yeah right get a life!'</p> <p>Simpson writes just as well about those who have, officially at least, got 'a life'. She describes Dorrie's husband's feelings with sympathetic acuity and in 'Burns and the Bankers', she leaves home altogether for a dire night out. This is a mercilessly funny account of a corporate function. Simpson's ear for philistine and banal conversation is hilarious. But it is a story that works on many levels - and it is full of arrestingly incongrous moments such as the one in which a high-flying woman lawyer reflects in a way that would not disgrace Virginia Woolf on her failure to 'live inside the minute like a thin-skinned raindrop proud on a nasturtium leaf'. In the atmosphere of sexist jokes, empty banter, swinging kilts and haggis, this image seems to have come from another world. But that is typical Simpson.</p>",

But the sly echo of Germaine Greer's remark that: 'It has been my nightmare that Tolkien would turn out to be the most influential writer of the century' issues a challenge which nobody can quite ignore. </p> <p>For when The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit came out, many saw them as a stupendous irrelevance, a 'flight from reality', ignoring everything worthwhile in the modern novel. But others waited - for years - for (the difficult) The Silmarillion to appear, and all the other texts that emerged from material left when Tolkien died. </p> <p>For many in the Fifties to Seventies, Tolkien's imaginary world, despite passages of frankly weak writing, provided a diagnostic myth which, as myths do, simplified and intensified, and held contradictions in tension together.

But there is evidence of many Tolkien readers among that same group, and of a massive following among intelligent people of sensibility who simply read and trouble not their heads with theory or orthodoxy. So perhaps the 'Tolkien phenomenon', in fact, turns the tables: if theory cannot accommodate such works, then, perhaps, theories need revising. </p> <p>Indeed, Tolkien offered that challenge: the two essays on Beowulf and 'On Fairy Stories', to which Shippey gives proper weight, are arguably among the most important theoretical works of the last 60 years. They summarise his thinking about the nature of imaginative literature and its importance, how it transcends the fashion of the moment. While the academy, quite properly, theorises about what ought to be and has been, the imaginative and emotional needs served by the art of lying that is fiction must still be met. </p> <p>Shippey's witty, combative book is illuminating, especially on The Silmarillion. He also claims that Tolkien can be seen in the context of major developments in modernist fiction. Shippey argues the twentieth century's need for new myths, new maps of Hell, the world changed with the First World War, in which Tolkien fought, and ancient images of paradise lost provided by literary tradition were no longer viable for a writer marked by losing most of his friends in those terrible four years of industrialised warfare. You have, after that experience, to make and live your own myth and, if you are lucky, you can write about it. </p> <p>The central chapters demonstrate the ingenious articulation of the trilogy, the profundity of its thought about suffering, and evil, both personal and institutional, cosmic and frankly devilish: no allegory, as some tried reductively to decode it, for the problems of the Second World War, for the issues of nuclear deterrence, but something applicable to both, and to the then unimagined Vietnam, and to all struggles where Mordor so nearly wins. </p> <p>Tolkien, Shippey argues, was in an interesting dialectic between the Boethian view of evil, where it is, in the end, a privation of good, and the dualist or Manichean, where it is an active principle based on the corrupted will of sentient beings.

Do you dare set yourself above the likes of William 'It's you that I'm in it for' Hague who humbly affirm their wish to obey the vox populi .</p> <p>Many at the top try a prolier-than-thou style that has the advantage of turning critics into reactionary aristocrats, but there isn't an e-business billionaire or newspaper tycoon who can match the master, Jack Straw. The worst Home Secretary of the twentieth - and, if we're lucky, the twenty-first - century denounces his powerless opponents of his \u00e9litist plans to take power from the people as \u00e9litists themselves - and gets away with it.</p> <p>Straw and Lord [Gareth] Williams of Mostyn, the Attorney General, have been fighting for a year to deny citizens the right to elect to be tried by jury for assault, theft, burglary and other middle-ranking offences. All whose work includes handling money know that convictions for dishonesty brings the loss of reputation, whatever punishment the courts inflicts and the probable loss of their jobs. They will no longer have the power to insist that they are innocent until found guilty beyond reasonable doubt by a jury of their peers. By extension, about 80,000 people a year will no longer have the power to sit on juries and decide on the guilt or innocence of their neighbours. Power will flow to the growing number of professional stipendiary magistrates appointed in secret by Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor, who is in office because he was the patron of Tony Blair and Cherie Booth when they were young barristers on the make.</p> <p>Short of abolishing the franchise, it is hard to imagine a more \u00e9litist assault on popular rights. Yet Straw poses as the people's tribune whose rough but ready working-man's fists will smash the snobs until they bow to the will of the silent majority. Those who defend trial by jury were pampered 'BMW-driving civil liberties lawyers', he sneered. They lived in Hampstead and subscribed to a 'woolly-minded liberalism', which took 'no account of the situation of those who are less favoured than they'.</p> <p>He forgot to mention that at the last election he was the most louche limousine liberal in the land. 'Surely cutting down the right to jury trial ... is not only wrong but short-sighted,' he drawled in 1997 when Michael Howard proposed the assault on juries he was destined to ape. Tony Blair was no more in touch with the concerns of plain, decent folk. The poor little rich boy didn't understand that ordinary people love to be patronised but thought that 'fundamental rights to justice cannot be driven by administrative convenience'. Meanwhile Gareth Williams revealed himself to be the most isolated of Hampstead hermits when he said in 1993 that it was 'madness' to abolish juries.</p> <p>After all we've been through, these gentlemen's apostasy is no longer surprising. What has been remarkable is the speed with which Straw's and Williams's mendacity has been exposed. Straw began by claiming that his enemies were the forces of conservatism who opposed any change. Why when Roy Jenkins had introduced majority verdicts in the Sixties he had been attacked by the very types who were shouting at him today. Jenkins stood up in the House of Lords on 20 January. He had allowed juries to find a criminal guilty by a majority of 10 to two to stop them from being nobbled by gangsters, he said. He had protected juries, Straw was abolishing them. 'I cannot allow the Home Secretary to claim my endorsement for this ill-conceived little bill, so directly contrary to everything that he and his spokesman said in opposition.'</p> <p>The Scots did not have the right to ask for jury trial for assault and the like, continued Straw, why should the English and Welsh be different? The Scottish barrister and Labour peer Helena Kennedy made the obvious riposte in the Lords last month. Scotland has a separate legal system with its own safeguards. Straw was not proposing to introduce Scottish procurators fiscal and 'not proven' verdicts, rather he was collecting the most repressive features of different jurisdictions and pasting them together in a grim collage. In any case, English readers may say, who cares if the Scots arrange these matters differently? Aren't we meant to take a pride in Englishness and cherish what is best about us in this age of devolution? If there is anything in England better than the democratic right to be tried by your peers I have yet to find it.</p> <p>Williams opened a new front the other day when he sobbed that he wanted to protect victims from the delays jury trials bring to justice. With the exception of saints and masochists, victims want criminals to pay for their crimes. Yet when suspects opt for a jury trial and lose, Crown Court judges give far stiffer punishments than magistrates. The Home Office admits as much. The sav ings it predicts the nobbling of jurors will bring are based on the assumption that the cost of running our bulging prison system will fall as softer sentences are issued. Not much joy for victims there.</p> <p>The same objection meets Straw's claim that professional criminals are abusing the system by asking for a jury trial. Why would they court a longer stretch? Citizens who are not Napoleons of crime do. Some take the risk because they have been overcharged by an understaffed and not noticeably competent Crown Prosecution Service and agree to plead guilty when the Crown Court has made prosecutors agree to hit them with a lesser crime. Others are protesting their innocence and believe, as all of us believe, that a jury will give them a fairer trial.</p> <p>And so it goes on. Straw told the Commons on 7 March that his plan 'enjoys the active endorsement of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham'. Bingham revealed that a fortnight earlier he had sent a letter to the Home Secretary in which he wrote of his 'unease' about the 'dangers' of the legislation. Straw claimed that Professor Michael Zander, chairman of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, supported him. Zander said he did not. Straw said that 95 per cent of cases in Britain are heard by magistrates without a jury so there was no harm in slipping a few more trials in their direction. It was left to others to say that nearly all defendants plead guilty in magistrates courts and don't therefore need to bother a jury. If you're ever in trouble don't call the Home Secretary as a witness. There's not a jury in the country which would believe him.</p> <p>So disreputable has the Home Office's case become that when the Lords last threw out the measure, peers such as Melvyn Bragg, Clive Hollick, and Waheed Ali, who are usually dismissed as New Labour stooges, refused to support the Government. In the Commons, Straw has been forced to rely on the payroll vote and Scottish MPs to secure a majority.</p> <p>Everyone who opposes Straw and Williams says they are simply good boys obeying Treasury orders to save money. I'm sure that's true, but beneath the anti-\u00e9litist rhetoric lurks another motive - a scarcely concelaed anxiety about decisions being out of the hands of polite society.</p> <p>Authoritarian governments have always loathed juries. They can put justice before the letter of the law and by refusing, for example, to convict whistleblowers who have broken the Official Secrets Act. Lord Lipsey, a superior journalist turned New Labour peer, revealed establishment fears when he blurted out in February that blacks 'opt for jury trial in the hope that they will get an O.J. Simpson. What they hope is that there will be enough black jurors who are fundamentally hostile to the criminal justice system'.</p> <p>I suppose the only way to solve this shocking state of affairs is to ban all blacks from juries. Or perhaps the Government wants to go further and ban juries completely. Williams said last month that citizens who asked for juries were imposing an intolerable burden on the authorities. The courts were being bullied by the exercise of the 'defendant's diktat'. It was a revealing choice of words. Suspects facing charges which might ruin their lives were oppressors. The helpless state was the victim.</p> <p>A Conservative peer leapt up and rebuked him. The noble lord was Norman Tebbit. When a Labour Attorney General can be attacked from the Left by such a man you realise that Blairism has sunk into irredeemable decadence.</p> <p>The Government will decide in February whether to order the Commons to override the Lords and force Straw's bill into law. In the run up to the election when the \u00e9lite will pose as the champions of anti-\u00e9litism, it will be destroying the democratic liberty. In the name of the people, of course.</p>",

The Scottish barrister and Labour peer Helena Kennedy made the obvious riposte in the Lords last month. Scotland has a separate legal system with its own safeguards. Straw was not proposing to introduce Scottish procurators fiscal and 'not proven' verdicts, rather he was collecting the most repressive features of different jurisdictions and pasting them together in a grim collage. In any case, English readers may say, who cares if the Scots arrange these matters differently? Aren't we meant to take a pride in Englishness and cherish what is best about us in this age of devolution? If there is anything in England better than the democratic right to be tried by your peers I have yet to find it. Williams opened a new front the other day when he sobbed that he wanted to protect victims from the delays jury trials bring to justice. With the exception of saints and masochists, victims want criminals to pay for their crimes. Yet when suspects opt for a jury trial and lose, Crown Court judges give far stiffer punishments than magistrates. The Home Office admits as much. The sav ings it predicts the nobbling of jurors will bring are based on the assumption that the cost of running our bulging prison system will fall as softer sentences are issued. Not much joy for victims there. The same objection meets Straw's claim that professional criminals are abusing the system by asking for a jury trial. Why would they court a longer stretch? Citizens who are not Napoleons of crime do. Some take the risk because they have been overcharged by an understaffed and not noticeably competent Crown Prosecution Service and agree to plead guilty when the Crown Court has made prosecutors agree to hit them with a lesser crime. Others are protesting their innocence and believe, as all of us believe, that a jury will give them a fairer trial. And so it goes on. Straw told the Commons on 7 March that his plan 'enjoys the active endorsement of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Bingham'. Bingham revealed that a fortnight earlier he had sent a letter to the Home Secretary in which he wrote of his 'unease' about the 'dangers' of the legislation. Straw claimed that Professor Michael Zander, chairman of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, supported him. Zander said he did not. Straw said that 95 per cent of cases in Britain are heard by magistrates without a jury so there was no harm in slipping a few more trials in their direction. It was left to others to say that nearly all defendants plead guilty in magistrates courts and don't therefore need to bother a jury. If you're ever in trouble don't call the Home Secretary as a witness. There's not a jury in the country which would believe him. So disreputable has the Home Office's case become that when the Lords last threw out the measure, peers such as Melvyn Bragg, Clive Hollick, and Waheed Ali, who are usually dismissed as New Labour stooges, refused to support the Government. In the Commons, Straw has been forced to rely on the payroll vote and Scottish MPs to secure a majority. Everyone who opposes Straw and Williams says they are simply good boys obeying Treasury orders to save money. I'm sure that's true, but beneath the anti-\u00e9litist rhetoric lurks another motive - a scarcely concelaed anxiety about decisions being out of the hands of polite society. Authoritarian governments have always loathed juries. They can put justice before the letter of the law and by refusing, for example, to convict whistleblowers who have broken the Official Secrets Act. Lord Lipsey, a superior journalist turned New Labour peer, revealed establishment fears when he blurted out in February that blacks 'opt for jury trial in the hope that they will get an O.J. Simpson. What they hope is that there will be enough black jurors who are fundamentally hostile to the criminal justice system'. I suppose the only way to solve this shocking state of affairs is to ban all blacks from juries. Or perhaps the Government wants to go further and ban juries completely. Williams said last month that citizens who asked for juries were imposing an intolerable burden on the authorities. The courts were being bullied by the exercise of the 'defendant's diktat'. It was a revealing choice of words. Suspects facing charges which might ruin their lives were oppressors. The helpless state was the victim. A Conservative peer leapt up and rebuked him. The noble lord was Norman Tebbit. When a Labour Attorney General can be attacked from the Left by such a man you realise that Blairism has sunk into irredeemable decadence. The Government will decide in February whether to order the Commons to override the Lords and force Straw's bill into law. In the run up to the election when the \u00e9lite will pose as the champions of anti-\u00e9litism, it will be destroying the democratic liberty. In the name of the people, of course.",

With the Northern Ireland peace process on a knife-edge, Trimble told the Ulster Unionist Party conference in Belfast that he would not be bullied out of the Stormont Assembly by those who wanted to see him fail. 'There is no Utopia out there. Politics is a rough business with limited choices,' the leader said, to heckling and booing. 'I am not impressed by the self-serving calls for us to rush out of the Assembly. Knee-jerk reactions are unwise. Will we sleep any sounder in our beds if we are seen to ditch this Agreement? Will there be decommissioning? Will the Union be guaranteed? No, no and no again. 'The choice we have is simple. On the one hand, we can draw nationalism and republicanism into a consensus. On the other, we can be governed by London with Dublin interference, deprived of a voice, deprived of a veto.' Trimble's highly charged speech threatens to split his party in two. Although two-thirds of the audience gave him a standing ovation, there were cat-calls as he spoke.. Earlier, Ken Maginnis, one of Trimble's closest allies, faced shouts of 'shame, shame' when he said the paramilitary murder rate had fallen by 70 per cent since 1995. Trimble is threatened with a leadership challenge at an emergency meeting of the UUP's ruling council next month. If that were successful the party would resign from the body, plunging the peace process into chaos. Tony Blair and the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, will meet on Tuesday to discuss the impending crisis. Trimble told the conference that the Government should stop prevaricating about decommissioning. 'We have had enough,' he said. 'Our people are losing faith in a Government whose response to paramilitary pressure is to look for another set of goodies to give them.' Opposition to him has been growing since the party lost South Antrim to the Democratic Unionists 10 days ago. Party members opposed to the Agreement say Trimble should agree to a 'no guns, no government' policy, which would mean pulling out of the Assembly until the IRA began decommissioning to the UUP's satisfaction. Trimble called on colleagues to stop attacking their own party- a reference to fierce critic Jeffrey Donaldson. 'I hear loud calls for a change of policy,' said the party leader. 'I'll give those who have been shouting a change of policy - stop undermining the party. Stop undermining the leadership of the party. Stop undermining democratic decisions made by your party. Stop running to the media and bad-mouthing the Assembly team.' Trimble also attacked the Patten Report and criticised Sinn Fein, which he said had failed on decommissioning.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The shadow cabinet Minister ducked back against the wall as Michael Portillo swept down the corridor, trailing a knot of important looking aides and shuffling autograph hunters in his wake.</p> <p>'Here comes El Caudillo,' the Shadow Minister muttered through gritted teeth, 'with his little entourage. You notice none of the rest of us are quite so grand?'</p> <p>Last week's party conference saw the final triumph of a gentler Portillo brand of ideology - welcoming to gays and worried about the inner cities - over Ann Widdecombe's moral authoritarianism.</p> <p>But it left neither of the rivals for William Hague's crown unscathed. For the ensuing backlash exposes seething resentment against Portillo within the Shadow Cabinet, fuelled by jealousy, frustration over his domination of policy, and fear.</p> <p>The blood-letting in Bournemouth has opened profound new battle lines for the Tories just when they seemed most united, and the wounds will smart all the way to the election. The original Caudillo was the Spanish dictator Franco, and his enemies usually met unpleasant ends. According to some of his angrier colleagues, Portillo now threatens to live up to the name.</p> <p>The first ripples broke on the eve of the party conference, with reports of anonymous Tory sources calling for the sacking of the mild-mannered party chairman Michael Ancram. 'An over-eager Portillista, probably,' sighed one Shadow Cabinet Minister when asked who the assassin might be. 'And the problem is they are so over-eager.'</p> <p>The famed, feared and sometimes unjustly blamed Portillistas are a mix of backbench cheerleaders for the Shadow Chancellor, current aides and ex-Central Office staffers forced out under the Hague regime, such as former press officer Robbie Gibb and ex-Smith Square aide Andrew Cooper.</p> <p>No one openly blames Portillo for the Westminster punishment beatings, and the footsoldiers, of course, all hotly deny involvement. But the suspicion remains palpable. John Redwood's allies blame them for his demotion, friends of health spokesman Liam Fox and education's Theresa May suspect them of stirring hostilities, while Ancram may have suffered for objecting to ex-Minister Steve Norris, a cheerleader for the new tolerance, becoming vice-chairman.</p> <p>'What they can do to people is terrible, and we are heartily sick of it,' said one insider. 'The entire Shadow Cabinet would be deeply grateful if he would... just buckle down to the job.'</p> <p>But Portillo's attempts to get a grip on policymaking have caused more serious tensions. Just over two weeks ago, a Shadow Cabinet awayday to a country hotel in Aylesbury ended in a pitched battle over the fuel tax revolt.</p> <p>One camp, including Widdecombe, Iain Duncan-Smith and Andrew Lansley, had pushed for days for an immediate promise of a generous Tory tax cut. Portillo had dug in, insisting on no rash moves until the sums added up. After two bad-tempered days of arguments, a 3p tax cut was finally announced - 10 days after the start of the crisis. The row was buried, but not forgotten.</p> <p>Tempers then boiled again two days before Portillo's speech, when Fox discovered it would be centring on his radical plans for private funding in the NHS. 'Liam had steam coming out of his ears,' said one insider.</p> <p>So it was perhaps unsurprising, in such a fraught atmosphere, that the radar missed the real incoming missile.</p> <p>When Roman emperors paraded in triumph before their people, a slave would follow behind in a chariot to remind them of the dangers of hubris.</p> <p>Ann Widdecombe's hurtling bandwagon, insiders said last week, had long needed a slave on board. 'She has to learn that she is only mortal,' said one. She was dealt a painful lesson last week, but remains convinced her 'zero tolerance on soft drugs' stance was right.</p> <p>Senior party sources say Hague originally liked it. 'William was pushing for zero tolerance - he supports it,' said one. And Widdecombe's speech, including \u00a3100 fixed penalty fines, even for first-time offenders with small amounts of cannabis, was cleared both by Hague and Portillo on Monday. While the Portillo camp insists he only considered its financial implications, not the policy detail, her friends retort that he conspicuously failed to save her from herself.</p> <p>'She was set up, if you ask me,' says one. Some colleagues certainly did know in advance, including defence spokesman Iain Duncan-Smith, who warned Widdecombe that it would need careful explanation to avoid backfiring.</p> <p>But all that was forgotten as, pacing the stage furiously, she delivered her usual high-octane rendition of a daringly right-wing policy. The faithful loved it. But within the hour it turned to ashes.</p> <p>Senior policemen said it was unworkable. Bruce Anderson, the Spectator columnist, ambushed her in the press rooms, bellowing that she had got it wrong. Camera crews began cornering senior Tories demanding whether they had ever inhaled. Suddenly Central Office was under siege. 'They had a very clear choice then: to stand by her or drop her in it,' said one source. 'It's pretty obvious what was chosen.'</p> <p>The damning headlines were written suggesting Hague was retreating on the idea. And as a very bruised Widdecombe prepared to face a private fundraising dinner, the conspiracy theorists gathered in the bar. Had the Portillistas, some of whom seemed to be enjoying her disgrace, helped to fuel it?</p> <p>Several of her Shadow Cabinet colleagues believe so. 'She might have got it wrong, but they shouldn't be rubbing her nose in it,' said one. But other observers say the truth is more complicated: 'It's been horrible for her, but she is partly to blame. Part of that policy had not been properly thought through, and she is intolerant of colleagues.'</p> <p>The two young men hovering nervously in the hotel foyer on the night of Widdecombe's nemesis were clearly lost, but too embarrassed to ask directions. Eventually they found their way to the ballroom where Torche, the pro-gay Tory group, held its party by simply following the sound of cheesy disco music.</p> <p>It is still not easy to be an openly gay Tory, or even to sympathise, whatever courageous signals emerge from the platform. Portillo was not at the party, choosing a constituency dinner instead: the most senior Tory present was Norris, vice-president of Torche,who also bears the bruises of past calls for more liberal thinking.</p> <p>The Portillistas had discussed the pro-tolerance theme for months, often over tapas at Goya, their favourite restaurant in Pimlico. Allies like Cooper and fellow Central Office exile Michael Simmonds knew the plan in advance.</p> <p>But it was at home alone in Belgravia a fortnight ago that Portillo finally finished his first draft - including the welcome for Tories, whatever their sexual orientation, and passage about his Spanish father. When he first rehearsed it for his team, they laughed when he pronounced his surname Spanish-style - Porteeyo - thinking it an in-joke for them. 'But he said, \"I mean it, I'm going to do it that way\",' recalls one. He was clearly going for broke.</p> <p>The ground would have been laid in an interview arranged with the Sunday Telegraph on the eve of conference, but that disappeared when Hague, originally booked for another title, wanted the Telegraph slot instead.</p> <p>It could have been seen as a plot to stifle Portillo's publicity. But the fierce rivalry raging last week was not, for once, mostly between Portillo and Hague: the immediate battle now is not to become leader, but heir apparent - and that is a battle with Widdecombe.</p> <p>She still probably has the edge among party activists, who are the key to a successful leadership challenge. But the events of last week suggest supporters are starting to listen to their heads, not their hearts. It has given the modernisers comfort.</p> <p>The Portillistas should not celebrate yet, however. For while many senior Tories - Fox, David Willetts, Archie Norman and others - side with him on a more inclusive strategy, they are not yet buying Portillo the man. They have not forgotten it was Hague who actually decided that the week's theme should be reaching out beyond the core vote.</p> <p>'William has really stamped his authority on the Shadow Cabinet recently,' says one moderniser. 'I would put money on William being leader in 2005.'</p> <p>And so the search may now just be on, not for a 'stop Widdecombe' or 'stop Portillo' candidate, but a third-way contender against them both. There is a chance it could even turn out to be William Hague.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The shadow cabinet Minister ducked back against the wall as Michael Portillo swept down the corridor, trailing a knot of important looking aides and shuffling autograph hunters in his wake. 'Here comes El Caudillo,' the Shadow Minister muttered through gritted teeth, 'with his little entourage. You notice none of the rest of us are quite so grand?' Last week's party conference saw the final triumph of a gentler Portillo brand of ideology - welcoming to gays and worried about the inner cities - over Ann Widdecombe's moral authoritarianism. But it left neither of the rivals for William Hague's crown unscathed. For the ensuing backlash exposes seething resentment against Portillo within the Shadow Cabinet, fuelled by jealousy, frustration over his domination of policy, and fear. The blood-letting in Bournemouth has opened profound new battle lines for the Tories just when they seemed most united, and the wounds will smart all the way to the election. The original Caudillo was the Spanish dictator Franco, and his enemies usually met unpleasant ends. According to some of his angrier colleagues, Portillo now threatens to live up to the name. The first ripples broke on the eve of the party conference, with reports of anonymous Tory sources calling for the sacking of the mild-mannered party chairman Michael Ancram. 'An over-eager Portillista, probably,' sighed one Shadow Cabinet Minister when asked who the assassin might be. 'And the problem is they are so over-eager.' The famed, feared and sometimes unjustly blamed Portillistas are a mix of backbench cheerleaders for the Shadow Chancellor, current aides and ex-Central Office staffers forced out under the Hague regime, such as former press officer Robbie Gibb and ex-Smith Square aide Andrew Cooper. No one openly blames Portillo for the Westminster punishment beatings, and the footsoldiers, of course, all hotly deny involvement. But the suspicion remains palpable. John Redwood's allies blame them for his demotion, friends of health spokesman Liam Fox and education's Theresa May suspect them of stirring hostilities, while Ancram may have suffered for objecting to ex-Minister Steve Norris, a cheerleader for the new tolerance, becoming vice-chairman. 'What they can do to people is terrible, and we are heartily sick of it,' said one insider. 'The entire Shadow Cabinet would be deeply grateful if he would... just buckle down to the job.' But Portillo's attempts to get a grip on policymaking have caused more serious tensions. Just over two weeks ago, a Shadow Cabinet awayday to a country hotel in Aylesbury ended in a pitched battle over the fuel tax revolt. One camp, including Widdecombe, Iain Duncan-Smith and Andrew Lansley, had pushed for days for an immediate promise of a generous Tory tax cut. Portillo had dug in, insisting on no rash moves until the sums added up. After two bad-tempered days of arguments, a 3p tax cut was finally announced - 10 days after the start of the crisis. The row was buried, but not forgotten. Tempers then boiled again two days before Portillo's speech, when Fox discovered it would be centring on his radical plans for private funding in the NHS. 'Liam had steam coming out of his ears,' said one insider. So it was perhaps unsurprising, in such a fraught atmosphere, that the radar missed the real incoming missile. When Roman emperors paraded in triumph before their people, a slave would follow behind in a chariot to remind them of the dangers of hubris. Ann Widdecombe's hurtling bandwagon, insiders said last week, had long needed a slave on board. 'She has to learn that she is only mortal,' said one. She was dealt a painful lesson last week, but remains convinced her 'zero tolerance on soft drugs' stance was right. Senior party sources say Hague originally liked it. 'William was pushing for zero tolerance - he supports it,' said one. And Widdecombe's speech, including \u00a3100 fixed penalty fines, even for first-time offenders with small amounts of cannabis, was cleared both by Hague and Portillo on Monday. While the Portillo camp insists he only considered its financial implications, not the policy detail, her friends retort that he conspicuously failed to save her from herself. 'She was set up, if you ask me,' says one. Some colleagues certainly did know in advance, including defence spokesman Iain Duncan-Smith, who warned Widdecombe that it would need careful explanation to avoid backfiring. But all that was forgotten as, pacing the stage furiously, she delivered her usual high-octane rendition of a daringly right-wing policy. The faithful loved it. But within the hour it turned to ashes. Senior policemen said it was unworkable. Bruce Anderson, the Spectator columnist, ambushed her in the press rooms, bellowing that she had got it wrong. Camera crews began cornering senior Tories demanding whether they had ever inhaled. Suddenly Central Office was under siege. 'They had a very clear choice then: to stand by her or drop her in it,' said one source. 'It's pretty obvious what was chosen.' The damning headlines were written suggesting Hague was retreating on the idea. And as a very bruised Widdecombe prepared to face a private fundraising dinner, the conspiracy theorists gathered in the bar. Had the Portillistas, some of whom seemed to be enjoying her disgrace, helped to fuel it? Several of her Shadow Cabinet colleagues believe so. 'She might have got it wrong, but they shouldn't be rubbing her nose in it,' said one. But other observers say the truth is more complicated: 'It's been horrible for her, but she is partly to blame. Part of that policy had not been properly thought through, and she is intolerant of colleagues.' The two young men hovering nervously in the hotel foyer on the night of Widdecombe's nemesis were clearly lost, but too embarrassed to ask directions. Eventually they found their way to the ballroom where Torche, the pro-gay Tory group, held its party by simply following the sound of cheesy disco music. It is still not easy to be an openly gay Tory, or even to sympathise, whatever courageous signals emerge from the platform. Portillo was not at the party, choosing a constituency dinner instead: the most senior Tory present was Norris, vice-president of Torche,who also bears the bruises of past calls for more liberal thinking. The Portillistas had discussed the pro-tolerance theme for months, often over tapas at Goya, their favourite restaurant in Pimlico. Allies like Cooper and fellow Central Office exile Michael Simmonds knew the plan in advance. But it was at home alone in Belgravia a fortnight ago that Portillo finally finished his first draft - including the welcome for Tories, whatever their sexual orientation, and passage about his Spanish father. When he first rehearsed it for his team, they laughed when he pronounced his surname Spanish-style - Porteeyo - thinking it an in-joke for them. 'But he said, \"I mean it, I'm going to do it that way\",' recalls one. He was clearly going for broke. The ground would have been laid in an interview arranged with the Sunday Telegraph on the eve of conference, but that disappeared when Hague, originally booked for another title, wanted the Telegraph slot instead. It could have been seen as a plot to stifle Portillo's publicity. But the fierce rivalry raging last week was not, for once, mostly between Portillo and Hague: the immediate battle now is not to become leader, but heir apparent - and that is a battle with Widdecombe. She still probably has the edge among party activists, who are the key to a successful leadership challenge. But the events of last week suggest supporters are starting to listen to their heads, not their hearts. It has given the modernisers comfort. The Portillistas should not celebrate yet, however. For while many senior Tories - Fox, David Willetts, Archie Norman and others - side with him on a more inclusive strategy, they are not yet buying Portillo the man. They have not forgotten it was Hague who actually decided that the week's theme should be reaching out beyond the core vote. 'William has really stamped his authority on the Shadow Cabinet recently,' says one moderniser. 'I would put money on William being leader in 2005.' And so the search may now just be on, not for a 'stop Widdecombe' or 'stop Portillo' candidate, but a third-way contender against them both. There is a chance it could even turn out to be William Hague.",

The 'fragrance' deepens as you enter the shell of what was the Scandal Parfumerie owned by Marko Milosevic, son of the ex-president of Yugoslavia. Marko left Belgrade Airport yesterday morning at 08.40, bound for Moscow, trailing a terrible stench. With him were his wife, bodyguards and son, also called Marko - the boy Slobodan Milosevic had told the nation in his waxwork-like resignation address that he wanted to spend more time with. Marko Milosevic's sudden flight is one visible sign of the frantic race going on behind the scenes even as President Vojislav Kostunica was formally anointed in office yesterday. The old regime is hurrying to hide the evidence of 13 years of corruption, while the new one is desperate to save the paper trails from destruction. The old regime is not fussy about its methods.

It is used interchangeably to describe anything from increasing use of computing and internet technology to the growth of the information, knowledge and networked society, and to the emergence of a sustained growth yet low inflation economy in the US. Indeed some multinationals, mindful of the contamination of the 'globalisation' brand, now refer exclusively to the new economy instead. After all, certain groups may profess to be anti-globalisation, but how could anyone possibly be 'anti-new economy'?</p> <p>Amid this semantic muddle, a very real debate is emerging among economists and others about the cause, extent and novelty of what is termed the 'new economy', and whether talk of a British new economy is premature. Indeed, before the party gets off the ground outside the US, Business Week, the publication that lays claim to coining the concept, murmurs that it may soon be over.</p> <p>The first point is to separate cause from effect. Is it the successful economy that is new, or is it the industries that underpin it? </p> <p>The new economy has been described in terms of inputs - the new industries producing intangible, 'weightless' products such as IT, biotech, software and telecommunications; the application of new technology to improve productivity across the economy; and globalisation, the simple, costless diffusion of these techniques around the world. But it has also been described in terms of the perceived result of these trends - the creation in the US of an economy handling sustained growth in output and productivity without the spectre of inflation. In turn, this effect has been explained by phenomena other than technology, basically cheaper inputs. It's all down to the labour market, says Jack Triplett, of the Brookings Institution, while according to Andrew Oswald, of Warwick University, the new economy boom was a story of unfeasibly cheap energy, and the recent end of that trend spells doom.</p> <p>Supporters of such theses claim the role of technology in the ongoing US boom is overstated. The return on investment in this area is almost entirely contained within the IT producing sector, they say, and after accounting for cyclical factors, there is virtually no change in productivity in the other 88 per cent of the US economy. Put another way, the productivity growth in the US is fantastic, but given the sums of money invested, this should not be surprising.</p> <p>'It's mainly to do with the production of computers rather than their use,' says Ben Broadbent, an economist who has analysed the new economy extensively for Goldman Sachs. 'Hitherto, it's all been in electronics hardware production, where productivity has grown by up to 30 per cent a year. Subsequently views as to the future growth caused by B2B [business to business e-commerce], the internet and weightless products are mostly conjectural, but we're optimistic.' Goldman Sachs estimates that B2B will add 5 per cent to UK gross domestic product over the next decade. </p> <p>Economic growth can be considered a succession of 'new economies'. Capital investment is reallocated to dynamic sectors and sub-sectors at the expense of older sectors and they in turn produce fast growth. This economic darwinism is what causes trend growth - it just so happens that at the moment the favoured sectors are information, communications and technology (ICT). A genuinely new economy would reflect a broader shift, where use rather than production in new industries causes a stepchange in productivity across all sectors.</p> <p>Externalities, those returns on investments that can't be measured in simple economic terms, are crucial in this context. The key example is network externalities. Their intangible effect on an economy is captured by Metcalfe's Law. This says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users, because of the number of potential connections between network users. Such arguments have emboldened investors in these areas.</p> <p>Others argue that the effect of instant internet networks compared with those that require a contacts book and a telephone is negligible. For example, that B2B is nothing more than a small technical advancement on existing supply chain management systems. Such analysis is the realm of conjecture and counter-conjecture. </p> <p>'A lot of the benefits of the ICT revolution are not going to be measured by the conventional economic statistics,' says Garry Young of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research - for example, the ability to receive the latest football results on a mobile phone. Despite this productivity, figures will prove the acid test of any new economic revolution. But these are notoriously flaky and, since the shift from manufacturing to services in the 1980s, productivity has been increasingly tricky to track. There is little to suggest an effect of the new economy in overall UK and European productivity figures. Until this year UK figures for labour productivity growth were actually falling.</p> <p>The irony is that if the sceptics are right, the new economy boom in the US is very much a tale of manufacturing, albeit of the hi-tech sort. There is a danger that in trying to mimic that boom by focusing on weightless intangibles we may throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p> <p>As for monetary policy, there are doves on the Monetary Policy Committee who believe we are on the cusp of a leap in productivity which increases the capacity of the economy to expand without raising inflation. 'Some say that it allows you to have lower interest rates because the economy does not reach its speed limits as quickly,' says Young. </p> <p>But there is a more general problem, says US economist Robert Shiller in the context of overvalued stock markets. If we overstate the returns to the new economy then there is a danger that at the macro level, society allocates too many resources to the dotcom dodos of the future, and not enough to other priorities. The \u00a3100 million spent funding Boo.com, was \u00a3100m lost investment in, for example, genomics or photonics, two areas in which the UK could lead the world.

The library takes its name from Alfred Marshall, the eminent Victorian who did a great deal to shape the emerging 'dismal science' and whose collection of books was the seed-crystal from which the present magnificent library was grown. </p> <p>As the crow flies, my journey measured just over six miles. But it took almost an hour to travel the distance in a car. It would have been quicker by camel. As it happens, I do not normally have to drive into Cambridge at rush hour, but tens of thousands of less fortunate folk do, and they endure interminable traffic jams and pump out unconscionable amounts of pollutants in the process. </p> <p>Cambridge is choking on prosperity.

One cannot enter a supermarket without running into posters advertising for, nay, begging for, workers. Unemployment is, to all intents and purposes, zero. </p> <p>The Science Park, on the outskirts of the city, is so crammed with hi-tech companies that their employees queue for half-an-hour merely to exit on to the A14. Across the road the St John's Innovation Centre, a nursery for start-ups, is filled to the rafters with new companies. The old Cambridge City football ground has been turned into a huge office complex. Ditto the old council offices on the top of Castle Hill. Ditto the old Chivers jam factory in Histon, and the suburban gardens at Mount Pleasant. A few miles out of town a new 'research park' has risen from a gravel pit, and its first units were let before the water had been drained from the site. </p> <p>What has all this to do with Marshall? Simple: Cambridge is an example of a phenomenon about which the old boy wrote extensively - the tendency of firms to cluster together. Marshall called it the theory of 'industrial districts'. Such districts enjoy the same economies of scale that only giant companies get. Specialised suppliers arrive. Skilled workers know where to come to ply their trade. And everyone involved benefits from the spillovers of specialised knowledge. As Marshall put it in his Principles: 'The mysteries of the trade become no mysteries, but are as it were in the air.' </p> <p>But the 'Cambridge phenomenon' - the name comes from a famous 1985 report by Segal Quince Wicksteed, a consultancy firm - is not just 'in the air'. In a new report, featured in The Observer last week, the firm estimates that Cambridge hi-tech firms generate exports of more than \u00a31.5 billion annually. Several are already billion-dollar companies. As the second-rank companies move into that league, the attractiveness of the cluster will increase, and with it the pressures that are choking the city to death. </p> <p>What can be done about it? Probably nothing. As we reported, the local authorities seem paralysed by the Cambridge phenomenon, like rabbits caught in the headlights. Marshall would probably counsel them to do nothing, on the grounds that the feedback loops in the system will solve the problem in time. </p> <p>Property is already so expensive in Cambridge that young academics and post- doctoral researchers, the lifeblood of a research university, cannot afford to live there. Will people continue to cluster in a place where rabbit hutches cost \u00a3200,000 and nothing moves faster than a camel?

As the second-rank companies move into that league, the attractiveness of the cluster will increase, and with it the pressures that are choking the city to death. What can be done about it? Probably nothing. As we reported, the local authorities seem paralysed by the Cambridge phenomenon, like rabbits caught in the headlights. Marshall would probably counsel them to do nothing, on the grounds that the feedback loops in the system will solve the problem in time. Property is already so expensive in Cambridge that young academics and post- doctoral researchers, the lifeblood of a research university, cannot afford to live there. Will people continue to cluster in a place where rabbit hutches cost \u00a3200,000 and nothing moves faster than a camel? We will see. John.Naughton@observer.co.uk",
