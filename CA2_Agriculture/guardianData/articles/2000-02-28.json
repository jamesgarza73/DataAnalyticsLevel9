      "bodyText": "The Moors murderer Ian Brady will launch a landmark high court battle today for the right to starve himself to death. He claims Ashworth hospital has no legal right to force-feed him by tube and foil the hunger strike he began 152 days ago. Brady, 61, is expected to attend part of the four-day hearing, which will be held in private amid strict security at the Queen Elizabeth II court complex in Liverpool. He will be brought under heavy police escort for his first court appearance since he was convicted of killing three children at Chester assizes in 1966. In 1987 he confessed to the murders of two other youngsters. The case raises complex legal and medical issues about the right of doctors to force-feed adults against their will. The normal rule under English law is that an adult who is competent - mentally capable - of understanding the consequences and weighing up the factors involved, may refuse any treatment, including force-feeding. The House of Lords confirmed in the case of the Hillsborough survivor Tony Bland that artificial feeding is a form of medical treatment. Being mentally ill, as Brady is, does not deprive an individual of the right to take treatment decisions. The question is whether he is capable of taking that particular decision at that time. In the past, the high court held that a paranoid schizophrenic in Broadmoor, with delusions that he was a famous surgeon, was competent to decide he did not want his leg amputated and banned doctors from operating without his consent.

An extract is published at) <a href=\"http://www.slashdot.org   \">www.slashdot.org </a> </p> <p>Are newspapers over? At this moment in media history, they have never been more pressed to define themselves, or done a worse job. All over the information spectrum, media audiences are fragmented, drawn to the timeliness, convenience and immediacy of cable news, and the net and the web. </p> <p>The challenge for newspapers isn't technological. It's creative. They don't tell us things we don't know. They don't offer us good writing or strong opinion. They don't even have good comics any more. And their coverage of technology generally sucks. And profoundly so. They still don't recognise that the net is not a sex story or a business story but the biggest story of our time. </p> <p>In recent years, newspapers have remained graphically impaired. They seem oblivious to the graphic revolution that has swept magazines and is spreading through the web. Papers continue to cover new media technologies and popular culture poorly, alienating young and future audiences. They have ceded good writing to magazines, publishing and websites. </p> <p>Papers seem seem almost stupefyingly oblivious to the fact that they aren't in the breaking news business anymore. As the net and web spawn ferocious and idiosyncratic commentary, democratising opinion all over the country, newspapers cling to stuffy and elitist op-ed pages, where opinion is generally confined to a \"left\" and \"right\" and voice usually given to elite cliques of pundits, academics, authors and chief executives. </p> <p>Technology is spawning a host of significant issues of relevance to almost everyone. How many of these stories make their way to the front pages of newspapers? Few, and then rarely. Newspapers are the scolds of the Digital Age, shrieking and clucking about a changing world (the net, the web, movies, TV shows, rap, hip-hop, kids today) like Temperance Ladies wandering into a bar. </p> <p>Newspapers are also struggling to evolve definitions of culture, leisure time, recreation and amusement. Opera, classical music, hard cover books, art museums are one kind of culture. But there are new kinds - elaborate and creative gaming and video cultures, creative coding, the booming business of web architecture and design, proliferating weblogs , vast messaging systems and services like AIM and ICQ, collaborative global information-and-software sharing movements like Linux. </p> <p>Few newspaper readers have even heard about these new kinds of culture. No wonder kids- especially geek and nerd kids - have abandoned papers in droves.</p>",

      "bodyText": "* Jon Katz (who last week provoked a big online debate with an article on the future of the press. An extract is published at) www.slashdot.org Are newspapers over? At this moment in media history, they have never been more pressed to define themselves, or done a worse job. All over the information spectrum, media audiences are fragmented, drawn to the timeliness, convenience and immediacy of cable news, and the net and the web. The challenge for newspapers isn't technological. It's creative. They don't tell us things we don't know. They don't offer us good writing or strong opinion. They don't even have good comics any more. And their coverage of technology generally sucks. And profoundly so. They still don't recognise that the net is not a sex story or a business story but the biggest story of our time. In recent years, newspapers have remained graphically impaired. They seem oblivious to the graphic revolution that has swept magazines and is spreading through the web. Papers continue to cover new media technologies and popular culture poorly, alienating young and future audiences. They have ceded good writing to magazines, publishing and websites. Papers seem seem almost stupefyingly oblivious to the fact that they aren't in the breaking news business anymore. As the net and web spawn ferocious and idiosyncratic commentary, democratising opinion all over the country, newspapers cling to stuffy and elitist op-ed pages, where opinion is generally confined to a \"left\" and \"right\" and voice usually given to elite cliques of pundits, academics, authors and chief executives. Technology is spawning a host of significant issues of relevance to almost everyone. How many of these stories make their way to the front pages of newspapers? Few, and then rarely. Newspapers are the scolds of the Digital Age, shrieking and clucking about a changing world (the net, the web, movies, TV shows, rap, hip-hop, kids today) like Temperance Ladies wandering into a bar. Newspapers are also struggling to evolve definitions of culture, leisure time, recreation and amusement. Opera, classical music, hard cover books, art museums are one kind of culture. But there are new kinds - elaborate and creative gaming and video cultures, creative coding, the booming business of web architecture and design, proliferating weblogs , vast messaging systems and services like AIM and ICQ, collaborative global information-and-software sharing movements like Linux. Few newspaper readers have even heard about these new kinds of culture. No wonder kids- especially geek and nerd kids - have abandoned papers in droves.",

Are you achieving that? New technologies, new resources, new products, and a new customer base are changing so many aspects of journalists' work. Keeping an eye on and preparing for the new while building on the well-honed traditions of journalistic practice are the challenges for newsroom leaders. </p> <p>The three areas of news media most affected by new media are: </p> <p>*News-gathering and reporting. </p> <p>*New products. </p> <p>*News customers. </p> <p>As Dan Bradley, the vice-president of WFLA-TV in Tampa, Florida, says: \"Stop thinking of yourself as a broadcast journalist. In the uncertain digital world we are entering, your platform of distribution . . . will have little relevance.\" </p> <p>When the big story breaks, how is your team prepared to tap into online resources to get the background it needs? When covering an on-going story, how is your team able to see what others are saying, to find new angles and perspectives? When doing enterprise, how is your team finding new and fresh ideas, covering the uncovered? When bringing \"voice\" to the story, how is your team locating people with expertise and those with experience? </p> <p>If the resources of the web are not part of the answer to those questions it borders on journalistic malpractice. The internet is where stories are breaking, where background is provided, where experts are located. </p> <p>Computer-assisted reporting techniques are under-used in television newsrooms. Using spreadsheets to compile and analyse data, developing databases to track trends, and working with mapping programs that can reveal concentrations of occurrences provide powerful new storytelling techniques. They have the potential to uncover untold stories, to wrest away the power of interpretation of data from the officials, to bust popular perceptions, or to confirm anecdotal evidence. </p> <p>What kind of journalism are you doing in your newsroom - reactive or investigative? </p> <p>Think of it in terms of four key opportunities: </p> <p>*There is now a more level playing field - anyone anywhere has the same access to resources. </p> <p>*There is cheaper access to resources which only well-funded newsrooms had in the past. </p> <p>*Take the lead, don't just follow others' coverage - using news alerts, mining sites for new stories, doing original data analysis. </p> <p>*Keep talented and energised journalists by providing them with resources. </p> <p>And six key questions: </p> <p>*What access do reporters/producers have to the internet? Is it a resource at their desktops or is access limited to a few stations in the newsroom? </p> <p>*What kind of training have reporters/producers received? </p> <p>*What resources are available to help them find good sites (an intranet, a researcher)? </p> <p>*What techniques are used to facilitate news finding (filters or personalised news services)? Are all the advanced techniques of research and personalised services understood and being used? </p> <p>*What is the budget line for accounts to \"for-fee\" information services? Not everything is free on the web. How will subscription services be managed? </p> <p>*How are successes promoted? Are examples of innovative research and enterprise rewarded? </p> <p>To put it simply, mono-media is dead. The creative product of your newsroom is going out via multiple platforms. The packaging of the news product has to be multipurpose - for broadcast, the web, the cell phone, the bathroom mirror. Soon the potential of high definition television (HDTV) [providing pictures with higher resolution and more information] delivery of news will bring new opportunities and issues. </p> <p>*How are you preparing your staff to anticipate and embrace the potential of multi-platform delivery of the news? </p> <p>*What is your own attitude toward these new technologies? HDTV has been referred to, disparagingly, as high deficit TV. How might the development of plans for HDTV go if your team thinks of it as hot damn TV. While developing plans with a sense of reality is critical, don't stymie creative R&amp;D in the early stages when enthusiasm and idea generation is essential. </p> <p>Some more issues: </p> <p>*Audience can get the news they want when they want it in the form they want. </p> <p>*Create the product line that people use, rely on. </p> <p>*Provide more depth, additional material, \"give-me-more\" features to customers. </p> <p>*Re-engineer the newsroom to think of information in multiple forms, prepare for the future (which is now). </p> <p>*Realise that there is a potential for collaboration of content, specialise in local audio/video stock. </p> <p>And more questions: </p> <p>Training: do your journalists know how to create multimedia, interactive, non-linear news pack ages? What skill sets will be required to think in a 3D information space? </p> <p>Collaboration/integration: how is the \"new products\" unit operating - as part of the news team, as a separate unit with little interaction with the news team? How is this helping or hindering efforts to re-engineer the newsroom? </p> <p>Digital asset management: as things go digital, are you archiving for re-use? How can you tap into resources of the past to make up the current news package? How do you control and manage various media resources? </p> <p>Staffing: What kind of reporters/ researchers will you need to create the elements of the multiple media/interactive news product? What will the positions in the multiple media newsroom be? </p> <p>The \"Us to Them\" model of television producers and viewers is dying. New news consumers will expect to have control on many aspects of the newscast: when they watch it, from what angle, the depth of the coverage, the type of news they want to see. Time-shifting, multicasting, camera vantage point selection - all will provide the viewer with more power over the product. News consumers will have new means of communicating with you about the news, and will expect a response. </p> <p>If you look at the top 50 websites in terms of traffic you will find out a lot about what people want to do online. They want to communicate with each other. They want to create their own pages. They want to play games, buy things, find things. How are the products you are creating helping them do those things? The primary mission, being a credible and reliable source of news and information, has not changed, but it does need to be augmented to satisfy the expectations of the new news customer. </p> <p>There are a thousand opportunities out there: </p> <p>*Get a better sense of the news consumers' appetites and reactions. </p> <p>*Track actual use of the news consumers' behaviour. </p> <p>*Create a dialogue with the news consumer. </p> <p>And a thousand questions: </p> <p>*Do your reporters all have email addresses? </p> <p>*Is there a public forum area on the website? Do you offer interactive features on the website? </p> <p>*Are users of your site able to customise to meeet their needs and interests? </p> <p>*How easily can people find things on your site? Do you facilitate learning or frustrate it? </p> <p>Think about it, the future is now.</p>",

As Dan Bradley, the vice-president of WFLA-TV in Tampa, Florida, says: \"Stop thinking of yourself as a broadcast journalist. In the uncertain digital world we are entering, your platform of distribution . . . will have little relevance.\" When the big story breaks, how is your team prepared to tap into online resources to get the background it needs? When covering an on-going story, how is your team able to see what others are saying, to find new angles and perspectives? When doing enterprise, how is your team finding new and fresh ideas, covering the uncovered? When bringing \"voice\" to the story, how is your team locating people with expertise and those with experience? If the resources of the web are not part of the answer to those questions it borders on journalistic malpractice. The internet is where stories are breaking, where background is provided, where experts are located. Computer-assisted reporting techniques are under-used in television newsrooms. Using spreadsheets to compile and analyse data, developing databases to track trends, and working with mapping programs that can reveal concentrations of occurrences provide powerful new storytelling techniques. They have the potential to uncover untold stories, to wrest away the power of interpretation of data from the officials, to bust popular perceptions, or to confirm anecdotal evidence. What kind of journalism are you doing in your newsroom - reactive or investigative? Think of it in terms of four key opportunities: *There is now a more level playing field - anyone anywhere has the same access to resources. *There is cheaper access to resources which only well-funded newsrooms had in the past. *Take the lead, don't just follow others' coverage - using news alerts, mining sites for new stories, doing original data analysis. *Keep talented and energised journalists by providing them with resources. And six key questions: *What access do reporters/producers have to the internet? Is it a resource at their desktops or is access limited to a few stations in the newsroom? *What kind of training have reporters/producers received? *What resources are available to help them find good sites (an intranet, a researcher)? *What techniques are used to facilitate news finding (filters or personalised news services)? Are all the advanced techniques of research and personalised services understood and being used? *What is the budget line for accounts to \"for-fee\" information services? Not everything is free on the web. How will subscription services be managed? *How are successes promoted? Are examples of innovative research and enterprise rewarded? To put it simply, mono-media is dead. The creative product of your newsroom is going out via multiple platforms. The packaging of the news product has to be multipurpose - for broadcast, the web, the cell phone, the bathroom mirror. Soon the potential of high definition television (HDTV) [providing pictures with higher resolution and more information] delivery of news will bring new opportunities and issues. *How are you preparing your staff to anticipate and embrace the potential of multi-platform delivery of the news? *What is your own attitude toward these new technologies? HDTV has been referred to, disparagingly, as high deficit TV. How might the development of plans for HDTV go if your team thinks of it as hot damn TV. While developing plans with a sense of reality is critical, don't stymie creative R&amp;D in the early stages when enthusiasm and idea generation is essential. Some more issues: *Audience can get the news they want when they want it in the form they want. *Create the product line that people use, rely on. *Provide more depth, additional material, \"give-me-more\" features to customers. *Re-engineer the newsroom to think of information in multiple forms, prepare for the future (which is now). *Realise that there is a potential for collaboration of content, specialise in local audio/video stock. And more questions: Training: do your journalists know how to create multimedia, interactive, non-linear news pack ages? What skill sets will be required to think in a 3D information space? Collaboration/integration: how is the \"new products\" unit operating - as part of the news team, as a separate unit with little interaction with the news team? How is this helping or hindering efforts to re-engineer the newsroom? Digital asset management: as things go digital, are you archiving for re-use? How can you tap into resources of the past to make up the current news package? How do you control and manage various media resources? Staffing: What kind of reporters/ researchers will you need to create the elements of the multiple media/interactive news product? What will the positions in the multiple media newsroom be? The \"Us to Them\" model of television producers and viewers is dying. New news consumers will expect to have control on many aspects of the newscast: when they watch it, from what angle, the depth of the coverage, the type of news they want to see. Time-shifting, multicasting, camera vantage point selection - all will provide the viewer with more power over the product. News consumers will have new means of communicating with you about the news, and will expect a response. If you look at the top 50 websites in terms of traffic you will find out a lot about what people want to do online. They want to communicate with each other. They want to create their own pages. They want to play games, buy things, find things. How are the products you are creating helping them do those things? The primary mission, being a credible and reliable source of news and information, has not changed, but it does need to be augmented to satisfy the expectations of the new news customer. There are a thousand opportunities out there: *Get a better sense of the news consumers' appetites and reactions. *Track actual use of the news consumers' behaviour. *Create a dialogue with the news consumer. And a thousand questions: *Do your reporters all have email addresses? *Is there a public forum area on the website? Do you offer interactive features on the website? *Are users of your site able to customise to meeet their needs and interests? *How easily can people find things on your site? Do you facilitate learning or frustrate it? Think about it, the future is now.",

Ijaz Batalvi and Khwaja Sultan, the two leading lawyers for the defence, criticised a decision by the judge presiding over the anti-terrorist court to consider imposing a reporting ban when Mr Sharif gives evidence. \"The whole world for the last two months heard the prosecution malign and scandalise Mian Nawaz Sharif and now when it was his turn to tell the truth he has been asked to shut up,\" said Mr Batalvi. \"To say the least, this is not justice. We have decided to withdraw from the case.\" Mr Sharif was overthrown in a military coup on October 12 and is now on trial at the court in Karachi together with his brother Shahbaz and five former senior government officials. They have pleaded not guilty to charges of hijacking, kidnapping, attempted murder and terrorism and face the death penalty if convicted. Mr Sharif was due to give evidence this week at the start of the defence case but prosecutors argued that the hearing should be held in private, saying the former prime minister's evidence could breach national security. Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri ruled on Friday that he would decide which parts of Mr Sharif's testimony could be reported after the former prime minister had spoken in open court and handed in written statements. Mr Batalvi, one of Pakistan's most senior lawyers, said he believed the judge had stepped beyond the law in making his decision but said the defence was unable to appeal against the ruling under the terms of the anti-terrorism court. \"The law has not given him any such authority nor has the law fixed any parameters by which the statement of the accused can be scissored by the judge,\" he said. Mr Batalvi represented the prosecution in another trial of a former Pakistani prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was sentenced to death and hanged in April 1979 under the dictatorship of General Zia ul-Haq. Mr Sharif was detained immediately after the October coup but a series of setbacks for Pakistan's new military regime has delayed his trial. A high court judge refused to hear the case in January, complaining about the presence of intelligence agents in the court room, and later that month all the country's senior judges were ordered to swear new oaths of loyalty to the military regime. There are still seven lawyers working in the defence team.",

      "body": "<p>Junior minister Stephen Timms rose to address the Labour party faithful in Norwich on Saturday framed by history and proclamation. To his right a banner for the Amalgamated Engineering Union announcing \"Unity is Strength\"; to his left a display of the early labour movement in Norfolk presenting a \"rousing speech\" made during a strike at Grout's silk works in Great Yarmouth; behind him a banner for the Norwich Labour party stating simply \"Forward with Socialism\".</p> <p>With talk of building a society which is \"modern and decent\" through a \"dynamic enterprise economy\", by balancing \"prosperity and fairness\", Timms, treasury financial secretary, reassured many but inspired few. Then the crowd of around 60 members went off into different rooms, clutching brown envelopes, to discuss the policy documents sent by Millbank.</p> <p>It is the eve of Labour's 100th birthday. The keynote speaker has wound up to polite applause. Nobody has mentioned the trade unions which set the party up or uttered the word \"socialism\". There will be discussions in small groups behind closed doors, and there has been no open, public debate.</p> <p>The Labour party has a peculiar relationship with its history. It is both drawn by its symbolism but repelled by its significance; keen to establish an emotional link with its past but reluctant to admit any structural relationship with it. New Labour - that mixture of PR jingle and political construct - is still defined not so much by what it actually is, but by what it has abandoned.</p> <p>The fact that the party has changed is, of course, both welcome and inevitable. It started the last century with two MPs and ended with the largest majority in its parliamentary history. All that has come between, from the birth, life and death of the Soviet Union to the globalisation of capital, via feminism, the ozone layer and the end of empire, has had a profound and fundamental effect on society that must be reflected in a party that wishes to lead it.</p> <p>But for the best part of the century the fundamental tensions within the party have remained consistent. On the one hand there have been those who wanted to use the party's base among the working class as a vehicle for radical, social change; on the other those who wished to extend its appeal so that it could use its parliamentary presence to gradually negotiate reforms. In a sense it has been a phoney war. The two camps have not always been in conflict, have shared many basic values and in the broader scheme of things have always had more in common than divides them. But at times of crisis or opportunity the representatives of either side - be it Bevan and Gaitskell, Healey and Benn or Livingstone and Dobson - will square up for a conflict which threatens to split the party asunder.</p> <p>\"In other parts of Europe these two traditions have been the basis, broadly speaking, for two separate parties; social democratic and communist,\" wrote Hilary Wainwright in her book, Labour: A Tale of Two Parties. \"In Britain, by contrast, the Labour party has united the majority of each tradition in one party.\"</p> <p>For the most part these traditions have expressed themselves not so much as a battle of policies but of axioms. There is no point in having power unless you are going to use it to improve the livelihoods of those who support you, say one camp; you cannot do anything for those who support you unless you are in power, say the other. The arbitrator between these two truisms has traditionally been the membership which, through internal democracy, has always made its voice clear about how much its thirst for change might be quenched by the chance to taste power. Failure to hear this voice has been punished with low turnouts and a sharp decline in envelope stuffers, door- knockers and telephone canvassers as people who feel their support has been taken for granted or ignored stay at home.

      "bodyText": "Junior minister Stephen Timms rose to address the Labour party faithful in Norwich on Saturday framed by history and proclamation. To his right a banner for the Amalgamated Engineering Union announcing \"Unity is Strength\"; to his left a display of the early labour movement in Norfolk presenting a \"rousing speech\" made during a strike at Grout's silk works in Great Yarmouth; behind him a banner for the Norwich Labour party stating simply \"Forward with Socialism\". With talk of building a society which is \"modern and decent\" through a \"dynamic enterprise economy\", by balancing \"prosperity and fairness\", Timms, treasury financial secretary, reassured many but inspired few. Then the crowd of around 60 members went off into different rooms, clutching brown envelopes, to discuss the policy documents sent by Millbank. It is the eve of Labour's 100th birthday. The keynote speaker has wound up to polite applause. Nobody has mentioned the trade unions which set the party up or uttered the word \"socialism\". There will be discussions in small groups behind closed doors, and there has been no open, public debate. The Labour party has a peculiar relationship with its history. It is both drawn by its symbolism but repelled by its significance; keen to establish an emotional link with its past but reluctant to admit any structural relationship with it. New Labour - that mixture of PR jingle and political construct - is still defined not so much by what it actually is, but by what it has abandoned. The fact that the party has changed is, of course, both welcome and inevitable. It started the last century with two MPs and ended with the largest majority in its parliamentary history. All that has come between, from the birth, life and death of the Soviet Union to the globalisation of capital, via feminism, the ozone layer and the end of empire, has had a profound and fundamental effect on society that must be reflected in a party that wishes to lead it. But for the best part of the century the fundamental tensions within the party have remained consistent. On the one hand there have been those who wanted to use the party's base among the working class as a vehicle for radical, social change; on the other those who wished to extend its appeal so that it could use its parliamentary presence to gradually negotiate reforms. In a sense it has been a phoney war. The two camps have not always been in conflict, have shared many basic values and in the broader scheme of things have always had more in common than divides them. But at times of crisis or opportunity the representatives of either side - be it Bevan and Gaitskell, Healey and Benn or Livingstone and Dobson - will square up for a conflict which threatens to split the party asunder. \"In other parts of Europe these two traditions have been the basis, broadly speaking, for two separate parties; social democratic and communist,\" wrote Hilary Wainwright in her book, Labour: A Tale of Two Parties. \"In Britain, by contrast, the Labour party has united the majority of each tradition in one party.\" For the most part these traditions have expressed themselves not so much as a battle of policies but of axioms. There is no point in having power unless you are going to use it to improve the livelihoods of those who support you, say one camp; you cannot do anything for those who support you unless you are in power, say the other. The arbitrator between these two truisms has traditionally been the membership which, through internal democracy, has always made its voice clear about how much its thirst for change might be quenched by the chance to taste power. Failure to hear this voice has been punished with low turnouts and a sharp decline in envelope stuffers, door- knockers and telephone canvassers as people who feel their support has been taken for granted or ignored stay at home. The result can be electoral defeat. \"Obedient ministers who tramp through lobbies strange to all they have ever said may preserve themselves from the prime minister's sacking,\" said Lena Jeger MP back in 1968. \"But they do not protect themselves from a sacking in their constituencies, a sacking which may well not be deliberate but may come just because nobody turns up to drive the loudspeaker van.\" Back at Norwich Labour club, the local trades council are showing a video about the Burston village school strike.

Common to every bubble is the ingrained belief that this time it will be different, that the rise in the price of an asset is rooted in sound common sense rather than on recklessness, stupidity and greed. </p> <p>Take the crash of 1929, for example. In his excellent book charting the sad history of bubbles, Edward Chancellor* records how Wall Street's elite convinced themselves that the rules of economics had been rewritten and that the market could support ever-higher share prices. John Moody, the founder of the credit agency intoned in 1927 that \"no one can examine the panorama of business and finance in America during the past half-dozen years without realising that we are living in a new era\". </p> <p><strong> A new economy</strong><br> </p> <p> Yale economist Irving Fisher declared a few weeks before the October crash that stock prices had reached a \"permanently high plateau\". Why was this? Simple. The creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 had abolished the business cycle, while technological breakthroughs had created a \"new economy\" that was much more profitable than the old. </p> <p>As share prices continued their heady rise, traditional methods of stock market valuations were abandoned. It did not matter that many of the start-up companies of the late 1920s were not making any money; what counted was that some day they surely would. So share prices were justified by discounted future earnings. </p> <p>Investors mortgaged themselves up to the hilt to buy stocks in exotic companies from broking houses, the number of which proliferated in the 1920s. One analyst warned that \"factories will shut ... men will be thrown out of work ... the vicious circle will get into full swing and the result will be a serious business depression\". He was ridiculed, naturally. </p> <p>Sound familiar? It should, because the gravity defying performance of stocks in London and New York is eerily redolent of 1929. Those of us who have been warning for some time that the whole stock market edifice is built on sand have so far been proved wrong.</p> <p> It is possible that we will continue to be wrong and that this time the rules really have been rewritten. It may be that Alan Greenspan has abolished the business cycle, that Goldman Sachs' contented equity guru Abby Joseph Cohen is wiser than Irving Fisher, that Amazon.com is in a different league from RCA (the go-go stock of the 1920s). Maybe. </p> <p>However, there are plenty of warnings there for those prepared to heed them. One is what is happening in the markets themselves. More and more money is being concentrated in a handful of stocks in the technology sector, while shares in \"old industry\" fall. An analysis by Peter Oppenheimer, of HSBC, showed that the price-earnings gap in London between the new economy stocks and the old economy stocks is the largest for any market ever. </p> <p>An analysis of the balance sheet of Amazon.com by Tim Congdon of Lombard Street showed that liabilities were covered more than four times by holdings of cash and securities in early 1999. However, by the end of the year high investment and trading losses meant that liabilities were higher than cash and securities. He believes that the rise in the Nasdaq index is being underpinned by firms borrowing money to buy each other's shares - the equivalent of taking in each other's washing. </p> <p>Amazon.com's results, he says, give \"a fascinating and alarming insight into the cost of building an internet brand. Arguably, they also demonstrate that the hi-tech element in the American stock market is now gripped by a speculative madness of a kind never before seen in the organised financial markets of a significant industrial country.\" </p> <p>In the US, the economist Robert Gordon, has started to unpick the American productivity data in an attempt to put the \"new paradigm\" into historical perspective. \"I believe that the inventions of the late 19th century and early 20th century were more fundamental creators of productivity than the electronic-internet era of today,\" he said. </p> <p>Oppenheimer, at HSBC, estimates that share prices in the new economy imply growth rates that are unlikely to be achieved and that collectively they are overvalued by 40%. </p> <p><strong> Survey's warning </strong><br> </p> <p> Sushil Wadhwani, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, quoted a survey last week showing that 133 internet companies that have gone public since 1995 would need on average to expand their revenues by 80% a year for the next five years. Microsoft, which has had a virtual monopoly, has managed 53% a year; Dell 66%. </p> <p>It is no wonder that Greenspan is doing his level best to massage share prices down. He knows that the alternative could be a full-scale panic. But even on the assumption that there is no re peat of 1929, there are certain conclusions to be drawn. </p> <p>First, the euro looks considerably undervalued against the US dollar. European exchanges have performed strongly in recent months. Equity investors seem to have cottoned on to the recovery in the European economy, but foreign exchange dealers - perhaps recalling how they were too long on euros around its launch - have not. </p> <p>Second, the real medium-term danger for the global economy will be deflation rather than inflation. A stroll down any high street shows that downward pressure on prices is strong; it would not take much to tip western economies from disinflation into deflation and even though policymakers believe that they have scope to ease monetary and fiscal policy, the experience of Japan in the 1990s suggests that such action may be more difficult than they think. </p> <p>A crash would have more profound implications, not least the rediscovery of the virtues of social democracy and the need for some curbs on the global money machine. A meltdown on Wall Street would be seen, rightly, as the crescendo of a period of financial turbulence that started a decade ago. </p> <p>Those who today are insistent that we are all Americans now would say that the US was just another Thailand waiting to happen. After all, the US has all the ingredients - a rising trade deficit, a consumer credit binge and wasteful investment in non-performing assets. </p> <p>At this point, it is traditional to say that a crash is to be avoided at all costs. Actually, it would be no bad thing. A shake-out would not mean that the benefits associated with the new technologies would be lost, any more than the end of the railway boom in the 19th century put an end to railways. </p> <p>But crashes do have the effect of cleansing the stables, and boy do these stables need cleansing. In the aftermath of the 1929 crash the policies of laissez-faire were cast aside in favour of controls on speculation and the financial system in general. Sadly, those lessons have been forgotten, with the result that we live in a state of perpetual financial instability and allow money idolatry to hollow out societies from the inside. </p> <p>\u0095 Devil Take the Hindmost; Macmillan. </p> <p>larry.elliott@theguardian.com</p>",

Those of us who have been warning for some time that the whole stock market edifice is built on sand have so far been proved wrong. It is possible that we will continue to be wrong and that this time the rules really have been rewritten. It may be that Alan Greenspan has abolished the business cycle, that Goldman Sachs' contented equity guru Abby Joseph Cohen is wiser than Irving Fisher, that Amazon.com is in a different league from RCA (the go-go stock of the 1920s). Maybe. However, there are plenty of warnings there for those prepared to heed them. One is what is happening in the markets themselves. More and more money is being concentrated in a handful of stocks in the technology sector, while shares in \"old industry\" fall. An analysis by Peter Oppenheimer, of HSBC, showed that the price-earnings gap in London between the new economy stocks and the old economy stocks is the largest for any market ever. An analysis of the balance sheet of Amazon.com by Tim Congdon of Lombard Street showed that liabilities were covered more than four times by holdings of cash and securities in early 1999. However, by the end of the year high investment and trading losses meant that liabilities were higher than cash and securities. He believes that the rise in the Nasdaq index is being underpinned by firms borrowing money to buy each other's shares - the equivalent of taking in each other's washing. Amazon.com's results, he says, give \"a fascinating and alarming insight into the cost of building an internet brand. Arguably, they also demonstrate that the hi-tech element in the American stock market is now gripped by a speculative madness of a kind never before seen in the organised financial markets of a significant industrial country.\" In the US, the economist Robert Gordon, has started to unpick the American productivity data in an attempt to put the \"new paradigm\" into historical perspective. \"I believe that the inventions of the late 19th century and early 20th century were more fundamental creators of productivity than the electronic-internet era of today,\" he said. Oppenheimer, at HSBC, estimates that share prices in the new economy imply growth rates that are unlikely to be achieved and that collectively they are overvalued by 40%. Survey's warning Sushil Wadhwani, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, quoted a survey last week showing that 133 internet companies that have gone public since 1995 would need on average to expand their revenues by 80% a year for the next five years. Microsoft, which has had a virtual monopoly, has managed 53% a year; Dell 66%. It is no wonder that Greenspan is doing his level best to massage share prices down. He knows that the alternative could be a full-scale panic. But even on the assumption that there is no re peat of 1929, there are certain conclusions to be drawn. First, the euro looks considerably undervalued against the US dollar. European exchanges have performed strongly in recent months. Equity investors seem to have cottoned on to the recovery in the European economy, but foreign exchange dealers - perhaps recalling how they were too long on euros around its launch - have not. Second, the real medium-term danger for the global economy will be deflation rather than inflation. A stroll down any high street shows that downward pressure on prices is strong; it would not take much to tip western economies from disinflation into deflation and even though policymakers believe that they have scope to ease monetary and fiscal policy, the experience of Japan in the 1990s suggests that such action may be more difficult than they think. A crash would have more profound implications, not least the rediscovery of the virtues of social democracy and the need for some curbs on the global money machine. A meltdown on Wall Street would be seen, rightly, as the crescendo of a period of financial turbulence that started a decade ago. Those who today are insistent that we are all Americans now would say that the US was just another Thailand waiting to happen. After all, the US has all the ingredients - a rising trade deficit, a consumer credit binge and wasteful investment in non-performing assets. At this point, it is traditional to say that a crash is to be avoided at all costs. Actually, it would be no bad thing. A shake-out would not mean that the benefits associated with the new technologies would be lost, any more than the end of the railway boom in the 19th century put an end to railways. But crashes do have the effect of cleansing the stables, and boy do these stables need cleansing. In the aftermath of the 1929 crash the policies of laissez-faire were cast aside in favour of controls on speculation and the financial system in general. Sadly, those lessons have been forgotten, with the result that we live in a state of perpetual financial instability and allow money idolatry to hollow out societies from the inside. \u0095 Devil Take the Hindmost; Macmillan. larry.elliott@theguardian.com",

Tomorrow the Lords will again be asked to approve the arrangements for May 4's mayoral election, which currently rules out the free mailshot for candidates that is a standard part of every major British election. The government's defence, hilariously, is that the contest for London mayor is a local election - admittedly a very big one, but a local election all the same. Never mind that London includes more voters than Scotland and Wales combined, the capital city is to be treated as a humble ward of a local parish council. This is pretty clearly just another ruse to block Ken - making it costly for him to spread his message. But it is also a shoddy piece of election tampering. The peer who said that \"fix and fiddle\" risks becoming to Labour what sleaze was to the Tories spoke good sense. Labour should listen to it.</p>",

Tomorrow the Lords will again be asked to approve the arrangements for May 4's mayoral election, which currently rules out the free mailshot for candidates that is a standard part of every major British election. The government's defence, hilariously, is that the contest for London mayor is a local election - admittedly a very big one, but a local election all the same. Never mind that London includes more voters than Scotland and Wales combined, the capital city is to be treated as a humble ward of a local parish council. This is pretty clearly just another ruse to block Ken - making it costly for him to spread his message. But it is also a shoddy piece of election tampering. The peer who said that \"fix and fiddle\" risks becoming to Labour what sleaze was to the Tories spoke good sense. Labour should listen to it.",

She had sworn to the court that she was guiltless of any adultery.</p> <p>At the time, and looking back now, the experience was wholly delightful. I did not believe that I was taking advantage of her; indeed, the alacrity with which I was dumped soon after her final decree suggests the opposite.

Everyone used to know what that meant, but now - following Bill Clinton's difficulty in categorising what he did with Monica - it may have to be spelled out in detail.</p> <p>The impetus arose from two high-profile cases. Lowell Halverson, a prominent Seattle family lawyer, admitted to sleeping with six women for whom he was acting.</p> <p>In the affair that made the news, he failed to tell his client-lover that, if they were found out, he would have to resign as her lawyer and that could prejudice her attempt to get custody of her daughter. The sexual bond had blinded him to his duty to give independent advice, to her detriment, the disciplinary board against him ruled. Halverson strongly, though unsuccessfully, contested the finding, claiming that he had broken no specific rule of conduct.</p> <p>The same defence was used, more flamboyantly, by Chicago attorney Richard Rinella, whose case was not helped when a client with whom he'd denied having sex produced a photo she'd taken of him naked.</p> <p>Allegations that he'd pestered clients to have sex with him in return for legal services resulted in his suspension for three years; his attempt to get the Supreme Court to rule that his sexual advances were protected by the first amendment - free speech - was treated with derision. His main point, though, was that there was no professional code forbidding what he'd done.</p> <p>The American national body clearly wants to put the issue beyond doubt by a firm no-sex rule. By contrast, the Law Society of England and Wales is far more relaxed.</p> <p>They don't see it as much of a problem. No one denies that it goes on. Anecdotally, there's a lot of it about. Most of the alarmist stories follow the formula of a distressed woman in a bad marriage seeking the help and advice of a lawyer and finding herself taken advantage of by the scheming professional (similar tales are told with vicars or doctors playing the baddie). But it's also clear that many affairs are fully consensual.</p> <p>Few cases reach the press. One of them involved a former solicitor to the Princess of Wales, Paul Butner. Another well-known matrimonial solicitor began a seven-year affair with his client which led to her husband complaining to the solicitors' complaints bureau. He was cleared of any misconduct - he had stopped being her solicitor when the relationship deepened.</p> <p>The official Law Society view is that it would be overkill to impose a total ban. \"If sleeping with clients was a disciplinary offence, the ranks of solicitors would be decimated,\" a top QC once commented drily to a judge who was angry at discovering that the solicitor in the case had slept with his client, a rock star's wife.</p> <p>Lawyer-client sex is mentioned twice in the solicitors' rules of conduct. Under the heading Conflicts of Interest, \"a solicitor who becomes involved in a sexual relationship with a client must consider whether this may place his or her interests in conflict with those of the client, or otherwise impair the solicitor's ability to act in the best interests of the client.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, the rules warn that \"while it would not necessarily be so, it may be an abuse of the solicitor-client fiduciary relationship for a solicitor to enter into a sexual relationship with a client.\"</p> <p>The code of practice for members of the specialist Solicitors' Family Law Association says only this: \"You should make sure that you are objective and do not allow your own emotions or personal opinions to influence your advice.\" In other words, it's all left to the good sense of the solicitor. If he (it's rarely she, it seems) finds himself entertaining sexual feelings towards his client, he should hand the case over to another lawyer, and play no further part in the proceedings.</p> <p>Most family lawyers I spoke to are convinced that a sexual and a professional relationship should not co-exist. \"It's not like a commercial case, where you're out to win and that's all that matters,\" says Helen Ward, a highly respected divorce solicitor with the London firm Manches. \"In family cases you've got a duty to try to get the best results for the children, for the family. You can't look at it through a narrow telescope, thinking only of your client's interests. You've got to be totally objective about the steps that need to be taken to secure an acceptable solution, and you've got to be able to see the other side's point of view. If you're sexually or emotionally involved, it impedes your ability to be objective, and you give rubbish advice.\"</p> <p>Ray Tooth, an equally well-known matrimonial lawyer, is not so sure. A few years ago, he had an affair with a client, which had begun after her divorce had gone through. He doesn't see why lawyer-client relationships are necessarily professionally wrong. \"It all depends on how much she's involved, how much he's involved. You can't assume that it's the lawyer who's made all the running. Of course if the lawyer's been overbearing, taking advantage, that's different.\"</p> <p>He's not even convinced that a lawyer who starts a relationship with a client should automatically have to hand over the case to someone else. \"It all depends. Is it love or lust? If it's true love, then perhaps he should; if it's just a fling, I don't think it matters much.\"</p> <p>In America, critics of the proposed wholesale ban argue that, at the very least, there should be a distinction between family lawyers and the rest.</p> <p>The lawyer involved with a woman who comes for a divorce takes on her anger, her bad feelings towards her husband, perhaps her bitterness and desire for revenge. He starts taking her side, not as a dispassionate adviser, but as a party to the emotional turmoil. Feelings are enhanced if there's a dispute over children.</p> <p>The lawyer in a commercial case, by contrast, it's said, doesn't develop personal emotions towards the large corporation or insurance company he's suing. The advice he dishes out can be dispassionate, because it's based on hard law, not people's behaviour.</p> <p>But is there such a difference? The lawyer in lust or love - in whatever field of law - will surely be tempted to make rash promises, to put the most favourable gloss on her case so as not to disappoint her, to convince himself that she has a good case when she hasn't; perhaps even to cut legal corners. In the end, the result is the same as in anguished family cases: the client doesn't get the best advice.</p> <p>Lawyers, it's often argued, ought to be put on the same ethical professional footing as doctors. Ray Tooth recalls a joke his lawyer uncle told him about the difference between the two professions. \"A doctor can touch his patient's body but not her money; a lawyer can lay his hands on his client's money but not her body.\"</p> <p>Or, as a senior Law Society official put it, \"People say that lawyers should be treated the same as doctors.

The legal effects of this were to occupy three magistrates and eight senior judges, including two lord chancellors, and cost the taxpayer a six-figure sum before it reached its conclusion last week in the House of Lords.</p> <p>A shiner, \"in the language of today's gilded youth, apparently means, not a black eye, but an act of oral sex\", explained Mr Justice Rougier in the high court. The boy was prosecuted under the Indecency with Children Act 1960, for inciting a child under 14 to commit an act of gross indecency, a charge carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. It was a new offence, brought in after two cases in which paedophiles who induced children to perform sexual acts on them were found not guilty of any offence.</p> <p>The boy said he thought the girl was over 14. But was this a defence? Parliament, when it passed the act, was silent on the question. Did that mean it was a \"strict liability\" offence, where the perpetrator was guilty regardless of what he thought?</p> <p>The boy's lawyers argued that his belief that the girl was over 14 was a defence. But the magis trates said no. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an 18-month supervision order. He appealed to the high court, where three judges upheld the magistrates' ruling. Lord Justice Brooke noted the court spent \"a day and a half at the taxpayer's expense exploring the highways and byways of our laws on sexual offences\" because parliament had not made its intentions clear.</p> <p>The taxpayer had to fork out more money when the boy appealed to the Lords. There, five judges heard the appeal and unanimously came to the opposite conclusion. The judges said parliament had not expressly stated that the defendant's belief was no defence, nor could the implication that that was its intention be drawn from looking at other offences.</p> <p>The result is that adult paedophiles may now get off by claiming they thought the child was over 14. It will be for the prosecution to prove otherwise. As Lord Nicholls said: \"If parliament considers that the position should be otherwise regarding this serious social problem, parliament must itself confront the difficulties and express its will in clear terms.\"</p>",

The boy was prosecuted under the Indecency with Children Act 1960, for inciting a child under 14 to commit an act of gross indecency, a charge carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. It was a new offence, brought in after two cases in which paedophiles who induced children to perform sexual acts on them were found not guilty of any offence. The boy said he thought the girl was over 14. But was this a defence? Parliament, when it passed the act, was silent on the question. Did that mean it was a \"strict liability\" offence, where the perpetrator was guilty regardless of what he thought? The boy's lawyers argued that his belief that the girl was over 14 was a defence. But the magis trates said no. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to an 18-month supervision order. He appealed to the high court, where three judges upheld the magistrates' ruling. Lord Justice Brooke noted the court spent \"a day and a half at the taxpayer's expense exploring the highways and byways of our laws on sexual offences\" because parliament had not made its intentions clear. The taxpayer had to fork out more money when the boy appealed to the Lords. There, five judges heard the appeal and unanimously came to the opposite conclusion. The judges said parliament had not expressly stated that the defendant's belief was no defence, nor could the implication that that was its intention be drawn from looking at other offences. The result is that adult paedophiles may now get off by claiming they thought the child was over 14. It will be for the prosecution to prove otherwise. As Lord Nicholls said: \"If parliament considers that the position should be otherwise regarding this serious social problem, parliament must itself confront the difficulties and express its will in clear terms.\"",

Mr Jospin, who flew back to France - and straight into a big domestic row - earlier than planned on Saturday night, upset Arab leaders and provoked furious protests from West Bank students on Thursday by describing Hizbullah attacks on Israeli occupation soldiers in south Lebanon as \"terrorist acts\". Mr Chirac's office said yesterday that the president - who by longstanding French tradition enjoys primacy in foreign policy matters - had telephoned Mr Jospin immediately after his return, forcefully reminding him of France's delicate \"equilibrium\" in its dealings with Israel and the Arab world. Mr Chirac \"reaffirmed the consistancy of French foreign policy and the equilibrium that drives our interaction in the Middle East, an interaction that remains unchanged.

Mr Jospin later toned down, but did not withdraw, his comments, referring to Hizbullah's \"acts of war\". But that was not enough to pacify angry Palestinian students at Bir Zeit university, who on Saturday pelted him with stones and jumped on his bullet-proof Mercedes. French opinion is divided over whether the prime minister meant what he said. The leftwing newspaper Lib\u00e9ration criticised him for a \"blunder\" that had caused \"considerable damage\", while the populist Le Parisien said it was a bad mistake that would unbalance the \"cohabitation\" - the delicate power-sharing relationship between a con servative president and a Socialist prime minister. But many commentators thought Mr Jospin's remarks were far from a slip of the tongue. The authoritative Le Monde said the prime minister fully intended to criticise Syria's efforts to block the peace process in Lebanon and was \"expressing truths that may not please everyone, but are a mark of his character and determination\". Conservative opponents accused Mr Jospin of compromising France's relations in a particularly sensitive region of the world by trying to score domestic political points against the president in the run-up to the two leaders' likely battle for the French presidency in 2002. \"As the elections approach, the prime minister will want to be more and more present on the international scene,\" said Pascal Boniface, the head of the Institute for International and Strategic Relations. \"The tone will get even tougher.\"",

We're working on what the definition of an atrocity is,\" Major Michael Boehme, information officer Camp Monteith, the US base in Gnjilane, told the Guardian yesterday.</p> <p>The K-For commander, General Klaus Reinhardt, along with Dr Bernard Kouchner, the top UN administrator and the American general in command of the eastern sector, were preparing detailed guidelines, he said.Gary Carrell, an American policeman who commands the UN police in the area, said his staff had held \"preliminary meetings\" with the Serbian police on the border in the last few weeks.</p> <p>Albanians cross the border freely and the main aim was to prevent people involved in assassinations of Serbs from slipping away. \"We're pretty sure the suspects in the killing of three Serbs in Kosovo last month were from Presevo,\" he said. But the plan for further meetings with the Serb police was vetoed by Jock Covey, the American who is deputy head of the UN administration. The Serb police, known as the MUP, won a fearful reputation among Albanians during last year's expulsions and killings.</p> <p>It is hard to gauge what support the UCPMB has. Hundreds of people from the region have fled to Kosovo in recent weeks because of stepped-up Serb police action and alleged intimidation.</p> <p>An inhabitant of Bujenovac, who has brought his family to Kosovo, said he spoke for many when he denounced the UCPMB. But he insisted on anonymity. \"In Presevo it is not so bad, since the population is 95% Albanian. In Bujenovac where the Serbs are 40% it is much tougher for Albanians,\" he said.</p> <p>Yugoslav officials agree that violence in the region is growing. General Vladimir Lazarevic, the commander of the Yugoslav Third Army, told a Belgrade newspaper recently that \"the adverse political and security situation in Kosovo is spreading to municipalities bordering Kosovo\".</p> <p>But he rejected the notion that Albanians leaving the area for Kosovo were refugees. \"This is a plan aimed at convincing the world that Serbia is expelling Albanians.\" He added that K-For wanted to provide a pretext for more drastic measures, diplomatic, political, and perhaps military.</p>",

Local Serb police are allowed to operate in the zone, but Yugoslav army troops and special police with heavy weapons are forbidden. Although US forces who control Kosovo's eastern sector send low-flying helicopters along the border line, they respect Serbia's sovereignty by not penetrating the buffer zone. But the ceasefire agreement has a major loophole. Negotiated in a rush as part of the package which put Kosovo under United Nations administration, it said any violation \"would be subject to K-For military action\" but did not specify what exactly might trigger a K-For response. \"If atrocities occur in the area, we will go in and take action. We're working on what the definition of an atrocity is,\" Major Michael Boehme, information officer Camp Monteith, the US base in Gnjilane, told the Guardian yesterday. The K-For commander, General Klaus Reinhardt, along with Dr Bernard Kouchner, the top UN administrator and the American general in command of the eastern sector, were preparing detailed guidelines, he said.Gary Carrell, an American policeman who commands the UN police in the area, said his staff had held \"preliminary meetings\" with the Serbian police on the border in the last few weeks. Albanians cross the border freely and the main aim was to prevent people involved in assassinations of Serbs from slipping away. \"We're pretty sure the suspects in the killing of three Serbs in Kosovo last month were from Presevo,\" he said. But the plan for further meetings with the Serb police was vetoed by Jock Covey, the American who is deputy head of the UN administration. The Serb police, known as the MUP, won a fearful reputation among Albanians during last year's expulsions and killings. It is hard to gauge what support the UCPMB has. Hundreds of people from the region have fled to Kosovo in recent weeks because of stepped-up Serb police action and alleged intimidation. An inhabitant of Bujenovac, who has brought his family to Kosovo, said he spoke for many when he denounced the UCPMB. But he insisted on anonymity. \"In Presevo it is not so bad, since the population is 95% Albanian. In Bujenovac where the Serbs are 40% it is much tougher for Albanians,\" he said. Yugoslav officials agree that violence in the region is growing. General Vladimir Lazarevic, the commander of the Yugoslav Third Army, told a Belgrade newspaper recently that \"the adverse political and security situation in Kosovo is spreading to municipalities bordering Kosovo\". But he rejected the notion that Albanians leaving the area for Kosovo were refugees. \"This is a plan aimed at convincing the world that Serbia is expelling Albanians.\" He added that K-For wanted to provide a pretext for more drastic measures, diplomatic, political, and perhaps military.",

In my husband's life, his strongest role is in his job, but I have that and the role of wife and mother. We need a space to be just us - without the children.\" Time at home, alone, without chores, is still often felt as shirking responsibility. De Motte, for example, won't attend NWR meetings if her husband is away because employing a babysitter would \"leave me guilt-ridden\".</p> <p>So although most women can now define themselves by a paid job, it is often a definition in addition to, not instead of, domestic labour.

But it is still not quite big enough for the sets of Rudolph Nureyev's version of La Bayad\u00e9re which the Paris Opera Ballet is bringing to Salford to open the centre's 1,730-seat Lyric theatre in May. So having been transported from France in 15 huge trucks, the sets will spill over into the back-stage scene dock to leave plenty of dance space for the company which is making its first visit to Britain for 15 years. It is stopping for just five performances before packing all the scenery back into the trucks and heading south down the M6 to the channel. There should be no crowding problems in the enormous pit, which will be filled with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in an unusual accompanying role. Ticket prices will range from \u00a348 (\"There won't be a better view of any stage anywhere than from the two seats at the centre of the front row of the dress circle,\" boasted Robert Robson, the Lowry's theatres director) to \u00a312 in an upper circle which will be close enough to the action to make opera glasses redundant. While the French dancers leap next door, the Royal National Theatre will perform its new production of Ted Hughes's version of the Oresteia by Aeschylus in the smaller Quays theatre (466 seats). The style of the Quays is a blend of the Cottesloe at the National and the Swan at Stratford. The Lowry project, costing \u00a396.4m and including a spectacular footbridge which will link it to the Imperial War Museum North across the ship canal, also provides space for 350 works by the Salford artist in whose honour it is named. Within weeks, Lowry's paintings and drawings will be moved from their present home near Salford university to new galleries running alongside the two auditoria and a Lowry study centre will be established in a tall drum tower. The rest of the building will be given over to restaurants, bars, shops, wide public spaces and Artworks, a unique gallery area which sets out to encourage creativity in adults and children. The Lowry, the national landmark millennium project for the arts, attracted a unique package of huge grants from the arts council, the millennium commission and the heritage lottery fund. Its significance in the region is the equivalent of the Covent Garden redevelopment in London. It has already been dubbed Salford's Guggenheim and will be closely watched after its big glass doors officially open on April 28 to see if it can succeed in pulling in the crowds from Salford and beyond. The Royal Shakespeare Company will make a visit early in 2001.",

      "bodyText": "Britons rate their mobile phones as a necessity of modern life - whether they are on the street, in bed or even on the toilet, a survey revealed yesterday. Mobiles, once identified as the ultimate \"yuppie\" accessory, are no longer seen as a luxury by most of Britain's 24m owners, with 62% seeing them as an essential part of life. The survey of more than 1,000 adults, commissioned by Philips Consumer Communications, found that eight out of 10 mobile owners said they would never throw their phone away, while 15% use their mobiles more than their home phones. Despite widespread public antipathy, 68% of owners are not embarrassed to use a mobile phone in public. More than 2.5m people answered their phone on the toilet and nearly 250,000 responded to calls while having sex. While almost half of all mobiles were initially purchased for use in emergencies such as a car breakdown, two-thirds of calls are social and a third are work-related. The survey also found that, regardless of the range of hi-tech features, reception quality and price remain the most important considerations for buyers, while text messaging was important to 20% of 16- to 24-year-olds, but had little appeal for the over-45s.",

      "bodyText": "Police in the west country have launched an investigation into what could turn out to be one of the country's biggest child abuse scandals involving as many as 20,000 children in council care. Avon and Somerset police have set up incident rooms in Bristol and Taunton to investigate allegations of institutional abuse during the 1960s, 70s and 80s at residential homes. More than 30 officers have been assigned to the inquiry, which could take up to five years. The investigation has so far focused on three homes: the Olands observation and assessment centre in Milverton, near Taunton, Somerset, the Kingswood assessment centre and the Kingswood secure unit, both in Bristol. More than 20,000 boys passed through the two Bristol centres before they were demolished in the 1980s, and several hundred boys and girls passed through Milverton before it closed in 1993. The inquiry was launched after several former residents came forward following the recent Bryn Alyn care home scandal in north Wales. Several arrests have already been made but senior detectives are said to be overwhelmed by the scale of the abuse they have uncovered. The inquiry started after allegations of abuse from former residents of the Forde Park approved school in Newton Abbott, Devon. Officers found a disturbing pattern of abuse at the Bristol homes and the investigation was expanded. Many of the suspected victims were boys and girls who passed through the homes before moving back home, to foster homes or another institution. Steve Pilkington, chief constable of Avon and Somerset, said: \"This should put out a strong message to those people who prey on the vulnerable.\" A force spokesman confirmed a 50-year-old man arrested in connection with the Taunton inquiry had been released on police bail. A 55-year-old man who worked in the Milverton home was bailed pending further inquiries. A Somerset social services spokesman said: \"We are co-operating fully with the police and will do all we can to assist them in their inquiries.\" News of the investigation comes two weeks after the publication of Lost in Care, the report of the Waterhouse inquiry into abuse in north Wales children's homes. Sir Ronald Waterhouse recommended a massive overhaul of the care system after uncovering a paedophile ring that targeted hundreds of young people in care in the 70s and 80s. The report condemned social workers, children's home staff, police and local councils and made more than 70 recommendations to protect the 4,000 children cared for by local authorities in Wales. In another inquiry, the Metropolitan police are investigating claims that 200 children in the south London borough of Lambeth may have been sexually and physically abused between 1974 and 1994. The Operation Middleton investigation, which began last year after police in Merseyside arrested a former council worker, gained momentum after five more victims contacted police after the Waterhouse report. The allegations cover more than 20 homes run by Lambeth. The inquiry, which centres on Lambeth council's social services department, has led to seven arrests and the suspension of 10 staff employed by the borough.

Now it is essential that this approach is backed with action.\" </p> <p>The prime minister will today be provided with a reminder of his earlier enthusiasm when the Guardian discloses that Britain agreed to help the United States sell GM food to Europe in 1998, after intense pressure from President Bill Clinton. </p> <p>Documents obtained under the US freedom of information act show that Mr Clinton lobbied Mr Blair to open up Britain and Europe during private talks in Downing Street in 1998. A day after the meeting Britain set in motion changes to make it easier for more GM food to be sold in Britain and Europe. </p> <p>The meeting came as the prime minister was insisting that scientific research should be allowed to continue into GM foods because it could be the technology of the future. </p> <p>Yesterday's sea-change in his attitude came on the eve of a three-day conference in Edinburgh at which the critics of the industry are expected to lambast the government. </p> <p>The government also faces another embarrassment because the backlash against GM crops has been so great that the biotech industry is unable to find enough British farmers willing to grow them during trials due to start on March 1. </p> <p>An emergency meeting of the industry committee on February 8 was held because they could not find enough farmers to provide 75 fields for the four years of trials needed to prove that GM crops are not harmful to the environment. Another meeting is to be held on March 10 to decide what to do. </p> <p>Planting should start in 25 fields on Wednesday but not enough farmers can be found to take part. The trials are a cornerstone of government's tests to see if the environment is harmed by the growing of these crops. </p> <p>English Nature and an independent body of scientists were to spend four years examining the evidence and advising the government. The industry had agreed to hold off commercial sales until the study is complete. With his new doubts about the technology it is hard to see how Mr Blair could allow the crops to be planted without first reassuring the green lobby with independent scientific evidence that they were safe. </p> <p>Yesterday a ship carrying GM soya from the United States turned back after a two day occupation by five Greenpeace volunteers. They were arrested after chaining themselves inside the anchor room but later released without charge.</p>",

Now it is essential that this approach is backed with action.\" The prime minister will today be provided with a reminder of his earlier enthusiasm when the Guardian discloses that Britain agreed to help the United States sell GM food to Europe in 1998, after intense pressure from President Bill Clinton. Documents obtained under the US freedom of information act show that Mr Clinton lobbied Mr Blair to open up Britain and Europe during private talks in Downing Street in 1998. A day after the meeting Britain set in motion changes to make it easier for more GM food to be sold in Britain and Europe. The meeting came as the prime minister was insisting that scientific research should be allowed to continue into GM foods because it could be the technology of the future. Yesterday's sea-change in his attitude came on the eve of a three-day conference in Edinburgh at which the critics of the industry are expected to lambast the government. The government also faces another embarrassment because the backlash against GM crops has been so great that the biotech industry is unable to find enough British farmers willing to grow them during trials due to start on March 1. An emergency meeting of the industry committee on February 8 was held because they could not find enough farmers to provide 75 fields for the four years of trials needed to prove that GM crops are not harmful to the environment. Another meeting is to be held on March 10 to decide what to do. Planting should start in 25 fields on Wednesday but not enough farmers can be found to take part. The trials are a cornerstone of government's tests to see if the environment is harmed by the growing of these crops. English Nature and an independent body of scientists were to spend four years examining the evidence and advising the government. The industry had agreed to hold off commercial sales until the study is complete. With his new doubts about the technology it is hard to see how Mr Blair could allow the crops to be planted without first reassuring the green lobby with independent scientific evidence that they were safe. Yesterday a ship carrying GM soya from the United States turned back after a two day occupation by five Greenpeace volunteers. They were arrested after chaining themselves inside the anchor room but later released without charge.",

      "bodyText": "Prince Charles was made an honorary village chief by the Amerindian natives of Guyana yesterday, and toasted his new status with a heavy local brew made from jungle root. The prince was presented with a Surama tribe head-dress fashioned from eagle feathers before a group of local girls serenaded him with a song in praise of eco-tourism. Members of the Surama tribe - one of nine tribes scattered throughout the remote rainforest hinterland of Guyana - demonstrated how to make an alcoholic drink called pacari. He took a sip - although his reaction was out of earshot. The prince took a private walk into the heart of the rainforest, accompanied by Dr David Cassells, who is director general of the UN-funded conservation project in the area. Dr Cassells said: \"We would very much like a high-profile champion for our forest.\" It appears that the prince was willing to oblige. After emerging from the undergrowth, he said: \"It is very peaceful - the sheer size of the trees is amazing.\" The 50,000 Amerindians are among the poorest of Guyana's 1m citizens. They struggle to fend for themselves through traditional industries such as hunting and fishing, while the arrival of forestry and mining developments have imposed modern tensions. In an attempt to protect the native population, the UN is funding an aid programme for the rain forest region, for which the prince voiced his support yesterday. The prince is well-known for his interest in the environment. He may have felt at home in an area where experts have recorded 206 species of fish, and 120 of snakes, lizards and frogs. They believe there may be up to 2,000 plant varieties and 450 types of bird. Later, Prince Charles visited one of Guyana's secret marvels: the falls at Kaieteur. Five times the height of Niagara, these waterfalls support a delicate eco-system including 100 species of orchid. To view the Potaro river cascading 741ft down the world's longest unbroken waterfall is a privilege accorded only to a few. Tourism barely figures in the economy of Guyana. According to Amerindian legend, the Patamona tribal chief, Kaie, paddled over the falls, sacrificing himself to the spirits to save his tribe and appease the gods. The future of the monarchy may be uncertain, and Prince Charles's aides took no chances. He was kept at a safe distance, one third of a mile away.",

      "bodyText": "John Prescott yesterday lifted the lid on the government's biggest internal row when he admitted that ministers were failing to inspire grassroots activists who claim that Downing Street has abandoned the Labour heartlands. Speaking hours before Tony Blair's keynote speech to mark Labour's centenary, the deputy prime minister warned of the catastrophic dangers of a party \"losing heart\". In a sign of his own dissatisfaction, Mr Prescott said that Labour had undermined itself by holding elections in Scotland and Wales under proportional representation. He also gave a strong hint that he was still in favour of higher taxes. Mr Prescott's intervention came as Mr Blair attempted to reach out to party activists by saying that he was determined to turn Labour into the \"natural party of progress\". In his centenary speech at the Old Vic theatre in south London, the prime minister set out \"five great goals\" for the next century. They include the abolition of child poverty, full employment, creating the world's best health service and achieving educational excellence for all. \"We do not exist simply to govern,\" he said. \"We are there to transform. It is not enough for us to be the natural party of government. We must be the natural party of progress.\" But Mr Blair's attempt to reach out to the grassroots was overshadowed by Mr Prescott, who admitted in public what ministers have long complained of in private: that activists remain wary of New Labour. Speaking on BBC1's On the Record, the deputy prime minister said that many supporters did not know what the gov ernment was doing \"largely because we are not getting our message out to many of our own people\". Mr Prescott said the prime minister's reforms of the party, which were designed to encourage new members to involve themselves in Labour activities, were proving a success. But he agreed that Labour was having difficulties in bringing out its core voters. \"If you don't keep contact with your activists you will reap the kind of problems the Tories had,\" he said. \"They begin to walk away and then the government doesn't have any support in the country. The party must have a heart to want to go out and fight.\" The deputy prime minister made it clear that he understood the concerns of activists when he said taxes \"could be more progressive\" and he attacked the prime minister's de cision to introduce proportional representation for the elections to the devolved bodies in Scotland and Wales. \"The other thing, to be honest, I think that's undermined us a bit is that when we had this whole PR in elections, where the party [has seen its strength go down]... we've seen PR, perhaps we've had enough of it,\" Mr Prescott said. The deputy prime minister tempered his remarks by say ing the government had made remarkable progress in meeting the concerns of activists, through the introduction of the minimum wage and the working families tax credit. This message was reinforced by the prime minister in his centenary speech, when he cast himself as a \"crusader\" who wanted to right injustices. But Mr Blair also issued a warning that Labour must win the support of all communities or risk losing power if it retreats back to a \"narrow base\" as it did in the early 1980s. \"When we have won we have won a broad coalition of support, from all walks of life, all parts of the country,\" the prime minister said. \"When we have lost we have retreated to a narrow base.\"",

No further programmes will be consummated. </p> <p>Two points of general relevance to television are made by this fiasco: the risk posed to the medium by exhibitionists, and the fact that, in an age of general moral tolerance about sexual behaviour, relationships have become one of the most important territories for broadcasting to explore. Both of these lessons are demonstrated by The Ex-Files (Wednesday, 10.30pm, Channel 4), a new series in which people revisit old lovers in an attempt to find a pattern in their past relationships. </p> <p>It's standard now to describe the accumulated influence of previous partners as \"baggage\". The Ex-Files is a kind of baggage search although, unlike at airports, you can conduct the check yourself. In episode one, Becky - whom viewers are told is a 35-year-old with 15 previous relationships, uncertain whether to commit to her current lover, Carl - goes back to re-open her two most important previous pieces of baggage. Guy was her first love, an older man. She deliberately ended their affair by openly snogging Luke in front of him at a party. Guy is now married with three children and running a hotel. Supposedly - it is always wise to say supposedly with television these days - he had not seen her since he found her skewered on Luke's tongue. He waited on the residents' lawn with a bottle of wine. You hoped the producers hadn't calculated that, if a spark happened still to be there, there were numerous bedrooms nearby in which it might be ignited. </p> <p>When they meet on the lawn, they exchange the great social lie that neither has changed to look at, although you possibly sense a mutual relief not to be seeing that on a pillow. Speaking to the camera as she drove to meet him, Becky expressed fears that she had hurt him and claimed to be seeking \"forgiveness\". But, during their chat, she seems peeved that she was not given instructions to a hut somewhere in which Guy The Hermit was staring at her picture. \"You got over me pretty quickly then\", she chides him as he describes his emotional recovery. </p> <p>There is a low-key truth to this encounter: two old lovers coolly sipping drinks and wondering if they perhaps imagined the thrashing bodies of the past. But the series, if it is to work, needs pain and hatred and, in Becky's second rendez-vous, we get it. Luke - now 30 and single and living in Denmark - meets her in Hampton Court, a site of former happy moments and therefore a promisingly dangerous place for a reunion. You get the sense that Becky sees herself as a leaver, but Luke left her. </p> <p>As soon as they meet, it's like the moment in a restaurant when a domestic at one table kills all other conversation as people listen to what they hope may be a contrast but fear may be a preview. Luke, playing to a stereotype of laddish insensivity as many of the boys on Blind Date do, says that he has \"spent no time thinking about my ex-girlfriends\". The screen crackles with antagonism. If there were such a profession as emotional baggage-handlers, they would have walked out on strike here, demanding overtime. As they disagree over all key details of what happened, Luke says: \"Am I right in thinking that it was me who ended the relationship?\" </p> <p>In the third section of the programme, Becky and her current luggage, Carl, walk on a Somerset beach while discussing whether they have a future and - a late-dropped detail which undermines the established tone of the show - the death of their child. Like other recent Channel 4 series - Something For The Weekend, So Graham Norton - this one seems to establish that the thirtysomething generation has no concept of emotional or sexual privacy. Television sound-men hear things that only Catholic priests in the confessional used to. </p> <p>Although The Ex-Files is technically about romance, its main interest is the blood sports of the heart. Viewers are used to Blind Date. This is, with due apology to Kubrick, a kind of Eyes Wide Shut Date. Whereas someone tuning into Cilla's programme may occasionally have to sit through an encounter which went well, The Ex-Files guarantees at best wariness and at worst confrontation, although the viewer is probably most held by the possibility that a spent relationship will be recharged. </p> <p>Blind Date receives most publicity when a wedding results from one of its encounters. The Ex-Files - if it works in the way that viewers and possibly producers secretly want - may be responsible for divorces. Baggage left lying around, as they warn at airports and tube stations, may be exploded.</p>",

Luke, playing to a stereotype of laddish insensivity as many of the boys on Blind Date do, says that he has \"spent no time thinking about my ex-girlfriends\". The screen crackles with antagonism. If there were such a profession as emotional baggage-handlers, they would have walked out on strike here, demanding overtime. As they disagree over all key details of what happened, Luke says: \"Am I right in thinking that it was me who ended the relationship?\" In the third section of the programme, Becky and her current luggage, Carl, walk on a Somerset beach while discussing whether they have a future and - a late-dropped detail which undermines the established tone of the show - the death of their child. Like other recent Channel 4 series - Something For The Weekend, So Graham Norton - this one seems to establish that the thirtysomething generation has no concept of emotional or sexual privacy. Television sound-men hear things that only Catholic priests in the confessional used to. Although The Ex-Files is technically about romance, its main interest is the blood sports of the heart. Viewers are used to Blind Date. This is, with due apology to Kubrick, a kind of Eyes Wide Shut Date. Whereas someone tuning into Cilla's programme may occasionally have to sit through an encounter which went well, The Ex-Files guarantees at best wariness and at worst confrontation, although the viewer is probably most held by the possibility that a spent relationship will be recharged. Blind Date receives most publicity when a wedding results from one of its encounters. The Ex-Files - if it works in the way that viewers and possibly producers secretly want - may be responsible for divorces. Baggage left lying around, as they warn at airports and tube stations, may be exploded.",

      "body": "<p>Dozens, possibly hundreds, of people were swept to their deaths by surging flood waters in Mozambique yesterday as too few rescue helicopters battled to save survivors clinging to trees and roofs, and crammed into ever shrinking strips of high ground.</p> <p>The Mozambican government appealed for more aircraft to back up five South African military helicopters which are battling to save thousands of people from surging river waters.</p> <p>Up to 60,000 people were yesterday attempting to flee the town of Chokwe, where waters rose by about six feet in a few hours and were predicted to surge significantly higher with a new bout of flooding. Surrounding low-lying villages have completely disappeared.</p> <p>One helicopter pilot wept as he described his desperation at being able to save just a few dozen people at a time.</p> <p>\"People are just disappearing. We can't get to them all in time. We see people stuck and when we fly back they've gone,\" he said.</p> <p>One helicopter crew said they had flown over a cluster of houses with people waving for help. When they returned later, the homes had vanished into a vast lake broken only by the tips of a few tall trees and telegraph poles. The people were nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>The storm waters surged yesterday as tropical cyclone Eline, which hit Mozambique last week, delivered a second blow. The cyclone had moved on to South Africa and Zimbabwe where its rains further swelled three rivers - the Limpopo, the Save and the Incomati - which flow back into Mozambique.</p> <p><b> Wall of water</b><br></p> <p>Eline's torrential winds and rain have flooded eastern and southern Zimbabwe, making an estimated 250,000 people homeless and killing at least 62. Hundreds of Zimbabwe's rural communities have been forced to flee floodwaters and for most of the weekend a single helicopter struggled to pluck people from treetops in eastern Manicaland province.</p> <p>It was a wall of water travelling the length of the Limpopo which consumed Chokwe. Tens of thousands more people are trapped in the Save river valley, 600 miles north of the capital Maputo.</p> <p>At least 50 were drowned as the town of Nova Mambone virtually disappeared underwater where the Save river meets the sea. Thousands of people are trapped on narrow islands of high ground in the area with no food or shelter.</p> <p>Similar devastation has hit northern parts of South Africa where bridges and roads have been destroyed, and farms flooded. But Mozambique is bearing the brunt of the floods.</p> <p>Ian Macleod of the UN children's fund, Unicef, said another wave of water is expected to hit southern and central Mozambique almost immediately and a third will sweep across the area on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"There is a dramatic urgency. Our window of opportunity is very small. A lot of people have to be moved from one area to another. The number of rescue assets, whether it be helicopters or boats or whatever, is insufficient. We need to get more in there,\" he said.</p> <p>Britain has donated $1m (\u00a3625,000) to keep the South African helicopters flying. They have provided the backbone of rescue operations over the past fortnight but their exhausted crews have been forced to abandon their original missions to deliver food and medicines to areas hit by the ear lier floods in favour of rescuing victims of the latest crisis.</p> <p>The survivors say the effects of the flooding are worse than those of Mozambique's very brutal 16-year civil war. Then they may have had to flee the rebels, but they usually returned to find their homes intact. Now, when they return, everything is destroyed.</p> <p>Madeleine Mucantcho spent three days in a tree as the flood waters swept away everything she owned. Her feat was all the more remarkable because she is well in to her 70s.</p> <p>\"Some people swam away on the first day. There wasn't a man to help me so I just had to stay in the tree.</p> <p>\"After three days, some of them came back and told us they heard that there was more water coming and we will drown if we stay. I cannot swim properly so it took me hours to get to the road,\" she said. \"I've seen different floods but not like this one.\"</p> <p>Mrs Mucantcho comes from the village of Ngoyene, which is now a dot in the middle of a sprawling lake of flood water about 30 miles wide. Most of its villagers were eventually plucked to safety by a South African helicopter operating from a stretch of main road which has been turned into a runway just outside the town of Palmeiras.</p> <p>The road used to be the main route along the north coast, through Xai-Xai and on to the port of Beira. But a few miles beyond Palmeiras the highway was swept away by a brand new river created by the floods.</p> <p>Several hundred yards of road have been pummelled out of existence by the massive surge of water. On either side, the water stretches for miles over farmland that fed hundreds of families.</p> <p>Mrs Mucantcho and the rest of the villagers do not now intend to return to live in Ngoyene.</p> <p>\"Every day I go and see how the water is. If the floods go, I will go back to plant but I can't live there,\" she said.</p> <p>Another of the villagers, Fabiao Matchovane Lhongo, said Ngoyene's residents were now constructing a new settlement near Palmeiras.</p> <p>\"We are building a village here. They have told us this is our land forever. We will live here and keep our ducks and goats and then we will go back to look after our crops in our fields. It is a long walk - nearly two hours - but we will never live there again,\" he said.</p> <p>Finding land is not as difficult as it might be elsewhere in Africa. Mozambique is not an overcrowded country and most agricultural land is still owned by the government, despite American pressure to privatise it. Many local authorities have swiftly reassigned the land for the displaced.</p> <p>Where the highway abruptly ends after Palmeiras, a group of men who usually work in gold mines in South Africa were stripped to their underwear and preparing to wade through chest-deep water on their way on to find out what happened to their villages.</p> <p><b> Worse to come</b><br></p> <p>Dinis Tivane was among them. He was given six days off from the Western Area mine near Johannesburg to try and make it to Josina Machel village. He eyed two buses swept from the road by the force of water and planted into the mud as he speculated on the fate of his home.</p> <p>\"I haven't heard anything about my village. I don't know what happened to my family. In Johannesburg all we heard was our country was disappearing under water. I don't know what I'll find. Probably nothing,\" he said.</p> <p>Perhaps the worst will come when the waters recede. That will expose the carcasses of thousands of animals which can only compound the problems created by a severe lack of clean drinking water. The first case of cholera has been reported, and the number of malaria cases is three times higher than normal even for the rainy season, when the disease is rampant.</p> <p>\u0095 Readers who want to donate money to the relief operation can phone donations to the British Red Cross on 0870 444 3444 or send a cheque to British Red Cross, Freepost, Mid21782, Halesowen B63 3BR.</p> <p>Donations will help to provide blankets, medical equipment, water tanks, tents and plastic sheeting, as well as building materials, seeds and tools.</p>",

The cyclone had moved on to South Africa and Zimbabwe where its rains further swelled three rivers - the Limpopo, the Save and the Incomati - which flow back into Mozambique. Wall of water Eline's torrential winds and rain have flooded eastern and southern Zimbabwe, making an estimated 250,000 people homeless and killing at least 62. Hundreds of Zimbabwe's rural communities have been forced to flee floodwaters and for most of the weekend a single helicopter struggled to pluck people from treetops in eastern Manicaland province. It was a wall of water travelling the length of the Limpopo which consumed Chokwe. Tens of thousands more people are trapped in the Save river valley, 600 miles north of the capital Maputo. At least 50 were drowned as the town of Nova Mambone virtually disappeared underwater where the Save river meets the sea. Thousands of people are trapped on narrow islands of high ground in the area with no food or shelter. Similar devastation has hit northern parts of South Africa where bridges and roads have been destroyed, and farms flooded. But Mozambique is bearing the brunt of the floods. Ian Macleod of the UN children's fund, Unicef, said another wave of water is expected to hit southern and central Mozambique almost immediately and a third will sweep across the area on Wednesday. \"There is a dramatic urgency. Our window of opportunity is very small. A lot of people have to be moved from one area to another. The number of rescue assets, whether it be helicopters or boats or whatever, is insufficient. We need to get more in there,\" he said. Britain has donated $1m (\u00a3625,000) to keep the South African helicopters flying. They have provided the backbone of rescue operations over the past fortnight but their exhausted crews have been forced to abandon their original missions to deliver food and medicines to areas hit by the ear lier floods in favour of rescuing victims of the latest crisis. The survivors say the effects of the flooding are worse than those of Mozambique's very brutal 16-year civil war. Then they may have had to flee the rebels, but they usually returned to find their homes intact. Now, when they return, everything is destroyed. Madeleine Mucantcho spent three days in a tree as the flood waters swept away everything she owned. Her feat was all the more remarkable because she is well in to her 70s. \"Some people swam away on the first day. There wasn't a man to help me so I just had to stay in the tree. \"After three days, some of them came back and told us they heard that there was more water coming and we will drown if we stay. I cannot swim properly so it took me hours to get to the road,\" she said. \"I've seen different floods but not like this one.\" Mrs Mucantcho comes from the village of Ngoyene, which is now a dot in the middle of a sprawling lake of flood water about 30 miles wide. Most of its villagers were eventually plucked to safety by a South African helicopter operating from a stretch of main road which has been turned into a runway just outside the town of Palmeiras. The road used to be the main route along the north coast, through Xai-Xai and on to the port of Beira. But a few miles beyond Palmeiras the highway was swept away by a brand new river created by the floods. Several hundred yards of road have been pummelled out of existence by the massive surge of water. On either side, the water stretches for miles over farmland that fed hundreds of families. Mrs Mucantcho and the rest of the villagers do not now intend to return to live in Ngoyene. \"Every day I go and see how the water is. If the floods go, I will go back to plant but I can't live there,\" she said. Another of the villagers, Fabiao Matchovane Lhongo, said Ngoyene's residents were now constructing a new settlement near Palmeiras. \"We are building a village here. They have told us this is our land forever. We will live here and keep our ducks and goats and then we will go back to look after our crops in our fields. It is a long walk - nearly two hours - but we will never live there again,\" he said. Finding land is not as difficult as it might be elsewhere in Africa. Mozambique is not an overcrowded country and most agricultural land is still owned by the government, despite American pressure to privatise it. Many local authorities have swiftly reassigned the land for the displaced. Where the highway abruptly ends after Palmeiras, a group of men who usually work in gold mines in South Africa were stripped to their underwear and preparing to wade through chest-deep water on their way on to find out what happened to their villages. Worse to come Dinis Tivane was among them. He was given six days off from the Western Area mine near Johannesburg to try and make it to Josina Machel village. He eyed two buses swept from the road by the force of water and planted into the mud as he speculated on the fate of his home. \"I haven't heard anything about my village. I don't know what happened to my family. In Johannesburg all we heard was our country was disappearing under water. I don't know what I'll find. Probably nothing,\" he said. Perhaps the worst will come when the waters recede. That will expose the carcasses of thousands of animals which can only compound the problems created by a severe lack of clean drinking water. The first case of cholera has been reported, and the number of malaria cases is three times higher than normal even for the rainy season, when the disease is rampant. \u0095 Readers who want to donate money to the relief operation can phone donations to the British Red Cross on 0870 444 3444 or send a cheque to British Red Cross, Freepost, Mid21782, Halesowen B63 3BR. Donations will help to provide blankets, medical equipment, water tanks, tents and plastic sheeting, as well as building materials, seeds and tools.",

She had been on the run for more than three months, rumoured to be in Los Angeles, Santiago, Texas and Germany. This week she is facing extradition proceedings which could return her to Mexico, where she is due to stand trial.</p> <p>Trevi's story starts more than 15 years ago, when a feisty 14-year-old from a middle-class Mexican family left home and started on her career as a performer. She could dance, sing, compose, drum and play the piano, and she soon set about showing that she could shock, too. In a country where performers still tended to be dutiful and conventional, the time was ripe for someone who was ready to kick over the traces.</p> <p>She burst on the scene with an exotic stage persona - all torn fishnets, striptease and punky hair, with songs to match. She found a manager, Sergio Andrade, who, at a time when Madonna was conquering the world, quickly realised Trevi's potential. Andrade, the brother of a Mexican senator, was already a successful songwriter and had managed a number of other young women singers, although none had achieved the fame his new charge would attain.</p> <p>Trevi's first three CDs sold more than 5m copies and she could pack stadiums with 20,000 fans, delighted to see and hear someone so naughty and dangerous. One album was entitled Mas Turbata Que Nunca (More Disturbed Than Ever), its subliminal message easily found by rolling the first two words together. No wonder she became known as La Atrenida - the insolent one.</p> <p>Just as important as the medium she chose to reach her audience were the ideas she delivered through it: in a staunchly Catholic country, she spoke and sang about abortion, unwed motherhood, prostitution, drugs and politics. She became a symbol of fearless feminism, and both her teenage fans and many older, Mexican intellectuals admired her for her libertarian stance and her daring.</p> <p>While her message was sometimes deadly serious, Trevi's performances were full-on rock: she interspersed her own material with that of Led Zeppelin and The Doors. The shows were sensational, whether she was beating out a rhythm with flaming drumsticks or pulling young men on to the stage and stripping them. As her fame and success on stage grew, she capitalised on her notoriety by posing nude for calendars - the last one showed her wearing nothing but a devil's forked tail - and as a naked version of Adelita, one of the heroines of the Mexican revolution. The Catholic hierarchy denounced her godlessness, which only added to her mystique.</p> <p>In 1998, Andrade's young ex-wife, Aline Hernandez, published a book in which she claimed that Andrade lured her into a relationship when she was just 13. She married him at the age of 15. Hernandez portrayed Trevi and Andrade as sinister and manipulative. The book made waves, but its meatier allegations were dismissed as the product of Mexico's generally venomous showbusiness world. Then, gradually, the parents of other teenage girls who had also been part of Andrade's stable of young performers started to make the same allegations: that Trevi had helped to procure them for Andrade's sexual gratification.</p> <p>Last November, after specific allegations made by the parents of one of the girls, Karina Yapor, the state of Chihuahua issued a wanted poster for Trevi and Andrade. Yapor's parents claimed that Andrade had seduced their daughter, who had gone to him for music lessons when she was 12. It was claimed that she had had a child by Andrade in Spain when she was 15 and the baby had been left in a Spanish orphanage. By the time the Mexican authorities went looking for them, Andrade and Trevi had slipped from view. He had apparently left Mexico more than two years ago; she had last been heard of giving an interview to a Miami-based television station in spring of last year.</p> <p>Speculation on the streets and in the press was rife. Were the allegations simply part of an internal showbusiness feud? Was Trevi an innocent party? Would they ever return to Mexico? Then, just when it was rumoured that they were hiding out in the US, news came of their arrest in a Rio de Janeiro apartment one block from the Copacabana beach; the porter at their apartment building had thought they were just a bunch of \"dirty hippies\". Trevi has now been moved from jail in Rio to Brasilia, and the extradition proceedings could be completed this week.</p> <p>In Mexico, Trevi's case is the subject of heated debate. Her mother appeared on television last week saying that her daughter was a \"good girl\" and that Andrade had always seemed like a \"caballero\" - a gentleman - to her. But elsewhere, the attacks were growing. One weekly magazine suggested Trevi and Andrade had been involved in black magic and had run what was essentially an \"academy of Lolitas\" in Cuernavaca.</p> <p>Yapor is seen as the prosecution's key witness, but she has so far been supportive of Trevi and Andrade, saying initially that another man was the father of her baby. She has since changed the story, saying that the child was the result of a consensual relationship with Andrade. Last week, she refused to take a lie detector test requested by the prosecution.</p> <p>Trevi, for her part, is clearly deter mined not to submit without a fight, and it seems that she will not take what might be the safer route of blaming Andrade for everything. The mug shots taken after her arrest show her with her trademark self-confident grin. She told Mexican journalists on the plane between Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia when she was being moved last week: \"I am not going to play the victim. I support Sergio, I am with him.\" Andrade has taken the brunt of the public's outrage, but, judging from radio phone-in programmes, Mexicans are also angry with the girls' parents, who seem to have virtually signed over their daughters in the search for fame and fortune.</p> <p>Feminist organisations in Chihuahua, the state that is pursuing the couple, have also pointed the finger at the attorney general's office, suggesting that the prosecution of Trevi and Andrade is a way of diverting attention from their inaction over the rape and murder of nearly 200 women in the border area of Juarez. \"It is as if they want to show that they are concerned about the problems faced by women and sexual crime,\" said Irma Campos, a Chihuahua attorney and member of the women's group called March 8.</p> <p>Mariana Martinez, an editor of the book written by Aline Hernandez that was the starting point for the scandal, said of the affair this week that \"rebel lion is part of life, but the need to find a symbol for it can be manipulated so that it turns into the exact opposite. Trevi was similar to subcomandante Marcos [the leader of the Chiapas rebellion] in the way that she was an emblem in Mexico. In one way or another, Mexico needs heroes.\"</p> <p>Guadalupe Loeza, the Mexican writer and cultural commentator, sees Trevi as a tragic victim three times over - of Andrade, of the star system and of the notoriously corrupt entertainment business. \"Everyone knew about the kind of things that went on in Televisa [the television station that creates most Mexican stars],\" said Loeza, \"but no one said so openly. This is the first time the dirty linen is being washed in public. This is like a Pandora's box. There is now the space for lots of stories to come out. Trevi is a product of her time, of the disillusionment and the disappointment and the confusion of it.\"</p> <p>Loeza said that it was clear why Trevi was so successful: \"She was a seducer, she was not a fake. She appealed to everyone: eight-year-old girls who wanted to be like her, adolescents who thought they were her, adults who became fans of her calendars. I wrote at the time and I still believe that every Mexican woman has a Gloria Trevi inside her but is frightened to give it expression.\"</p> <p>Other writers, such as Jorge Caballeros of the left-of-centre daily La Jornada, pay tribute to her for breaking taboos with her lyrics and for singing about politics: \"She was a social and cultural phenomenon.\"</p> <p>Last summer, the well-known talk-show host and comedian Paco Stanley was shot dead in broad daylight outside a Mexico City restaurant. Initially, the country mourned what appeared to be yet another random act of violence, but then it emerged that Stanley was a cocaine addict, and his sidekick on the show was alleged to have been behind the plot to kill him. The cynicism this case engendered about the entertainment industry has helped to fuel the charges against Trevi and Andrade. At the same time, there are many within the business who must know that if the dirty laundry is going to be washed, they will be hung out to dry along with Trevi and Andrade.</p> <p>One of Trevi's hit CDs was entitled Why Am I Here? It's a question she may well be pondering in jail as she waits to see what the judicial process will do to her. She may also be wondering if it was inevitable that she would be punished for so openly flaunting the conventions of Mexican culture.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A gloriously Gallic soap opera has divided le tout Paris. It has pitted man against woman, chauvinist against feminist, editorialist against commentator, philosopher against moralist. Acres of newsprint, hours of airtime have been devoted to it. And what everyone wants to know is, did Bruno Gaccio touch Sylvie Kerviel's breasts?</p> <p>It's a tricky one. In Lib\u00e9ration, Pierre Marcelle sat firmly on the fence, referring to \"this obscure and tenebrous affair\" about which \"questions, lots of questions\" should be asked. In l'Evenement, the philosopher Blandine Kriegel was reduced to quoting Montesquieu: \"A republic,\" she said helfully, \"presupposes virtue.\"</p> <p>But let us begin at the beginning. What no one disputes is that one fine day a fortnight ago, Sylvie Kerviel, a journalist with Le Monde, published her interview with Bruno Gaccio, the senior writer on the popular French equivalent of Spitting Image, les Guignols.</p> <p>According to Kerviel, the interview was brief. Gaccio, she wrote, said he hated talking about himself. He kissed her hand and inquired whether she liked pasta, because he had a restaurant in the south of France he would invite her to.</p> <p>Asked what he found most interesting about the people he caricatured on the show, he replied: \"The stains on their ties,\" and placed his index finger between her breasts. Later, he suggested he could \"teach her a few positions she didn't know\". He asked if she was married, and if so how many lovers she had.</p> <p>Wise to the fact that this particular gambit from the Gallic school of male charm was unlikely to go unnoticed even in France, Gaccio's boss, Alain de Greef, moved swiftly to avert catastrophe. \"I like Gaccio,\" he hurriedly told the next day's paper. \"But he goes a bit far. In fact, he's an oik. He should never have behaved like that. But it was ironic.\"</p> <p>Now it so happens there exists a brand-new organisation that has sworn to do something about the Frenchman's perennial penchant for below-the-belt blows in the battle of the sexes. Les Chiennes de Garde, or the Guard Bitches, are 471 well-known French females, including writers, directors, former ministers and a scary round-the-world yachtswoman.</p> <p>They duly fired off a broadside the following day, accusing Gaccio of \"gross macho harassment\", denouncing De Greef for standing up for a subordinate rather than apologising to the victim, and threatening to \"sink their fangs\" into the pair of them.</p> <p>Undaunted, De Greef issued a formal statement two days later, raising the stakes further: he denied the encounter had been anything like that described by Kerviel.</p> <p>\"This wasn't three minutes of sexual harrassment of a female journalist by an oafish humourist, but an hour and a quarter of journalistic harassment of a scripwriter who did not want to give an interview,\" he said. \"Bruno Gaccio was rude, stu pid, ridiculous - and dumb enough to get trapped.\"</p> <p>Le tout Paris adored it. Deontologically speaking, they wanted to know, was there such a thing as journalistic harassment? Could Ms Kerviel be accused of wearing what one commentator called a \"metaphorical miniskirt\"? The whole affair, another philosopher noted, was \"bathed in shadows. Would that there were truly angels and demons. Alas, there are not.\"</p> <p>The final instalment of the sorry saga came a couple of days ago. Gaccio himself emerged to tell a very different story. He had never given interviews and never would. But at Kerviel's insistence, he said, and I quote: \"I don't mind talking about myself with you, but only naked, lying on animal skins and making love with a live trout.\"</p> <p>And so on, and so on. The whole conversation, Gaccio said, was so Rabelaisian that no sane person would have taken offence. Rather than \"a satyr lurking in the woods\" he was, he claims, \"a ridiculous schoolboy dancing naked on the table.\" But he did, he admitted, make the stain-on-tie gesture. And he admitted that he would not have sent a male journalist packing in the same way.</p> <p>So there you have it. Filthy macho French male, or poor put-upon non-publicity seeker? Cher lecteur, you must make up your own mind. Suffice it to say that it is encouraging, in France, that this affair became an Affair. And that just occasionally, a word of apology may be better than all the philosophising in Paris.</p> <p><b>Here comes Paris's Red Ken</b></p> <p>It's official: Paris isn't as trendy as London, and even the French admit it. Jack Lang, flamboyant 60-year-old former culture minister, let slip as much last week when he said he'd be running for mayor.</p> <p>\"Compared to London, Berlin or Rome, Paris needs a new \u00e9lan,\" Lang conceded. \"My dream is to give back to Paris its premier place, and to make its inhabitants happier by transforming their daily lives. We have to support the Paris that's dynamic.\"</p> <p>Lang, it has to be said, knows about dynamism. He's remembered by the French for helping push through some of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's grander projects - such as the Louvre pyramid - and for giving France its hugely popular national Fete de la Musique and an annual techno extravaganza. In some ways, Lang's candidacy echoes Ken Livingstone's: he represents a bygone age of socialism.

      "bodyText": "A gloriously Gallic soap opera has divided le tout Paris. It has pitted man against woman, chauvinist against feminist, editorialist against commentator, philosopher against moralist. Acres of newsprint, hours of airtime have been devoted to it. And what everyone wants to know is, did Bruno Gaccio touch Sylvie Kerviel's breasts? It's a tricky one. In Lib\u00e9ration, Pierre Marcelle sat firmly on the fence, referring to \"this obscure and tenebrous affair\" about which \"questions, lots of questions\" should be asked. In l'Evenement, the philosopher Blandine Kriegel was reduced to quoting Montesquieu: \"A republic,\" she said helfully, \"presupposes virtue.\" But let us begin at the beginning. What no one disputes is that one fine day a fortnight ago, Sylvie Kerviel, a journalist with Le Monde, published her interview with Bruno Gaccio, the senior writer on the popular French equivalent of Spitting Image, les Guignols. According to Kerviel, the interview was brief. Gaccio, she wrote, said he hated talking about himself. He kissed her hand and inquired whether she liked pasta, because he had a restaurant in the south of France he would invite her to. Asked what he found most interesting about the people he caricatured on the show, he replied: \"The stains on their ties,\" and placed his index finger between her breasts. Later, he suggested he could \"teach her a few positions she didn't know\". He asked if she was married, and if so how many lovers she had. Wise to the fact that this particular gambit from the Gallic school of male charm was unlikely to go unnoticed even in France, Gaccio's boss, Alain de Greef, moved swiftly to avert catastrophe. \"I like Gaccio,\" he hurriedly told the next day's paper. \"But he goes a bit far. In fact, he's an oik. He should never have behaved like that. But it was ironic.\" Now it so happens there exists a brand-new organisation that has sworn to do something about the Frenchman's perennial penchant for below-the-belt blows in the battle of the sexes. Les Chiennes de Garde, or the Guard Bitches, are 471 well-known French females, including writers, directors, former ministers and a scary round-the-world yachtswoman. They duly fired off a broadside the following day, accusing Gaccio of \"gross macho harassment\", denouncing De Greef for standing up for a subordinate rather than apologising to the victim, and threatening to \"sink their fangs\" into the pair of them. Undaunted, De Greef issued a formal statement two days later, raising the stakes further: he denied the encounter had been anything like that described by Kerviel. \"This wasn't three minutes of sexual harrassment of a female journalist by an oafish humourist, but an hour and a quarter of journalistic harassment of a scripwriter who did not want to give an interview,\" he said. \"Bruno Gaccio was rude, stu pid, ridiculous - and dumb enough to get trapped.\" Le tout Paris adored it. Deontologically speaking, they wanted to know, was there such a thing as journalistic harassment? Could Ms Kerviel be accused of wearing what one commentator called a \"metaphorical miniskirt\"? The whole affair, another philosopher noted, was \"bathed in shadows. Would that there were truly angels and demons. Alas, there are not.\" The final instalment of the sorry saga came a couple of days ago. Gaccio himself emerged to tell a very different story. He had never given interviews and never would. But at Kerviel's insistence, he said, and I quote: \"I don't mind talking about myself with you, but only naked, lying on animal skins and making love with a live trout.\" And so on, and so on. The whole conversation, Gaccio said, was so Rabelaisian that no sane person would have taken offence. Rather than \"a satyr lurking in the woods\" he was, he claims, \"a ridiculous schoolboy dancing naked on the table.\" But he did, he admitted, make the stain-on-tie gesture. And he admitted that he would not have sent a male journalist packing in the same way. So there you have it. Filthy macho French male, or poor put-upon non-publicity seeker? Cher lecteur, you must make up your own mind. Suffice it to say that it is encouraging, in France, that this affair became an Affair. And that just occasionally, a word of apology may be better than all the philosophising in Paris. Here comes Paris's Red Ken It's official: Paris isn't as trendy as London, and even the French admit it. Jack Lang, flamboyant 60-year-old former culture minister, let slip as much last week when he said he'd be running for mayor. \"Compared to London, Berlin or Rome, Paris needs a new \u00e9lan,\" Lang conceded. \"My dream is to give back to Paris its premier place, and to make its inhabitants happier by transforming their daily lives. We have to support the Paris that's dynamic.\" Lang, it has to be said, knows about dynamism. He's remembered by the French for helping push through some of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's grander projects - such as the Louvre pyramid - and for giving France its hugely popular national Fete de la Musique and an annual techno extravaganza. In some ways, Lang's candidacy echoes Ken Livingstone's: he represents a bygone age of socialism. So he's a long way from being the current Socialist PM's favourite person - but he's adored by the average Parisian. And Lang's opponent for the Socialist nomination is, funnily enough, a loyal if unflamboyant local party man. But unlike Tony Blair, Lionel Jospin has promised not to get up to anything underhand: even if he privately favours the local candidate, Bertrand Dalanoe, the two leftist hopefuls will face a straight primary on March 30 at which all Paris party members will vote. Jospin will not interfere in his party's choice for one simple reason: though the French capital has swung leftwards, it has not been run by a Socialist since the Paris Commune uprising of 1871. Equally importantly, Paris city hall has always been a springboard to top national office: winning it would do no harm to Jospin's campaign for president in 2002. Tainted by a string of corruption scandals, the centre-right incumbent, Jean Tiberi - who was chosen by Jacques Chirac as his successor when he left city hall to become president in 1995 - will almost certainly be forced out by his RPR party before the vote. And assuming Lang does get the Socialist nomination, his likely opponent will be Philippe Seguin, a notable Gaullist heavyweight and former speaker of the French parliament. If those two square off, the race to put Paris back on the map will be every bit as nasty as London's has already become: one poll last week put support for the two grandees at 47% each",

      "body": "<p>Now, bins. Kitchen bins. There's some secret stuff going on at James Dyson's factory HQ in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. More revolutionary products in design on the tail (or the hose) of his mould-breaking bagless, see-through Dual Cyclone vacuum. So hush-hush that those involved have to sign a secrecy clause, have to promise not even to tell their spouse. Please tell me, I beg him, that it's kitchen bins.</p> <p>\"Oh no, yes, no they're awful,\" says Dyson, inventor, manufacturer, multi-millionaire. \"Overfilling the bag, yes I know . It's taking the bag out that's the worst thing. Yes, and I hate the big ones.\" He has a quiet upper-class voice but his face is contorting in distaste. He wriggles about in his chair (Vitara by Antonio Citerio, \u00a3400), darting in and out of the checkerboard light thrown by the Venetian blinds behind him, dodging an Anglepoise light the size of a small robot by his ears. He is animated now. \"I found quite a nice one, but it's \u00a3300. I found it in the Conran Shop and it's quite nice, but it's not perfect. It's cast iron - I got blue ones - and it's not that big, it's about that high and it has a very nice pedal and a stainless steel lid that comes up and then a galvanised bin that you lift out and it's got a very good seal around the top. Yes, it's a very good seal.\"</p> <p>He's in a world of his own now. Loo flushes? I say. Not so sure about the stubbly ones down the corridor: time someone drew them to your attention? \"Oh, the prison ones,\" he says. \"They're from the prison catalogue. But actually, these ones aren't very good. I shouldn't say that in front of the architects. The architects sourced those. But I don't think they look very nice. I found one for our previous office that looked much better and worked better. This one, you rather lose your thumb in it don't you? These are German, aren't they?\" Er, sorry, didn't notice . . . He's up and out of his chair and across the room and through another door. I can hear him shouting something. A German manufacturer's name, perhaps. \"Yup, German,\" he says, striding back into the room. His secretary pops her head round the door, checking on the commotion perhaps. \"Just talking about lavatory pushes,\" he says. \"Oh right,\" she says, and goes back out again.</p> <p>Dyson, 52 \"and a half\", owes his success to a permanent attention to detail, a constant edge of irritation. Little things make him cross. And big things make him even crosser. It was \"a poxy little Hoover Junior\" that had been angering, infuriating , him at home for years that set him thinking in 1978 about \"the gigantic con\" put upon us by the manufacturers that bags - \"these bloody things\" - were necessary.</p> <p>He felt the same fury towards the humble wheelbarrow before his earlier invention of the Ballbarrow (over which he fell out with his sister; they still hardly speak). His autobiography, Against The Odds - which describes his 15-year battle for independence and success, with patents and licences and constant and continuing litigation and terrible debt - is littered with references to \"complete bastards\" and \"pathetic\" attitudes and other people's \"apathy and chronic defensiveness\" and \"creative jealousy\". Most of all, he's cross at Britain's \"can't do\" mentality. Last week, he sounded off on the radio about Eddie George's attitude to manufacturing. High interest rates, a strong pound as well as restrictive planning regulations, may well, he said, drive him and his production oversees. A long time in the wilderness, and you can tell he rather enjoys the attention.</p> <p>\"I'm very committed to Britain, or England, as we're now allowed to say. \"But I am really worried because a lot of things are going seriously wrong. It's the most terrible place to make things at the moment. Our attitude to money is pretty Thatcherite. The man who has the money, earns the money, whereas in Japan where you pay less than 1% on money, it's not the City that gets rich, it's people who make things.\"</p> <p>Dyson, a graduate of the Royal College of Art, and the son of a classics master, likes to think of himself and his 350 employees as people who make things. He refers to himself as an artist on a couple of occasions, as in \"Deirdre [his wife, a rug designer] and I are both artists. She understands the creative impulse\". He has become an emblem not just of the successful British entrepreneur (estimated wealth: \u00a3500m), but of English good taste. His Chelsea house (there are others in Wiltshire and Provence) is regularly featured in magazines devoted to interiors. He has three children, two sons and a daughter, Emily, who has just opened Couverture, a shop in London's King's Road pandering to one's desire for a \u00a3325 pair of slippers (a bit more than a bin).</p> <p>He is laid-back in manner, he rolls his finger in the cleft of his chin when he's thinking, rubs his hand under his arm as if cashmere is a little too itchy for his liking (NB anything we can do about that?). He generally registers disagreement with a slight, fey laugh and he clearly likes his own way. He gets visibly annoyed twice during the interview - once when I ask whether the secret of a good invention is making something simpler, unlike, say, those machines for initialising golfballs which makes something simple more complicated.</p> <p>\"I\"m not an inventor,\" he interrupts.</p> <p>\"Surely you . . .\"</p> <p>\"No. No. No. An inventor is a boffin who has a brilliant idea. And there are 350 of us here working on things, to do something different, to make it better.\" But surely you're . . . \"I hate the tag. I hate it,\" he continues. \"It isn't a flash of brilliance, it's years of grind. People think, pfff, he's done that, he's struck lucky, but your invention has, in fact, come about by trying to do something that seemed impossible and perhaps slightly mad. I hate that word 'mad', strike that . . . Something that seems impossible and therefore a lot of people wouldn't attempt it, but you make it work . . . after a staggering amount of effort.\"</p> <p>The other time he seems cross is when I say the Dyson design is trendy. \"No, it's not.\" Yes it is. \"It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not trendy. It works well. We earn our stripes the hard way. Trendy implies it's temporal. People say it works bloody well but it looks like a piece of shit. That to me is a great compliment.\"</p> <p>Halfway through the interview the fire alarm starts pealing and 351 of us troop out to the muster station in the car park. Everybody is young. Everyone's in fleeces, apart from Dyson, who's in a pale purple Pashmina. Dyson has a Californian - or he'd say Japanese - vision for his company. There is pasta and salad in the cafe (he hates the word canteen). No suits and ties. Memos are banned. There is no recirculated air. (There were big scenes with the architects about this. \"I said, 'I don't want any recirculated air.' They said, 'You have to.' I said, 'I'm not having it.' And I was getting phone calls saying, 'Be reasonable', and I just kept saying, 'I'm sorry, your sums don't add up, it will be cheaper without it, no ghastly, filters, smaller ducts, just fresh air which you have to cool or heat.' Two weeks later, they came back and said, 'You're right.'\")</p> <p>We're still standing in the car park when Dyson says: \"This is where we lose 5,000 vacuum cleaners off the production lines. The lines stop and then it gets longer than the stoppage to get started again.\" His fine grey blond hair looks a little thinner in the outside air, his shoulders more angular. Is he insulated these days against failure? I ask.</p> <p>\"No,\" he says. \"I've got everything tied up in this. Lots of things could go wrong. All our competitors are bringing out bagless vacuum cleaners. I feel the same fear as I always have - we're living by our wits. We are what bankers describe as a one-product company. And there are the ongoing legal suits with our competitors [over ads claiming that bags clog]. So one is embattled. It goes with the territory. If you're trying to change the status quo, people don't like it. And we're a very unsexy company. We're manufacturers, not popular. Engineering, very unpopular. We're a very untrendy company.\" He gives me a steely look.</p> <p>Does he still do his own Hoovering. . . I mean, vacuuming? He gives that little laugh. \"Yes, I was vacuuming last night, actually.\" For pleasure? \"Hm, not for pleasure. I don't think anyone vacuums for pleasure.\"</p> <p>He has a \"wonderful woman\" at home who does most of the cleaning. He's telling me this back in his office. He hasn't yet replaced her with the newly released computerised model that does everything for you except the stairs. \"I used to be made to vacuum when I was young,\" he says, suddenly all maudlin and reflective. \"I remember the smell of the stairs . . . Look,\" He jumps up again and goes to a wall where there are some ancient brown uprights that look like extras from A Bug's Life. \"Look. Old ones. I got them from a car boot sale.\" An expression of pure happiness fleets across his face. \"Look,\" he says, breaking in deeply. \"They've got their original dust in them.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "France is emerging as mainland Europe's leading economy. Germany may be larger, at one-third of the region's output, but France, at 25%, has the best growth. Fourth-quarter French growth is driven by domestic demand; Germany's depends entirely on exports. The mainspring of French recovery is jobs. Jobs growth rose above 2% in 1999, faster than in the United States. So why is the French economy so successful? After the follies of the Mitterrand experiment of 1981/82, France endured 15 years of non-stop deflation.

      "bodyText": "Harold Wilson appears to have been kept in the dark about a $3bn-plus rescue package that could have prevented the humiliating devaluation of sterling in November 1967, according to declassified papers from the US state department. The move rocked Wilson's Labour government, undermining its credibility with backbench MPs and foreign governments. Wilson refused to devalue when he won the 1964 election, but three years later cheap imports were flooding into the country, exporters' goods were increasingly expensive and a balance of payments crisis loomed. A memo marked: \"Secret; sensitive\" from White House special assistant, Walt Rostow, to President Lyndon Johnson on November 16 enthuses on the likelihood of central bankers chipping in to a huge fund to salvage the pound. He wrote: \"There is a general consensus on the need for an impressive package. The impression one gets is that the central bankers went to the brink and didn't like what they saw.\" But Wilson, writing in his diary for November 15, commented that there were \"no serious signs of a chequebook\" from the Americans. The diary note, from the Wilson family papers, is quoted in Ben Pimlott's 1992 biography of the late prime minister. The then chancellor, James Callaghan, wrote in his memoirs that he believed devaluation to have been inevitable as from November 13, given the inadequacy of support offers from the US and the International Monetary Fund. Lord Callaghan stated that $2bn was on offer but that he and Bank of England governor Sir Leslie O'Brien, felt this would buy little more than a \"breathing space\". Five months earlier, Callaghan had spoken of the need for a $3bn package - the figure Mr Rostow was mentioning to President Johnson two days before devaluation. Why this last-minute package was not put to the British is not known. Washington DC was informed of the decision to devalue sterling from its post-war rate of $2.8 to $2.4 only late on the evening of Friday November 17. Kenneth Morgan's biography of Lord Callaghan confirms that on November 13 the chancellor believed \"the end of the road had been reached\" and that President Johnson called an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday November 20 in which he told colleagues that sterling's devaluation \"has the most serious consequences for the administration\". Another state department memorandum of November 13 warned the president that the consequences would include an attack on the dollar and the fact that \"the gold market would come under very great pressure and might explode\". Wilson's assurance that the purchasing power of sterling at home had not been devalued backfired and the phrase \"the pound in your pocket\" was to haunt him for the rest of his political career. Elsewhere in the State Department archive is material relating to the currency crisis of late 1968, in which Britain, America and other countries tried to persuade West Germany to revalue the mark. On November 19 Johnson cabled Wilson with suggestions for a realignment of European currencies. Wilson sent two telegrams in reply which remain top secret and have not been declassified.",

It puts an Indian firm on the global map for branded tea and will encourage others to scout for foreign brands, said R.S. Jhawar, chairman of the Indian Tea Association. \"For the first time, an Indian tea company has acquired a global brand. It opens a lot of opportunities for us,\" he said. Darjeeling Planters Association chairman Ashok Lohia said Indian firms would be encouraged to think globally. \"Certainly it is an example for other tea companies. We need to think global,\" he said. \"It is a great thing to happen. As an Indian tea planter, I feel delighted.\" The acquisition excludes the American coffee business of Tetley, which was recently sold by the existing shareholders of Tetley separately. Tata Tea has a 23% market share in India, behind Hindustan Lever, the Indian subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch company Unilever, which has 44% of the market, Mr Kumar said. The combined sales turn over of Tetley and Tata Tea was 29 billion rupees (\u00a3418m), he said. \"As we enter into new markets, these can increase very substantially,\" Mr Kumar said, although he gave no target. \"We [Tata Tea] are growing at 8% every year and we expect to accelerate that.\" Tata Tea already had a five-year-old equal joint venture with Tetley in India and this would most probably be included in the international operations of Tata Tea, he said.",

It also \"aims to provide a space where technology meets creativity in an environment designed to appeal to a style-conscious clientele\". That claim, loosely translated, means that a group of talented young computer and design buffs have created the first convincing \"cybercafe\", a space that aims to match the dream of computer technology. </p> <p>Mitchell, 35, came to England from Auckland 15 years ago. He studied the piano from the age of five, but trained as a graphic designer before emigrating. He liked the idea of setting up some sort of work and meeting place where anyone could drop by, and was disappointed by the internet cafes that sprang up across Britain in the 90s. There was a mismatch, he thought, between what computers could do in terms of imagery, and the look and feel of internet cafes and offices that revolved around computers. </p> <p>So Mitchell teamed up with George Philippakos (Nutopia's IT director) and Toula Philippakou (its operations manager) to create a corner of the capital in which those willing to pay \u00a35 an hour can disappear into a computer-generated virtual world while inhabiting a workplace that is itself about as close to cyberspace as you can hope to find. </p> <p>The Nutopia concept will doubtless be copied, but Mitchell and gang intend to keep several steps ahead of their rivals. What they have between them is that all too rare mix of passion, energy, imagination and technical know-how. \"It's about imagining what we could do and could be,\" says Mitchell. \"The name Nutopia comes from a statement made by John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1973. We announce, they said, the birth of a conceptual country, Nutopia. It has no land, no boundaries or passports, only people\".

These, and the continually changing installations of furniture, fittings and artworks chosen by Mitchell and co. On display until the beginning of April are a light-emitting polycarbonate sofa by Ansel Thompson; a kinetic light sculpture made of three skipping ropes and a \"chromastrobic\" light by Paul Friedlander; and wall-mounted light panels by Jason Bruges that change as you move across or in front of them. These are inspired designs that connect the pop art world of the 60s with that of the 2000s and the promise of cyberspace. </p> <p>The question that emerges and morphs in the brain after a mind-expanding visit to Nutopia is this: why, given the ability of computer programs to generate fantastic visions, are architects and designers incapable of realising such digital dreams in real space? </p> <p>It's true that without computer modelling we would never have seen such brave and inventive buildings as Frank Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao or Renzo Piano's Kansai International Airport. And yet, inside, neither building offers a breakaway sense of space.

Except in the smoke-and-mirror games played in spaces like Nutopia, the cyberdream can so far only be seen on computer screens and in books. </p> <p>Hybrid Space, a new book by Peter Zellner, a US architect who studied with Rem Koolhaas at Harvard, looks at the work of a dozen architectural practices worldwide. All are attempting to connect the real world with the virtual world, to exploit the computer's ability to create unexpected new forms through digital animation and complex algorithms, even to crossbreed biology and technology (very much a 60s dream; try not to think of Roger Dean's album covers for Yes). \"Their researches,\" says Zellner, \"are triggering a phase-shift in our perception and comprehension of space, materiality and time at the start of the new millennium.\" </p> <p>Maybe. This is, of course, millennial and thus messianic thinking, although no less valuable for that. Many of the weird and wonderful spaces shown in the book are as unattainable, given existing building materials and technology, as the speed of light is for a spaceship, even the wonderful machines that moved so gracefully through 2001. That said, it is also true that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the great Prussian modernist, designed two remarkable glass skyscrapers between 1919 and 1921.

This gives us the feel of what we might yet achieve as computer design comes of age and we begin to see how we might create buildings and interiors as ethereal and happily uncertain as a magic-lantern show.

This is the government's recipe for cutting deaths on the roads by 40% by 2010. In the same period it also wants to halve the number of children killed and seriously hurt.</p> <p>If the policy works it will still leave 1,700 people killed and around 3,000 children killed or seriously injured. That figure for deaths will compare well with most of our European neighbours, but poorly with our main road safety rival Sweden, which is putting in place policies which will aspire to zero road deaths. It will compare very badly with the safety standards expected in travel by rail and air.</p> <p>The most controversial issue in the reviews has been whether to change national speed limits. A statistical analysis of the most dangerous and least dangerous roads led ministers to consider reducing the 30mph limit in towns and the 60mph limit on country roads, while raising the limit of 70mph on Britain's safest roads - the motorways. But lowering speed limits nationally was resisted by the motoring organisations at a time when the government was on the defensive over fuel taxation policies. And the increase in the upper limit was rejected by environment ministers because of the greatly increased contribution to the greenhouse effect from driving at high speeds.</p> <p>Perhaps there could have been a trade-off. Say urban limits had been lowered to 25mph and motorway limits raised to 75 or 80mph. But even if that had squared the motoring lobby while improving safety, the opportunity has now passed, at least until limits are officially reviewed again.</p> <p>Any immediate decisions on changes in speed limits have now been handed to local councils. They, following a direct intervention by the prime minister, will be instructed to reduce by 50% the number of children killed or seriously hurt. Britain's record for injuries to child pedestrians and cyclists is one of the worst in Europe. British children walk and cycle only a third as much as Dutch children, but face more than double the risk of death.</p> <p>Councils have been given the power to reduce local speed limits where appropriate to 20mph to cut the risk faced by children near schools and on residential streets. Fine, but serious questions remain about whether the strategy can work without major funding from central government for a nationwide programme of traffic calming in residential areas, and without a clear policy for reducing the risk to cyclists and pedestrians on urban A and B roads where half of urban pedestrian and cycling deaths occur.</p> <p>Ministers will be asked whether they have compromised on safety in order to promote mobility. What, for instance, will be the prime determinant of a slow-speed zone in a town - pedestrian safety or traffic density? If schools flank a major road at half-mile intervals, how should the school's ambit be defined? Should cars be forced to slow down past playing fields, shops and other facilities visited on foot? These are vital questions that still need clarification from government. Perhaps that will come later in guidance to local councils.</p> <p>Another area where the government's policy appears unclear is in the enforcement of existing speed limits. The junior home office minister Charles Clarke told me in the autumn that the 30mph limit in built-up areas should be rigorously enforced on safety grounds... yet following pressure from the motoring lobby he was overruled by Downing Street.</p> <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers confirmed recently that police will give motorists 10% leeway over the legal limit, plus an extra 2mph to allow for any discrepancies in speed-monitoring equipment. Safety experts argue that the leeway should not be given, as every one mile an hour increases the risk of an accident by 5%. The home secretary, Jack Straw, has yet to say whether he accepts these police guidelines on law enforcement.</p> <p>In the summer, the home office is due to publish a wholesale review of sentencing for driving offences; ministers believe courts have been too lenient with dangerous drivers. But Jack Straw is reluctant to make traffic policing a core duty for police forces. A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary even described traffic policing as a Cinderella activity - the number of traffic officers has been halved in just over a decade. (The number of safety cameras, however, is set to increase with some councils being given the proceeds of speeding fines by the treasury for the sake of investment in enforcement.)</p> <p>There is a democratic dimension missing from the road-safety review. No provision is being made to increase people's ability to demand enforcement of safe speeds on streets where they live. This may prove a critical flaw. Local campaigners are often told by police and councils that there needs to be a death on the road to lift it up the priority list for speed cameras or traffic calming.</p> <p>But many initiatives in the review will be widely praised. Villagers will benefit from new 30mph speed limits (there is to be further discussion over reducing speeds on rural lanes). There will be be more Dutch-style \"home zones\" in which small residential streets are re-engineered at the behest of residents to remove the dominance of the car. The question here will be how far the government will meet what could amount to a massive demand for reworking local roads.</p> <p>Wednesday's announcement will also feature a new panel to monitor progress towards the accident reduction targets. There will be consultation over how to improve training for young drivers - who are vulnerable to mistakes in the first few years of driving. It will raise the likelihood of greatly increased safety spending in the transport spending review due in the summer. And it will herald a new level of cooperation with the health and safety executive to bring business driving under similar rules that apply to workplaces. This might lead to a clampdown on the excesses of white van man.</p> <p>The review is to be \"target driven\" but though deaths and injuries are confidently expected to fall, the government has abandoned hopes of cutting the number of accidents. They will rise as traffic increases.</p> <p><b> Child deaths</b></p> <p>Hit by a car at:</p> <p><b> 10mph</b> nearly all children live</p> <p><b> 20mph</b> one in 20 dies</p> <p><b> 30mph</b> nearly half die</p> <p><b> 40mph</b> 17 out of 20 die</p> <p>\u0095 Roger Harrabin reports on transport for BBC Radio 4's Today</p>",

They, following a direct intervention by the prime minister, will be instructed to reduce by 50% the number of children killed or seriously hurt. Britain's record for injuries to child pedestrians and cyclists is one of the worst in Europe. British children walk and cycle only a third as much as Dutch children, but face more than double the risk of death. Councils have been given the power to reduce local speed limits where appropriate to 20mph to cut the risk faced by children near schools and on residential streets. Fine, but serious questions remain about whether the strategy can work without major funding from central government for a nationwide programme of traffic calming in residential areas, and without a clear policy for reducing the risk to cyclists and pedestrians on urban A and B roads where half of urban pedestrian and cycling deaths occur. Ministers will be asked whether they have compromised on safety in order to promote mobility. What, for instance, will be the prime determinant of a slow-speed zone in a town - pedestrian safety or traffic density? If schools flank a major road at half-mile intervals, how should the school's ambit be defined? Should cars be forced to slow down past playing fields, shops and other facilities visited on foot? These are vital questions that still need clarification from government. Perhaps that will come later in guidance to local councils. Another area where the government's policy appears unclear is in the enforcement of existing speed limits. The junior home office minister Charles Clarke told me in the autumn that the 30mph limit in built-up areas should be rigorously enforced on safety grounds... yet following pressure from the motoring lobby he was overruled by Downing Street. The Association of Chief Police Officers confirmed recently that police will give motorists 10% leeway over the legal limit, plus an extra 2mph to allow for any discrepancies in speed-monitoring equipment. Safety experts argue that the leeway should not be given, as every one mile an hour increases the risk of an accident by 5%. The home secretary, Jack Straw, has yet to say whether he accepts these police guidelines on law enforcement. In the summer, the home office is due to publish a wholesale review of sentencing for driving offences; ministers believe courts have been too lenient with dangerous drivers. But Jack Straw is reluctant to make traffic policing a core duty for police forces. A recent report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary even described traffic policing as a Cinderella activity - the number of traffic officers has been halved in just over a decade. (The number of safety cameras, however, is set to increase with some councils being given the proceeds of speeding fines by the treasury for the sake of investment in enforcement.) There is a democratic dimension missing from the road-safety review. No provision is being made to increase people's ability to demand enforcement of safe speeds on streets where they live. This may prove a critical flaw. Local campaigners are often told by police and councils that there needs to be a death on the road to lift it up the priority list for speed cameras or traffic calming. But many initiatives in the review will be widely praised. Villagers will benefit from new 30mph speed limits (there is to be further discussion over reducing speeds on rural lanes). There will be be more Dutch-style \"home zones\" in which small residential streets are re-engineered at the behest of residents to remove the dominance of the car. The question here will be how far the government will meet what could amount to a massive demand for reworking local roads. Wednesday's announcement will also feature a new panel to monitor progress towards the accident reduction targets. There will be consultation over how to improve training for young drivers - who are vulnerable to mistakes in the first few years of driving. It will raise the likelihood of greatly increased safety spending in the transport spending review due in the summer. And it will herald a new level of cooperation with the health and safety executive to bring business driving under similar rules that apply to workplaces. This might lead to a clampdown on the excesses of white van man. The review is to be \"target driven\" but though deaths and injuries are confidently expected to fall, the government has abandoned hopes of cutting the number of accidents. They will rise as traffic increases. Child deaths Hit by a car at: 10mph nearly all children live 20mph one in 20 dies 30mph nearly half die 40mph 17 out of 20 die \u0095 Roger Harrabin reports on transport for BBC Radio 4's Today",

      "body": "<p>Rangers last night won the kind of game that gives professional football a bad name. They conquered so easily at Dundee that it should attract the attention of those agencies specialising in people in distress. Mercifully, Steven Tweed's late own-goal in the second half was all they added after creating mayhem in the first. But it still made the total seven; far too many. </p> <p>They wasted no time in getting started. Dundee, whose league position is increasingly perilous, could have done without losing a goal inside 75 seconds. But far worse was to happen before the end of the half because, by the time they reached the sanctuary of the dressing room, they were 6-1 down after suffering the kind of humiliation that tends to cost managers their jobs. </p> <p>Rod Wallace had claimed a hat-trick and his team-mates had added three more.

      "bodyText": "Rangers last night won the kind of game that gives professional football a bad name. They conquered so easily at Dundee that it should attract the attention of those agencies specialising in people in distress. Mercifully, Steven Tweed's late own-goal in the second half was all they added after creating mayhem in the first. But it still made the total seven; far too many. They wasted no time in getting started. Dundee, whose league position is increasingly perilous, could have done without losing a goal inside 75 seconds. But far worse was to happen before the end of the half because, by the time they reached the sanctuary of the dressing room, they were 6-1 down after suffering the kind of humiliation that tends to cost managers their jobs. Rod Wallace had claimed a hat-trick and his team-mates had added three more. Those who believe that Rangers should go off and play somewhere else will feel vindicated. In fairness, most of the goals were memorable. The first, scored after a through-ball from Giovanni van Bronckhorst, was slipped into the net by Wallace, shrugging off a tackle by Tweed. There were then 20 minutes to wait until the second arrived from an Andrei Kanchel skis corner that Tony Vidmar headed home with the defence unable to match his leap. Rangers had already done enough to claim the points but there was a glimmer of hope for Dundee when they pulled a goal back in the 27th minute. Willie Falconer headed back a corner for Tweed to finish. But, four goals in 15 minutes transformed the match and underlined the gap between the haves and the have-nots that blights the Scottish Premier League. First, Rozental fashioned a move involving Van Bronckhorst to place the ball in front of Wallace for a third goal. A couple of minutes later, Stephan Klos simply kicked the ball 80 yards to allow the same striker to flick the ball over the head of Rab Douglas, who seemed to be as disillusioned as his own supporters. All this time, J\u00f6rg Albertz had been practising his thunderballs and in the 38th minute he struck one from the outside the penalty area to give Rangers a fifth that they hardly needed. But there was a genuine sense of occasion in the 45th minute when Wallace held up the ball to allow Rozental to score with a simple shot on his first start after returning to the club following a two-year fight against serious injury.",

This time, though, he was happy with a draw. In contrast, some City supporters will not be. </p> <p>They felt victory would put the Blues firmly in the hunt for an automatic promotion place rather than a play-off one. But Francis was quick to correct them. \"We're still on course for an automatic place,\" he said. \"That is, if Charlton, Ipswich and Manchester City each lose 10 games. </p> <p>\"An automatic place was not on even if we had won. As it is I'm very pleased my team has drawn with a very good side. The point has lifted us up to fifth place and the teams I'm concerned about are the ones near or below us: Huddersfield, Wolves, Fulham and Blackburn. To be in fifth place after the illness and injuries we've had to deal with is a fantastic achievement.\" </p> <p>Yet for almost half-an-hour Blues were on course to close the gap on their Suffolk rivals to seven points. Ipswich's veteran defender Tony Mowbray proved an unlikely City hero when his diving header, worthy of the best striker, diverted Simon Charlton's cross past a helpless Richard Wright. </p> <p>Jamie Clapham's searing left-foot drive from distance threatened to restore parity but the ball rebounded to safety off Ian Bennett's right-hand post. </p> <p>However, with seconds of the half remaining Ipswich scored the goal their enterprise deserved when Mowbray, atoning for his earlier blunder, headed Wayne Brown's free-kick across goal for David Johnson to volley home. </p> <p>Town felt they should have had a penalty when David Holdsworth appeared to foul Marcus Stewart after the break. Had he been penalised it would have spoiled a fine display but the appeal was turned down. </p> <p>It should not have mattered as Johnson had a golden chance to give Ipswich victory six minutes from time. Set up by a pinpoint rightwing cross from John McGreal, Johnson's header packed power but lacked direction, leaving them with only a point. </p> <p>\"The thought of coming away with a point before kick-off would have been a disaster,\" Burley said. \"But with hindsight this is always a diffi cult place to come to and, even though we were well in control by the end, I'm not too disappointed. </p> <p>\"The draw has lifted us into second place and, if we can maintain the consistency that has now seen us go 18 games without defeat, there's no reason we cannot stay there.\"</p>",

They felt victory would put the Blues firmly in the hunt for an automatic promotion place rather than a play-off one. But Francis was quick to correct them. \"We're still on course for an automatic place,\" he said. \"That is, if Charlton, Ipswich and Manchester City each lose 10 games. \"An automatic place was not on even if we had won. As it is I'm very pleased my team has drawn with a very good side. The point has lifted us up to fifth place and the teams I'm concerned about are the ones near or below us: Huddersfield, Wolves, Fulham and Blackburn. To be in fifth place after the illness and injuries we've had to deal with is a fantastic achievement.\" Yet for almost half-an-hour Blues were on course to close the gap on their Suffolk rivals to seven points. Ipswich's veteran defender Tony Mowbray proved an unlikely City hero when his diving header, worthy of the best striker, diverted Simon Charlton's cross past a helpless Richard Wright. Jamie Clapham's searing left-foot drive from distance threatened to restore parity but the ball rebounded to safety off Ian Bennett's right-hand post. However, with seconds of the half remaining Ipswich scored the goal their enterprise deserved when Mowbray, atoning for his earlier blunder, headed Wayne Brown's free-kick across goal for David Johnson to volley home. Town felt they should have had a penalty when David Holdsworth appeared to foul Marcus Stewart after the break. Had he been penalised it would have spoiled a fine display but the appeal was turned down. It should not have mattered as Johnson had a golden chance to give Ipswich victory six minutes from time. Set up by a pinpoint rightwing cross from John McGreal, Johnson's header packed power but lacked direction, leaving them with only a point. \"The thought of coming away with a point before kick-off would have been a disaster,\" Burley said. \"But with hindsight this is always a diffi cult place to come to and, even though we were well in control by the end, I'm not too disappointed. \"The draw has lifted us into second place and, if we can maintain the consistency that has now seen us go 18 games without defeat, there's no reason we cannot stay there.\"",

In September Bruno Rodriguez was hailed as the man to save City's season; now it is Jorge Cadete. </p> <p>Gamble one was a spectacular failure. Rodriguez returned to Paris St-Germain one month into an eight-month loan deal after criticising the club and city. Gamble two must succeed. If the Portuguese can galvanise Bradford's season as he transformed their performance against Aston Villa on Saturday, the manager Paul Jewell will not be humiliated again. </p> <p>Within seconds of Cadete's entrance on 75 minutes David Wetherall's effort was clawed round a post by Peter Enckelman and from the resulting corner Dean Windass headed home to draw Bradford level. Then, with eight minutes remaining, Cadete rose above Gareth Southgate only for his header to be palmed on to the bar. It was an inspired and inspiring substitution by Jewell. </p> <p>However, Cadete will be eased in gently. He has not started for Benfica all season but an 18-month spell at Celtic, which yielded 38 goals in 49 appearances and ended in May 1997, will stand him in good stead to cope with the pace of the Premiership. </p> <p>Motivation ought not to be a problem for the 31-year-old forward either. He hopes to make the Portuguese squad for Euro 2000 and, with England their opening opponents, what better way to enhance his chances of selection than by shining in the Premiership? </p> <p>Bradford need some illuminating, although they are by no means down and out. Unbeaten at home since mid-October, they are in the relegation zone on goal difference alone.

      "bodyText": "Arrival of new striker stirs optimism in Bradford. Sound familiar? In September Bruno Rodriguez was hailed as the man to save City's season; now it is Jorge Cadete. Gamble one was a spectacular failure. Rodriguez returned to Paris St-Germain one month into an eight-month loan deal after criticising the club and city. Gamble two must succeed. If the Portuguese can galvanise Bradford's season as he transformed their performance against Aston Villa on Saturday, the manager Paul Jewell will not be humiliated again. Within seconds of Cadete's entrance on 75 minutes David Wetherall's effort was clawed round a post by Peter Enckelman and from the resulting corner Dean Windass headed home to draw Bradford level. Then, with eight minutes remaining, Cadete rose above Gareth Southgate only for his header to be palmed on to the bar. It was an inspired and inspiring substitution by Jewell. However, Cadete will be eased in gently. He has not started for Benfica all season but an 18-month spell at Celtic, which yielded 38 goals in 49 appearances and ended in May 1997, will stand him in good stead to cope with the pace of the Premiership. Motivation ought not to be a problem for the 31-year-old forward either. He hopes to make the Portuguese squad for Euro 2000 and, with England their opening opponents, what better way to enhance his chances of selection than by shining in the Premiership? Bradford need some illuminating, although they are by no means down and out. Unbeaten at home since mid-October, they are in the relegation zone on goal difference alone. But their return of six points from away games needs to be improved if they are to survive. John Gregory could teach them a thing or two about that. Villa's pre-Christmas slump heaped pressure on the manager but he now has a place in Europe, be it through the FA Cup or the League, in his sights. Villa have lost only once in 17 games but Gregory is desperate for something to show for his troubles. He is close to signing PSV's Belgian striker Luc Nilis to help the cause. \"We have had some major problems on and off the pitch in the past two years and it has taken a while to get the squad I want together,\" he said. \"I think we're just ahead of schedule at the moment.

      "body": "<p>Fast, direct and executed by an Englishman: it was a goal that Graham Taylor had to admire even if it was a devastating counter-blow to the heart of a Watford side still pumping with pride and energy. </p> <p>Both Chelsea goals came from the Taylor manual rather than the Gianluca Vialli version but the unconvincing hosts were grateful for any return on their labours. Chelsea had done little to suggest the classic counter-attack and Jon Harley's imperious headed winner, a passage of excellence they may need to match against Marseille tomorrow night. </p> <p>The reward for 20-year-old Harley, who has so impressively exploited injury to Graeme le Saux and the extended absence of Celestine Babayaro, could be a first start in the Champions League in the Stade V\u00e9lodrome. </p> <p>There is much more to Harley's game, though, than the pitch-long sprint that enabled him to score his first Chelsea goal after 65 minutes. The confident Kent youngster, converted from midfield, has shown a composure well beyond his years in adapting to being a left-back in a Premiership team of so many talents. </p> <p>Already, after only 19 senior appearances, Harley is being touted as the answer to one of England's chronic problems. Vialli lends qualified support to that belief: \"He's probably one of the best left-sided offensive players in England. He's got to work on his defensive game but he has not been playing in that position for long.

      "bodyText": "Fast, direct and executed by an Englishman: it was a goal that Graham Taylor had to admire even if it was a devastating counter-blow to the heart of a Watford side still pumping with pride and energy. Both Chelsea goals came from the Taylor manual rather than the Gianluca Vialli version but the unconvincing hosts were grateful for any return on their labours. Chelsea had done little to suggest the classic counter-attack and Jon Harley's imperious headed winner, a passage of excellence they may need to match against Marseille tomorrow night. The reward for 20-year-old Harley, who has so impressively exploited injury to Graeme le Saux and the extended absence of Celestine Babayaro, could be a first start in the Champions League in the Stade V\u00e9lodrome. There is much more to Harley's game, though, than the pitch-long sprint that enabled him to score his first Chelsea goal after 65 minutes. The confident Kent youngster, converted from midfield, has shown a composure well beyond his years in adapting to being a left-back in a Premiership team of so many talents. Already, after only 19 senior appearances, Harley is being touted as the answer to one of England's chronic problems. Vialli lends qualified support to that belief: \"He's probably one of the best left-sided offensive players in England. He's got to work on his defensive game but he has not been playing in that position for long. And let's see how the boy responds to more pressure.\" Taylor readily acknowledged the quality of Chelsea's winner, even if he saw it as yet another sucker punch, stemming from a Watford corner. Harley's header, high past Alec Chamberlain's left hand, climaxed a superb volleyed pass from Didier Deschamps and Dan Petrescu's inviting cross.

At a special conference in Dublin, Mr Adams said that republicans were looking to a new phase in which they would build up their electoral support to make it easier to resist unionist demands. \"If the Good Friday agreement is lost because the British government caved into unionist demands, one thing is certain,\" the Sinn Fein president said. \"At some point in the future, a new agreement will be negotiated. \"We have to ensure that Sinn Fein is there in a better position to negotiate a better agreement than the one which is now in tatters.\" Mr Adams told a Sinn Fein conference in Dublin it was the \"comparative weakness\" of nationalists against the strength of unionism that allowed Peter Mandelson to suspend the new political institutions in Belfast two weeks ago. \"We should also recall that during the negotiations leading to the Good Friday agreement, that if Sinn Fein had been a stronger player, the progressive elements of that agreement would have been much stronger,\" he said. Mr Adams' remarks made clear that the Sinn Fein leadership has lost any hope of reviving the Good Friday agreement on the government's terms. Peter Mandelson, who reimposed direct rule earlier this month, has made clear that he will only reverse his decision if the IRA give a clear commitment that it will begin to disarm. Mr Adams made clear that this was an impossible demand. \"If the British government, with all of its military firepower and muscle, could not get an IRA surrender in 30 years of war, then unionist leaders or British ministers cannot expect a Sinn Fein leadership to do it for them,\" he said. The current political vacuum must be closed, Mr Adams warned. \"Otherwise, there is the possibility that all of the good work of recent years could be frittered away.\" Mr Mandelson attempted to take heart from Mr Adams' speech, saying that he was glad to hear the Sinn Fein leadership reiterate its commitment to the political path. \"I'm glad that the republican movement is concentrating on electoral politics and not the use of guns,\" he said. But the Northern Ireland secretary insisted that demands for weapons to be put beyond use had to be met. \"I want Sinn Fein to come back to the table, talk with their partners in the process and find a way forward,\" Mr Mandelson said.

With the Limpopo river continuing to rise, just five helicopters continued to try to save as many people as possible stuck in trees and on rooftops in southern and central Mozambique. On Sunday, a 2m high wall of water submerged Chokwe, a town of 40,000 people about 125 miles north of the capital Maputo. On Monday, villages 25 miles farther downstream flooded, said Michele Quintaglie, spokeswoman for the UN world food programme. \"There will be thousands of people left behind tonight. These people will be on their own to get through the night,\" Ms Quintaglie said, adding that it appeared many of the thousands left in the Chokwe area overnight had survived. The five rescue helicopters currently deployed are not able to rescue people in all the flooded areas. One helicopter crew member described how a woman threw her baby at a full helicopter as it lifted off. He caught the child by its arm, saving it from certain death, but it was unclear whether its mother survived. Around 200 deaths have been confirmed as a result of the flooding so far, but officials believe the final toll is likely to be far higher. In a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon, international development secretary Clare Short confirmed the new \u00a3500,000 package and said that British aid for the stricken region now totalled \u00a32.2 million. The financial support is being channelled through the UN, Unicef, Oxfam and other charities. Ms Short also confirmed that two humanitarian specialists had been sent to the region to help co-ordinate the aid effort. \"We stand by ready to provide further assistance,\" she said. The German, Dutch and Norwegian governments also pledged to donate unspecified amounts to the rescue effort. The swollen Limpopo river will continue to rise in the nearest days, Mozambique's water department said. The Save river was also expected to continue rising. A World Food Programme report said 55,000 people needed to be evacuated from the southern Gaza province and 30,000 from the Save river valley. The national disaster management centre said the situation was critical at Xai-Xai, the capital of Gaza, downstream from Chokwe. Roads on both sides of the town of about 130,000 people have been washed away, and it has run out of fuel and has no power. Meanwhile, more water was heading downstream into Mozambique's Cahora Bassa Dam from its western neighbour, Zimbabwe, which released billions of gallons from its overflowing Kariba Dam yesterday. The Mozambican water department said this did not pose an immediate threat. In Zimbabwe, which has also been hit by tropical storms, president Robert Mugabe came under attack for concentrating resources on the Congo war instead of deploying adequate troops and helicopters to help rescue victims of a tropical cyclone. The opposition and official sources in the civil protection division said the government's disaster management programme has been hit seriously by a severe shortage of fuel and helicopters. The civil protection division said helicopters were still trying to rescue hundreds of people marooned in Manicaland and Chiredzi on the border with Mozambique. \"We have one helicopter [in our area] where we could have done with 10,\" said one source. \"...it's fairly obvious the planes are... in the Congo. Otherwise there is no reason why they would not have been permissioned for such an important task.\"",

      "body": "<p>There is a new holy trinity for the new millennium - a new mantra on every aspirant cyber squillionaire's lips. In order to succeed, you have to rise early and chant it for several hours. Let's practice. Repeat after me: \"Content, community, commerce; content, community, commerce . . . \" </p> <p>Get these three working together online and before you know it, you too will be the envy of your friends, family and former colleagues. It has worked for AOL, it has worked for Yahoo!, it has worked for Amazon - so, yes, it's about time you got it to work for you. </p> <p>Now, although many people are uttering the three Cs as if it was as important and innovative a concept as \"E=MC2\", the more sceptical among you will have noticed that there is very little that is new about it. </p> <p>The best of traditional media, whether newspapers, magazines, TV or radio, have after all been based on building communities around content and making money from them - primarily by getting those communities to pay for the content or by selling advertising. </p> <p>Online we still have the advertising model, but the real difference is that the revenue has shifted from the entrance point (the cover price) to the exit - what people go on to buy from your site. </p> <p>For example, NME, the paper, costs \u00a31.15 at the news-stand. Inside it, they tell you what music to buy and based on this information, you might go off to Our Price, where you will buy the CD. </p> <p>If the CD is any good, you will buy another copy of NME and go back to Our Price again and so on until everyone makes money except you - all your money has been spent on CDs. </p> <p>At NME.com, however, you read for free. But after reading a review and deciding you want to buy the CD, you simply click on the buy it button and, via Yalplay, you buy it and NME takes a slice. The distance between recommendation and retail, between content and commerce has almost disappeared. </p> <p>The same is true at Amazon - although it comes from the other direction. What was once simply a shop now hires journalists to write reviews of books and CDs - as well as getting users to write their own reviews. </p> <p>Now, in some ways this is good. There are few things more annoy ing than reading that something is fantastic and then not being able to get your hands on it in the shops. The convenience of reading about it and buying it immediately is an excellent service to readers. </p> <p>But all this convenience comes at a price. How much can we trust the reviews on a website where success is judged by the number of units sold through it? Where is the editorial independence? </p> <p>Anyone who can string a sentence together (and a fair few who can't) is currently being chased by various online retailers to provide their \"content\". One Amazon journalist told me recently their role was to \"accentuate the positive\", which is a slightly chilling term. That said, their reviews are pretty balanced. Scouring other sites shows considerably less neutrality. </p> <p>From other sites come reports of journalists lured by the offer of stunning share options and promises of editorial independence only to find themselves beaten up by the commercial team and forced into writing sales puffs. </p> <p>At the same time, there is a danger that this debate gets a little too precious. It has been standard practice for years in newspapers for readers to be able to buy a book or record that has been reviewed, but few can really suggest that the integrity of those pages have suffered because of it. Much of what is happening on the net is a natural and comfortable extension of this. </p> <p>And, quite frankly, it is rather naive to work in an e-commerce outlet, plan to earn a fortune from share options and think that you will never be part of actually selling anything.

      "bodyText": "There is a new holy trinity for the new millennium - a new mantra on every aspirant cyber squillionaire's lips. In order to succeed, you have to rise early and chant it for several hours. Let's practice. Repeat after me: \"Content, community, commerce; content, community, commerce . . . \" Get these three working together online and before you know it, you too will be the envy of your friends, family and former colleagues. It has worked for AOL, it has worked for Yahoo!, it has worked for Amazon - so, yes, it's about time you got it to work for you. Now, although many people are uttering the three Cs as if it was as important and innovative a concept as \"E=MC2\", the more sceptical among you will have noticed that there is very little that is new about it. The best of traditional media, whether newspapers, magazines, TV or radio, have after all been based on building communities around content and making money from them - primarily by getting those communities to pay for the content or by selling advertising. Online we still have the advertising model, but the real difference is that the revenue has shifted from the entrance point (the cover price) to the exit - what people go on to buy from your site. For example, NME, the paper, costs \u00a31.15 at the news-stand. Inside it, they tell you what music to buy and based on this information, you might go off to Our Price, where you will buy the CD. If the CD is any good, you will buy another copy of NME and go back to Our Price again and so on until everyone makes money except you - all your money has been spent on CDs. At NME.com, however, you read for free. But after reading a review and deciding you want to buy the CD, you simply click on the buy it button and, via Yalplay, you buy it and NME takes a slice. The distance between recommendation and retail, between content and commerce has almost disappeared. The same is true at Amazon - although it comes from the other direction. What was once simply a shop now hires journalists to write reviews of books and CDs - as well as getting users to write their own reviews. Now, in some ways this is good. There are few things more annoy ing than reading that something is fantastic and then not being able to get your hands on it in the shops. The convenience of reading about it and buying it immediately is an excellent service to readers. But all this convenience comes at a price. How much can we trust the reviews on a website where success is judged by the number of units sold through it? Where is the editorial independence? Anyone who can string a sentence together (and a fair few who can't) is currently being chased by various online retailers to provide their \"content\". One Amazon journalist told me recently their role was to \"accentuate the positive\", which is a slightly chilling term. That said, their reviews are pretty balanced. Scouring other sites shows considerably less neutrality. From other sites come reports of journalists lured by the offer of stunning share options and promises of editorial independence only to find themselves beaten up by the commercial team and forced into writing sales puffs. At the same time, there is a danger that this debate gets a little too precious. It has been standard practice for years in newspapers for readers to be able to buy a book or record that has been reviewed, but few can really suggest that the integrity of those pages have suffered because of it. Much of what is happening on the net is a natural and comfortable extension of this. And, quite frankly, it is rather naive to work in an e-commerce outlet, plan to earn a fortune from share options and think that you will never be part of actually selling anything. The answer here is not about what journalists are prepared (or forced) to do, but about the trust that is placed in their words by consumers. What people expect from a review or recommendation depends heavily on context. Consumers expect a certain amount of selling from Amazon but expect a newspaper or, say, the NME to be more selective. That doesn't mean that Amazon staff are entitled to behave like a bunch of barrow boys flogging bad fruit while a newspaper should refrain from promoting anything for fear of losing its dignity. The difference is much more subtle, and the trick for all involved is about finding the limits. For many media owners, commercial success on the net will come from some form of e-commerce. If they fail to exploit this to the full, they will find themselves in trouble. But if they push things too far, and betray readers' trust, they will be in even more trouble. Trust, you see, is the most precious commodity on the net. It is frighteningly difficult to gain, and just as frighteningly easy to lose. And once you have lost it, it is all but impossible to get it back.",

THE RUMOUR MILL According to Opta Soccer, Robbie Fowler will join Leeds in the wake of Emile Heskey's signing for Liverpool - the Anfield club are said to be making an official \u00a310m bid for the Leicester player. Middlesbrough have made an approach to Arsenal regarding Stephen Hughes. The 23-year-old midfielder, who would cost \u00a33m, does not figure in Arsene Wenger's plans and would be prepared to join Boro for the promise of first team football. Tottenham are interested in Bordeaux striker Lilian Laslandes and Wimbledon front-man John Hartson. Thomas Helveg, AC Milan's midfielder and right wing back, is a target for Chelsea and Tottenham. Manchester United are set to make an \u00a33.6m offer for Feyenoord's Polish international goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. If the bid fails, expect Alex Ferguson to turn his attentions to Wimbledon's Neil Sullivan. NEWS IN BRIEF Liverpool and Liverpool City Council have unveiled a \u00a320m plan to increase the capacity of Anfield to 60,000. The work could take four years to complete. Trading standards officers of the Highland Council have referred Celtic to the Office of Fair Trading over their refusal to refund tickets to Inverness Caledonian Thistle fans after their recent Scottish Cup tie at Parkhead was postponed and rescheduled for a midweek night. \"It should be commonly accepted nowadays, even by football clubs, that consumers should be entitled to a refund if goods or services are not supplied as per the contract made,\" said councillor Bill Fulton.

McLaren, an ex-Dundee United and Reading midfielder, tested positive for cocaine and cannabis at Reading's training ground in January. In an unrelated development, McLaren's contract at Reading was subsequently terminated and he is currently not contracted to any club.

It always seemed a curious way of tearing up one's money - listening for the thud of the 25% drop in its value as you drove it out of the showroom door. </p> <p>But when it came to replacing our ageing Volvo, fuel consumption was a driving issue and newness therefore of the essence. We'd been eyeing up the Peugeot 406 diesel; but a recent estate model would be \u00a315,000 or so and an older one wouldn't have the new, ultra-efficient, HDi engine. </p> <p>Might an import be the answer? A friend of mine had tried. She wanted an Audi A3 but had been told, quite wrongly, that it was unavailable on the continent in right-hand drive. By the time she'd discovered the truth of the matter she had already taken delivery of a UK showroom model. </p> <p>I was determined to do better and turned for guidance to the EU's car price website. This compares tax-free prices in each member country and gives an index figure for each car. For the Peugeot 406 the index is 128.8% in the UK, compared with 100% in Holland and 115% in Belgium. But the clear winner is Denmark, at 77.8% - or 40% off the UK price. </p> <p>Not that the Danes themselves are winners. When you add back Danish tax their cars are among the most expensive around. But the rock-bottom manufacturers' prices required to compensate means that every bargain-hunter in Europe is beating a path to their dealers' doors. Jonas, who sold us our car, was far too polite to admit that he was doing us a favour. But he didn't need us the way we needed him. He had been a struggle to find. I started by choosing batch of the larger dealers from the Peugeot Denmark website and faxing our requirements. </p> <p>Result: silence. I called the Peugeot hotline number given in the EU website, which turned out to be customer services in Coventry. It seemed a cheek to be asking them how to circumvent their own outrageous prices. They were polite, but scarcely chummy and offered me the number of the Peugeot importer in Denmark. </p> <p>The importer told me to contact a dealer. \"But the dealers won't speak to me,\" I returned. </p> <p>Then, a week later, came a message containing the phone number of one of the dealers I had already tried. I dialled it anyway, but the salesman who answered was adamant. \"We don't do UK cars,\" he told me. \"But,\" I protested, \"the importer said . . .\" A muffled conversation at the other end and then, suddenly, I was speaking to Jonas and the way ahead was clear. </p> <p>But what to order? We had wanted an LX family estate, with optional rear electric windows. The UK price was \u00a317,495 after dealer's discount. But equipment levels vary widely across Europe, and in Denmark we assumed we would be limited to a Danish model, although supplied with imperial speedometer and right-hand drive. </p> <p>We had spent hours poring over the model details from the Peugeot Denmark web site, guessing at the meaning of the Danish words for such things as vanity mirror and parcel shelf. Eventually we settled on the ST. In practice, Peugeot were not about to build an Anglo-Danish hybrid, so Jonas completed the circle by matching the ST back to a UK model. The equivalent he plumped for was the GTX, two levels up from the LX, list price \u00a320,470. </p> <p>The order form was on my desk within hours. The price, tax free, was 122,340 krone - a bit over \u00a310,000 at current rates. It included a whopping 10,000 krone for \"documentation\", but we were pleased to pay. The deposit requested was a reasonable 25%. </p> <p>With the run-up to Christmas and the millennium we put the car to the back of our minds. Then, in January, the call came. It was four months since we had placed the order. </p> <p>We had to organise in a hurry. Insurance was a problem. Our broker couldn't find cover that would operate before the car was registered in the UK. So I rang round and got it from Direct Line. The Go website was offering flights to Copenhagen for \u00a340. To get them you had to collect vouchers from a newspaper we didn't read. We had already missed the relevant days; could my brother be relied upon not to have thrown away his back numbers? Fortunately, he could. </p> <p>Six in the morning on the day of departure. Travelling light, we left the pushchair at home and set out on foot for the station. A bad moment to remind ourselves how slowly the children walk. We missed the train but made it to the check-in at Stansted with six minutes to spare. </p> <p>In Copenhagen the Tivoli Gardens was closed so we went to the zoo. The next day we called on Jonas. It took him a moment or two to negotiate our bankers' draft, but he had the invoice, temporary Danish registration and the all-important manufacturers' certificate of conformity ready on his desk. We had 24 hours to leave the country. </p> <p>Only the certificate of conformity bothered us. The left/right- hand drive and metric/imperial speedometer options had not been ticked. Jonas could not read the French and shrugged. We decided to hope for the best. </p> <p>We drove through the night, entertaining ourselves with the trip computer and the rain-sensitive windscreen wipers while trying to interpret the Danish instruction manual. Despite getting hopelessly lost in Holland we ended up in Dover at nine the next morning, green but triumphant after a choppy crossing, elated to hear the thud of our new car increasing in value as we drove it on to British soil. </p> <p>Registration was simple, or would have been if the certificate of confor mity had not been rejected. I called Peugeot in Coventry. Our certificate was only valid in certain countries - a case of EU harmonisation that was not quite harmonious. They agreed to issue a new one.

No question asked. </p> <p>Now we are registered and legal, with tax disc and smart new V reg. number plates, awaiting only the last piece in the jigsaw: a bill from customs and excise for 17.5% that will bring the purchase price to about \u00a312,000. Add \u00a3500 as the cost of collection and the saving is a clear \u00a35,000 compared with the car we originally wanted; nearer \u00a37,000 compared with the higher specification car we actually drove away. </p> <p><strong> Checklist</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Start with the EU website at http://europa.eu.int/comm/ dg04/aid/en/car.htm - go from there to the six-monthly price report.

      "body": "<p>The green activists who have worked so hard for this moment hail it as Tony Blair's biggest u-turn since becoming prime minister. We can argue about that, but there is no doubt that Mr Blair's shift on genetically modified food represents a dramatic change of heart. One year ago the PM was urging us to \"resist the tyranny of pressure groups\", insisting that GM foods were perfectly safe and that if he was happy to eat them, then so should we. Yesterday Mr Blair declared almost the reverse position: \"There's no doubt that there is potential for harm, both in terms of human safety and in the diversity of our environment, from GM foods and crops.\" This represents a significant journey by the PM, in terms of both policy and politics. </p> <p>First the substance of the move. As an early campaigner on this once-ignored question, we welcome Mr Blair's sudden conversion to a cause he once dismissed as mere hysteria. For Mr Blair seemed to make up his mind hurriedly on GM foods. Soon after taking office, he was persuaded that Britain could be a world leader in biotechnology and that we should not make the frequent mistake of our past - letting our domination of a new technology slip away. Appealing, too, was the ethical dimension: the hard-sell for GM claimed this innovation would cure world hunger at a stroke, using science to feed the third world. Labour's new friends in big business were keen. For our young, outward-looking, modernising premier, GM food must have seemed a technology made in his own image. The fact that, as David Hencke and Rob Evans reveal on our news pages today, President Clinton was lobbying heavily for GM cannot have hurt. </p> <p>So it is no wonder that, when the backlash came, Mr Blair and his team were first surprised then airily dismissive. For them this was yet another case of the future against the past, with the greens and consumer activists mere Luddites determined to stand in the way of progress. On GM foods, we were part of the legendary forces of conservatism. But the behind-the-scenes perseverance of the pressure groups and the (often underestimated) environment minister Michael Meacher seems to have turned things around. The argument that there is at least a risk to pressing ahead with such untried technology, whose long-term impact on our environment can only be guessed at, has clearly prevailed. Perhaps now Mr Blair will act on his article in the Independent on Sunday yesterday, and accept that the right approach to GM is proper testing and labelling before any of these new products or crops are foisted on the public. </p> <p>So much for the policy. The politics of this u-turn are also significant. Mr Blair appears to have timed his reverse for today's opening of the OECD conference on GM food in Edinburgh. He will have been warned that the gathering threatened to become \"another Seattle\", with anti-GM activists dominating proceedings. Fearful of the PR disaster that would have ensued, the prime minister clearly calculated that it was better to have red faces in the government before the conference than red paint thrown at the government once it started. </p> <p>We hope that this is the start of a change, that Tony Blair will be less dismissive of sincere concerns voiced in future. Maybe he will hesitate before waving aside a future public outcry the way he brushed off anxiety over GM food, as a \"flash in the pan\". Perhaps Mr Blair will realise that he does not always know the public mind better than it knows itself - and that sometimes the ability to lead is also the ability to listen.</p>",

Labour's new friends in big business were keen. For our young, outward-looking, modernising premier, GM food must have seemed a technology made in his own image. The fact that, as David Hencke and Rob Evans reveal on our news pages today, President Clinton was lobbying heavily for GM cannot have hurt. So it is no wonder that, when the backlash came, Mr Blair and his team were first surprised then airily dismissive. For them this was yet another case of the future against the past, with the greens and consumer activists mere Luddites determined to stand in the way of progress. On GM foods, we were part of the legendary forces of conservatism. But the behind-the-scenes perseverance of the pressure groups and the (often underestimated) environment minister Michael Meacher seems to have turned things around. The argument that there is at least a risk to pressing ahead with such untried technology, whose long-term impact on our environment can only be guessed at, has clearly prevailed. Perhaps now Mr Blair will act on his article in the Independent on Sunday yesterday, and accept that the right approach to GM is proper testing and labelling before any of these new products or crops are foisted on the public. So much for the policy. The politics of this u-turn are also significant. Mr Blair appears to have timed his reverse for today's opening of the OECD conference on GM food in Edinburgh. He will have been warned that the gathering threatened to become \"another Seattle\", with anti-GM activists dominating proceedings. Fearful of the PR disaster that would have ensued, the prime minister clearly calculated that it was better to have red faces in the government before the conference than red paint thrown at the government once it started. We hope that this is the start of a change, that Tony Blair will be less dismissive of sincere concerns voiced in future. Maybe he will hesitate before waving aside a future public outcry the way he brushed off anxiety over GM food, as a \"flash in the pan\". Perhaps Mr Blair will realise that he does not always know the public mind better than it knows itself - and that sometimes the ability to lead is also the ability to listen.",

      "bodyText": "President Clinton was briefed to put intensive pressure on Tony Blair to open up Britain and Europe to US genetically modified food and crops during private talks at the Downing Street summit in 1998, papers released to the Guardian revealed yesterday. And within 24 hours of US protests, Britain had acted to modify proposals to try to open the way for more GM food being sold in Britain and the rest of the European Union. The approach, which was never made public, was timed for three separate meetings - two in Downing Street's state dining room, and at Dunbar Court in the foreign office, at the EU summit on May 18. Documents released to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act reveal President Clinton was briefed to warn Mr Blair - who then held the EU presidency - that \"the EU's slow and non-transparent approval process for genetically modified organisms has cost US exporters hundreds of millions in lost sales.\" It goes on: \"In the spirit of increased US-EU regulatory cooperation, we urge the EU to take immediate action to ensure that these products receive a timely review.\" Papers for the meeting show the same complaints were put to President Jacques Santer, then head of the European Commission, and Sir Leon Brittan, then EU foreign affairs commissioner. The papers show more detailed complaints were put to Margaret Beckett, then trade secretary, and Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, by William Daley, the US trade secretary, and Madeleine Albright, the US secretary of state, at meetings in the foreign office and Downing Street that morning. Participating in the talks were the co-chairmen of the Transatlantic Business Dialogue - a lobbying organisation - Lodewijk de Vink, chief executive of Warner-Lambert (now Time-Warner), the US in ternational media company, and Juergen Schrempp, chief executive of Daimler-Benz, the car makers, who back deregulation of European-US trade. The papers show that not only did the US attack the EU over the slow approval of GM crops but it criticised the labelling of GM foods. The brief reads: \"Differences among member states over labelling have been an impediment to reforming the approval process. We will be watching the commission's efforts to implement its new guidelines for labelling and we hope the EU can now move quickly to complete review of the products in the pipeline. \"That said, the US sees no reason to label a product simply because it has been genetically engineered.

      "body": "<p>On Wednesday, South Africa's human rights commissioners will gather in Johannesburg in the hope, rather than the expectation, of interrogating the country's editors on alleged racism in their news coverage. </p> <p>The commission has summonsed more than 30 journalists with threats of up to six months in prison if they refuse to comply. Those summonsed include Richard Lambert, editor of the Financial Times, Victor Mallett, South Africa correspondent of the Financial Times, and John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times. Some are determined not to show up, saying the subpoenas fly in the face of constitutional guarantees of press freedom besides any concern about the planned conduct of the hearings. Editors are presumed guilty and open to interrogation on just about anything the commissioners care to ask. </p> <p>A group of black editors, while criticising the \"ill-advised\" approach, says it will cooperate with the probe because the greater crime is the racism still rife in South Africa's press. </p> <p>The human rights commission launched its investigation a year ago after the Black Lawyers Association accused a leading anti-apartheid newspaper - the Mail and Guardian - of unfairly targeting black professionals in corruption stories. The BLA said that over a six-month period the paper, in which the Guardian Media Group has a majority stake, printed three times as many stories about corrupt black people as white people. </p> <p>The paper questioned the figures, and pointed out that with black people now dominating government, they were likely to account for a higher number of corruption cases. The BLA made similar accusations of \"subliminal racism\" against the Johannesburg Sunday Times. </p> <p>The human rights commission took the complaint as an opportunity to launch an inquiry into racism in the entire news media. It began with a 200-page report that amounts to the case for the prosecution at this week's hearings. The commission says the report provides \"prima facie\" evidence of media racism and that the press should be held to account. A series of images (reproduced, right) became the centre of heated debate. </p> <p>The report's author, Claudia Braude, throws mainstream South African journalism under apartheid into damning context. She highlights the profits-driven policy of collaboration with white governments. \"Newsrooms were infiltrated by spies, and intelligence and military agents who helped to control the shaping of the apartheid mind. This is a story that has only barely begun to be told. It nonetheless has major implications for the credibility of the contemporary mass media industry,\" the report says. </p> <p>The South African press is still dominated by white people whose preferences and prejudices influence the choice of news stories and how they are portrayed. The industry only has itself to blame for a shortage of black reporters and editors. Most newspapers never bothered to start targeted training schemes until it was evident apartheid had run its course. </p> <p>But further scrutiny of the report brought howls of derision. It was dismissed as a collection of unsubstantiated allegations, even absurdities in places. Braude failed to scrutinise the allegations for accuracy but still used them to bolster her premise that coverage of almost every story - from crime and politics to war and business - is infused with \"subliminal racism\". Critics, even those sympathetic with the need for inquiry into racism in the press, pointed out that in her efforts to prove racism across the board, Braude allowed herself to be dragged into a number of indefensible positions. In so doing, she let those with real transgressions to defend off the hook. </p> <p>Interestingly, in its pursuit of the white-dominated press the human rights commission chose Braude, a white woman, to write the report and the Media Monitoring Project, a white-run organisation, to provide the statistical interpretation. </p> <p>Few of the editors who have been summonsed to appear are clear about exactly what they will be asked to account for. But the human rights commission's report gives them a fair idea. It is divided into three parts: </p> <p><strong> 'White Supremacist Narratives of South Africa in Transition'</strong><br> </p> <p>Braude opens her analysis with more than a dozen pages on anti-Semitism in Die Afrikaner, an obscure Afrikaner nationalist newspaper which persistently denies the Holocaust and favours theories about a Jewish masterplan to bring about a new world order. The report also delves into Radio Pretoria, a once-banned station that has made no secret of its pro-apartheid leanings with its perpetual rantings about humans being like plants divided into sub-groups that should not cross-pollinate. Radio Pretoria broadcasts predictable diatribes against affirmative action, land reform and other measures to right past wrongs. </p> <p>The report concludes: \"Both Die Afrikaner and Radio Pretoria repre sent South Africa in a state of decline as a direct consequence of transition to non-racial, democratic rule, and particularly of black governance.\" Although neither organisation reaches much beyond a narrow and bigoted audience, they are used as the basis of an examination of the mainstream press in the second part of the report. </p> <p><strong> 'Racialisation of news in mainstream coverage of contemporary South Africa'</strong><br> </p> <p> In her examination of the mainstream media, Braude looks at one week of news coverage in June 1999. Stories of doctors complaining about overcrowded hospitals, a threat from rabid dogs and fresh budget cuts are all deemed racist because they portray black government in a negative light. </p> <p>The analysis for which the report was most widely derided leaps out. It focuses on an editorial in The Citizen, a Johannesburg daily, which criticises the standard of rubbish collection. Braude sees it as evidence of a \"deep-seated racialised anxiety about dirt\". </p> <p>\"The psychosexual racist logic arises from the phallic obsessions, Oedipal projections and anal-sadistic orientations in European cultures which endow non-European (especially African) men and women with sexual prowess; view non-Europeans as either cruel, revengeful fathers, frivolous, carefree children, or passive, long-suffering mothers; and identify non-Europeans (especially black people) with dirt, odious smells and faeces,\" the report says. </p> <p>The Johannesburg Star called it \"psycho babble\". Others noted that many of the complaints about rubbish collection come from the townships, which are still badly served compared to the formerly whites-only suburbs. </p> <p>And then there was the seemingly innocuous picture of two birds sitting on a rubbish bin that appeared on the front page of The Star under the headline, Trash for Two. One of the birds is a maribou stork. The commission concluded that the bin symbolised the decay of Johannesburg under black rule and the birds a fear of Africans flooding in. \"As such, the photograph integrates anxieties about decaying urban infrastructure with fears of incursions from Africa,\" it says. Except, as the caption says, the picture was taken in Uganda not Johannesburg. </p> <p>But it is the report's analysis of political coverage which is most telling. The commission was clearly disturbed at the numerous articles which probed President Thabo Mbeki's style of politics, often portrayed as centralised and secretive. </p> <p>The Mail and Guardian was taken to task over an article entitled \"Can Thabo be a good Machiavelli?\". Braude concluded that this, and similar articles in other papers, was aimed at portraying Mbeki as \"another power-hungry soon-to-be African dictator\". Others saw it as examining the president's exercise of power in much the way Tony Blair's style of politics has been similarly scrutinised. </p> <p>The report dedicates much space to stories on Mbhazima \"Sam\" Shilowa, just installed as the African National Congress premier of the country's richest province, Guateng. The Star had a story about Shilowa's annual \"state of the province\" address under the headline \"Shilowa outlines Guateng master plan\". It is accompanied by a photograph of the premier on a TV screen. The commission concluded that the story and picture were designed to invoke a \"fear of black dictatorship\". </p> <p>\"The spectre of Orwellian control evoked by the photograph is underscored by the word 'master plan' in the headline,\" it said. </p> <p><strong> 'The Media Monitoring Project'</strong><br> </p> <p> The third part of the report is an analysis by the Media Monitoring Project. It sets out dozens of propositions - black lives are unimportant, African society is primitive and Africa is ridden with disaster, disease and violence - and then judges to what extent news stories reinforce these racial stereotypes. </p> <p>In the process the MMP ties itself in knots. It repeatedly criticises headlines and news stories for \"depersonalising\" black people by talking about the numbers of dead instead of individual identity, such as one which read: \"Thirty die in Nigerian unrest\". </p> <p>The report states: \"Frequently reporting on events where black people had died tended to focus on the numbers of people who had died rather than individual deaths.\" </p> <p>But later the MMP complains that the South African press is more likely to intrude on the sorrow of black people than whites. It criticises TV cameramen for \"taking close-up shots of mourners uncontrollably sobbing\". </p> <p>\"This reinforces the stereotype of black people being emotional and out of control,\" the report says. </p> <p>The MMP complains of racial bias because John F Kennedy Jr's death and the \"death of a few British tourists\" in a bus crash (it was 27) received more coverage in the South African media than the loss of 18 miners in an accident and the death of 500 Indians in a train crash. </p> <p>The commission protests that there is insufficient depth of coverage of the conflicts in Congo, or ethnic killings in Nigeria. Yet the report also complains of too many stories about wars in Africa. The MMP says it reinforces perceptions of the continent as \"ridden with disaster, disease and violence\". At no point does it say that any of the stories have got their facts wrong. </p> <p>It might be argued that to ignore the problems of Africa, and the suffering of Africans because of war, corruption, maladministration and Aids is in itself racist because it avoids focusing on the suffering of black people. </p> <p>But perhaps the most troublesome part of the MMP's report is its failure to compare the headlines it criticises with reports on other conflicts. Had it done so it would have found equally \"depersonalising\" headlines about Kosovo, East Timor and Chechnya.</p>",

Frank Dobson's controversial selection as mayoral candidate was swiftly followed last week by a slap-down from the House of Lords over whether candidates should have free mailings. </p> <p>But there could be further humiliation in store. All other pratfalls not-withstanding, political analysts agree that a poor or indifferent turnout for the elections on May 4 will be another severe embarrassment for the government and its flagship policy of devolution, no matter who is elected. </p> <p>With this very much in mind, the government is spending \u00a34m on a blanket advertising campaign, one of its most sophisticated to date, aimed at explaining the complexities of London's new electoral system and persuading apathetic Londoners to vote. The budget may not sound much by the multi-million pound standards of modern business, but the fact that the entire amount will be spent in London, most of it within 10 weeks, means that its distinctive orange asterisk logo will be almost impossible to miss. If the media schedule hits its targets, the average Londoner will be exposed to the campaign in one or other of its many forms at least 50 times in the coming weeks. </p> <p>The first wave, the so-called \"responsibilities\" phase of the campaign, broke last week as 1,700 posters went up all over the capital bearing the headline \"It's the biggest job in London. You choose who gets it\". The line will also be carried on the back of bus and tube tickets. \"The idea is to explain exactly what the mayor does and how he can affect individual lives,\" explains Jo Cave, account director at the campaign's advertising agency WCRS. </p> <p>The message will be reinforced by radio and press adverts, tube posters and a TV commercial (revealed here for the first time) directed by Selby at Godman films, which breaks this Wednesday. The 30-second films shows scenes of London life with the ubiquitous orange asterisk highlighting the mayor's responsibilities such as transport and policing. </p> <p>Phase two of the campaign will use the local press to explain the mechanics of the mayoral election process, how to vote and key electoral innovations. The final assault on the capital's consciousness will begin five days before \"E day\" - as the government commandeers every advertising vehicle available. Five 10-second TV films, press and radio ads as well as buses, beer mats and airships will announce the countdown to the election. There will also be a door drop to every London household detailing the mayor's responsibilities and telling people how and where to vote. </p> <p>It may sound a little over the top, but the approach was determined by fears that Londoners, some of whom have voted no fewer than five times in the past three years, may be suffering \"election fatigue\". \"Londoners have been called to vote so often recently, another direct call to vote wouldn't be heard,\" Cave said. \"People don't vote for a community or for an idea. They want to know what the impact will be on their individual lives. So we are addressing them as the mayor's employers in an attempt to make them feel empowered.\" </p> <p>The question is, do campaigns like this work? Evidence from previous campaigns is mixed. The government regularly runs programmes encouraging people to register to vote, but the spends tend to be so tiny - \u00a30.5m over the entire country - that effects are negligible, or indiscernible. </p> <p>There have been similar efforts to encourage greater participation in US presidential elections, but turnout is still around 55%. The government spent \u00a32m in Scotland and \u00a32m in Wales promoting the elections, but even the first flush of enthusiasm for their own parliaments failed to produce turnouts anywhere near those for a general election. The problem is that the power of advertising is quite limited. \"Advertising is best at raising awareness,\" says Roger Mortimer, senior political analyst at market research firm MORI. \"The vast majority of people know this election is happening, so to have any effect, it will have to change attitudes, to convince people that the election matters.\" </p> <p>But that is a much harder task. Even if it did succeed, how could we tell, asks Patrick Dunleavy, professor of government at the London School of Economics. \"Campaigns like these can work if all the other switches are facing in the right direction,\" he says. \"But advertising is a comparatively minor factor in the mix. The commitment of government and the major parties [markedly lacking in last year's European elections] and quality of the field, will affect turn out far more.\" This, he says, creates a tension between Labour as the government and Labour as a political party. \"Ironically the best chance of a good turnout is if Ken Livingstone stands. If he doesn't, there will be much less public interest.\" </p> <p>The refusal to let mayoral candidates have the one-off mail shot customary in parliamentary elections illustrates just how the government can act to keep interest low. Much of the debate about such campaigns tends to centre on their technical merits and party political manoeuvrings. But there are those who believe that they can serve a fundamental role in the political enfranchisement of minorities and their enlistment into mainstream society. </p> <p>Operation Black Vote was established in 1996 to sell politics to the black community and encourage participation in the electoral process. \"About 27% of black people aren't registered to vote, compared to 6% of white people,\" says Simon Wooley, the campaign's co-founder. He says campaigns to persuade people to vote can work and are important, especially where whole groups don't participate. He points to a test campaign in the London borough of Southwark where a mailing to 50,000 black people increased registration by 7%. </p> <p>Wooley, who has a background in the industry, says that advertising is exactly the right way to address the problem of voter apathy. \"You have to sell politics to a justifiably cynical community,\" he argues. </p> <p>He supports the orange asterisk campaign in principle, but says it has missed a trick. The first mistake he says was to target the entire population. Like universal benefits, it's a waste of money. \"The middle classes don't need to be told that the election is happening. The campaign should be far more heavily targeted towards minorities.\" But he also says that the idea that such campaigns can work in isolation is wrong. \"Campaigns in a vacuum don't work. We need to demystify the democratic process, and without an ongoing programme that just can't happen.\"</p>",

With the BBC's Kick The Habit campaign getting under way next week, Dr Smith's treatment may at least help to cure Mr Salmon of west London of his addiction to replaying old comedies. </p> <p>Or take the big sports events so far this year: the likely Six Nations decider between England and France, the England vs Argentina football friendly, the resumed Champions League and the FA Cup quarter-finals were all broadcast by Sky, ITV, or some combination of the two, leaving BBC1 forced to make do with less crucial rugby internationals and Fifa's torpid club tournament in Brazil. Buddy, can you spare \u00a3200m? </p> <p>Further wounds were inflicted a fortnight ago by Royal Television Society research indicating that ITV broadcast 66 of the 100 most-watched programmes last year, including all the top 10. Broadcast magazine's ratings analyst, William Phillips, who compiled the chart, argued: \"Take away EastEnders and a handful of specials, and little remains to justify the corporation's pretensions as a convenor of the whole nation for shared amusement.\" </p> <p>The BBC response was predictable. \"We don't judge ourselves purely by numbers, we have different barometers of our success. We aim to give all licence fee payers a nourishing schedule filled with quality and diversity.\" This follows the argument advanced by the director of television, Alan Yentob, when campaigning for the director-general post, that the BBC should not be fixated on ratings if its programmes were innovative, educational or of high quality. </p> <p>Echoing this mantra, BBC1 controller Peter Salmon chose \"Quality, range, diversity\" as his slogan for the winter season, but he also struck a more personal note by speaking of \"programmes which push back the boundaries of ambition\", presumably referring to Castaway 2000 and last week's Child Of Our Time. This is a recurring theme (\"unless you can be ambitious on BBC1, what's the point?\"), and his willingness to gamble has resulted, again and again, in glory co-existing with disaster. </p> <p>Last winter's successes, including the return of Parky, were overshadowed by the catastrophic results of Salmon's signing of Vanessa; this winter's successes, such as Paul Abbott's Clocking Off, have similarly won less press coverage than the Castaway 2000 fiasco or the gaffe-strewn live millennium spectacular. Welcoming Victoria Wood back to BBC1 has been offset by the seeming insanity of signing Hale &amp; Pace, the bold coup of switching The Royle Family from BBC2 to BBC1 by the equally daring blunder of putting Mrs Merton And Malcolm straight onto BBC1. </p> <p>Last autumn - with Warriors, Walking with Dinosaurs, and Wives and Daughters - was his most impressive season so far, marred only by the high-profile embarrassment of French and Saunders' Let Them Eat Cake. But of its successes only The Royle Family is a returning series, highlighting his biggest headache: a lack of \"banker\" shows in drama, comedy and entertainment. By the end of May he will have totted up 1,000 days in the job, but the Casualty spin-off Holby City and Dinnerladies are the only new, BBC1-originated series in these genres with audiences averaging above 9m. </p> <p>Salmon inherited a number of shows nearing the end of their natural lives, and has done all that could be asked of a controller - hiring top talent - in his efforts to replace them. Reeves and Mortimer, Bazal and Ginger, for example, have all been called up to little avail to stop the rot on Saturday nights. </p> <p>He has been unlucky in trying to fill the gaps left by Men Behaving Badly, Birds of a Feather and Goodnight Sweetheart: neither Marks &amp; Gran nor Simon Nye have so far provided him with another stonker, and two John Sullivan sitcoms have disappointed. In drama, similarly, Lucy Gannon has produced strong finite works but not another Soldier Soldier or Peak Practice, and Kay Mellor (Playing the Field) and Mike Bullen (Sunburn) have added to a long list of BBC1 semi-hits rather than delivering the kind of ratings their ITV shows get. </p> <p>Equally unfortunately, Salmon's period as controller has coincided with ITV's transformation into a ruthless ratings machine, increasing its share targets each year and so pushing BBC1 consistently below 30%, slumping to 26% in its nadir last year. Key defeats have been inflicted - on Christmas day, on Saturday nights, in the head-to-head between SM TV: Live and Live &amp; Kicking. </p> <p>Just as troublingly, however, David Liddiment, ITV's director of programmes, has combined this relentless frontal offensive with sneakily contesting the BBC's claim to a uniquely \"rich mix\", to a monopoly of \"quality and diversity\" - a strategy clearest in drama. If you add up their respective (non-soap, first-run) primetime drama offerings this week, BBC1 has six totalling five hours 10 minutes, compared to ITV's seven totalling seven hours. The latter figure was even higher in previous weeks, when it played two-hour whodunnits on Saturday night. </p> <p>Nor are these all cops 'n' docs shows - ITV is closing the gap in costume adaptations, and such series as Four Fathers, Last Train, At Home With The Braithwaites and Reach For The Moon are far from being formulaic genre pieces. The Death Of Stephen Lawrence and Lost For Words were last year's best single plays. </p> <p>Tellingly, BBC programming is now divided in its seasonal and weekly press packs into \"highlights\" - led in the current season by Castaway 2000, Clocking Off, Kick the Habit and the forthcoming remake of Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) - and the unloved, under-promoted remainder. Funding flows towards prestige projects such as Walking With Dinosaurs or Vanity Fair, designed to win Bafta awards and impress governors and MPs. </p> <p>Surrounded by mediocrity and re-run reminders of past glories, these peaks belie an overall picture in which ITV is on top in drama, entertainment and sport, has countered BBC1's (now less decisive) ascendancy in sitcom by developing comedy dramas, and is on level-pegging in popular factual output since the waning of the docu-soap fad. </p> <p>The BBC's sole clear-cut area of supremacy is in anything which involves informing or coaching the public, a broad spectrum stretching from Walking with Dinosaurs and televising literary classics to consumer programmes and leisure shows such as Ground Force and Changing Rooms. </p> <p>And, luckily, this aptitude for providing spoonfuls of entertainment to help the medicine of information go down coincides with the government's conception of the key function of broadcasting. Tony Blair identifies his priorities as \"education, education, education\"; Greg Dyke declares in a Spectator lecture that education will be at the heart of his BBC; Chris Smith specifies that, besides boosting BBC1, the extra licence-fee income must go towards the corporation's \"commitment to education\". </p> <p>Smith's statement left it unclear how he defines \"education programmes\", and whether he expects more of them in peak on BBC1 and BBC2. But - even if the only formal requirement is for more money to go to dedicated niche services and off-peak schools/adult-learning zones - one can readily imagine controllers and producers, sensing the way the wind is blowing, getting still more enthusiastic about television's new-found mission to teach. The empires of the BBC's science and education departments, which already include such series as Animal Hospital, will grab more of the schedule. Getting educated by stealth will be increasingly hard to avoid if you're watching the BBC. </p> <p>It's vital, however, that beefing up BBC1 is kept separate from all this homework for the viewer. With 78 years of Reithian experience behind it, the BBC is confident in the role of teacher, good-humouredly bossy in its campaigns or beat-the-criminals series, making lessons fun in its dinosaur soap or in Robert Winston's science epics. </p> <p>But it's perhaps no coincidence that a period when - governed by John Birt's \"mission to inform\" - it's been at its most pedagogic has seen it surrender countless sports rights and lose the knack of making frivolous, fictional programmes which are not the least bit worthy or instructive. Programmes which politicians rarely see or understand. </p> <p>So every penny possible from Smith's \u00a3200m hand-out should go towards sitcoms, sport, and dramas which are neither adapted from A-level texts nor set in schools. Otherwise, BBC1 risks turning into what Radio 4 has already become - a brilliant sixth-form college, but incapable of coming up with anything new which is not designed to improve its audience.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\"Don't forget the Fruit Gums, Mum\" - a brutal appeal to kids' pester power, or an unforgettable campaign that made Fruit Gums a favourite in many homes? You take your pick. Well, the issue is back again - and this time with a vengeance. </p> <p>A recent conference on toys and games highlighted, again, the issue of television advertising to children and the threat of a Europe-wide ban when Sweden takes up presidency of the European Union next year. When Sweden announced its presidential agenda, extending its own ban on television advertising to children throughout Europe was high on its list. I understand that it's dropped down their batting order since then, and most commentators believe their chances of imposing the ban are slim. This is good news because, like most bans, it would be ineffective and counter-productive. </p> <p>The reason for the ban in Sweden is because their government accepted research stating that most children could not recognise the difference between advertisements and programmes until they were 10 years old. They then added two years for luck, and imposed a ban on television ads aimed at the under-12s. The deputy director of the Swedish ministry of culture added for good measure that television advertising leaves children \"vulnerable to abuse and deception by adults\". </p> <p>All the evidence in this country shows that children's advertising literacy develops from the age of four and that by the age of seven or eight they have developed a good understanding of the purpose and intent of advertising. The Independent Television Commission, scrutinising the rules governing toy advertising, concluded that \"as a result of exposure to media technology of all kinds, the children were quick to assimilate and interpret what they were shown\". </p> <p>Beyond this, there is a series of reasons why a ban would be inappropriate for the UK. First, the quality of children's television. Swedish children's television is dominated by cheap American cartoons (many of which, by the way, are linked to merchandising). A ban on children's advertising here would have a catastrophic effect on the funding of commercial children's television programming. </p> <p>If advertising revenue were taken away from ITV, children's programmes would be removed, reduced to low-cost shows from elsewhere, or could even become available as subscription only. </p> <p>Next, the accusation that pester power is purely the result of television advertising. Nonsense. All the studies from Sweden that I have seen show there is no less pester power for toys there than here. The major sources are toy catalogues and playground competitiveness. </p> <p>Even here, somebody told me last year, the Argos catalogue have more impact on children in the UK than all the television advertising put together. And let's not forget the international marketing phenomenon of movies like Toy Story 2. </p> <p>Next, cost. Swedish toys are up to 40% more expensive than in the rest of the EU. This higher cost is the result of limited competition. Competition always brings down prices and benefits the consumer. Advertising is an essential component of a competitive marketplace. </p> <p>Of course, any focus group of parents asked if they would like to see less advertising aimed at children would probably say yes. But the same group asked if they would like to see less advertising but that, as a consequence, toys would be more expensive would say no. </p> <p>What we should be paying attention to, and what we in this country do pay attention to, is how best to self-regulate advertising, to make sure that vulnerable audiences aren't exploited. Advertising agencies comply with tough rules about what we can and cannot do. The regulations pay special regard to the child audience and contain provisions to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate commercial messages or influence. </p> <p> O f course, elements of merchandising are excessive and irritating for parents. But advertising helps children to discriminate and to grow up. And, just like adults, they know, or they soon learn, that they can't automatically have what they see advertised. All of us face a range of marketing influences around which we make our choices. Children are going to be joining a commercial world. They have to learn to cope with and interpret the marketing influences that surround them. </p> <p>The issue of television advertising to children will also surely be raised at the International Advertising Association congress in June. Archbishop Foley, representing the Vatican, will give his views on the power of advertising and spell out why he thinks it should be limited. I'm looking forward to hearing what he says, and giving the counter argument. </p> <p>Advertising does not exist in a vacuum; it doesn't exist for its own sake, like art or religion. It's a commercial activity. If you don't like the ads, you don't have to buy the goods. Ultimate power rests with the consumer. Trying to ring-fence advertising in the way proposed is futile and would be counter-productive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"Don't forget the Fruit Gums, Mum\" - a brutal appeal to kids' pester power, or an unforgettable campaign that made Fruit Gums a favourite in many homes? You take your pick. Well, the issue is back again - and this time with a vengeance. A recent conference on toys and games highlighted, again, the issue of television advertising to children and the threat of a Europe-wide ban when Sweden takes up presidency of the European Union next year. When Sweden announced its presidential agenda, extending its own ban on television advertising to children throughout Europe was high on its list. I understand that it's dropped down their batting order since then, and most commentators believe their chances of imposing the ban are slim. This is good news because, like most bans, it would be ineffective and counter-productive. The reason for the ban in Sweden is because their government accepted research stating that most children could not recognise the difference between advertisements and programmes until they were 10 years old. They then added two years for luck, and imposed a ban on television ads aimed at the under-12s. The deputy director of the Swedish ministry of culture added for good measure that television advertising leaves children \"vulnerable to abuse and deception by adults\". All the evidence in this country shows that children's advertising literacy develops from the age of four and that by the age of seven or eight they have developed a good understanding of the purpose and intent of advertising. The Independent Television Commission, scrutinising the rules governing toy advertising, concluded that \"as a result of exposure to media technology of all kinds, the children were quick to assimilate and interpret what they were shown\". Beyond this, there is a series of reasons why a ban would be inappropriate for the UK. First, the quality of children's television. Swedish children's television is dominated by cheap American cartoons (many of which, by the way, are linked to merchandising). A ban on children's advertising here would have a catastrophic effect on the funding of commercial children's television programming. If advertising revenue were taken away from ITV, children's programmes would be removed, reduced to low-cost shows from elsewhere, or could even become available as subscription only. Next, the accusation that pester power is purely the result of television advertising. Nonsense. All the studies from Sweden that I have seen show there is no less pester power for toys there than here. The major sources are toy catalogues and playground competitiveness. Even here, somebody told me last year, the Argos catalogue have more impact on children in the UK than all the television advertising put together. And let's not forget the international marketing phenomenon of movies like Toy Story 2. Next, cost. Swedish toys are up to 40% more expensive than in the rest of the EU. This higher cost is the result of limited competition. Competition always brings down prices and benefits the consumer. Advertising is an essential component of a competitive marketplace. Of course, any focus group of parents asked if they would like to see less advertising aimed at children would probably say yes. But the same group asked if they would like to see less advertising but that, as a consequence, toys would be more expensive would say no. What we should be paying attention to, and what we in this country do pay attention to, is how best to self-regulate advertising, to make sure that vulnerable audiences aren't exploited. Advertising agencies comply with tough rules about what we can and cannot do. The regulations pay special regard to the child audience and contain provisions to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate commercial messages or influence. O f course, elements of merchandising are excessive and irritating for parents. But advertising helps children to discriminate and to grow up. And, just like adults, they know, or they soon learn, that they can't automatically have what they see advertised. All of us face a range of marketing influences around which we make our choices. Children are going to be joining a commercial world. They have to learn to cope with and interpret the marketing influences that surround them. The issue of television advertising to children will also surely be raised at the International Advertising Association congress in June. Archbishop Foley, representing the Vatican, will give his views on the power of advertising and spell out why he thinks it should be limited. I'm looking forward to hearing what he says, and giving the counter argument. Advertising does not exist in a vacuum; it doesn't exist for its own sake, like art or religion. It's a commercial activity. If you don't like the ads, you don't have to buy the goods. Ultimate power rests with the consumer. Trying to ring-fence advertising in the way proposed is futile and would be counter-productive.",

      "body": "<p>Ten years ago, I travelled to Sudan to cover the food shortages. There in Khartoum were television crews from three British channels making very diverse programmes. Africa, it seemed, was on the map and this was reflected in documentaries, news reports and debates. </p> <p>Back in Britain, the nightly TV news was dominated by the seismic political changes taking place in eastern Europe and Russia. Channel 4's Dispatches programme was airing remarkable documentaries about Tibet and the Balkans, there were peak-time programmes on the BBC about life in China and Uganda, and it wasn't hard to find major TV expos\u00e9s of international factory farming and ecological injustices. In short, there was a real sense of a wider world. </p> <p>It was not to last. Even as TV foreign coverage was developing a loyal audience of millions, the great hype in London media circles was how the proposed new Broadcasting Act would provide viewers with more \"choice\". The politicians and heads of most TV channels were arguing strongly that freeing ITV from many of its public service commitments would usher in a new era of \"diversity\". Only a few Cassandras warned that the competitive rush for audiences would turn British TV inward, ignoring the rest of the world. </p> <p>The Cassandras have been proved correct. We almost certainly know less about what is happening in the world today than we did 10 years ago. TV hardly gives us a clue what is happening in most parts of the world, the social and economic forces shaping people's lives, how other cultures think, or are responding on political or personal levels to some of the greatest scientific, ecological, cultural and societal changes in world history. </p> <p>Even as business and politics has globalised, and as more people than ever are travelling abroad, so British TV - the prime source of information about the 5bn people living in the developing world - has become more insular, shallower, more opinionated, narrower, consumer-led, less intelligent and more self-obsessed. Our world map is massively diminishing even as our ignorance is increasing. </p> <p>The proof comes from a major study commissioned for Britain's leading international aid, development and environment charities. It shows how British terrestrial TV, despite having an extra channel, has wilfully abandoned coverage of the developing world in the past decade. The decline in the quantity and quality of coverage has been stark and dramatic: the total number of hours of factual programming on developing countries has declined by 50%; ITV has dropped its coverage by 74%; BBC2 by more than a third, Channel 4 by 56%. BBC 1 is increas ingly obsessed with soft wildlife and travel programmes and Channel 5, says the report, has commissioned almost nothing from non-western countries since it was set up. </p> <p>The quality of coverage has shifted considerably, too, says the report done by the Third World and Environment Broadcasting Project (3WE) which was set up in 1989 by groups including Oxfam, Action Aid, the WWF, Save the Children, Voluntary Service Overseas, Christian Aid and the RSPB. At the start of the decade, a large number of factual programmes about developing countries were about human rights, the environment and development subjects - they accounted for 30% of the output. These have almost entirely been replaced by travel and wildlife programmes which, argues the report \"do not offer complete portraits of the developing world\". </p> <p>Moreover, those few current affairs reports, international documentaries, and arts, culture and religious analysis programmes still being made are now mostly broadcast at the margins of the schedules - late night or very early in the morning. The vast majority of factual shows about poorer countries shown at peak times are now celebrity-led programmes about travel or wildlife. </p> <p>These two areas have, the report suggests, become the bastion of TV's coverage from developing countries. Are they supposed to be of use to people trying to understand what is happening in the lives of 80% of the world's population? Presumably yes, as together these two categories now make up almost 60% of all programming about poor countries. </p> <p>This dismal picture, says the report, acidly, begs an analysis of TV's public service value: \"A disproportionate number of these types of programmes consist of either footage of animals without a broader social context or celebrities visiting resorts. Holiday-type travel programmes figure more heavily than adventure travel programmes.\" BBC2 and C4 are both criticised here. The figures suggest a complete reversal of programming policies by channels once regarded as the flagships for minority interest and overseas coverage but which are now widely regarded as obsessed with sex and controversy. Channel 4, notes the report, broadcast more factual programmes on developing countries at the start of the decade than BBC1 and BBC2 combined. Today this trend is reversed and C4, despite having no higher overall share of the audience slice, is now showing 100 fewer hours a year while boasting of being more diverse than ever. </p> <p>The report also notes that ecological programming, a major theme of the channel's overseas factual programming in 1989, is now \"virtually extinct with little effort to innovate in this area\". When it did offer four hours of prime time TV to rubbish global environmentalism - in 1997's Against Nature - it was castigated by the ITC for misrepresentation. The programmes were widely attacked for being nonsensical and ignorant. </p> <p> It gets worse. News programmes rely to an increasing extent on reporting disaster and conflict. Overseas current affairs coverage has declined by 38% to just 12 hours a year across all five channels. But it is religious, cultural and arts programmes which have been the hardest hit. Where these categories made up 20% of all overseas factual programming 10 years ago, today they barely exist, with just 21 hours a year across all channels. \"This is a very significant reduction in an important area of programming which helps augment multicultural awareness within the UK,\" says the report. \"In the name of choice, it appears that the British viewer is now treated to a greater amount of travel and wildlife programming with a serious diminution in other categories. There is room for much greater production innovation.\" </p> <p>So what is happening? The report's author, Jennie Stone, says that there are many factors responsible for the dwindling level of international factual programming in the past decade. She cites diminishing budgets, the advent of new technology which allows images to be quickly and cheaply transmitted but which results in less in-depth analysis, and a changing production culture with staff more likely to move across programme genres, with less overall commitment. </p> <p>She also suggests that TV has moved rapidly to invest in online and internet services with international filming being one of the first areas to have its budgets cut. Her report attacks the oft-repeated excuse that the British public is just not interested in factual programming from poor countries. \"This is inadequate,\" she says, citing dozens of programmes over the years that have reached huge audiences. </p> <p>The report concludes by calling for a reversal of most of the trends: \"TV remains the primary medium through which the British public is informed about the developing world. Increasing global links are the fabric of our societies and Britain stands in a unique international position at the heart of the UN, the EU, Nato, the Group of 8, the Commonwealth and many other influential global bodies. We believe broadcasters have a key responsibility towards coverage of these links.\"</p>",

Her report attacks the oft-repeated excuse that the British public is just not interested in factual programming from poor countries. \"This is inadequate,\" she says, citing dozens of programmes over the years that have reached huge audiences. The report concludes by calling for a reversal of most of the trends: \"TV remains the primary medium through which the British public is informed about the developing world. Increasing global links are the fabric of our societies and Britain stands in a unique international position at the heart of the UN, the EU, Nato, the Group of 8, the Commonwealth and many other influential global bodies. We believe broadcasters have a key responsibility towards coverage of these links.\"",

The University of Verona faces possible criminal prosecution for financial irregularities after being ordered to pay up to \u00a3500,000 in salary arrears to Mr Parks and five other foreign lecturers. A Bologna court has ruled in favour of the lecturers after a 13-year legal odyssey in Italian and European courts, sparked by a cut in wages, employment rights and sackings. Europa was short-listed for the 1997 Booker prize for its account of the misadventures of a dysfunctional, sexually predatory group of foreign-trained university lecturers travelling in a bus from Italy to Strasbourg to petition the European parliament for the rights that their Italian colleagues enjoyed. Mr Parks, 45, hailed the ending of a \"senseless\" saga that pitted the former employees against the university in a venomous, draining test of will. However, more than 1,000 other foreign lecturers, known as lettori , remain embroiled in similar legal actions against Italian universities. The Bologna verdict upheld a decision by Italy's highest appeals court, which found that foreign lecturers were entitled to the same pay as colleagues with Italian degrees.

For the several thousand Chechen guerrillas involved, it's a fight for sheer winter survival against the firepower and manpower deployed by the Kremlin; for the Russians, it's a no-holds-barred chance to destroy the Chechen resistance; for the Georgian border guards, the frontline keeps the Chechen war from invading their country. A spillover into Georgia would threaten the young post-Soviet country's fragile independence and territorial integrity, worsen its tense relations with Moscow and trigger diplomatic and strategic dilemmas that could reach far beyond the Caucasus. The Russians are angry, the guerrillas are desperate, the Georgians are alarmed, and the US is frightened that Georgia will be dragged into the Chechen conflict, said a western diplomat in Tbilisi. \"You have all the ingredients for an explosive situation.\" \"The Russians\", a senior Georgian official said, \"want to move the conflict into Georgia\". Bowing to months of pressure from Moscow, the Georgian president, Eduard Shevardnadze, who was the Soviet Union's last foreign minister, ordered the 50-mile border with Chechnya and Russia sealed last week - an impossible task. It is extremely inhospitable territory, with only one road at the crossing point of Shatili, the route linking Tbilisi with the destroyed Chechen capital, Grozny.

Nine unarmed monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe have been warily watch ing the standoff at the Shatili crossing point since taking up their posts 10 days ago. \"The situation is tense but stable,\" said a source, adding that any unauthorised movement across the border was \"immediately destroyed\" by the Russians.

Georgia is also central to US plans to exploit the oil and gas riches of the Caspian basin, and Mr Shevardnadze talks optimistically of Georgia joining Nato. Officials from the region, Russia, the US and Turkey are expected in Tbilisi within weeks to discuss plans for a Caucasus \"stability pact\", modelled on western policy in the Balkans. The idea was mooted in Tbilisi two weeks ago by President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey, Georgia's southern neighbour, and Russia's traditional rival for influence in the Caucasus. Moscow is sceptical, seeing Turkey as a proxy for US scheming in the region. However, Mr Putin is sending an envoy to Ankara today with a message for President Demirel. \"The western countries now support Georgia actively,\" Mr Putin said. In Tbilisi last week, Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, stressed western support for Georgia's \"three Is: independence, integrity [territorial], and integration into euro-Atlantic structures\".

He is expected to get a pay off of \u00a3300,000.</p> <p>The chairman, Hugh Collom, appointed only last October had been given two months to reorganise the company by the government but the strength of the inspectorate's criticism took ministers by surprise.</p> <p>Laurence Williams, the NII chief inspector said \"Its no use sacking a few production workers. Responsibility must start at the top.\"</p> <p>He was referring to the fact that five workers at the plutonium and uranium mixed oxide fuel plant (mox) had been dismissed for falsifying documents on fuel destined for Japan. Since then it has emerged that more documents covering fuel sent to Germany was also falsified further damaging the company's reputation.</p> <p>Also expected to go is Chris Loughlin, in charge of both the giant \u00a31.8 billion Thorp reprocessing plant and the MOX plant. There will be a shake up of the whole management structure at Sellafield and it would be a surprise if more heads did not roll.</p> <p>Mr Taylor, who came from the oil giant Exxon, had a good reputation but the nuclear inspectors criticised the company for putting business considerations before safety. They said the standard of safety at the giant Sellafield works in Cumbria was \"only just tolerable.\"</p> <p>If widespread management changes were not implemented in two months the inspectorate said they would move to close the money making reprocessing works to force the company's hand.</p> <p>Mr Taylor had been expected to mastermind the government's plan to sell off 49 per cent of the state owned BNFL company which employs 20,000 people.</p> <p>It had already been postponed until after the election because of the adverse safety report. Now it may never happen since the company has lost so much business in last few weeks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Taylor, the chief executive of the troubled British Nuclear Fuels company is expected to resign on Tuesday, nine days after a devastating report from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate attacking management failures at every level in the company. Mr Taylor, was in Japan at the time the report was published, and appeared in no mood to resign but the pressure from ministers for changes appeared to have forced his hand. He is expected to get a pay off of \u00a3300,000. The chairman, Hugh Collom, appointed only last October had been given two months to reorganise the company by the government but the strength of the inspectorate's criticism took ministers by surprise. Laurence Williams, the NII chief inspector said \"Its no use sacking a few production workers. Responsibility must start at the top.\" He was referring to the fact that five workers at the plutonium and uranium mixed oxide fuel plant (mox) had been dismissed for falsifying documents on fuel destined for Japan. Since then it has emerged that more documents covering fuel sent to Germany was also falsified further damaging the company's reputation. Also expected to go is Chris Loughlin, in charge of both the giant \u00a31.8 billion Thorp reprocessing plant and the MOX plant. There will be a shake up of the whole management structure at Sellafield and it would be a surprise if more heads did not roll. Mr Taylor, who came from the oil giant Exxon, had a good reputation but the nuclear inspectors criticised the company for putting business considerations before safety. They said the standard of safety at the giant Sellafield works in Cumbria was \"only just tolerable.\" If widespread management changes were not implemented in two months the inspectorate said they would move to close the money making reprocessing works to force the company's hand. Mr Taylor had been expected to mastermind the government's plan to sell off 49 per cent of the state owned BNFL company which employs 20,000 people. It had already been postponed until after the election because of the adverse safety report. Now it may never happen since the company has lost so much business in last few weeks.",

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown's commitment to enterprise will be underscored by radical changes to the capital gains tax regime in next month's Budget, which could go beyond plans already floated. The chancellor believes the move could unleash a wave of venture capital to help small business, especially dot.com firms, realise their potential. In his pre-Budget report in November, Mr Brown said he was planning to increase the incentives for enterprise by cutting the qualifying period for reduced CGT on business assets from 10 years to five. But after lengthy consultations with the venture capital industry, he is now understood to be considering shortening the so-called business assets taper to four years. In an increasingly fast moving economy, Mr Brown believes a shorter qualifying period for the lower 10% CGT rate is more in tune with the time it takes to get a new business up and running. In a further development which will benefit the fast-growing hi-tech sector, the chancellor is also poised to announce a widening of the scope of CGT incentives by reducing the percentage thresholds for qualifying business asset shareholdings. Investors now have to own 25% of the equity of a new company to take advantage of the system, a high hurdle which many are reluctant to clear. Full-time employees must own 5% of the equity to qualify for reduced CGT. To make the system less restrictive, Mr Brown is thinking of cutting both limits to stim ulate investment in hi-tech firms and encourage quality staff to go and work for them. As part of the build-up to the Budget on March 22, Mr Brown will go on a national tour this week, taking in employment black spots in east London, Sunderland, Sandwell and Liverpool. Treasury sources said the emphasis of the tour would be on promoting enterprise in these areas to lower unemployment. The treasury is expected to publish research highlighting the fact that the level of vacancies are almost as high as the number of people claiming unemployment benefit.

Townshend now wishes his work to be measured by classical standards. </p> <p>Here, Who favourites were interposed between orchestral compositions. Behind Townshend wigging out on Who Are You?, the London Chamber Orchestra sat, tapping their feet. In the crowd goatee mixed with mullet as he struggled to define a mature context for an adolescent artform. </p> <p>Townshend has revived Lifehouse - positing a dystopian millennium whose fragmented society communicates by computer - to place The Who's finest songs \"in their original context\". But there's little, save Townshend's explanatory links, to generate a sense of \"concept\". A narrative arc is fleetingly perceptible in the interplay of ballad and rock, orchestra and psychedelia. Elsewhere, one waits for the hits - and it's a bonus to hear them sung by the man who wrote every word. </p> <p>Lifehouse's guiding ideal is the search for music's transcendence - \"the simple secret of the note in us all\", according to the deeply hippie Pure and Easy, its defining track. Townshend's enduring curiosity about what makes music tick is admirable - even if the frustrating truth may be that its transcendent moments are essentially arbitrary.

      "bodyText": "Pete Townshend at Sadler's Wells? The ex-Who star's venue for this performance of the 30-years-in-the-making rock opera Lifehouse was, like its recent broadcast on Radio 3, no accident. Townshend now wishes his work to be measured by classical standards. Here, Who favourites were interposed between orchestral compositions. Behind Townshend wigging out on Who Are You?, the London Chamber Orchestra sat, tapping their feet. In the crowd goatee mixed with mullet as he struggled to define a mature context for an adolescent artform. Townshend has revived Lifehouse - positing a dystopian millennium whose fragmented society communicates by computer - to place The Who's finest songs \"in their original context\". But there's little, save Townshend's explanatory links, to generate a sense of \"concept\". A narrative arc is fleetingly perceptible in the interplay of ballad and rock, orchestra and psychedelia. Elsewhere, one waits for the hits - and it's a bonus to hear them sung by the man who wrote every word. Lifehouse's guiding ideal is the search for music's transcendence - \"the simple secret of the note in us all\", according to the deeply hippie Pure and Easy, its defining track. Townshend's enduring curiosity about what makes music tick is admirable - even if the frustrating truth may be that its transcendent moments are essentially arbitrary. There were thrilling peaks but as the gig dragged on beyond three hours, nothing he conjured could rival what should have been its grand finale: in the keyboard refrain of Won't Get Fooled Again. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

Traditionally it has been the custom that when someone who has been working as a temp is taken on as a full-time employee, the hiring company pays a fee to the agency that originally supplied him or her. These fees are an important source of revenue for the agencies, which have recruited and placed the staff.

And indeed the industry's ruling body, the recruitment and employment confederation, has welcomed the decision. But behind the scenes one leading recruitment consultant, who was deeply involved with negotiations on behalf of her own and several other agencies, would only go as far as to say that she felt \"reasonably encouraged\" by the move. This is because, despite months of uncertainty over whether the legislation would be introduced in the first place, the issue has still not been fully resolved to everyone's satisfaction. </p> <p>The alternative proposed by the DTI is that if an agency wants to charge a fee, a \"waiting period\" can be agreed before a temp becomes permanent, during which time the agency receives its temp fee as normal. At the end of the period the temp will be able to transfer freely to the employer's full-time staff. But the department has yet to indicate how long a waiting period it will consider reasonable. </p> <p>The DTI has argued that insisting on a fee when a temp is taken on full-time deters employers from transferring temporary workers to permanent status, and that in some instances employers have dismissed temps rather than pay the fee. The employment agencies' were sceptical that this occurs on a large scale, and pointed to the example of Belgium, where similar legislation resulted in agencies folding and the survivors cutting back on temps' benefits, such as training. </p> <p>The managing director of one London secretarial consultancy claims that many of her clients have promised to continue to pay the fee regardless of how the law is finally resolved. Certainly the current system facilitates an efficient form of recruiting for both employer and employee. And, argues the industry, it is a more just one, too.

      "body": "<p>Unless you happen to work for a pharmacist, it's a safe bet that your boss will be delighted to see the end of the flu epidemic. After fielding countless sniffling phonecalls from staff croaking that they really, honestly, can't make it in to the office, employers are looking forward to having a full complement of staff once again. </p> <p>They shouldn't get excited too soon, however. Latest reports reveal that absenteeism is now one of the biggest problems facing the British workplace - whether or not we're at the height of the flu season. In a study by Gee Publishing, 40% of the 311 companies polled said that absence levels had risen during the previous three years, and one in five said absence was a major problem. In response, many companies are putting in place new and often controversial measures to persuade their employees to come to work. </p> <p>It's not difficult to see why employers are concerned about staff taking sickies. The financial consequences are severe - absenteeism can cost a company 3% of its payroll, a national total of more than \u00a310bn a year, according to the CBI. To persuade staff to make that little bit more effort to get into work, the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD) has found that many employers are making sweeping changes in their procedure for employees calling in sick, as well as in the content of their return-to-work interviews. Some organisations are even providing a figure for the number of \"acceptable\" days' absence, which raises the rather alarming prospect of workers having to drag themselves out of their wheelchairs once they have exceeded their monthly backache quota. </p> <p>Richard Stafford, a business psychologist specialising in human resources policies, insists that quotas don't work like that. \"It's simply a case of monitoring patterns of absence so that it is brought to employers' attention if, say, an employee is off sick for eight occasional Mondays in four months. In turn, they can take this up with the member of staff. It is a very successful method of preventing unnecessary absence.\" Such surveys have turned up the entirely unsurprising evidence that most \"sickies\" are taken on a Monday after a long weekend overindulging, or to cover a pre-planned long weekend break. </p> <p>\"We decided to be proactive about absence because we only have 200 staff and so it has a major impact on day-to-day business,\" says Deirdre Devereux, administrator services manager at Marsden Building Society. This involved the company taking the radical step of paying staff not to be ill. Workers with a full attendance during the year now receive a \u00a3100 bonus. </p> <p>This form of inducement is catching on. Absence levels at some Tesco stores had reached 11% when the company started dangling the promise of bonuses before staff tempted to take time off. But more important, according to Keith Luxton, group human resources manager, was understanding why people were taking time off in the first place, and developing better ways to deal with absenteeism as it happens. </p> <p>\"When someone phones in sick, do they speak to someone trained in managing absence? When they return to work, are they interviewed about what was wrong with them, whether they are well enough to be back at work and if there is anything the company can do to prevent it happening again?\" he asks. \"In an attempt to address these issues, we organised workshops on absence and how to manage it. The result is that absence has halved in some stores.\" </p> <p>Companies that have been most successful in tackling these questions are the ones that have considered the role of support staff and not just managers, according to Angela Baron, employee resourcing adviser at the IPD. \"It's very often the PA or secretary who takes the calls from staff who aren't coming in, who fills out the relevant forms on their return, and who monitors the total number of days they take off,\" she explains. </p> <p>When it comes to taking a sneaky day off, Baron has found that support staff are often seen as a \"soft touch\". Sheepish hungover workers hoping not to have to explain themselves to their boss ask to speak to the secretary instead. \"If the secretary is clued up on managing sickness, the member of staff might think twice about making the call,\" says Baron. </p> <p>These techniques, however, are not without their sceptics. Dr Martyn Dyer-Smith, principal psychologist at the university of Northumbria at Carlisle and specialist in absence, is one of them. He believes the fact that about 38% of companies now have absence monitoring systems in place may be counter-productive. \"The point should not be getting staff to take as few days off as possible. The point should be getting them to be as productive as possible. Monitoring dehumanises the workforce, and the systems that companies are putting in place as a result of the monitoring seem to be based on fear and bribery, whereas any attempt to make staff want to be at work should first and foremost find out why they are not.\" </p> <p>Tesco, of course, would claim that's exactly what its back-to-work interviews strive to achieve. But Dyer-Smith claims a deeper exploration is required into the very culture of the organisation. Certain sectors and companies, for example, are more prone to absence than others. Larger companies of more than 1,000 employees average 10 days absence per employee a year, a level almost twice that of smaller companies, while the public sector reports 10.4 days of absence compared with 6.2 days in the businesses services sector. Dyer-Smith believes the reasons are down to company culture. </p> <p>\"The larger the company, the more likely it is that its employees feel anonymous - a very common reason for absence. As for the differences between public and private sector, these are closely associated with national attitudes. People are happy to cheat the taxman but not their neighbour, and will steal public property but not their neighbour's property. It's as if they believe 'public' means 'not belonging to anyone'. No wonder, then, that they feel less guilty about taking sick days.\" </p> <p>Introducing flexible working is, according to Dr Joan Harvey, the best way of decreasing absenteeism. Harvey is a chartered psychologist at the university of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne and research specialist in absenteeism. \"If you have a hangover, you don't feel as if you need to take the whole day off,\" she explains. \"You can simply come in a couple of hours late and it's acceptable. Everybody feels respected and everybody wins.\" </p> <p>In fact, Marsden Building Society now allows hungover staff to call up and be honest about why they won't be in. The catch is that the time off comes out of their annual leave. \"But it works in cutting down absenteeism because we respect the fact that staff might want unplanned time off,\" explains Devereux. </p> <p>In the meantime, employers brace themselves for the next season of sickness in the absentee calendar. Spring and blooming rape fields will see an epidemic of hay fever, allergies and asthma. Summer will produce cases of sunstroke. Then we will be back into the season for coughs and colds and, of course, the next outbreak of flu.</p>",

The picture is even worse for female part-time workers, who bring home 60% of men's full-time hourly rate. This will be one of the key issues on the agenda at the TUC women's conference in March, where a new report \"Fair Pay for Women Now!\" will be launched. See www.tuc.org.uk for more information. \u0095 ONLINE NANNIES Having trouble organising your childcare? A new website from Top Notch Nannies has information about nannies, maternity nurses, babysitters and other childcare professionals. The site offers an interactive section where parents can get advice on childcare provision, and you can even apply for a nanny online. See www.topnotchnannies.com \u0095 DOCUMENT DISPOSAL A rap on the knuckles from manufacturer Rexel, which says that we are too careless with sensitive documents, putting them in the bin rather than disposing of them safely. Only a quarter of firms with a turnover of more than \u00a31m are satisfied that their business disposes of confidential material safely, says the company. To help firms, Rexel has produced a free booklet, Secrets and Shredders. For a copy, email your details, quoting the reference \"shredder booklet\", to businessmachines@acco-uk.co.uk \u0095 PEN PINCHING How many times a day do you make a trip to the stationery cupboard having discovered that all the pens have vanished from your desk?

One contestant chose Shakespeare as his special subject, but flunked the final question on Measure for Measure that would have netted him \u00a364,000. </p> <p>The 14-year-old Pennington, having got all the previous questions right, was on the edge of his sofa yelling the answer at the screen. \"What a misspent youth,\" he now says, \"having an encyclopedic knowledge of Shakespeare!\" As my eyes shoot up, he admits, \"No, I'm not being quite sincere, am I?\" </p> <p>He sure isn't. Shakespeare, for much of Pennington's working life, has been his mission and his meal-ticket. He has played Hamlet - one of the best I've seen - for the RSC, along with Berowne, Hector and both Angelo and the Duke in Measure for Measure. With Michael Bogdanov, he founded and ran the piratical English Shakespeare Company in the 80s. </p> <p>Currently he's polishing up his Stratford Timon of Athens for a Barbican opening on Wednesday, while correcting the proofs for his wise, witty book Twelfth Night: A User's Guide, to be published in April. He's the nearest equivalent to Granville-Barker in our own day: an actor-scholar who brings to Shakespeare a wealth of practical experience. </p> <p>For Pennington, playing Timon is the accidental fulfilment of a dream: he took over after Alan Bates pulled out with a chest illness. \"One night last summer,\" he says, \"I was going to see a friend in Phantom of the Opera. Just before going in, I checked my phone for messages and found one from Greg Doran, the Stratford director, who was remarkably cool, asking if I was in the country. I found he was offering me Timon, with three weeks to go before the first preview! Within 36 hours I was in rehearsal. </p> <p>\"To me it's incredibly sentimental because I was in the 1965 Stratford production with Scofield. I had a line and a half, watched Scofield from the wings every night and thought, 'I'd love to do this one day when I'm grown up'. Little did I know that the next Timon on the main Stratford stage, 34 years later, would be me.\" </p> <p>Timon is one of Shakespeare's oddest heroes: a spendthrift who, when times turn hard and his chums desert him, transforms into a railing misanthrope. Watching Timon of Athens, said theatre critic Tynan of Mayfair, is \"like going to some scandalously sophisticated party at which, halfway through, the host falls down drunk and begins to rave from under the piano\". But Pennington, with his excavating intelligence, thinks there's infinitely more to the play than that. </p> <p>\"On first sight,\" he says, \"it's the story of a man who goes on an extraordinary journey from Camelot to Cardboard City. But I think there is a positive idealism in him that makes him a major Shakespearean figure. He's a champagne socialist who believes that if you're lucky enough to be born rich you must share it. There's a genuine public spiritedness about him which is slightly absurd. What's interesting is the way that turns into its opposite. </p> <p>\"We're playing it Jacobean but, in a curious way, it reminds me of the 60s. One of the most potent images of that period is the face of the mass-killer, Charles Manson, coming out at you like Jim Morrison, who was a cultural hero. I see the play as an extension of that idea: a study of what happens when idealism goes sour. Except that in the end Timon achieves a provisional salvation. He faces down his demons and there's a sort of exhilarating peace about the conclusion that seems to me completely Shakespearean. Like Richard II, Timon reconstructs his personality to become a human being.\" </p> <p>Pennington's love-affair with Shakespeare - he compares it to a marriage, in that you have periods of acrimony and fatigue but you keep coming back - dates from childhood. He was taken by his parents - his father was a Chancery lawyer - to see an Old Vic Macbeth and, on coming home, instantly started to act out the play. By 15 he had seen virtually the entire canon. But Pennington's missionary Bardic zeal is combined with an awareness that Shakespeare, like Homer, occasionally nodded. </p> <p>Both qualities come out in his book on Twelfth Night, which is studded with self-critical accounts of the productions he has directed for the ESC and for companies in Tokyo and Chicago. Pennington writes movingly of Shakespeare's \"transforming power\": he cites the example of a high-security prisoner playing Caliban in an ESC workshop, \"his poetry a tangible defiance of the fact that he couldn't see over a wall a few feet away\". He also writes, with crucifying accuracy, about Shakespeare's tendency to hammer home a gag and about the plot-delaying procrastination of the sadistic scene in Twelfth Night where Feste taunts the imprisoned Malvolio. Only a true lover, you feel, could write so unsparingly about his mistress's faults. </p> <p>Oddly, for a man so variously talented, Pennington has no further plans to direct or write. He loves acting, has Antony, Lear and Prospero in his sights and wouldn't mind a crack at Ibsen, Strindberg and more Eduardo de Filippo: he did Filumena for the Peter Hall Company and was mortified when it closed. He gets a bit pissed off at being told he should direct: it is, he says, \"rather like an electrician being proposed a carpentry course\". And, having written four books, including a practical guide to Hamlet, he feels that's it. \"All I do in these books,\" he says, \"is tap into the energy of the play. The Hamlet book was relatively easy to write because the play has such narrative pulse. Twelfth Night was more difficult because it's elusive, impressionistic, and it's hard to find the play's moral register. At one point I was in despair but I hope I've now cracked it.\" </p> <p>My own hope is that he can be forced back to his word-processor: he's too good a writer to waste. As an actor, he's also a rare example of a vanishing breed: the predominantly classical performer who can make old texts live in the present. He's done his share of telly and the odd movie but his natural stamping-ground is the classical stage where lung capacity has to be matched to psychological penetration. In Timon, if Stratford is anything to go by, he not only restores a neglected play but seems to be gearing himself up to play a most uncivil Lear. Just as well he wasn't a schoolboy millionaire quiz-kid after all.</p>",

I had a line and a half, watched Scofield from the wings every night and thought, 'I'd love to do this one day when I'm grown up'. Little did I know that the next Timon on the main Stratford stage, 34 years later, would be me.\" Timon is one of Shakespeare's oddest heroes: a spendthrift who, when times turn hard and his chums desert him, transforms into a railing misanthrope. Watching Timon of Athens, said theatre critic Tynan of Mayfair, is \"like going to some scandalously sophisticated party at which, halfway through, the host falls down drunk and begins to rave from under the piano\". But Pennington, with his excavating intelligence, thinks there's infinitely more to the play than that. \"On first sight,\" he says, \"it's the story of a man who goes on an extraordinary journey from Camelot to Cardboard City. But I think there is a positive idealism in him that makes him a major Shakespearean figure. He's a champagne socialist who believes that if you're lucky enough to be born rich you must share it. There's a genuine public spiritedness about him which is slightly absurd. What's interesting is the way that turns into its opposite. \"We're playing it Jacobean but, in a curious way, it reminds me of the 60s. One of the most potent images of that period is the face of the mass-killer, Charles Manson, coming out at you like Jim Morrison, who was a cultural hero. I see the play as an extension of that idea: a study of what happens when idealism goes sour. Except that in the end Timon achieves a provisional salvation. He faces down his demons and there's a sort of exhilarating peace about the conclusion that seems to me completely Shakespearean. Like Richard II, Timon reconstructs his personality to become a human being.\" Pennington's love-affair with Shakespeare - he compares it to a marriage, in that you have periods of acrimony and fatigue but you keep coming back - dates from childhood. He was taken by his parents - his father was a Chancery lawyer - to see an Old Vic Macbeth and, on coming home, instantly started to act out the play. By 15 he had seen virtually the entire canon. But Pennington's missionary Bardic zeal is combined with an awareness that Shakespeare, like Homer, occasionally nodded. Both qualities come out in his book on Twelfth Night, which is studded with self-critical accounts of the productions he has directed for the ESC and for companies in Tokyo and Chicago. Pennington writes movingly of Shakespeare's \"transforming power\": he cites the example of a high-security prisoner playing Caliban in an ESC workshop, \"his poetry a tangible defiance of the fact that he couldn't see over a wall a few feet away\". He also writes, with crucifying accuracy, about Shakespeare's tendency to hammer home a gag and about the plot-delaying procrastination of the sadistic scene in Twelfth Night where Feste taunts the imprisoned Malvolio. Only a true lover, you feel, could write so unsparingly about his mistress's faults. Oddly, for a man so variously talented, Pennington has no further plans to direct or write. He loves acting, has Antony, Lear and Prospero in his sights and wouldn't mind a crack at Ibsen, Strindberg and more Eduardo de Filippo: he did Filumena for the Peter Hall Company and was mortified when it closed. He gets a bit pissed off at being told he should direct: it is, he says, \"rather like an electrician being proposed a carpentry course\". And, having written four books, including a practical guide to Hamlet, he feels that's it. \"All I do in these books,\" he says, \"is tap into the energy of the play. The Hamlet book was relatively easy to write because the play has such narrative pulse. Twelfth Night was more difficult because it's elusive, impressionistic, and it's hard to find the play's moral register. At one point I was in despair but I hope I've now cracked it.\" My own hope is that he can be forced back to his word-processor: he's too good a writer to waste. As an actor, he's also a rare example of a vanishing breed: the predominantly classical performer who can make old texts live in the present. He's done his share of telly and the odd movie but his natural stamping-ground is the classical stage where lung capacity has to be matched to psychological penetration. In Timon, if Stratford is anything to go by, he not only restores a neglected play but seems to be gearing himself up to play a most uncivil Lear. Just as well he wasn't a schoolboy millionaire quiz-kid after all.",
