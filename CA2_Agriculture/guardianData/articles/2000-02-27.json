One exception was the period under Margaret Thatcher when it was asserted that the market knew best. But when, in January 1985, the market was driving the pound down to one dollar, even Thatcher decided the market was getting above itself. She telephoned her friend Ronald Reagan, who was then US President, and a highly successful operation to prop up sterling took place. </p> <p>But after Black Wednesday the British establishment went into 'denial' over the possibility of intervening to steady the pound. It was a classic lurch: from one extreme to another. It was an absurd and futile effort to save the pound followed by acceptance of the latest 'dogma' - that it is impossible to intervene successfully to steady a currency. </p> <p>But apart from anything else, it is much easier to prevent a currency from rising - the central bank has plenty of its own currency to offer - than to stop it falling, because when portfolio managers and speculators have lost confidence in a currency, reserves soon disappear. </p> <p>So where do we go from here?

      "body": "<p>Microsoft was back in court last week, trying to persuade Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that the company hadn't really broken any anti-trust laws. Its lawyers produced a new rabbit out of their copious hat, namely an argument that Microsoft's legal copyright over the Windows operating system could not be infringed by a court's anti-trust ruling.</p> <p>Which, being translated, seems to imply a view that even if Gates &amp; Co have violated anti-trust law then it doesn't matter because their copyright allows them to do so. The judge, I am delighted to say, would have none of it. This line of argument, he observed icily, would have allowed John D. Rockefeller to escape from the anti-trust laws which finally broke up Standard Oil in 1911.</p> <p>Ironically though, by dragging copyright into it, the Microsoft lawyers have put their fingers on the nub of the problem. Copyright is going to be the bane of our lives for the next decade. Because software can be copyrighted, it enjoys legal protection for much longer than patented inventions.</p> <p>In one of the most original contributions to the 'what to do about Microsoft' debate, Jonathan Zittrain of the Berkman Centre at Harvard has proposed a fiendishly ingenious remedy for the kind of market dominance currently enjoyed by the company: limit the copyright protection of software to five years.</p> <p>This is far too good an idea to be adopted by the US Congress (which is entirely in hock to the publishing lobby). But perhaps the EU Commission might be more receptive? After all, they have taken on the US over the thorny issue of data privacy.</p> <p>The launch of Windows 2000 gave Microsoft a rare spate of good publicity. After all, some people had begun to doubt whether the company would ever get the monster out the door. And yet there it was, all four flavours of it, ready to go.</p> <p>Bill Gates described it as the most reliable product his company had ever shipped. Why, he crowed, independent tests had shown that a Windows 2000 server could run for 90 whole days without falling over (as compared to the 2.1 days it takes a Windows 95 machine to crash).</p> <p>Non-technical readers may be puzzled by this. They will translate the above into everyday terms and think of, say, the chief executive of Ford proudly announcing that the new Fiesta would break down only once every three months rather than every second day, as at present.</p> <p>If that were to happen, the CEO in question would be hauled off to jail and Ford's share price would go through the floor. And quite right too. Such are the boring realities of the 'old' economy. The 'new' economy, however, is an entirely different place.</p> <p>In an interesting internal Microsoft memo leaked last week, one of the chaps who led the Windows 2000 development team revealed that the product was riddled with bugs.</p> <p>'Our customers do not want us to sell them products with over 63,000 potential known defects,' he wrote to his colleagues. 'They want these defects corrected. How many of you would spend $500 on a piece of software with over 63,000 potential known defects?'</p> <p>As it happens, for a program as big as the new version of Windows, 63,000 bugs is probably quite reasonable.

      "bodyText": "Microsoft was back in court last week, trying to persuade Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that the company hadn't really broken any anti-trust laws. Its lawyers produced a new rabbit out of their copious hat, namely an argument that Microsoft's legal copyright over the Windows operating system could not be infringed by a court's anti-trust ruling. Which, being translated, seems to imply a view that even if Gates &amp; Co have violated anti-trust law then it doesn't matter because their copyright allows them to do so. The judge, I am delighted to say, would have none of it. This line of argument, he observed icily, would have allowed John D. Rockefeller to escape from the anti-trust laws which finally broke up Standard Oil in 1911. Ironically though, by dragging copyright into it, the Microsoft lawyers have put their fingers on the nub of the problem. Copyright is going to be the bane of our lives for the next decade. Because software can be copyrighted, it enjoys legal protection for much longer than patented inventions. In one of the most original contributions to the 'what to do about Microsoft' debate, Jonathan Zittrain of the Berkman Centre at Harvard has proposed a fiendishly ingenious remedy for the kind of market dominance currently enjoyed by the company: limit the copyright protection of software to five years. This is far too good an idea to be adopted by the US Congress (which is entirely in hock to the publishing lobby). But perhaps the EU Commission might be more receptive? After all, they have taken on the US over the thorny issue of data privacy. The launch of Windows 2000 gave Microsoft a rare spate of good publicity. After all, some people had begun to doubt whether the company would ever get the monster out the door. And yet there it was, all four flavours of it, ready to go. Bill Gates described it as the most reliable product his company had ever shipped. Why, he crowed, independent tests had shown that a Windows 2000 server could run for 90 whole days without falling over (as compared to the 2.1 days it takes a Windows 95 machine to crash). Non-technical readers may be puzzled by this. They will translate the above into everyday terms and think of, say, the chief executive of Ford proudly announcing that the new Fiesta would break down only once every three months rather than every second day, as at present. If that were to happen, the CEO in question would be hauled off to jail and Ford's share price would go through the floor. And quite right too. Such are the boring realities of the 'old' economy. The 'new' economy, however, is an entirely different place. In an interesting internal Microsoft memo leaked last week, one of the chaps who led the Windows 2000 development team revealed that the product was riddled with bugs. 'Our customers do not want us to sell them products with over 63,000 potential known defects,' he wrote to his colleagues. 'They want these defects corrected. How many of you would spend $500 on a piece of software with over 63,000 potential known defects?' As it happens, for a program as big as the new version of Windows, 63,000 bugs is probably quite reasonable. But it does explain why most businesses will be slow to adopt the first release. Combine that with Judge Jackson's verdict (expected in April) and ponder whether you really do want to hold on to that Microsoft stock. \u0095 Idiocies of filtering software #23,452.

      "body": "<b>Lockerbie, Wednesday, 21 December 1988, 7.03pm </b> Bunty Galloway had just sat down in front of the television to watch This is Your Life. Outside it was windy and cold. No one was out on the narrow street in front of her house. Many of Bunty's neighbours were also watching TV and others were wrapping gifts. It was four days before Christmas. <p>Suddenly, Bunty noticed a strange noise. She had never heard anything like it in her life. It was coming rapidly closer with a rising groan and howl as if at any moment the noise would make the house explode like a kettle under pressure. When she got to the door to look out, the roar had abruptly stopped. Now it was dark and quiet. The electricity had gone out.</p> <p>When she looked outside, the scene was as awful and bizarre as a Hieronymus Bosch version of hell: a wall of flames, down a hill and only about 600 metres away, was bathing the town in orange light. It smelled of kerosene.</p> <p>A terrace house was crushed from above, as if an enormous hammer had pounded through the roof. Two young women fell directly on to the street in front of her house. </p> <p>One lay on the asphalt and another was thrown over a low garden wall. The body of a child lay at the foot of the stairs that lead to Bunty Galloway's home. She would later remember that the child wore brown socks and blue pants.</p> <p>In all, 259 bodies fell within seconds on Lockerbie and on the area that surrounds the small town of 3,000 people. They lay alone or in groups of five or 10 or 20 in fields and parking lots, in gardens and on pavements, next to telephone booths and on top of roofs. Many seemed to be sleeping. Others were hardly recognisable as the remains of humans. Along with the bodies, about 290 tons of wreckage fell from the sky, including four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7A motors that were still functioning at full speed when they hit the ground. Eleven residents of Lockerbie had been killed instantly.</p> <p>Afterwards, for several terrible moments, there had been a long and unnatural silence. Almost all the electricity, gas, water and telephone lines had been cut. For a while, there was only sound and light where houses were burning.</p> <p>Hours would pass before Bunty Galloway and her neighbours would learn that a passenger jet had crashed into their town. Days would go by before specialists were certain that a bomb had caused the catastrophe. Months would pass before they could reconstruct the course of events. And it would take more than 11 years before two suspects would stand trial. And when this trial, which is scheduled to begin on 3 May near the Dutch city of Utrecht, ends after many months, it is likely that it will be decided that the real culprits still haven't been found.</p> <p><b>Moscow, US Embassy, 13 December 1988</b> On this Tuesday, a week before the accident, a diplomat signed an 'administrative notice' for the benefit of all embassy personnel: 'The embassy has been notified by the national flight authorities that an unidentified individual called a US diplomatic service in Europe on 5 December 1988 and claimed that a bomb would be planted on a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the US sometime in the next two weeks... Since this information could not be confirmed, the embassy leaves it up to all travellers to decide if they should change their travel plans or switch to another US airline.'</p> <p>The anonymous caller had placed the call in Helsinki. The Federal Aviation Administration had then informed the US Department of State as well as the affected airline and airports. But no one else was warned.</p> <p><b>London, Heathrow Airport, Terminal 3, 21 December 1988, 5pm </b>On this afternoon, 243 people gathered in the lounges at the south end of the terminal. They were booked to go on a Pan American Airways Boeing 747 to John F Kennedy Airport in New York. Many had checked in in London, while others had come on 10 feeder flights to Heathrow; 49 passengers had arrived on a Boeing 727 from Frankfurt.</p> <p>It was a feature of Pan Am that various flights could carry the same flight number: Pan Am Flight 103 could be booked from Frankfurt to New York, even though there was a change of airplanes in London. </p> <p>Among those waiting to board the flight were 35 US students who had spent six to 12 months in Europe on an exchange programme from Syracuse University. There were also 12 children under the age of 10. The youngest was nine weeks old and the oldest was a 79-year-old woman from Budapest. The passengers came from 21 countries. At this point they all had 122 minutes to live. </p> <p><b>The cockpit of the Maid of the Seas, 5.30pm</b> Captain James Bruce MacQuarrie was sitting on the left side of the cockpit of the Boeing 747. The Maid of the Seas had been put into service on 12 February 1970 and had since made 16,497 flights and logged in 72,646 flight hours. But, in spite of the age of the machine, the pilots had no reason to worry as they made their final checks.</p> <p>The Maid of the Seas had arrived in Heathrow at 12.10pm from San Francisco and had parked by Terminal 3. It was here that Jim MacQuarrie would take over from another pilot. The 55-year-old captain was an experienced pilot and a veteran of 10,910 flight hours, including 4,107 on a B-747.</p> <p>While the security forces of an airport are responsible for checking passengers and their hand luggage for dangerous objects, it is the duty of each airline to examine luggage that is stored in the freight section. At Heathrow, suitcases are examined with X-rays - but only those that are checked in at the airport.</p> <p>Since Flight 103 had officially begun its journey in Frankfurt, luggage originating from there was not checked again. The Boeing 727 that came from Frankfurt was parked at Position 16, directly next to the jumbo bound for New York. Workers unloaded the luggage container from the smaller jet and stored it in the belly of the Maid of the Seas.</p> <p>About 30 tons of freight was placed in the fuselage of the jumbo and over 108 tons of highly flammable kerosene lapped around in its tanks. The flight now weighed 323 tons and there were 259 people on board.</p> <p><b>6.25pm</b> Pan Am Flight 103 got permission from the control tower to take off. Captain MacQuarrie pushed the start lever forward. The jumbo moved down the runway and finally took off. </p> <p><b>6.58pm</b> The copilot made contact with Shanwick Oceanic Area Control in Ireland, the station that assigns flight corridors to planes flying across the North Atlantic to America in order to minimise the chances of a collision. The copilot gave the flight number, flying altitude and the destination.</p> <p><b>7.02pm</b> The air-traffic controller in Shanwick received the data and checked it. He answered: 'Clipper 103 should take 59 north 10 west to Kennedy.' The controller received no answer.</p> <p><b>7.02pm and 50 seconds</b> While the air-traffic controller was giving his instructions by radio, the image of the transponder suddenly disappeared from his screen. When radar caught up with the position of the plane a few seconds later - at 55 degrees and seven minutes north, 3 degrees and 21 minutes west - the surprised, and then dumbfounded, controller in Shanwick saw many images on his screen: a Boeing jet that was breaking apart.</p> <p><b>7.02pm and 50 seconds</b> On board the Maid of the Seas. There are no witnesses nor direct proof of what happened at this point, but there are many clues which allowed events to be reconstructed later. First, an explosion shook the aircraft. Before anyone realised what was happening, the electricity went out and it became completely dark. Several fractions of a second later, large sections of the forward fuselage were ripped away. The nose of the plane then broke off and fell towards the right into the depths.</p> <p>The people on board the beheaded 747 were hit with a shock wave of cold, noise and dark. Air escaped from the vessel and ice crystallised on the windows. From one second to the next, conditions had suddenly become similar to those on the peak of Mount Everest. The air was extremely thin and cold. The passengers immediately lost consciousness while the main body of the Maid of the Seas tipped forward, broke into several pieces and began to plummet. </p> <p>Passengers in the first few rows of seats were catapulted out of the disintegrating plane into the blackness of the night, while several were sucked into the engines that were still operating at full throttle. Most of the passengers, however, remained in two large sections of the plane that in a few seconds fell far enough to reach warmer levels of air that were richer in oxygen. At this point, perhaps as many as 60 per cent of the people on board were still alive, but no one knows if anyone ever regained consciousness. The drop continued.</p> <p><b>Lockerbie, 7.03pm and 26 seconds</b> With the motors still going at full speed, the Boeing crashed on to the ground at half the speed of sound: the drop had taken 36 seconds. Even though the wreckage weighed many tons, it still did not fall straight down because there was a strong wind from the west. It drifted eastwards to fall directly on to the small town of Lockerbie in Scotland's most southwestern county. The wings and the middle part of the fuselage, which still held about 90 tons of kerosene in the main tank, struck Sherwood Crescent, a street of tidy, single-family homes.</p> <p>The earthquake monitoring centre in Eskdalemuir, 14km away, registered a tremor of 1.6 on the Richter scale. The middle part of the plane, complete with the wings, tore a gash into the earth that was 47 metres long and a metre deep; 1,500 tons of earth was lifted into the air and eventually blocked traffic on the A74. A policeman who lived in the neighbourhood said that it seemed as if a 'small atom bomb' had hit.</p> <p>The houses between numbers 13 and 16 on Sherwood Crescent were completely obliterated, while most of the others were irreparably damaged. (Eventually, a total of 21 buildings had to be torn down.) Eleven people were decimated; nothing remained later to identify them aside from the artificial knee of 81-year-old Mary Lancaster, the oldest of the victims.</p> <p>The ball of fire reached a local gas station. Soon its diesel tanks exploded and its supply of tyres started to burn. The four engines of the aircraft struck on both sides of the railway track that divides the town. A 20-metre-long piece of the rear fuselage struck Rosebank Crescent, the street where Bunty Galloway was sitting in front of her television. The cockpit, along with the front end of the fuselage, crashed about 4km east of Lockerbie in a sheep pasture directly by Tundergarth church. This part of the nose was so intact that it could still be identified as part of a plane and reminded many who saw it of the severed head of a huge fish.</p> <p>Smaller parts - strangely bent pieces of metal, crushed suitcases, whisky bottles, coins, seats - covered practically every street of the town and also struck roofs, crashed through windows and were found buried inches deep in the moist earth of the surrounding fields and the golf course. Light material, such as insulation from the interior of the fuselage and torn pages of books, was found as far away as 130km.</p> <p>Invisible, but not without danger, were the 400kg of enriched uranium that made up part of the plane's stabilisation mechanisms which had been spread along the trail of the wreckage.</p> <p>And yet the people of southern Scotland were lucky. Only 16km from Lockerbie stands the Chapelcross atomic power plant, one of the oldest in Britain. It is also the site where the country produces plutonium for atomic weapons. </p> <p><b>Lockerbie, Sherwood Crescent, about 7.10pm </b>Donald Bogie lives in Ashgrove Terrace, a northern extension of Sherwood Crescent, and his experience was like that of most people in the town. He heard a sound that became so loud that it was almost unbearable. Then it suddenly became dark and eerily quiet.</p> <p>He ran out of his house and saw flames over the city. Perhaps it was because the catastrophe seemed so unreal that the people of Lockerbie did not become hysterical or apathetic, as so often happens in such situations. Over there in a field lay the body of a young man who was only wearing his underpants because the rest of his clothes had been torn off during the fall. Beside him was an undamaged bottle of Chivas Regal. The bodies of Captain MacQuarrie, his copilot and the flight engineer were found still strapped into their seats.</p> <p>The people of Lockerbie managed the catastrophe with laudable skill. Although the most important water line was broken, the fire department was able to put out all the fires within seven and a half hours. It is a region where milk production is the primary industry and milk wagons were quickly filled with water and driven to the many burning pieces of wreckage.</p> <p>The first corpses were brought to the town hall, but people then started bringing them to the hockey stadium because it was the only place large and cool enough to store so many bodies.</p> <p>The county's police force, the smallest in Scotland, was quickly reinforced. Normally only four policemen worked in the Lockerbie region, but by Thursday morning there were 1,100 working alongside 1,000 other soldiers, firemen and volunteers. But even a force of this size could not prevent the first ghoulish sightseers from blocking the narrow country roads the next day.</p> <p>At about 10am on the Thursday, two boys who were driving a tractor across a field on their father's farm near Tundergarth found both of the orange metal boxes containing the flight data.</p> <p>Search teams would comb through much of the 2,190 square kilometres of the county with the help of helicopters, airplanes and even spy satellites. But they would be unable to locate the bodies of seven of the passengers, as well as about 10 per cent of the plane. And in some cases they may have arrived too late: 10 years after the catastrophe, the chief pathologist reported that two of the passengers had suffered serious but not fatal wounds. Possibly they froze to death on the ground before the search teams found them in a forest four days later. </p> <p><b>Central Munitions Depot of the British Armed Forces, Longtown, January 1989 </b>Whenever there is an airplane accident in Britain, specialists from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) try to establish the cause. They learned of the crash 37 minutes after it happened. It was the worst in British history, and they were on the site that night. Towards midnight, the Scottish police said that they were conducting a 'criminal investigation', although it was still far from clear if a crime had been committed. From that time on, all of the wreckage was considered evidence and could only be touched by authorised people. Every corpse was photographed.</p> <p>In the first days after the crash, the work of the AAIB was similar to a giant puzzle. The investigators took over a hall in the munitions depot, which was located 32km from Lockerbie. Everything that was found was gathered at Longtown - in all about four million pieces of wreckage. Each was registered on a computer and, if it could be identified, was placed carefully so that gradually a two-dimensional version of the airplane and its contents took form.</p> <p>The examination of the two data boxes showed that 50 seconds after 7.02pm no new data was registered and the machine presumably began to fall apart. The cockpit that was found near Tundergarth was so undamaged that the instrument panel could be examined. All the gears were in their normal positions. Nothing indicated that the pilots had had time to initiate a last-ditch manoeuvre or even send a call for help.</p> <p>The investigators then made an important discovery: pieces of wreckage from the left side of the front fuselage and two luggage containers showed signs of an explosion. One of them had been loaded in Frankfurt.</p> <p>After weeks of testing, it was discovered that scraps of cloth and splinters from one suitcase showed traces of the chemicals RDX and PETN. Both are normally left in the wake of explosions triggered by the plastic explosive Semtex, which was produced in Czechoslovakia at the time.</p> <p>The searchers also found a splinter the size of a fingernail of a brown electrical circuit that was identified as part of a Toshiba radio recorder. They came to the conclusion that an 'improvised explosive device' had been built into the recorder and had been placed in a brown Samsonite suitcase. This was contained in the report that was submitted in July 1990, more than 18 months after the crash.</p> <p>The investigators thought they would be able to follow this lead to the criminals. It would become the most extensive detective search in criminal history: 15,000 interviews conducted in over 20 countries, 35,000 photos and 180,000 pieces of evidence. Scotland Yard would be helped by a dozen experts from the FBI as well as by personnel from the BKA, Germany's Bundeskriminalamt.</p> <p><b>Malta, Sliema, 30 August 1989</b> In the summer of 1989, British investigators came on to a hot trail. Of 11,000 pieces of cloth found in the wreckage, several dozen scraps had carried traces of explosive. One of these fragments carried a label that said 'Malta Trading Company'. When Manfred Klink, a criminal investigator for Germany's BKA, learned about this, he checked documentation in Frankfurt and found a computer printout showing that a suitcase originating in Malta had been transferred to Flight 103. Then three officials from Scotland Yard, the FBI and the BKA travelled to Malta, found the firm that had manufactured the piece of clothing carrying the label and finally found out where it was sold: a boutique called Mary's House in the port of Sliema. Tony Gauci, owner of the shop, remembered a customer who had bought three pairs of pyjamas and a pair of checked brown trousers in late November, early December. </p> <p>That customer stood out in Gauci's memory because he had paid so little attention to the size and prices of the garments. The man was of Arabic descent and, judging by his accent, probably a Libyan.</p> <p><b>Meckenheim, Germany, 14 September 1989</b> Swedish officials attending an international conference of Lockerbie investigators reported a lead that might implicate the PFLP-GC, the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Commando, a radical Palestinian splinter group that includes some of the most experienced bomb experts in the Middle East. In May 1989, the Swedish police arrested Mohammed Abu Talb, a PFLP-GC agent born in Egypt, for several attacks with explosives in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. What caught the attention of other investigators was the fact that Abu Talb had visited Malta twice, in October and November 1988. In apartments where the Egyptian had lived, investigators found pieces of clothing that had been bought in Malta and also a calendar on a kitchen table on which the date of 21 December 1988 - the day of the crash - had been circled.</p> <p>Could the PFLP-GC have been responsible for Lockerbie? And what motive would the terrorist group have had? The investigators believed there might have been an easy answer for the second question: money and revenge. For years the PFLP-GC had received political and military support from the Soviet Union and Syria, but this came to a stop at the end of the 1980s when an Iran Air Airbus with 290 passengers onboard was shot down in the Persian Gulf by the US cruiser Vincennes on 3 July 1988. Ayatollah Khomeini demanded revenge.Might the bomb experts of the PFLP-GC have been working for Iran? According to the CIA, several million US dollars were transferred from Iran to the accounts of the PFLP-GC after the airbus strike.</p> <p>But investigators were nevertheless sceptical about this lead. A number of technical details seemed contradictory and one would have thought the shopkeeper in Malta would have recognised Abu Talb's Egyptian accent. In addition, Abu Talb, who was sitting out a life prison sentence in Sweden, denied any involvement in Lockerbie.</p> <p><b>Fort Halstead, autumn 1989</b> The Forensic scientists of the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment continued their search. Thomas Hayes, the chief researcher, was convinced that a particular fragment of a circuit board was all that remained of the explosive device. </p> <p>The fragment, no larger than a postage stamp, did not fit any of the bombs typically made by the PFLP-GC. So who might have built such a bomb? US experts decided to see which other terrorist groups may have used this sort of device in the past. They traced records and found that two men had been arrested in Senegal in February 1988 with a device exactly like that found at Lockerbie. What really caught the attention of investigators was the fact that the two men were Libyan agents.</p> <p>In the summer of 1991, a man presented himself to US authorities and turned out to be a star witness, someone who might prove to be more useful than all of the chemical analyses and microscopic searches carried out so far. Abdel Madshid Jiacha was a former Libyan secret agent who had formerly been an assistant to the station chief of Libyan Arab Airlines at the Malta airport. He implicated two of his colleagues with the crime of Lockerbie - and he gave details.</p> <p><b>Washington and Edinburgh, 14 November 1991 </b>After months of questioning Jiacha, the FBI and Scotland Yard surprised the world's press with a totally new version of events. According to the new announcement, the attack on the Pan Am jumbo had been carried out by two Libyan secret agents: Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, born on 1 April 1952, and Amin Chalifa Fhimah, born on 4 April 1956. </p> <p>Jiacha said he had observed these two men as they loaded the suitcase containing the bomb on to the plane in Malta that was bound for Frankfurt. He said his government had ordered the attack as revenge for the US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986. Libya rejected all of the charges and refused to turn over the two accused men. In response, the UN placed several embargoes on Libya at the request of the US and Britain. All air traffic to and from Libya was forbidden, a blockade was put on Libyan assets held abroad and no Libyan exports were allowed to be received. Libya eventually said it was ready to turn over its two citizens, but only to a 'neutral' country. </p> <p>Robert Black, a law professor at the University of Edinburgh, made a compromise proposal in 1994 that was long rejected by all sides but which was finally accepted after tensions between Libya and the rest of the world had cooled: a Scottish court would judge the two suspects, but the trial would take place in the Netherlands, the headquarters of the International Court of Justice. </p> <p><b>Camp Zeist, Utrecht, Netherlands, 5 April 1999 </b>Eleven years after the mass murder of Lockerbie, a trial is set to take place that will be unique in the history of jurisprudence: Britain is organising and paying for a trial that will take place under Scottish law, but without a jury, on Dutch soil.</p> <p>Libya turned over the suspects on 5 April last year: they are the sole suspects. No one is implicating the Gadaffi regime, even though the Scottish prosecutors themselves take it for granted that the two agents were working for their government. The defence has asked that the start of the trial be delayed until 3 May 2000.</p> <p>And it is highly possible that the prosecutors will not be successful amid growing doubts about three weaknesses in the case.</p> <p>The first involves the fragment of the timing device that was found in the wreckage of the plane and that led US authorities to suspect Libyan agents in the first place. The Swiss manufacturer of the device has since said that the device found at Lockerbie was not the type that he had delivered to Libya in the past. Furthermore, the FBI forensic researcher who first examined the fragment has since been fired - for falsifying laboratory data in high-profile cases. </p> <p>The second weakness of the case involves the Malta connection. The boutique owner Tony Gauci has been questioned 16 times, but has never clearly identified the Libyan agent thought to have visited him. At the time of his alleged visit, the Libyan was 14 years younger than the man first described by Gauci. The boutique owner still maintains that Mohammed Abu Talb of the PFLP-GC is more likely to have been the man who visited his store.</p> <p>The third and major weakness of the case appears to be the star witness. Jiacha moved to the US from Malta after the attack and offered help to the FBI in 1991. The FBI then took him into its witness protection programme and paid him a reward.</p> <p>But several witnesses claim that he had already made contact with the US Embassy in Valletta, Malta in August 1988 - four months before the attack. At that point, he gave a detailed report of the activities of the Libyan secret service on Malta. It was only after considerable pressure from the defendants' lawyers that the US admitted that he had made contact with the CIA in 1988. This raises serious questions about the reliability of the witness who is the major connection between a purchase of clothing in Malta and the explosion in Lockerbie. </p> <p><b>Edinburgh, 23 November 1999</b> The Times reported that the Scottish defence team in the trial is seeking not only to absolve the two defendants but to name Mohammed Abu Talb as the guilty party.</p> <p>Will the trial bring out the truth? Is it really meant to? What is certain is that the prosecution's case is inconsistent. For if both suspects were working as Libyan secret agents, as the prosecution maintains, then Gadaffi, as Libya's chief of state, must be implicated.

      "bodyText": "Lockerbie, Wednesday, 21 December 1988, 7.03pm Bunty Galloway had just sat down in front of the television to watch This is Your Life. Outside it was windy and cold. No one was out on the narrow street in front of her house. Many of Bunty's neighbours were also watching TV and others were wrapping gifts. It was four days before Christmas. Suddenly, Bunty noticed a strange noise. She had never heard anything like it in her life. It was coming rapidly closer with a rising groan and howl as if at any moment the noise would make the house explode like a kettle under pressure. When she got to the door to look out, the roar had abruptly stopped. Now it was dark and quiet. The electricity had gone out. When she looked outside, the scene was as awful and bizarre as a Hieronymus Bosch version of hell: a wall of flames, down a hill and only about 600 metres away, was bathing the town in orange light. It smelled of kerosene. A terrace house was crushed from above, as if an enormous hammer had pounded through the roof. Two young women fell directly on to the street in front of her house. One lay on the asphalt and another was thrown over a low garden wall. The body of a child lay at the foot of the stairs that lead to Bunty Galloway's home. She would later remember that the child wore brown socks and blue pants. In all, 259 bodies fell within seconds on Lockerbie and on the area that surrounds the small town of 3,000 people. They lay alone or in groups of five or 10 or 20 in fields and parking lots, in gardens and on pavements, next to telephone booths and on top of roofs. Many seemed to be sleeping. Others were hardly recognisable as the remains of humans. Along with the bodies, about 290 tons of wreckage fell from the sky, including four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D-7A motors that were still functioning at full speed when they hit the ground. Eleven residents of Lockerbie had been killed instantly. Afterwards, for several terrible moments, there had been a long and unnatural silence. Almost all the electricity, gas, water and telephone lines had been cut. For a while, there was only sound and light where houses were burning. Hours would pass before Bunty Galloway and her neighbours would learn that a passenger jet had crashed into their town. Days would go by before specialists were certain that a bomb had caused the catastrophe. Months would pass before they could reconstruct the course of events. And it would take more than 11 years before two suspects would stand trial. And when this trial, which is scheduled to begin on 3 May near the Dutch city of Utrecht, ends after many months, it is likely that it will be decided that the real culprits still haven't been found. Moscow, US Embassy, 13 December 1988 On this Tuesday, a week before the accident, a diplomat signed an 'administrative notice' for the benefit of all embassy personnel: 'The embassy has been notified by the national flight authorities that an unidentified individual called a US diplomatic service in Europe on 5 December 1988 and claimed that a bomb would be planted on a Pan Am flight from Frankfurt to the US sometime in the next two weeks... Since this information could not be confirmed, the embassy leaves it up to all travellers to decide if they should change their travel plans or switch to another US airline.' The anonymous caller had placed the call in Helsinki. The Federal Aviation Administration had then informed the US Department of State as well as the affected airline and airports. But no one else was warned. London, Heathrow Airport, Terminal 3, 21 December 1988, 5pm On this afternoon, 243 people gathered in the lounges at the south end of the terminal. They were booked to go on a Pan American Airways Boeing 747 to John F Kennedy Airport in New York. Many had checked in in London, while others had come on 10 feeder flights to Heathrow; 49 passengers had arrived on a Boeing 727 from Frankfurt. It was a feature of Pan Am that various flights could carry the same flight number: Pan Am Flight 103 could be booked from Frankfurt to New York, even though there was a change of airplanes in London. Among those waiting to board the flight were 35 US students who had spent six to 12 months in Europe on an exchange programme from Syracuse University. There were also 12 children under the age of 10. The youngest was nine weeks old and the oldest was a 79-year-old woman from Budapest. The passengers came from 21 countries. At this point they all had 122 minutes to live. The cockpit of the Maid of the Seas, 5.30pm Captain James Bruce MacQuarrie was sitting on the left side of the cockpit of the Boeing 747. The Maid of the Seas had been put into service on 12 February 1970 and had since made 16,497 flights and logged in 72,646 flight hours. But, in spite of the age of the machine, the pilots had no reason to worry as they made their final checks. The Maid of the Seas had arrived in Heathrow at 12.10pm from San Francisco and had parked by Terminal 3. It was here that Jim MacQuarrie would take over from another pilot. The 55-year-old captain was an experienced pilot and a veteran of 10,910 flight hours, including 4,107 on a B-747. While the security forces of an airport are responsible for checking passengers and their hand luggage for dangerous objects, it is the duty of each airline to examine luggage that is stored in the freight section. At Heathrow, suitcases are examined with X-rays - but only those that are checked in at the airport. Since Flight 103 had officially begun its journey in Frankfurt, luggage originating from there was not checked again. The Boeing 727 that came from Frankfurt was parked at Position 16, directly next to the jumbo bound for New York. Workers unloaded the luggage container from the smaller jet and stored it in the belly of the Maid of the Seas. About 30 tons of freight was placed in the fuselage of the jumbo and over 108 tons of highly flammable kerosene lapped around in its tanks. The flight now weighed 323 tons and there were 259 people on board. 6.25pm Pan Am Flight 103 got permission from the control tower to take off. Captain MacQuarrie pushed the start lever forward. The jumbo moved down the runway and finally took off. 6.58pm The copilot made contact with Shanwick Oceanic Area Control in Ireland, the station that assigns flight corridors to planes flying across the North Atlantic to America in order to minimise the chances of a collision. The copilot gave the flight number, flying altitude and the destination. 7.02pm The air-traffic controller in Shanwick received the data and checked it. He answered: 'Clipper 103 should take 59 north 10 west to Kennedy.' The controller received no answer. 7.02pm and 50 seconds While the air-traffic controller was giving his instructions by radio, the image of the transponder suddenly disappeared from his screen. When radar caught up with the position of the plane a few seconds later - at 55 degrees and seven minutes north, 3 degrees and 21 minutes west - the surprised, and then dumbfounded, controller in Shanwick saw many images on his screen: a Boeing jet that was breaking apart. 7.02pm and 50 seconds On board the Maid of the Seas. There are no witnesses nor direct proof of what happened at this point, but there are many clues which allowed events to be reconstructed later. First, an explosion shook the aircraft. Before anyone realised what was happening, the electricity went out and it became completely dark. Several fractions of a second later, large sections of the forward fuselage were ripped away. The nose of the plane then broke off and fell towards the right into the depths. The people on board the beheaded 747 were hit with a shock wave of cold, noise and dark. Air escaped from the vessel and ice crystallised on the windows. From one second to the next, conditions had suddenly become similar to those on the peak of Mount Everest. The air was extremely thin and cold. The passengers immediately lost consciousness while the main body of the Maid of the Seas tipped forward, broke into several pieces and began to plummet. Passengers in the first few rows of seats were catapulted out of the disintegrating plane into the blackness of the night, while several were sucked into the engines that were still operating at full throttle. Most of the passengers, however, remained in two large sections of the plane that in a few seconds fell far enough to reach warmer levels of air that were richer in oxygen. At this point, perhaps as many as 60 per cent of the people on board were still alive, but no one knows if anyone ever regained consciousness. The drop continued. Lockerbie, 7.03pm and 26 seconds With the motors still going at full speed, the Boeing crashed on to the ground at half the speed of sound: the drop had taken 36 seconds. Even though the wreckage weighed many tons, it still did not fall straight down because there was a strong wind from the west. It drifted eastwards to fall directly on to the small town of Lockerbie in Scotland's most southwestern county. The wings and the middle part of the fuselage, which still held about 90 tons of kerosene in the main tank, struck Sherwood Crescent, a street of tidy, single-family homes. The earthquake monitoring centre in Eskdalemuir, 14km away, registered a tremor of 1.6 on the Richter scale. The middle part of the plane, complete with the wings, tore a gash into the earth that was 47 metres long and a metre deep; 1,500 tons of earth was lifted into the air and eventually blocked traffic on the A74. A policeman who lived in the neighbourhood said that it seemed as if a 'small atom bomb' had hit. The houses between numbers 13 and 16 on Sherwood Crescent were completely obliterated, while most of the others were irreparably damaged. (Eventually, a total of 21 buildings had to be torn down.) Eleven people were decimated; nothing remained later to identify them aside from the artificial knee of 81-year-old Mary Lancaster, the oldest of the victims. The ball of fire reached a local gas station. Soon its diesel tanks exploded and its supply of tyres started to burn. The four engines of the aircraft struck on both sides of the railway track that divides the town. A 20-metre-long piece of the rear fuselage struck Rosebank Crescent, the street where Bunty Galloway was sitting in front of her television. The cockpit, along with the front end of the fuselage, crashed about 4km east of Lockerbie in a sheep pasture directly by Tundergarth church. This part of the nose was so intact that it could still be identified as part of a plane and reminded many who saw it of the severed head of a huge fish. Smaller parts - strangely bent pieces of metal, crushed suitcases, whisky bottles, coins, seats - covered practically every street of the town and also struck roofs, crashed through windows and were found buried inches deep in the moist earth of the surrounding fields and the golf course. Light material, such as insulation from the interior of the fuselage and torn pages of books, was found as far away as 130km. Invisible, but not without danger, were the 400kg of enriched uranium that made up part of the plane's stabilisation mechanisms which had been spread along the trail of the wreckage. And yet the people of southern Scotland were lucky. Only 16km from Lockerbie stands the Chapelcross atomic power plant, one of the oldest in Britain. It is also the site where the country produces plutonium for atomic weapons. Lockerbie, Sherwood Crescent, about 7.10pm Donald Bogie lives in Ashgrove Terrace, a northern extension of Sherwood Crescent, and his experience was like that of most people in the town. He heard a sound that became so loud that it was almost unbearable. Then it suddenly became dark and eerily quiet. He ran out of his house and saw flames over the city. Perhaps it was because the catastrophe seemed so unreal that the people of Lockerbie did not become hysterical or apathetic, as so often happens in such situations. Over there in a field lay the body of a young man who was only wearing his underpants because the rest of his clothes had been torn off during the fall. Beside him was an undamaged bottle of Chivas Regal. The bodies of Captain MacQuarrie, his copilot and the flight engineer were found still strapped into their seats. The people of Lockerbie managed the catastrophe with laudable skill. Although the most important water line was broken, the fire department was able to put out all the fires within seven and a half hours. It is a region where milk production is the primary industry and milk wagons were quickly filled with water and driven to the many burning pieces of wreckage. The first corpses were brought to the town hall, but people then started bringing them to the hockey stadium because it was the only place large and cool enough to store so many bodies. The county's police force, the smallest in Scotland, was quickly reinforced. Normally only four policemen worked in the Lockerbie region, but by Thursday morning there were 1,100 working alongside 1,000 other soldiers, firemen and volunteers. But even a force of this size could not prevent the first ghoulish sightseers from blocking the narrow country roads the next day. At about 10am on the Thursday, two boys who were driving a tractor across a field on their father's farm near Tundergarth found both of the orange metal boxes containing the flight data. Search teams would comb through much of the 2,190 square kilometres of the county with the help of helicopters, airplanes and even spy satellites. But they would be unable to locate the bodies of seven of the passengers, as well as about 10 per cent of the plane. And in some cases they may have arrived too late: 10 years after the catastrophe, the chief pathologist reported that two of the passengers had suffered serious but not fatal wounds. Possibly they froze to death on the ground before the search teams found them in a forest four days later. Central Munitions Depot of the British Armed Forces, Longtown, January 1989 Whenever there is an airplane accident in Britain, specialists from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) try to establish the cause. They learned of the crash 37 minutes after it happened. It was the worst in British history, and they were on the site that night. Towards midnight, the Scottish police said that they were conducting a 'criminal investigation', although it was still far from clear if a crime had been committed. From that time on, all of the wreckage was considered evidence and could only be touched by authorised people. Every corpse was photographed. In the first days after the crash, the work of the AAIB was similar to a giant puzzle. The investigators took over a hall in the munitions depot, which was located 32km from Lockerbie. Everything that was found was gathered at Longtown - in all about four million pieces of wreckage. Each was registered on a computer and, if it could be identified, was placed carefully so that gradually a two-dimensional version of the airplane and its contents took form. The examination of the two data boxes showed that 50 seconds after 7.02pm no new data was registered and the machine presumably began to fall apart. The cockpit that was found near Tundergarth was so undamaged that the instrument panel could be examined. All the gears were in their normal positions. Nothing indicated that the pilots had had time to initiate a last-ditch manoeuvre or even send a call for help. The investigators then made an important discovery: pieces of wreckage from the left side of the front fuselage and two luggage containers showed signs of an explosion. One of them had been loaded in Frankfurt. After weeks of testing, it was discovered that scraps of cloth and splinters from one suitcase showed traces of the chemicals RDX and PETN. Both are normally left in the wake of explosions triggered by the plastic explosive Semtex, which was produced in Czechoslovakia at the time. The searchers also found a splinter the size of a fingernail of a brown electrical circuit that was identified as part of a Toshiba radio recorder. They came to the conclusion that an 'improvised explosive device' had been built into the recorder and had been placed in a brown Samsonite suitcase. This was contained in the report that was submitted in July 1990, more than 18 months after the crash. The investigators thought they would be able to follow this lead to the criminals. It would become the most extensive detective search in criminal history: 15,000 interviews conducted in over 20 countries, 35,000 photos and 180,000 pieces of evidence. Scotland Yard would be helped by a dozen experts from the FBI as well as by personnel from the BKA, Germany's Bundeskriminalamt. Malta, Sliema, 30 August 1989 In the summer of 1989, British investigators came on to a hot trail. Of 11,000 pieces of cloth found in the wreckage, several dozen scraps had carried traces of explosive. One of these fragments carried a label that said 'Malta Trading Company'. When Manfred Klink, a criminal investigator for Germany's BKA, learned about this, he checked documentation in Frankfurt and found a computer printout showing that a suitcase originating in Malta had been transferred to Flight 103. Then three officials from Scotland Yard, the FBI and the BKA travelled to Malta, found the firm that had manufactured the piece of clothing carrying the label and finally found out where it was sold: a boutique called Mary's House in the port of Sliema. Tony Gauci, owner of the shop, remembered a customer who had bought three pairs of pyjamas and a pair of checked brown trousers in late November, early December. That customer stood out in Gauci's memory because he had paid so little attention to the size and prices of the garments. The man was of Arabic descent and, judging by his accent, probably a Libyan. Meckenheim, Germany, 14 September 1989 Swedish officials attending an international conference of Lockerbie investigators reported a lead that might implicate the PFLP-GC, the People's Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Commando, a radical Palestinian splinter group that includes some of the most experienced bomb experts in the Middle East. In May 1989, the Swedish police arrested Mohammed Abu Talb, a PFLP-GC agent born in Egypt, for several attacks with explosives in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. What caught the attention of other investigators was the fact that Abu Talb had visited Malta twice, in October and November 1988. In apartments where the Egyptian had lived, investigators found pieces of clothing that had been bought in Malta and also a calendar on a kitchen table on which the date of 21 December 1988 - the day of the crash - had been circled. Could the PFLP-GC have been responsible for Lockerbie? And what motive would the terrorist group have had? The investigators believed there might have been an easy answer for the second question: money and revenge. For years the PFLP-GC had received political and military support from the Soviet Union and Syria, but this came to a stop at the end of the 1980s when an Iran Air Airbus with 290 passengers onboard was shot down in the Persian Gulf by the US cruiser Vincennes on 3 July 1988. Ayatollah Khomeini demanded revenge.Might the bomb experts of the PFLP-GC have been working for Iran? According to the CIA, several million US dollars were transferred from Iran to the accounts of the PFLP-GC after the airbus strike. But investigators were nevertheless sceptical about this lead. A number of technical details seemed contradictory and one would have thought the shopkeeper in Malta would have recognised Abu Talb's Egyptian accent. In addition, Abu Talb, who was sitting out a life prison sentence in Sweden, denied any involvement in Lockerbie. Fort Halstead, autumn 1989 The Forensic scientists of the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment continued their search. Thomas Hayes, the chief researcher, was convinced that a particular fragment of a circuit board was all that remained of the explosive device. The fragment, no larger than a postage stamp, did not fit any of the bombs typically made by the PFLP-GC. So who might have built such a bomb? US experts decided to see which other terrorist groups may have used this sort of device in the past. They traced records and found that two men had been arrested in Senegal in February 1988 with a device exactly like that found at Lockerbie. What really caught the attention of investigators was the fact that the two men were Libyan agents. In the summer of 1991, a man presented himself to US authorities and turned out to be a star witness, someone who might prove to be more useful than all of the chemical analyses and microscopic searches carried out so far. Abdel Madshid Jiacha was a former Libyan secret agent who had formerly been an assistant to the station chief of Libyan Arab Airlines at the Malta airport. He implicated two of his colleagues with the crime of Lockerbie - and he gave details. Washington and Edinburgh, 14 November 1991 After months of questioning Jiacha, the FBI and Scotland Yard surprised the world's press with a totally new version of events. According to the new announcement, the attack on the Pan Am jumbo had been carried out by two Libyan secret agents: Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, born on 1 April 1952, and Amin Chalifa Fhimah, born on 4 April 1956. Jiacha said he had observed these two men as they loaded the suitcase containing the bomb on to the plane in Malta that was bound for Frankfurt. He said his government had ordered the attack as revenge for the US bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986. Libya rejected all of the charges and refused to turn over the two accused men. In response, the UN placed several embargoes on Libya at the request of the US and Britain. All air traffic to and from Libya was forbidden, a blockade was put on Libyan assets held abroad and no Libyan exports were allowed to be received. Libya eventually said it was ready to turn over its two citizens, but only to a 'neutral' country. Robert Black, a law professor at the University of Edinburgh, made a compromise proposal in 1994 that was long rejected by all sides but which was finally accepted after tensions between Libya and the rest of the world had cooled: a Scottish court would judge the two suspects, but the trial would take place in the Netherlands, the headquarters of the International Court of Justice. Camp Zeist, Utrecht, Netherlands, 5 April 1999 Eleven years after the mass murder of Lockerbie, a trial is set to take place that will be unique in the history of jurisprudence: Britain is organising and paying for a trial that will take place under Scottish law, but without a jury, on Dutch soil. Libya turned over the suspects on 5 April last year: they are the sole suspects. No one is implicating the Gadaffi regime, even though the Scottish prosecutors themselves take it for granted that the two agents were working for their government. The defence has asked that the start of the trial be delayed until 3 May 2000. And it is highly possible that the prosecutors will not be successful amid growing doubts about three weaknesses in the case. The first involves the fragment of the timing device that was found in the wreckage of the plane and that led US authorities to suspect Libyan agents in the first place. The Swiss manufacturer of the device has since said that the device found at Lockerbie was not the type that he had delivered to Libya in the past. Furthermore, the FBI forensic researcher who first examined the fragment has since been fired - for falsifying laboratory data in high-profile cases. The second weakness of the case involves the Malta connection. The boutique owner Tony Gauci has been questioned 16 times, but has never clearly identified the Libyan agent thought to have visited him. At the time of his alleged visit, the Libyan was 14 years younger than the man first described by Gauci. The boutique owner still maintains that Mohammed Abu Talb of the PFLP-GC is more likely to have been the man who visited his store. The third and major weakness of the case appears to be the star witness. Jiacha moved to the US from Malta after the attack and offered help to the FBI in 1991. The FBI then took him into its witness protection programme and paid him a reward. But several witnesses claim that he had already made contact with the US Embassy in Valletta, Malta in August 1988 - four months before the attack. At that point, he gave a detailed report of the activities of the Libyan secret service on Malta. It was only after considerable pressure from the defendants' lawyers that the US admitted that he had made contact with the CIA in 1988. This raises serious questions about the reliability of the witness who is the major connection between a purchase of clothing in Malta and the explosion in Lockerbie. Edinburgh, 23 November 1999 The Times reported that the Scottish defence team in the trial is seeking not only to absolve the two defendants but to name Mohammed Abu Talb as the guilty party. Will the trial bring out the truth? Is it really meant to? What is certain is that the prosecution's case is inconsistent. For if both suspects were working as Libyan secret agents, as the prosecution maintains, then Gadaffi, as Libya's chief of state, must be implicated. 'This trial is meant to accomplish one thing: to bring the entire case to a close,' said one participant, who weighed his words very carefully. 'No one has any interest any longer in a public solution of the problem; neither Gadaffi nor the US. But all parties have to go through with this trial to save face. This is not about law but about politics - and it has been all along.'",

But events took a farcical turn even before they landed in decrepit Baghdad.</p> <p>Oliver Reed, John Barron (C.J. in The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin ) and a number of other top British actors accepted roles in the film, The Great Question, at a time when London still viewed the Iraqi dictator as a 'good guy'. The film told the story of a revolt by the Iraqis against British colonial rule in 1920.</p> <p>Unlimited funds were provided by the Directorate of Cinema and National Theatre and Saddam's agents were sent out to hire the best available cast and crew. They approached Edward Fox and representatives of Vanessa Redgrave. Both turned them down.</p> <p>However, many others accepted - not least because the Iraqis were offering \u00a31,000 for a week's filming. The actors and technicians were flown to Baghdad to start filming, which took place in 1980-81 - during the eight-year Gulf War between Iraq and Iran.</p> <p>Once over Iraqi airspace things started to go wrong. The first inkling came when the actors found their plane flying with no lights into an unlit airport. The precautions had to be taken to avoid missile attacks, the cabin staff explained. Most opted to drive for 14 hours across the desert to Jordan on their way out.</p> <p>There was only one decent hotel in the Iraqi capital at the time - the al-Mansoor - but it did not have enough rooms for all the actors and technicians. Many found themselves in various 'half-built, cockroach-infested ruins'. Nor was the food very good. 'I survived for weeks on end on dates and orange juice,' said Nicholas Young, who starred in children's sci-fi serial The Tomorrow People. Half the cast went down with diarrhoea.</p> <p>They also faced shortages of everything from salt to heating oil. Water supplies were intermittent so actors who had just spent 12 hours filming in the desert frequently had to go without washing.</p> <p>John Barron, who played General Haldane, commander-in-chief of the British troops, remembered noon temperatures in the hundreds and freezing nights spent huddled around open fires.</p> <p>'We were wearing 1920s Army uniforms and suffered as they must have done.'</p> <p>It was too much for many. 'Dozens of the technicians just walked off the set. There were quite a few nervous breakdowns,' Young said.</p> <p>All the British actors wore moustaches to distinguish them from the Iraqi rebels, who wore beards and were played by massed regiments from the Iraqi army. Frequently, however, real war interfered with the shooting schedule. Barron remembered one scene being cancelled when the soldiers were sud denly ordered to the front to stem an Iranian offensive.</p> <p>Being in a war-torn capital of a Muslim country did not stop Reed, who played another senior British officer, getting up to his usual antics during his five-week stay. These included entering into an impromptu 'table lifting' competition in a Baghdad restaurant.</p> <p>'The idea was to lift a table up by one leg with everything on it,' Barron said last week. 'He was rather noisy in the restaurant but when he was led out and driven home to be put to bed he was as quiet as could be.'</p> <p>Others remember how, after the supply of alcohol to his hotel room was cut off by Iraqi security men, Reed took the lift to the ground-floor bar to protest, stark naked.</p> <p>Though he never visited the set, Saddam's henchmen kept a close eye on their guests. Some actors were roughed up when passing checkpoints on the bus that took them to the desert for shooting. Others had films ripped from cameras</p> <p>The film, which runs for several hours, has never been shown outside Iraq. It was skewed to portray Saddam's Ba'ath party regime as somehow linked to the ragged religious and tribal rebels who led the original revolt after the First World War.</p> <p>At the time of filming, Western governments were well disposed towards Saddam, despite his reputation for brutal violence.They saw him as a bulwark against the fanatical Islamism of Iran.</p> <p>For the cast, the whole experience was odd. 'It was very, very interesting,' said Barron. 'I haven't done anything like it before or since.'</p> <p>Young remembers looking around the set in the desert with bewilderment. 'It was never entirely clear which Great Question the film title referred to,' he said. We asked our own of course - what on earth are we doing here?'</p> <p>jason.burke@observer.co.uk</p>",

Oliver Reed, John Barron (C.J. in The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin ) and a number of other top British actors accepted roles in the film, The Great Question, at a time when London still viewed the Iraqi dictator as a 'good guy'. The film told the story of a revolt by the Iraqis against British colonial rule in 1920. Unlimited funds were provided by the Directorate of Cinema and National Theatre and Saddam's agents were sent out to hire the best available cast and crew. They approached Edward Fox and representatives of Vanessa Redgrave. Both turned them down. However, many others accepted - not least because the Iraqis were offering \u00a31,000 for a week's filming. The actors and technicians were flown to Baghdad to start filming, which took place in 1980-81 - during the eight-year Gulf War between Iraq and Iran. Once over Iraqi airspace things started to go wrong. The first inkling came when the actors found their plane flying with no lights into an unlit airport. The precautions had to be taken to avoid missile attacks, the cabin staff explained. Most opted to drive for 14 hours across the desert to Jordan on their way out. There was only one decent hotel in the Iraqi capital at the time - the al-Mansoor - but it did not have enough rooms for all the actors and technicians. Many found themselves in various 'half-built, cockroach-infested ruins'. Nor was the food very good. 'I survived for weeks on end on dates and orange juice,' said Nicholas Young, who starred in children's sci-fi serial The Tomorrow People. Half the cast went down with diarrhoea. They also faced shortages of everything from salt to heating oil. Water supplies were intermittent so actors who had just spent 12 hours filming in the desert frequently had to go without washing. John Barron, who played General Haldane, commander-in-chief of the British troops, remembered noon temperatures in the hundreds and freezing nights spent huddled around open fires. 'We were wearing 1920s Army uniforms and suffered as they must have done.' It was too much for many. 'Dozens of the technicians just walked off the set. There were quite a few nervous breakdowns,' Young said. All the British actors wore moustaches to distinguish them from the Iraqi rebels, who wore beards and were played by massed regiments from the Iraqi army. Frequently, however, real war interfered with the shooting schedule. Barron remembered one scene being cancelled when the soldiers were sud denly ordered to the front to stem an Iranian offensive. Being in a war-torn capital of a Muslim country did not stop Reed, who played another senior British officer, getting up to his usual antics during his five-week stay. These included entering into an impromptu 'table lifting' competition in a Baghdad restaurant. 'The idea was to lift a table up by one leg with everything on it,' Barron said last week. 'He was rather noisy in the restaurant but when he was led out and driven home to be put to bed he was as quiet as could be.' Others remember how, after the supply of alcohol to his hotel room was cut off by Iraqi security men, Reed took the lift to the ground-floor bar to protest, stark naked. Though he never visited the set, Saddam's henchmen kept a close eye on their guests. Some actors were roughed up when passing checkpoints on the bus that took them to the desert for shooting. Others had films ripped from cameras The film, which runs for several hours, has never been shown outside Iraq. It was skewed to portray Saddam's Ba'ath party regime as somehow linked to the ragged religious and tribal rebels who led the original revolt after the First World War. At the time of filming, Western governments were well disposed towards Saddam, despite his reputation for brutal violence.They saw him as a bulwark against the fanatical Islamism of Iran. For the cast, the whole experience was odd. 'It was very, very interesting,' said Barron. 'I haven't done anything like it before or since.' Young remembers looking around the set in the desert with bewilderment. 'It was never entirely clear which Great Question the film title referred to,' he said. We asked our own of course - what on earth are we doing here?' jason.burke@observer.co.uk",

Depending on your fix of print, Blair is almost libellously accused of being a fascist, scurrilously accused of dishonesty and duplicity, damned if he steadily pursues his principled sensible policy on Europe, damned if he comes out against the destructive Ken Livingstone who helped all but bury the party in the Eighties. Everything that goes wrong is His Fault, yet, as Robert Graves said of the much maligned Nelson:</p> <p>And, Sir, the secret of his victories?</p> <p>By his unServicelike, familiar ways, Sir,</p> <p>He made the whole Fleet love him, damn his eyes!</p> <p>The Labour Party is going through a time of turbulence and, as its leader, Blair is being savaged. Old and so-called friends Brutusly knife him in the chest. I think that there is a real fear out there that he will win again. And again. That's one source of it. The criticism is overwhelmingly unfair but it was bound to happen and this steeling process could do him a favour and redound on those so eager now to tear him to bits.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, it would be best to ignore it all. It will pass away, so why rise to the bait? Especially someone like myself, vulnerable as one of Tony's so-called cronies. On the other hand, what the hell. You have to learn to ignore that canard. I was put into the House of Lords to beef up the arts and broadcasting group and to help democratise it. I have been a Labour Party supporter since before Tony Blair. In the wilderness years I was not unwilling to speak out, so why be silent in the dog days?</p> <p>The Labour Party, now just past mid-term, has made errors, but what it has done for the reparation of this country and what it will surely do far, far outweighs that. The source of current troubles can be tracked back, I think, to its astonishing election.</p> <p>When I woke up on that May morning in 1997 I, like millions of others I guess, thought along the lines of bliss it is this dawn to be alive and prompted to further pretension I might have added and to be Labour is very Heaven.</p> <p>To be honest, I saw no dawn. At 4.30am, I was still stuck on the sofa with Michael Foot, both agape at the television which delivered details of a famous victory and the awful fantasy of that majority. We refused to budge, save to raise the occasional glass of red wine and, so steeped were we in the win, that we happily forewent the celebrations on the South Bank. Dawn came while I slept. But the next day, hangover and all, it was indeed bliss, that day and for many days. There was dancing in the streets of London - I saw it.</p> <p>Here we go, here we go - at last all the wrongs would be righted. All the wrinkles of injustice ironed out, all baseness alchemised to gold. The early days were unreal. The wilderness years were over. What could Labour not do? Bang! Transform the NHS. Whack! Repair all schools and award all teachers degraded by nearly 20 years of government sneering. Wallop! End racism, child poverty and heal the 101 wounds of 'There is no such thing as society'. Right now, please!</p> <p>We wanted it now! And with that majority, with the rare fluke of a decent economic inheritance for Labour, with the will of the whole country - as it seemed - behind the new Government, we could have it all now. Surely. Victory meant instant remedies and I was one of the many who, knowing it to be foolish, somehow did believe a wand had been waved over the land. There was nothing that honest application to decent ideals could not achieve. And quick.</p> <p>Quick was a key to it all. Too long starved of power had made power seem to be a force in itself which could be wielded without reference to the reality of institutions, people, traditions, interest groups, bloody mindedness, subversion and dumb, silent opposition. Ideals smuggled through enemy lines after 20 years were so burnished and dear to us that they had a glow like a mythical force. When released into government, they would surely shatter the old order out of which would arise the new.</p> <p>I do not think this is merely fanciful. Those years of non-government were painful for Labour Party supporters and encouraged extreme expectations. By the time Labour got there, many were stir crazy. In the early Eighties, the Lib-Dems had threatened to slice Labour's intellectuals and middle classes away.</p> <p>Militants had threatened to destroy Labour in their own image, to become forever an inglorious rump, forever ingloriously right and forever left out of despised Westminster politics. Scargill, brilliant orator, appalling strategist, decided to take on a Prime Minister more than ready for the fight and lost. In London, one of Ken Livingstone's barmy decisions to court an IRA at that time attempting to assassinate not only British soldiers but British politicians, turned the guns of the Conservative Party on the Labour GLC and his great achievement was that it was abolished.</p> <p>Kinnock fought hard, but in public he was abused, misrepresented and ridiculed by a press which was triumphalist Tory. The North of England was laid to waste. The lives of great industries were brutally aborted, perhaps in the long term necessary, but not with that brutality, without regard for the social and personal consequences still scarring the land today.</p> <p>So Labour supporters were pretty mad in May 1997. Mad at what had happened and a little mad, too, at the dizzy prospect of that 179 majority giving the illusion of impregnability.</p> <p>Then there was the Blair and Brown factor. They are stars. Stars make their own rules. Stars command the territory way beyond the ordinary. There is a tendency to let them do all the work and you believe it must be in safe hands because they are stars. Stars must always play a blinder. Stars are pulled up to be pulled down. We want them to fail and then rise again. They make our myths. Political stars are dangerous, most of all when they succeed.</p> <p>An almost wholly inexperienced team took over from all those marinated Tory wiseacres and played them off the pitch in a fortnight. Brown seized the Treasury like a man who has been stalking it all his life. There would be no Labour loss of economic control this time. The accusation of economic irresponsibility would not be levelled at the fortress Brown built. He started as he has gone on; bold, secure, surprising and quietly, as redistributive as he is re-energising.</p> <p>And as for Tony Blair - it was SHAZAM! It must have been impossible for anyone not to be made giddy by the adulation which cascaded over him. But he seemed to not only to weather it, but ride it, to use the unnerving popularity in order to proselytise ideas and objectives clearly and passionately. There was, and is, his desire that Britain get rid of all that constricted it from an overprivileged, underambitious, overcomplacent, underanalytical, suffocating and incompetent past and blaze into the present with a stake in the real global future. And he wanted what so many people in this country wanted. He wanted it quickly and across the waterfront.</p> <p>So the first six months, even the first year and even the first two years, went by relatively unclouded for Labour. Then things went wrong, but that was not the heart of it. It was not only the right-wing panic that he might win and win again but the clash between the two forces that emerged at the beginning of May 1997 - 'Great Expectations' collided with 'Look Back in Anger'. This brought on the rumblings; this, and errors and mistakes, predictable in any government, especially a new government. Yet, it is important to put it into perspective. The popularity of Tony Blair and the Labour Party today is stronger than that of any other, at this time in the Government's term, since polling began. That is what also annoys some of the critics.</p> <p>Begin on Dome's Day - the inept arrangements, the effect on various newspaper editors frustrated by amateurism, a feeling of disappointment about its contents, and a general air of embarrassment that, despite promises, we had had no world role on New Year's Eve, no river of fire, no turning wheel, no splendour at the Dome.</p> <p>Warning shots had been coming throughout 1999. The outbreak of flu tested the NHS, doctors announced crises, newspapers identified crises, and indeed there were crises. No amount of accurate counter-talk about targets being met could allay a growing anxiety that the treasured NHS was not in the shape it should be. Transport was already in a jam and it seemed to get worse as the vision of millions of cars on an inadequate road system and run-down, even dangerous, train services produced a nightmare which John Prescott longs to be rid of, though he knows it will take years.</p> <p>That these were deep problems which came from two decades of neglect and mismanagement was suddenly irrelevant. Two years on and everything had not been transformed? Where was the magic wand? Where were the stars? Tony Blair was arguably surfing exhaustion. Kosovo and Northern Ireland sucked energy and attention when the domestic round needed concentration. One felt he was so passionate about moving the country forward, so anxious to rid the country of moribund practices which would wither it on the twenty-first-century vine, that he had to be everywhere all of the time, whatever it took out of him. Gordon Brown, meanwhile, rearranged the economy, well fitted for the long-term, well enough pleased with a quiet revolution. The two stars were still up there but around them seemed more consternation than constellation.</p> <p>Or so some of the press would have it. There was a running battle it seemed between the spin doctors of Number 10 and the spin doctors of the Street of Shame. The one group was trying to get the story right, the other trying to get the right story. They clashed. But what might have been an entertaining spat became bitter, as it does when people believe they are being misrepresented.</p> <p>Yet it is far better that the press flail the Government than fawn on it. Perhaps that is one of the two cheers for democracy. And, in this case, with such an enfeebled Opposition, the press can justifiably claim that it fills a vacuum.</p> <p>Moreover, there were issues that incited challenges. Asylum is rightly emotive and the handling of asylum seekers was heavily criticised. The trial-by-jury issue moved from modernising a legal system needing a thorough overhaul to a matter of principle in which it seemed that the whole of trial by jury was being undermined. The Alun Michael d\u00e9bcle and errors surrounding Livingstone proved excellent sticks for beating the Government.</p> <p>The accusation 'control freak' struck and stuck and the Millbank machine, so recently applauded, was derided as a cross between the Inquisition and Tammany Hall. Those, like myself, who argue that Blair's determination to cohere disparate departments and Ministers of uneven talent was necessary, were swept aside. One person's leader is another's control freak.</p> <p>It is true that there is an evangelical trait which can characterise Tony Blair's more public speeches. His Christianity is close to the surface and it is not a colouring for all tastes. That he is not like that in private, and that political public passions are suspect in our sceptic isle, does not wash with those whose motto when faced by politicians is: 'Who are you to tell me what to do?' The more you mean it, the worse it seems.</p> <p>And there is the sniping about his lack of liking for the old cloth-cap Labour Party. There is no evidence for this on a personal level but, yes, he wanted the Labour Party to cast off the cloth cap and all the fatalism and failure screwed down under it. He came in to the party when it was fouled up and all but sunk and the unions bore a good share of blame for that. He wanted rid of all that and he was right. Blair likes the Labour Party enough to slog himself silly to make it change and succeed - and succeed for the whole country.</p> <p>And that is yet another jibe. Thatcher was a great cheerleader for her side, they say, but Blair is overenamoured of the whole nation. Why is he not out there waving his sabre more often on single issues? Did we hear him loud and clear on Section 28? Well, he certainly wants it repealed and will try again. But there is a point here. Tony Blair has a grasp of what the whole country could do if it got itself together. He is an old-fashioned patriot and one nation to the core. That exacts compromises. But it's how he is. It has served him, and us, well.</p> <p>But he has become the prey. Columnists outdo each other with adjectives of scorn, derision and malice, seizing on the opportunity of bringing out the old knocking copy, which is so much more fun to write and often so much more fun to read. But to isolate particular targets does not invalidate the whole, broad battle plan. Casualties are expected but if the objective is clear and a good one - as Labour's is - then you keep going.</p> <p>Something else is going on. Despite the attacks, the British public insists on preferring Labour above all other par ties. More importantly, there is a track record out there. It may not satisfy those in the Labour Party who are genuinely addicted to Opposition and feel lonely without it. It will not satisfy that gaggle of luvvies who came for cocktails back then and predictably turned into pumpkins after midnight.</p> <p>But what is currently being done by the Labour Party will help an enormous number of people. I will keep it snappy. Would the Tories have given record increases in child benefits - the biggest ever from which seven million mothers and 12 million children will gain? Would the Tories have set up the Working Families Tax Credit to provide a guaranteed minimum of \u00a3200 per week for families with one adult in full-time work?</p> <p>Would the Tories have introduced the first national minimum wage, benefiting two million people, or equal rights to six million workers who never had them before, or paid holidays to two-and-a-half million who never enjoyed them before, and extra maternity leave to nearly four million women? On human rights, a good start has been made, as it has on tackling racism, and education, the NHS and the arts and sciences.

      "bodyText": "In certain sections of the press, it is open season on Tony Blair. Depending on your fix of print, Blair is almost libellously accused of being a fascist, scurrilously accused of dishonesty and duplicity, damned if he steadily pursues his principled sensible policy on Europe, damned if he comes out against the destructive Ken Livingstone who helped all but bury the party in the Eighties. Everything that goes wrong is His Fault, yet, as Robert Graves said of the much maligned Nelson: And, Sir, the secret of his victories? By his unServicelike, familiar ways, Sir, He made the whole Fleet love him, damn his eyes! The Labour Party is going through a time of turbulence and, as its leader, Blair is being savaged. Old and so-called friends Brutusly knife him in the chest. I think that there is a real fear out there that he will win again. And again. That's one source of it. The criticism is overwhelmingly unfair but it was bound to happen and this steeling process could do him a favour and redound on those so eager now to tear him to bits. Perhaps, then, it would be best to ignore it all. It will pass away, so why rise to the bait? Especially someone like myself, vulnerable as one of Tony's so-called cronies. On the other hand, what the hell. You have to learn to ignore that canard. I was put into the House of Lords to beef up the arts and broadcasting group and to help democratise it. I have been a Labour Party supporter since before Tony Blair. In the wilderness years I was not unwilling to speak out, so why be silent in the dog days? The Labour Party, now just past mid-term, has made errors, but what it has done for the reparation of this country and what it will surely do far, far outweighs that. The source of current troubles can be tracked back, I think, to its astonishing election. When I woke up on that May morning in 1997 I, like millions of others I guess, thought along the lines of bliss it is this dawn to be alive and prompted to further pretension I might have added and to be Labour is very Heaven. To be honest, I saw no dawn. At 4.30am, I was still stuck on the sofa with Michael Foot, both agape at the television which delivered details of a famous victory and the awful fantasy of that majority. We refused to budge, save to raise the occasional glass of red wine and, so steeped were we in the win, that we happily forewent the celebrations on the South Bank. Dawn came while I slept. But the next day, hangover and all, it was indeed bliss, that day and for many days. There was dancing in the streets of London - I saw it. Here we go, here we go - at last all the wrongs would be righted. All the wrinkles of injustice ironed out, all baseness alchemised to gold. The early days were unreal. The wilderness years were over. What could Labour not do? Bang! Transform the NHS. Whack! Repair all schools and award all teachers degraded by nearly 20 years of government sneering. Wallop! End racism, child poverty and heal the 101 wounds of 'There is no such thing as society'. Right now, please! We wanted it now! And with that majority, with the rare fluke of a decent economic inheritance for Labour, with the will of the whole country - as it seemed - behind the new Government, we could have it all now. Surely. Victory meant instant remedies and I was one of the many who, knowing it to be foolish, somehow did believe a wand had been waved over the land. There was nothing that honest application to decent ideals could not achieve. And quick. Quick was a key to it all. Too long starved of power had made power seem to be a force in itself which could be wielded without reference to the reality of institutions, people, traditions, interest groups, bloody mindedness, subversion and dumb, silent opposition. Ideals smuggled through enemy lines after 20 years were so burnished and dear to us that they had a glow like a mythical force. When released into government, they would surely shatter the old order out of which would arise the new. I do not think this is merely fanciful. Those years of non-government were painful for Labour Party supporters and encouraged extreme expectations. By the time Labour got there, many were stir crazy. In the early Eighties, the Lib-Dems had threatened to slice Labour's intellectuals and middle classes away. Militants had threatened to destroy Labour in their own image, to become forever an inglorious rump, forever ingloriously right and forever left out of despised Westminster politics. Scargill, brilliant orator, appalling strategist, decided to take on a Prime Minister more than ready for the fight and lost. In London, one of Ken Livingstone's barmy decisions to court an IRA at that time attempting to assassinate not only British soldiers but British politicians, turned the guns of the Conservative Party on the Labour GLC and his great achievement was that it was abolished. Kinnock fought hard, but in public he was abused, misrepresented and ridiculed by a press which was triumphalist Tory. The North of England was laid to waste. The lives of great industries were brutally aborted, perhaps in the long term necessary, but not with that brutality, without regard for the social and personal consequences still scarring the land today. So Labour supporters were pretty mad in May 1997. Mad at what had happened and a little mad, too, at the dizzy prospect of that 179 majority giving the illusion of impregnability. Then there was the Blair and Brown factor. They are stars. Stars make their own rules. Stars command the territory way beyond the ordinary. There is a tendency to let them do all the work and you believe it must be in safe hands because they are stars. Stars must always play a blinder. Stars are pulled up to be pulled down. We want them to fail and then rise again. They make our myths. Political stars are dangerous, most of all when they succeed. An almost wholly inexperienced team took over from all those marinated Tory wiseacres and played them off the pitch in a fortnight. Brown seized the Treasury like a man who has been stalking it all his life. There would be no Labour loss of economic control this time. The accusation of economic irresponsibility would not be levelled at the fortress Brown built. He started as he has gone on; bold, secure, surprising and quietly, as redistributive as he is re-energising. And as for Tony Blair - it was SHAZAM! It must have been impossible for anyone not to be made giddy by the adulation which cascaded over him. But he seemed to not only to weather it, but ride it, to use the unnerving popularity in order to proselytise ideas and objectives clearly and passionately. There was, and is, his desire that Britain get rid of all that constricted it from an overprivileged, underambitious, overcomplacent, underanalytical, suffocating and incompetent past and blaze into the present with a stake in the real global future. And he wanted what so many people in this country wanted. He wanted it quickly and across the waterfront. So the first six months, even the first year and even the first two years, went by relatively unclouded for Labour. Then things went wrong, but that was not the heart of it. It was not only the right-wing panic that he might win and win again but the clash between the two forces that emerged at the beginning of May 1997 - 'Great Expectations' collided with 'Look Back in Anger'. This brought on the rumblings; this, and errors and mistakes, predictable in any government, especially a new government. Yet, it is important to put it into perspective. The popularity of Tony Blair and the Labour Party today is stronger than that of any other, at this time in the Government's term, since polling began. That is what also annoys some of the critics. Begin on Dome's Day - the inept arrangements, the effect on various newspaper editors frustrated by amateurism, a feeling of disappointment about its contents, and a general air of embarrassment that, despite promises, we had had no world role on New Year's Eve, no river of fire, no turning wheel, no splendour at the Dome. Warning shots had been coming throughout 1999. The outbreak of flu tested the NHS, doctors announced crises, newspapers identified crises, and indeed there were crises. No amount of accurate counter-talk about targets being met could allay a growing anxiety that the treasured NHS was not in the shape it should be. Transport was already in a jam and it seemed to get worse as the vision of millions of cars on an inadequate road system and run-down, even dangerous, train services produced a nightmare which John Prescott longs to be rid of, though he knows it will take years. That these were deep problems which came from two decades of neglect and mismanagement was suddenly irrelevant. Two years on and everything had not been transformed? Where was the magic wand? Where were the stars? Tony Blair was arguably surfing exhaustion. Kosovo and Northern Ireland sucked energy and attention when the domestic round needed concentration. One felt he was so passionate about moving the country forward, so anxious to rid the country of moribund practices which would wither it on the twenty-first-century vine, that he had to be everywhere all of the time, whatever it took out of him. Gordon Brown, meanwhile, rearranged the economy, well fitted for the long-term, well enough pleased with a quiet revolution. The two stars were still up there but around them seemed more consternation than constellation. Or so some of the press would have it. There was a running battle it seemed between the spin doctors of Number 10 and the spin doctors of the Street of Shame. The one group was trying to get the story right, the other trying to get the right story. They clashed. But what might have been an entertaining spat became bitter, as it does when people believe they are being misrepresented. Yet it is far better that the press flail the Government than fawn on it. Perhaps that is one of the two cheers for democracy. And, in this case, with such an enfeebled Opposition, the press can justifiably claim that it fills a vacuum. Moreover, there were issues that incited challenges. Asylum is rightly emotive and the handling of asylum seekers was heavily criticised. The trial-by-jury issue moved from modernising a legal system needing a thorough overhaul to a matter of principle in which it seemed that the whole of trial by jury was being undermined. The Alun Michael d\u00e9bcle and errors surrounding Livingstone proved excellent sticks for beating the Government. The accusation 'control freak' struck and stuck and the Millbank machine, so recently applauded, was derided as a cross between the Inquisition and Tammany Hall. Those, like myself, who argue that Blair's determination to cohere disparate departments and Ministers of uneven talent was necessary, were swept aside. One person's leader is another's control freak. It is true that there is an evangelical trait which can characterise Tony Blair's more public speeches. His Christianity is close to the surface and it is not a colouring for all tastes. That he is not like that in private, and that political public passions are suspect in our sceptic isle, does not wash with those whose motto when faced by politicians is: 'Who are you to tell me what to do?' The more you mean it, the worse it seems. And there is the sniping about his lack of liking for the old cloth-cap Labour Party. There is no evidence for this on a personal level but, yes, he wanted the Labour Party to cast off the cloth cap and all the fatalism and failure screwed down under it. He came in to the party when it was fouled up and all but sunk and the unions bore a good share of blame for that. He wanted rid of all that and he was right. Blair likes the Labour Party enough to slog himself silly to make it change and succeed - and succeed for the whole country. And that is yet another jibe. Thatcher was a great cheerleader for her side, they say, but Blair is overenamoured of the whole nation. Why is he not out there waving his sabre more often on single issues? Did we hear him loud and clear on Section 28? Well, he certainly wants it repealed and will try again. But there is a point here. Tony Blair has a grasp of what the whole country could do if it got itself together. He is an old-fashioned patriot and one nation to the core. That exacts compromises. But it's how he is. It has served him, and us, well. But he has become the prey. Columnists outdo each other with adjectives of scorn, derision and malice, seizing on the opportunity of bringing out the old knocking copy, which is so much more fun to write and often so much more fun to read. But to isolate particular targets does not invalidate the whole, broad battle plan. Casualties are expected but if the objective is clear and a good one - as Labour's is - then you keep going. Something else is going on. Despite the attacks, the British public insists on preferring Labour above all other par ties. More importantly, there is a track record out there. It may not satisfy those in the Labour Party who are genuinely addicted to Opposition and feel lonely without it. It will not satisfy that gaggle of luvvies who came for cocktails back then and predictably turned into pumpkins after midnight. But what is currently being done by the Labour Party will help an enormous number of people. I will keep it snappy. Would the Tories have given record increases in child benefits - the biggest ever from which seven million mothers and 12 million children will gain? Would the Tories have set up the Working Families Tax Credit to provide a guaranteed minimum of \u00a3200 per week for families with one adult in full-time work? Would the Tories have introduced the first national minimum wage, benefiting two million people, or equal rights to six million workers who never had them before, or paid holidays to two-and-a-half million who never enjoyed them before, and extra maternity leave to nearly four million women? On human rights, a good start has been made, as it has on tackling racism, and education, the NHS and the arts and sciences. There is a great deal more to be done but would the Tories even have begun? I doubt it. Devolution is proving bumpy and difficult. So what? It is part of the biggest institutional change in a century and there are teething problems. What did anyone expect? Everyone who has run anything knows innovation can be a bastard. However much we want it, when it comes there are those who resist it, fight it, fumble it, misrepresent it, mess up on it, or are frightened of it. As I write, the mayoral battle in London is a mess. I wish we had had one person, one vote. I wish Gordon Brown would be more open about the subtle redistribution he is engineering while at the same time steering the economy through its longest period of success for decades. I wish things were calmer all across the waterfront so that Labour leaders did not have to be so stretched. I sometimes worry about the effect that this ceaseless hammering on his mannerisms, his style, his speeches, his character and his ideas, must be having on Tony Blair. But he came through the adulation and no doubt will be unimpaired by this period in the stocks. There is still part of me that is disappointed that the May morning did not change the world utterly and immediately. It is a childish and a foolish part, suckled on youthful idealism and long years of helplessness while watching the country being abused. It belongs to that bit of me that wants perfection without paying the price. I repeat that Labour's achievements already far, far outweigh its failings. I think the achievements will multiply.

The 'post-conviction review' office was shut down.</p> <p>Bush, in his autobiography A Charge to Keep, acknowledges that 'the worst nightmare of a death penalty supporter and of everyone who believes in our criminal justice system is to execute an innocent man'.</p> <p>He has, therefore, called the last hurdle before execution - the clemency process - the 'fail safe'. Nine states, including Texas, allow a governor to grant a pardon or reprieve if it has been recommended by a clemency board - before which Beets's appeal was pending until last Wednesday, when it was turned down. The fact that he had no recommendation from the board was his constitutional get-out.</p> <p>Having appointed all 18 of its members personally, Bush has written that he has 'full confidence' in the board, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. But The Observer has found withering criticism of the board's review process.</p> <p>In December 1998, US District Judge Sam Sparks heard a civil action against the board brought by two death row inmates. 'It seems incredible to me,' said Justice Sparks, 'that in 70-plus cases in an 18-member board, no person had ever seen an application for clemency important enough to hold a hearing.'</p> <p>How many wrongful deaths does it take before a state governor realises that his system is fatally flawed? The answer in Illinois was 13 - dead men subsequently proved innocent since the state reintroduced the death penalty in 1977.</p> <p>The conservative Republican governor, George Ryan, declared an indefinite moratorium, halting all executions in his state after reaching the conclusion that the system was 'fraught with error'. Illinois's doomed convicts drew national attention after diligent journalism students at Northwestern University in Chicago, under a crusading professor, Lawrence Marshall, proved the innocence of five men on Ryan's death row.</p> <p>Bush scoffed at his Republican colleague's moratorium, apparently without calculating that Ryan's support will be crucial at the 'Super Tuesday' primary election in populous Illinois, vulnerable to John McCain. 'Everybody who's been executed in Texas,' said Bush, 'is guilty of the crime of which they've been convicted.' But, retorted Ryan in a stinging accusation last week, 'Texas is worse, I'm sure, in convicting innocent people, and it's worse in not giving people who are innocent the opportunity to prove it.'</p> <p>Bush is by no means alone among the array of candidates in supporting the death penalty. McCain is an enthusiast, so is Al Gore.</p> <p>But for the first time since the death penalty was re-introduced in 1976, the American people are not so sure. A sizeable minority - the biggest ever recorded - of 40 per cent of Americans now favour life without parole as an alternative to execution.</p> <p>The sentiments of the movie Hurricane about the life sentence successfully fought by the innocent boxer Rubin Carter, and the spate of Benetton ads that have invoked the wrath of some state authorities, have implanted themselves in the culture for a reason. Demonstrations outside prisons when executions take place are bigger and more vocal than ever. 'It looks like there's light at the end of the tunnel,' says Lorry Post, a 67-year-old leader of the anti-death penalty movement from Florida. 'Seems like we're getting our best chance in a long time.'</p>",

Bush, who wants to be the next President, vetoed it. Not that the governor had simply let the system lurch on unaided; in 1995 he championed and signed legislation to limit appeals by death row prisoners, and to quicken the conveyor belt to death by shortening the time between conviction and execution. The 'post-conviction review' office was shut down. Bush, in his autobiography A Charge to Keep, acknowledges that 'the worst nightmare of a death penalty supporter and of everyone who believes in our criminal justice system is to execute an innocent man'. He has, therefore, called the last hurdle before execution - the clemency process - the 'fail safe'. Nine states, including Texas, allow a governor to grant a pardon or reprieve if it has been recommended by a clemency board - before which Beets's appeal was pending until last Wednesday, when it was turned down. The fact that he had no recommendation from the board was his constitutional get-out. Having appointed all 18 of its members personally, Bush has written that he has 'full confidence' in the board, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles. But The Observer has found withering criticism of the board's review process. In December 1998, US District Judge Sam Sparks heard a civil action against the board brought by two death row inmates. 'It seems incredible to me,' said Justice Sparks, 'that in 70-plus cases in an 18-member board, no person had ever seen an application for clemency important enough to hold a hearing.' How many wrongful deaths does it take before a state governor realises that his system is fatally flawed? The answer in Illinois was 13 - dead men subsequently proved innocent since the state reintroduced the death penalty in 1977. The conservative Republican governor, George Ryan, declared an indefinite moratorium, halting all executions in his state after reaching the conclusion that the system was 'fraught with error'. Illinois's doomed convicts drew national attention after diligent journalism students at Northwestern University in Chicago, under a crusading professor, Lawrence Marshall, proved the innocence of five men on Ryan's death row. Bush scoffed at his Republican colleague's moratorium, apparently without calculating that Ryan's support will be crucial at the 'Super Tuesday' primary election in populous Illinois, vulnerable to John McCain. 'Everybody who's been executed in Texas,' said Bush, 'is guilty of the crime of which they've been convicted.' But, retorted Ryan in a stinging accusation last week, 'Texas is worse, I'm sure, in convicting innocent people, and it's worse in not giving people who are innocent the opportunity to prove it.' Bush is by no means alone among the array of candidates in supporting the death penalty. McCain is an enthusiast, so is Al Gore. But for the first time since the death penalty was re-introduced in 1976, the American people are not so sure. A sizeable minority - the biggest ever recorded - of 40 per cent of Americans now favour life without parole as an alternative to execution. The sentiments of the movie Hurricane about the life sentence successfully fought by the innocent boxer Rubin Carter, and the spate of Benetton ads that have invoked the wrath of some state authorities, have implanted themselves in the culture for a reason. Demonstrations outside prisons when executions take place are bigger and more vocal than ever. 'It looks like there's light at the end of the tunnel,' says Lorry Post, a 67-year-old leader of the anti-death penalty movement from Florida. 'Seems like we're getting our best chance in a long time.'",

He is repeatedly approached in the street by voters urging him to run.</p> <p>Last week, staff on a government campaign bus urging London voters to register said that despite their officially neutral stance, they found scores of voters - mostly young - who volunteered that they only want to vote for Livingstone.</p> <p>But if the pressure on Livingstone to run is enormous, so is the pressure on him to back Dobson. Bill Morris, head of the giant TGWU transport union, which backed Livingstone, has offered to broker a deal, but Livingstone turned it down.

Even MPs who sympathise with his position, such as Diane Abbott, Jeremy Corbyn and former GLC deputy leader John McDonnell, have warned that he should not run against an official Labour candidate.</p> <p>Speaking to The Observer, Dobson was conciliatory about the man he narrowly beat in the candidacy race: 'I can see why Ken is bitterly disappointed. I would have been if I had lost, and he has been campaigning a lot longer than I have. I do hope he will now get behind me both in the election and following the election.</p> <p>'In the past dozen or so years, Ken has not been making the contribution he might have made and it has been a loss to the party.'</p> <p>Dobson is now assembling a team to work with him in an office away from Labour's official headquarters.</p> <p>He vowed: 'It's going to be an absolutely prat-free zone.'</p>",

Unless there is a sensational U-turn either from the Government or from Dobson, Livingstone is likely to declare his candidacy on Wednesday or Thursday, when he will appear before a live audience on BBC1's Question Time . He said: 'I am deluged with letters, e-mails and messages saying run, but close friends and family are saying don't. In fact, the closer you get to me, the more reluctant people are for me to run - I think mainly because it will be just about the filthiest campaign you have ever seen and they don't want me to go through all that.' He added that a decision was likely 'by the end of the week'. Livingstone will use the meeting to urge Prescott to drop his plans for a partial privatisation of the London Underground, the biggest single issue dividing him from the Government. He will also ask him to try to persuade Dobson to stand down. But the Deputy Prime Minister is likely to turn down both requests. Dobson has laughed off suggestions that he should quit, and a spokesman said: 'There is very little likelihood of John Prescott changing his mind on public-private partner ship when he has been working on it for years.' As a compromise, Prescott is expected to offer to consult Livingstone on how to finance other plans for improving London transport. Despite rumours of a government job for Livingstone, it is unlikely that any will be offered, or that he would accept it. One close ally said: 'There's been no offer so far, and being in a junior job in the Government isn't the same as running London. ' The Livingstone camp is also waiting to see what hap pens in the House of Lords on Tuesday, in the wake of a government defeat on the Bill to allow the 4 May election to go ahead. Opposition peers combined in a protest against the Government's refusal to give candidates a free mailshot to all five million London voters. Ministers are expected to strike a compromise this week, but some Livingstone supporters fear they will allow themselves to be defeated again so that the election has to be postponed, averting the risk of a Livingstone victory. Livingstone has been buoyed by private focus group research conducted by Mori earlier this month, which indicates that he is currently riding a wave of popularity unmatched by any politician except Tony Blair at his height three years ago. His e-mail, pager and mobile phone are clogged with messages he has not had time to answer. He is repeatedly approached in the street by voters urging him to run. Last week, staff on a government campaign bus urging London voters to register said that despite their officially neutral stance, they found scores of voters - mostly young - who volunteered that they only want to vote for Livingstone. But if the pressure on Livingstone to run is enormous, so is the pressure on him to back Dobson. Bill Morris, head of the giant TGWU transport union, which backed Livingstone, has offered to broker a deal, but Livingstone turned it down. He said: 'At the moment, I'm talking about the proposed privatisation of the Tube. I can't talk to Bill Morris about it. He's not the government.' Other warnings have come from his constituency party in Brent East and from Labour MPs such as John Cryer and John Austin, who voted for Livingstone. Even MPs who sympathise with his position, such as Diane Abbott, Jeremy Corbyn and former GLC deputy leader John McDonnell, have warned that he should not run against an official Labour candidate. Speaking to The Observer, Dobson was conciliatory about the man he narrowly beat in the candidacy race: 'I can see why Ken is bitterly disappointed. I would have been if I had lost, and he has been campaigning a lot longer than I have. I do hope he will now get behind me both in the election and following the election. 'In the past dozen or so years, Ken has not been making the contribution he might have made and it has been a loss to the party.' Dobson is now assembling a team to work with him in an office away from Labour's official headquarters. He vowed: 'It's going to be an absolutely prat-free zone.'",

Quite a few of the sinister Blair clones it highlights (Helena Kennedy, Alan McGee, the Gallaghers, John Mortimer) are currently in full, or partial, but certainly vocal, revolt. Other names are simply ludicrous: the idea that the BBC's Kate Adie has somehow been suborned because she is on the board of Imperial War Museum, or that Howard Davies of the Financial Services Agency has been corrupted by the juicy bauble of serving on the Welsh Transport Advisory Group Task Force is ... well, words fail me.</p> <p>Had he been less shrill, the CPS's Martin McElwee might have scored, however. For there is no doubt that there is an attempt to recreate something of the public culture that Annan represented. No government in the narrow sense of a certain number of Ministers can hope to change a country. Any political movement needs its wider support, its propagandists, chairmen, commission members, local advocates and eggheads. Really big movements, like the liberal movement of the second half of the twentieth century, sweep up most of a generation.</p> <p>Lord Annan's best book, Our Age, describes just that. Amazingly, Annan thought he knew the people who mattered in postwar Britain and set out to describe them. And amazingly, he was right. His book deals with the people who shaped postwar Britain, the politicians, industrialists, philosophers, poets, educationalists, spies, scientists, painters ... most of them people he'd met. Annan's Britain was like an extended, self-obsessed family, a country run by 'chaps like us' down from Oxbridge. This family, with its black sheep, dissidents and all, was broadly progressive, patriotic and pro-European. One can understand the anger and dismay of anyone on the Right who thinks it is back in business. And the CPS report, for all its flaws, describes a world with obvious similarities to the progressive elite of the Sixties and beyond. There is a tight group of people around government who know one another very well and are often related by marriage or divorce.</p> <p>You can go to a New Labour bash and feel yourself surrounded by most of the people running the big corporations, the authors who help shape public opinion, the key broadcasters - 'Our Age, part 2'. Many of the rich people there would indeed have given money to New Labour before the election. Some were rewarded, either with peerages (Tony Blair is creating life peers at three times the rate of Margaret Thatcher) or horrifyingly dull, unpaid committee posts.</p> <p>Ah, you may say, but they aren't from the old Oxbridge mafia. Hmm! The CPS report helpfully lists the background of special advisers at Number 10.

What's changed is the country around them, the state's lack of self-confidence, the privatised system of power. During the key decades of Annan's influence, there was an inner public order, a British political cosmos which was secure, even during national retreat.

There was a core, shared belief in social and intellectual progress; those who challenged it were, in Annan's book, 'the heretics'.

      "body": "<p>Teachers must be spending this weekend practising before the mirror for their new role as marriage promoters. The bishops and Baroness Young brigade may have finally agreed to scrap Section 28 - but they've won a couple of major concessions along the way, including, it would seem, legally binding teachers to promote heterosexual marriage 'as the fundamental building block of family life'.</p> <p>What this promotion will involve, remains unclear: somehow, I don't think there will be many educators eager to lecture on their personal experience of married bliss; diagrams at the chalkface would quickly sink into pornography, and efforts at role play into farce. Conscious of the pitfalls ahead, teachers across Britain must be turning photos of Cardinal Thomas Winning into makeshift dartboards. For it is the Scottish cleric who first ignited the unholy row over Section 28 - turning what New Labour regarded as an uncontroversial amendment into a causus belli for the outraged in Tunbridge Wells.</p> <p>The military image is apt: Winning has proved himself a tireless fighter and clever campaigner. His uncompromising stand has Dewar's footsoldiers in a flap; for they've come to suspect that the cardinal sees Section 28 not as an isolated skirmish but as the first salvo in a culture war that will pit progressive against conservative.</p> <p>South of the border, we should beware of complacency. Winning's battle will not be confined to Scotland or schools, but will soon engulf us all. And liberals beware: the outcome is not as certain as the woolly Hampstead flock would have you think.</p> <p>For decades, progressives have had an easy time. The world - or the interesting bits of it, like the BBC and luvvydom and a youthful, popular new government - belonged to them. The enemies - church, Crown and county - were declining in numbers, their institutions rent, their popularity flagging.</p> <p>As the new government grew older, though, the battle lines became blurred: no one seemed to be fighting under the traditional banners any longer. Once you could tell a conservative, as James Davison Hunter observed in his Culture Wars, by the way he or she defined freedom economically - as individual economic initiative; while for a liberal, it was justice that was defined, economically, as equity. Under New Labour, though, this old distinction was extinguished: individual initiative was championed, equity or redistribution ignored. Liberals, it seemed, had adopted the conservative agenda.</p> <p>But it would have been premature to call this a truce. Conservatives still defined justice socially, as righteous lifestyle - which did not necessarily entail adhering to any religion, but meant the espousal of conventional mores; while for liberals, it was freedom that should be defined socially, as individual rights - ranging from whom to bed to what to read. The two world views collided over Section 28.</p> <p>The conservatives were ready and waiting: all they had needed was a cause - and a generalissimo with fire in his belly and roaring conviction, to regroup and recharge, and prove that though they were diminished, they were not dead.</p> <p>Why did a man in skirts take the initiative from those whom we could expect to lead the opposition? Where were wee Willy Hague and his Spanish shadow, Michael Portillo? Given his confessions about his past homosexual experiences, Section 28 may not have seemed the perfect platform for Portillo to pontificate on; Hague's own absence from the fray - until late in the day, when the Daily Mail forced his back to the wall - seems yet another miscalculation, another missed opportunity which the Tories will blame upon their leader.</p> <p>And yet, the Tories were not alone in overlooking the potential rallying cause that was Section 28. New Labour - at Westminster and Edinburgh both - seemed blissfully unaware of the minefield their ace social affairs Minister, Wendy Alexander, had wandered into when she agitated to remove the Section. That both parties should have so misinterpreted public mood on this subject bore further testimony to what many had begun to suspect: increasingly, the politicians were dislocated from their electorate, unaware of what made voters tick. In the hallowed halls of Westminster and Holyrood, no elected representative seemed to have understood the fury that some parents felt against those who dared teach their children about homosexuality. Suddenly, an unlikely Scottish duo - a Catholic cardinal and a Protestant fundamentalist entrepreneur (in the person of Brian Souter, whose millions funded the Keep Section 28 campaign in Scotland) - were more in tune with Middle England than the representatives they had elected.</p> <p>If politicians were completely unprepared for the vehemence of public reaction to the proposed amendment, Winning was not. Indeed, he seemed to have been rehearsing the generalissimo's role for some time. He first hijacked headlines two years ago, with a bold initiative to help care for the babies of those women under pressure to have an abortion. Pro-lifers were delighted and even pro-choice groups had to concede that here at last was a cleric prepared to put his money (or Peter's pence) where his mouth was. The cardinal milked the pastoral exercise for political clout; he called on Catholics to turn their backs on Labour at the elections because of the party's position on abortion. He lost Labour votes, and won himself a high profile.</p> <p>Wading into the abortion debate was a risky move for a public figure, even a clerical one. In the US, after all, the issue has proved a powder keg of prejudice, with pro-lifers bombing abortion clinics and turning doctors (and, in one gruesome incident, a receptionist) into martyrs. Until now, the row has lost most of its poison in the trans-Atlantic crossing; yet for how much longer? The vehemence with which homophobes and gays have gone at each other's throats over Section 28 (remember Winning's words about the bombers in Second World War, and the allegations that he was comparing gay activists to Nazis?) should dispel all rosy notions of a civilised Britain untouched by uncouth fundamentalism.</p> <p>As Winning has shown, there are many among the forces of conservatism who are spoiling for a fight. They burn to re-establish the old moral certainties - men and women differ in the roles they fill, not just in their biological makeup; marriage provides the only legitimate context for sex; the nuclear family is the only family structure we should recognise.</p> <p>The blueprint of this ancien regime has been readily available in the pages of the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph for some time; Winning's Section 28 campaign has ensured the momentum to turn that blueprint into reality. His unapologetic stance, and the widespread support it has won him north and south of the border, have forced the Tories to embrace his cause; New Labour on the defensive; and even his fellow Churchmen - the mild mannered Cormac Murphy O'Connor, the new leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales; and George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who has made a career of titubation - to declare their (conservative) colours.</p> <p>As they gird their loins for battle, conservatives realise there is no time like the present: they recognise that at the helm of the liberal establishment is an ideological lightweight whose insubstantial take on life is no match for a man of steely principle. In their eyes, Tony Blair's premiership lends itself beautifully to manipulation by the champions of their traditionalist cause - whether they be tabloids or clerics.</p> <p>Scenting victory, the Winning team is casting around for more issues that will test Mr Blair and find him wanting. And there are plenty that offer scope for this. Even the seemingly innocuous report on equal pay will do: embedded in the talk of Mrs High Skill and Mrs Low Skill lies the issue of authority within the family. Should it rest with the paterfamilias or with both Mum and Dad, on egalitarian principles? For those baying for blood, the pedestrian prose of the Women's Unit study covers a veritable pandora's box of potential feuds: the battle of the sexes, children's rights, planned parenthood and who knows what other hand grenade could be lobbed into the highly combustible arena?</p> <p>The cultural landscape will no longer be a green and pleasant land where the great and good engage in polite if public tiffs over a censored film or violence on the box. In the wake of Section 28, conservatives and liberals are once again manning the barricades, ready to fight dirty over principles that the politicians thought buried - but the people had never forgotten.</p> <p>'The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity', wrote WB Yeats. Perhaps. But in politics, as in life, the best man does not always win.</p> <p>\u0095 Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman. Nick Cohen is on holiday</p>",

      "bodyText": "Teachers must be spending this weekend practising before the mirror for their new role as marriage promoters. The bishops and Baroness Young brigade may have finally agreed to scrap Section 28 - but they've won a couple of major concessions along the way, including, it would seem, legally binding teachers to promote heterosexual marriage 'as the fundamental building block of family life'. What this promotion will involve, remains unclear: somehow, I don't think there will be many educators eager to lecture on their personal experience of married bliss; diagrams at the chalkface would quickly sink into pornography, and efforts at role play into farce. Conscious of the pitfalls ahead, teachers across Britain must be turning photos of Cardinal Thomas Winning into makeshift dartboards. For it is the Scottish cleric who first ignited the unholy row over Section 28 - turning what New Labour regarded as an uncontroversial amendment into a causus belli for the outraged in Tunbridge Wells. The military image is apt: Winning has proved himself a tireless fighter and clever campaigner. His uncompromising stand has Dewar's footsoldiers in a flap; for they've come to suspect that the cardinal sees Section 28 not as an isolated skirmish but as the first salvo in a culture war that will pit progressive against conservative. South of the border, we should beware of complacency. Winning's battle will not be confined to Scotland or schools, but will soon engulf us all. And liberals beware: the outcome is not as certain as the woolly Hampstead flock would have you think. For decades, progressives have had an easy time. The world - or the interesting bits of it, like the BBC and luvvydom and a youthful, popular new government - belonged to them. The enemies - church, Crown and county - were declining in numbers, their institutions rent, their popularity flagging. As the new government grew older, though, the battle lines became blurred: no one seemed to be fighting under the traditional banners any longer. Once you could tell a conservative, as James Davison Hunter observed in his Culture Wars, by the way he or she defined freedom economically - as individual economic initiative; while for a liberal, it was justice that was defined, economically, as equity. Under New Labour, though, this old distinction was extinguished: individual initiative was championed, equity or redistribution ignored. Liberals, it seemed, had adopted the conservative agenda. But it would have been premature to call this a truce. Conservatives still defined justice socially, as righteous lifestyle - which did not necessarily entail adhering to any religion, but meant the espousal of conventional mores; while for liberals, it was freedom that should be defined socially, as individual rights - ranging from whom to bed to what to read. The two world views collided over Section 28. The conservatives were ready and waiting: all they had needed was a cause - and a generalissimo with fire in his belly and roaring conviction, to regroup and recharge, and prove that though they were diminished, they were not dead. Why did a man in skirts take the initiative from those whom we could expect to lead the opposition? Where were wee Willy Hague and his Spanish shadow, Michael Portillo? Given his confessions about his past homosexual experiences, Section 28 may not have seemed the perfect platform for Portillo to pontificate on; Hague's own absence from the fray - until late in the day, when the Daily Mail forced his back to the wall - seems yet another miscalculation, another missed opportunity which the Tories will blame upon their leader. And yet, the Tories were not alone in overlooking the potential rallying cause that was Section 28. New Labour - at Westminster and Edinburgh both - seemed blissfully unaware of the minefield their ace social affairs Minister, Wendy Alexander, had wandered into when she agitated to remove the Section. That both parties should have so misinterpreted public mood on this subject bore further testimony to what many had begun to suspect: increasingly, the politicians were dislocated from their electorate, unaware of what made voters tick. In the hallowed halls of Westminster and Holyrood, no elected representative seemed to have understood the fury that some parents felt against those who dared teach their children about homosexuality. Suddenly, an unlikely Scottish duo - a Catholic cardinal and a Protestant fundamentalist entrepreneur (in the person of Brian Souter, whose millions funded the Keep Section 28 campaign in Scotland) - were more in tune with Middle England than the representatives they had elected. If politicians were completely unprepared for the vehemence of public reaction to the proposed amendment, Winning was not. Indeed, he seemed to have been rehearsing the generalissimo's role for some time. He first hijacked headlines two years ago, with a bold initiative to help care for the babies of those women under pressure to have an abortion. Pro-lifers were delighted and even pro-choice groups had to concede that here at last was a cleric prepared to put his money (or Peter's pence) where his mouth was. The cardinal milked the pastoral exercise for political clout; he called on Catholics to turn their backs on Labour at the elections because of the party's position on abortion. He lost Labour votes, and won himself a high profile. Wading into the abortion debate was a risky move for a public figure, even a clerical one. In the US, after all, the issue has proved a powder keg of prejudice, with pro-lifers bombing abortion clinics and turning doctors (and, in one gruesome incident, a receptionist) into martyrs. Until now, the row has lost most of its poison in the trans-Atlantic crossing; yet for how much longer? The vehemence with which homophobes and gays have gone at each other's throats over Section 28 (remember Winning's words about the bombers in Second World War, and the allegations that he was comparing gay activists to Nazis?) should dispel all rosy notions of a civilised Britain untouched by uncouth fundamentalism. As Winning has shown, there are many among the forces of conservatism who are spoiling for a fight. They burn to re-establish the old moral certainties - men and women differ in the roles they fill, not just in their biological makeup; marriage provides the only legitimate context for sex; the nuclear family is the only family structure we should recognise. The blueprint of this ancien regime has been readily available in the pages of the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph for some time; Winning's Section 28 campaign has ensured the momentum to turn that blueprint into reality. His unapologetic stance, and the widespread support it has won him north and south of the border, have forced the Tories to embrace his cause; New Labour on the defensive; and even his fellow Churchmen - the mild mannered Cormac Murphy O'Connor, the new leader of the Catholic church in England and Wales; and George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who has made a career of titubation - to declare their (conservative) colours. As they gird their loins for battle, conservatives realise there is no time like the present: they recognise that at the helm of the liberal establishment is an ideological lightweight whose insubstantial take on life is no match for a man of steely principle. In their eyes, Tony Blair's premiership lends itself beautifully to manipulation by the champions of their traditionalist cause - whether they be tabloids or clerics. Scenting victory, the Winning team is casting around for more issues that will test Mr Blair and find him wanting. And there are plenty that offer scope for this. Even the seemingly innocuous report on equal pay will do: embedded in the talk of Mrs High Skill and Mrs Low Skill lies the issue of authority within the family. Should it rest with the paterfamilias or with both Mum and Dad, on egalitarian principles? For those baying for blood, the pedestrian prose of the Women's Unit study covers a veritable pandora's box of potential feuds: the battle of the sexes, children's rights, planned parenthood and who knows what other hand grenade could be lobbed into the highly combustible arena? The cultural landscape will no longer be a green and pleasant land where the great and good engage in polite if public tiffs over a censored film or violence on the box. In the wake of Section 28, conservatives and liberals are once again manning the barricades, ready to fight dirty over principles that the politicians thought buried - but the people had never forgotten. 'The best lack all conviction and the worst are full of passionate intensity', wrote WB Yeats. Perhaps. But in politics, as in life, the best man does not always win. \u0095 Cristina Odone is deputy editor of the New Statesman. Nick Cohen is on holiday",

In France, storms cause 90 fatalities, destroy 270 million trees and trigger \u00a37.5 billion worth of damage. In Austria, a series of avalanches sweeps 11 people to their deaths. And in the Arctic, scientists discover that over the past two decades the polar ice cap has thinned from a modest 10ft thickness to a flimsy 6ft. </p> <p>And that is just a brief selection of the environmental horrors that have beset the planet over the past few weeks, although it is enough to confirm meteorologists' worst fears. With wearied resignation, they are now admitting what was long suspected - that global warming must be accepted unambiguously as the trigger for increasingly unstable weather fronts, storms, melting glaciers and rising seas. </p> <p>The world is slowly sliding into climatic uncertainty - yet there is little sign that we are capable of taking action that can halt this descent into elemental catastrophe. </p> <p>'We can no longer say we are still unsure whether extreme weather events are caused by global warming or not,' says Dr Mike Hulme, of the Climate Research Unit at East Anglia University. 'When we look at the Mozambique floods, at the storms that hit France, at the absence of winter in Britain this year, at the avalanches in the Alps, we are witnessing events that are now clearly tainted by human actions.' </p> <p>Yet, as Hulme points out, even if mankind stopped pumping carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere tomorrow, we would have to wait a very long time to reap the benefits. It would take several hundred years to stop the world's oceans from rising, for example. </p> <p>'Even if we closed every factory in the world at mid night tonight, there would be enough carbon in the atmosphere to keep it warm for generations, and enough heat permeating through the oceans to keep sea levels rising for hundreds of years,' Hulme says. </p> <p>That is bad enough. But now, three years after the Kyoto environmental summit at which the leaders of the industrial nations hammered out meagre proposals for reducing industrial gas emissions by 5.2 per cent of 1990 levels by the year 2010 - the chance of mankind's willingness to reduce output by even a modest amount looks remote and unlikely. </p> <p>Some nations responded fairly well, of course - including relatively bad polluters like Britain, which was obliged to agree to a 12.5 per cent reduction. In fact, Tony Blair has decided to go further, and has pledged the country to a 20 per cent cut. Other European nations have been equally enthusiastic. </p> <p>The world could be slightly encouraged - were it not for one major blot on the political landscape. Although President Clinton signed the Kyoto Treaty, committing the United States - by far the biggest carbon dioxide polluter in the world - to reduce emissions by 7 per cent, Congress has simply refused to ratify the agreement or cut US carbon dioxide output by a single tonne. </p> <p>This failure can be traced to US experts who claimed that signing the Kyoto treaty would cost every American $2,000 a year in higher fuel bills, a line that was promoted with particular vigour by the Global Climate Coalition, an alliance of car manufacturers and oil companies, including Peabody Coal, the powerful Western Fuels Association and Exxon. </p> <p>The coalition's aim - as revealed in internal documents - has been to turn global warming from a 'fact' into a 'theory' in the minds of the American public. </p> <p>The origins of this extremely powerful, well-funded lobbying group predate Kyoto and can be traced to the days when George Bush Snr was President, a man who promised to 'counter the greenhouse effect with the White House effect' and then spurned the 1992 environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro. </p> <p>The election of Bill Clinton in November 1992 subsequently gave hope to reformers. 'This was the moment for the US to take the lead,' says author Mark Hertsgaard in his book Earth Odyssey, which he spent six years researching. 'We led the global economy, there was an economic boom, and we had a Vice-President who had just written that global warming was the greatest emergency facing the planet.' </p> <p>Unfortunately, the reformers, and the world, have been undone by a combination of factors: the election of a right-wing Republican Senate opposed to any attempt to curb Americans' right to have lives as wasteful and profligate as they like, the entrenchment of the global climate coalition, and - as Hertsgaard puts it - 'the long-time and deeply ingrained relationship between the Gore family and one of the industry's giants - Occidental Petroleum'. </p> <p>In this latter case, it was discovered that Vice-President Al Gore's father had invested in Occidental Petroleum, to the tune of $500,000 in stock. When Gore came to supervise the 'Reinventing Government' plan of 1995, he handed over a vast US Navy oil reserve at Elk Hills, California, to Occidental. The sale order was signed in 1997. </p> <p>'It was a windfall for Occidental,' says Hertsgaard, 'and it was sure a windfall for the stockholders. Anyone with stock in Occidental amassed a fortune.' </p> <p>The current impasse over Kyoto can be attributed to a number of factors, including 'the political influence of the fossil fuel industry and its friends in Congress, coupled with the inability of the Clinton Administration and its own personal entwinement in the corporations themselves', as Hertsgaard put it. </p> <p>The world's bid to reduce its headlong flight towards climate disruption, rising seas and drowned coastlines has been thwarted primarily by this depressing combination of effects. Just as it has done with moves to curb gun use, the US has stubbornly refused to accept what the rest of the world, and its own liberal politicians, have been saying: that it has to change its ways - drastically. </p> <p>However, this deeply depressing situation has been lightened by recent encouraging signs. The global climate coalition, the nemesis of environment campaigners, is beginning to show signs of instability. General Motors, Ford, Shell, Amoco and BP have recently quit the organisation, although others, such as Exxon and Mobil, remain. </p> <p>'These companies have watched the tide of public opinion change and moved far away from their entrenched position,' said Hulme. 'The future of car engine technology lies in the development of ways to reduce carbon and other emissions, and more and more of these companies are now accepting that this is inevitable.' </p> <p>Many experts predict that the family of someone killed in a storm or avalanche may soon follow the example of litigants against cigarette companies - and sue oil companies for pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. </p> <p>Intriguingly, Britain is currently on course to reach its Kyoto targets by 2010 but has had to do very little to achieve this goal. By switching from coal to gas burning, and by improving energy efficiency, we have cut emissions by several per cent, a trend further boosted by the fact we are now enjoying warmer and warmer winters - which, of course, are linked to our carbon dioxide output. This irony is not lost on scientists. </p> <p>However, to achieve its goal of a 20 per cent emissions cut Britain will soon have to take more direct action, and next year is expected to introduce a climate change levy on companies. Employers will be taxed according to the amount of energy they consume. How this cash is then distributed by the Treasury is still uncertain, however. </p> <p>One thought is to use the cash to offset National Insurance contributions, making it cheaper to employ people, but dearer to use electricity and gas. Alternatively, the money could fund research into solar, wind and wave energy devices that would then replace the gas, oil and coal plants which generate most of Britain's electricity. </p> <p>In other words, global warming, already an influence on British society, is going to touch our lives increasingly (see panel). 'We can take action to mitigate its effects, but we must also try to anticipate what is inevitably going to happen to our country,' said Dr Geoff Jenkins, of the Met Office's Hadley Centre. </p> <p>Bridge builders, architects, health services, lawyers, civil servants, biologists, doctors and many others will have to prepare for a future in which the climatic certainties of the past can no longer be taken for granted. </p> <p>This point is summed up by geographer Professor Nigel Arnell of Southampton University. 'We know the climate is going to change but we don't know specifically how or where,' he says. 'For the first time, the immediate past is not going to be a good guide to the immediate future, and we don't know what that future will be like.' </p> <p>However, no organisation or unit as yet exists to provide guidance. It is for this reason the Government is preparing to establish a climate change research centre at which engineers, social scientists, meteorologists and other scientists will attempt to identify the unavoidable changes that will soon sweep the country and devise ways to mitigate their effects. </p> <p>'We need to pool our resources and deploy them now as best we can,' said Hulme. 'We cannot stop global warming, but we can arm ourselves against it if we act promptly.'</p> <p><strong>How does it affect us?</strong></p> <p>Compared with many parts of the globe, Britain is likely to escape the worst effects of global warming over the next couple of decades - but it will still have to cope with a host of social, political and environmental headaches. For a start, rising sea levels will increase the danger of sea surges and flooding, particularly in low-lying areas around East Anglia and South-East England, where arid summers will also dry up water supplies. </p> <p>Other effects of global warming will be even odder. The type of tarmac used on our roads will have to be changed to stop it from melting in summer. Similarly, insect pests - like those already affecting some forestry plantations - may become serious nuisances: cold winters, which would normally have killed off most of them, will have become a thing of the past. Similarly cases of tick-borne illnesses, such as Lyme's disease, are expected to increase in the balmy conditions of coming decades. </p> <p>Other issues that will have to be tackled include the design of bridges and high buildings which are likely to be battered by the increasingly severe winds that will sweep over the nation. Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) - the nation's most precious habitats - will move and shift in the wake of environmental change, posing awkward problems for lawyers and biologists trying to protect plants and animals that have moved from their 'custody'. </p> <p>Even patterns of death will be affected. At present, local authorities face a major crisis every winter when they have to deal with a surge in deaths, mainly of the elderly killed by the cold and by flu. However, in future, it will be the searing heat of summers that will cause stress, fatal heat strokes and a jump in the nation's death charts - taking the winter burden off local councils, and delaying it until summer.</p>",

It was not until Robb's mother Anne visited the local police station that it became apparent that her son and another politically uninvolved teenager were the real victims. Up until this double killing the UVF in Mid-Ulster appeared to be winning the propaganda war against their former comrades turned deadly enemies. Jameson, a businessman who local loyalists claimed was the leader of the UVF in the region, was a popular figure in the Portadown area. His family denied allegations that he was the local UVF commander. His brothers, led by the eldest in the family, Bobby, began a street campaign against his LVF killers.

The RUC are monitoring the deteriorating situation in Portadown but do not expect a strike back by the LVF immediately.

The Internet service will coincide with the British release of W-registration cars on Wednesday. Prospective buyers will be able to have the model they want - identical to those bought on British forecourts - delivered to their door. The only difference will be the price. UK car dealers say the import scheme will compound a crisis of confidence in the industry that they predict will result in sales of the new W-reg vehicles slumping to 350,000 in March, compared with 370,000 this time last year. Consumers have been aware that they are being overcharged by up to 40 per cent since the European Union revealed that 62 of the 74 best-selling models cost more in Britain than anywhere else. But until now the difficulties of importing have meant there was little demand for cheaper motors from abroad. Now, amid reports that Pendragon, one of the biggest car dealer groups, is setting up its own Internet operation offering cut-price bargains, the Consumers' Association says that a secret three-month trial has revealed that, even with minimal effort, cars can be bought for thousands of pounds less. Under the latest scheme, called Carbusters, prospective buyers will be able to go to a website for an initial quote and then talk to a UK dealer to order a bespoke model and arrange home delivery - no ferry trip or haggling in a foreign language required.

The Virgin boss has attacked Camelot's profits and directors' earnings.</p> <p>Now, in retaliation, Camelot is to cut the 1p made on every lottery ticket sold to 0.5p.

      "bodyText": "Camelot, the National Lottery operator, will tomorrow take the extraordinary step of slashing its profit margin by half in a desperate attempt to retain the lucrative licence to run the game. Bids to run the lottery must be submitted by noon on Tuesday. Camelot, which last year made pre-tax profits of more than \u00a370 million, faces stiff competition from The People's Lottery group of Sir Richard Branson. The Virgin boss has attacked Camelot's profits and directors' earnings. Now, in retaliation, Camelot is to cut the 1p made on every lottery ticket sold to 0.5p. A spokeswoman for Camelot - a consortium made up of Cadbury Schweppes, printer De La Rue, computer firm ICL and electronics outfit Racal - hinted it had to cut its margin because of the strength of Branson's bid. In another move designed to shake off accusations of 'fat cat' greed, Camelot's directors are to have their bonuses trimmed.

      "body": "<p>More than three-quarters of a million children could be given drugs to control their behaviour - against their wishes and those of their parents. The spectre is raised by legislation planned by the Government to give more powers to psychiatrists.</p> <p>Mental health workers are warning that the new legislation is being drawn so widely that doctors will be given the right to drug children just because they have a difficulty with maths or spelling.</p> <p>The concern over the legislation follows alarming evidence that tens of thousands of schoolchildren with mild behaviour problems are being drugged with Ritalin - dubbed the 'chemical cosh' or 'kiddie crack' - simply in order to control them.</p> <p>In England, the number of prescriptions for the mind-drug Ritalin - which is given to so-called 'hyperactive' children to improve concentration - has shot up from just 3,500 in 1993 to 126,500 in 1998.</p> <p>The UK is rapidly following in the path of the US, where a report last week showed that three million children - one in every 30 - are now being given Ritalin. Children as young as two are being given mood-altering drugs, including anti-depressants.</p> <p>The new legislation will give far greater powers to psy chiatrists to give compulsory treatment in the community to both adults and children. A Green Paper on reform of the Mental Health Act proposes that doctors will be able to drug people, including child-ren, if they have 'any disability or disorder of the mind or brain, whether permanent or temporary, which results in an impairment of disturbance of mental functioning'.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the charity Young Minds said: 'Around 10 per cent of children have a diagnosable mental disorder. This is drawn so widely that it could cover a lot of children who have a learning disability. The implication for kids is considerable.'</p> <p>Under the present legisla tion, people can only be given treatment against their will if they show 'seriously irresponsible or abnormally aggressive behaviour'. However, the reformed legislation would do away with that safeguard.</p> <p>Margaret Pedler, head of policy development at the mental health charity Mind, said: 'The new Act gives compulsory powers in the community even for children. The definition is far too wide and could catch all sort of people who shouldn't be given compulsory treatment. It is a great concern.'</p> <p>The Government has followed the advice of an expert committee, chaired by Professor Genevra Richardson. But Dinah Morley, professional services manager of Young Minds, said: 'It's not impossible it could be used very widely on children against their wishes.'</p> <p>The drug is usually prescribed for children suffering from the highly controversial medical condition called Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), even though there is no agreement on what causes it, or even whether it really exists.</p> <p>Two years ago Dr Edward Hamlyn, a founding member of the Royal College of General Practitioners, described ADHD as 'a fraud intended to justify starting these children on a life of drug addiction'. Many medical experts believe that attention deficit or hyperactivity can simply be the result of glandular disorders, nutritional problems or even just tiredness, and so no mind-altering drugs such as Ritalin are required.</p> <p>The Green Paper, 'Reform of the Mental Health Act', is out for consultation until the end of March. Brian Daniels of the Citizen's Commission on Human Rights, a religious lobby group, said: 'The implications of the Green Paper as it stands are tantamount to social control. Well-meaning parents, teachers and politicians are being duped that \"normal\" childhood behaviour is no longer normal and that it is mental illness.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:anthony.browne@observer.co.uk\">anthony.browne@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "More than three-quarters of a million children could be given drugs to control their behaviour - against their wishes and those of their parents. The spectre is raised by legislation planned by the Government to give more powers to psychiatrists. Mental health workers are warning that the new legislation is being drawn so widely that doctors will be given the right to drug children just because they have a difficulty with maths or spelling. The concern over the legislation follows alarming evidence that tens of thousands of schoolchildren with mild behaviour problems are being drugged with Ritalin - dubbed the 'chemical cosh' or 'kiddie crack' - simply in order to control them. In England, the number of prescriptions for the mind-drug Ritalin - which is given to so-called 'hyperactive' children to improve concentration - has shot up from just 3,500 in 1993 to 126,500 in 1998. The UK is rapidly following in the path of the US, where a report last week showed that three million children - one in every 30 - are now being given Ritalin. Children as young as two are being given mood-altering drugs, including anti-depressants. The new legislation will give far greater powers to psy chiatrists to give compulsory treatment in the community to both adults and children. A Green Paper on reform of the Mental Health Act proposes that doctors will be able to drug people, including child-ren, if they have 'any disability or disorder of the mind or brain, whether permanent or temporary, which results in an impairment of disturbance of mental functioning'. A spokeswoman for the charity Young Minds said: 'Around 10 per cent of children have a diagnosable mental disorder. This is drawn so widely that it could cover a lot of children who have a learning disability. The implication for kids is considerable.' Under the present legisla tion, people can only be given treatment against their will if they show 'seriously irresponsible or abnormally aggressive behaviour'. However, the reformed legislation would do away with that safeguard. Margaret Pedler, head of policy development at the mental health charity Mind, said: 'The new Act gives compulsory powers in the community even for children. The definition is far too wide and could catch all sort of people who shouldn't be given compulsory treatment. It is a great concern.' The Government has followed the advice of an expert committee, chaired by Professor Genevra Richardson. But Dinah Morley, professional services manager of Young Minds, said: 'It's not impossible it could be used very widely on children against their wishes.' The drug is usually prescribed for children suffering from the highly controversial medical condition called Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), even though there is no agreement on what causes it, or even whether it really exists. Two years ago Dr Edward Hamlyn, a founding member of the Royal College of General Practitioners, described ADHD as 'a fraud intended to justify starting these children on a life of drug addiction'. Many medical experts believe that attention deficit or hyperactivity can simply be the result of glandular disorders, nutritional problems or even just tiredness, and so no mind-altering drugs such as Ritalin are required. The Green Paper, 'Reform of the Mental Health Act', is out for consultation until the end of March. Brian Daniels of the Citizen's Commission on Human Rights, a religious lobby group, said: 'The implications of the Green Paper as it stands are tantamount to social control. Well-meaning parents, teachers and politicians are being duped that \"normal\" childhood behaviour is no longer normal and that it is mental illness.' anthony.browne@observer.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Rosie Boycott has tried many lives for size. She's been the uncomfortable St Trinian at Cheltenham Ladies' College, nicknamed 'Oozy Rosie' when she tried to buy friends with sweets; an unhappy hippy chick on a motorbike, chasing nirvana in Nepal; a prototype lipstick feminist, the founder of Spare Rib; a dope dealer in St Tropez, hiding her drugs in her knickers; an anonymous alcoholic, drying out before drying out became fashionable; a confessional journalist; a fitness guru; a bonkbuster novelist; a single mother about town; and the first female editor of a national daily newspaper. 'It took me a long, long time to discover,' she says now, in her Joyce-Grenfell-as-chainsmoker voice, 'that I get the biggest kick out of things like gardening and making cushions.'</p> <p>It is almost two years since Boycott ended her short, painful tenure as editor of the Independent and took over at the Daily Express, a move, it was said at the time, akin to baling out of the Lusitania in order to clamber aboard the Titanic. She was given the brief, from her new proprietor Labour peer Lord Hollick, to transform the littlest of Little England papers into the generous tabloid voice of the new millennium. 'Not long after I arrived,' she recalls, 'I was given a pile of press cuttings about the paper's recent history. We've had 17 editors since 1973, each one promising a new era. It's staggering that we have any readers left at all.'</p> <p>In its golden age, Lord Beaverbrook's self-styled crusading newspaper was a national monument (and, to a certain extent, after Evelyn Waugh's Scoop, a favourite national joke). The paper celebrates its centenary in April and Boycott is organising a series of features which look back to the days when it gave away free life insurance to its readers, and stood up for causes (many of them lost), rather than to its recent crimped and curmudgeonly Thatcherite era lived in the shadow of the Mail. 'We want to stress that original human face,' she asserts in her best marketing voice.</p> <p>Boycott has her own odd experience of this old-style human face. Her first husband, David Leitch, the writer, was given up for adoption in 1937 in a classified ad on the front page of the Express. She snorts a little laugh at the fact. 'It said, \"Baby available, Sunday afternoon, Bloomsbury Hotel\". His whole experience of life has been coloured by the question, \"What would have happened had my parents read the Times ?\"'</p> <p>Arthur Christiansen, the legendary Express editor of the Fifties, used to say that he edited the paper for the man on the promenade at Rhyl. If Boycott has an ideal reader, you guess it might be the kind of middle-England woman who asks you to sponsor her in a charity half-marathon and cites 'When I am an old woman, I shall wear purple' as her favourite poem. Boycott likes the notion of her paper - and herself - as possessing 'gutsiness'.</p> <p>Presumably, with this idea in mind, she organises lunches where she ushers parties of female readers into a dining room with Tessa Jowell or Margaret Jay. She talks excitedly of a journey she made to the Sudan last month, following a famine appeal: 'We were flying around in this tiny little Russian plane, camping out in compounds, and we were told that the Express readers [who had raised \u00a3750,000] were the biggest single donors to that cause in the entire world. And you think, \" Shit! \" and you think, \" Fantastic!' \"</p> <p>Boycott has a reputation for being selective in her loyalties, but if you can catch her attention she has, by most accounts, an obsessive enthusiasm. Looking back on her own other lives, she believes that her overriding impulse has 'always been a need to try things'. If she has a role model, it is the war reporter Martha Gellhorn, a picture of whom takes pride of place in her office with its panoramic view up the Thames.</p> <p>Boycott met Gellhorn in 1970, the year before she started Spare Rib, and they remained close until Gellhorn's death in 1998. 'Martha wasn't really into women's issues,' she says of the one-time Mrs Hemingway, 'because she was a woman who had always made it in a bloke's world on absolutely her own terms.' Boycott enjoys the idea of that. 'There's an element in women,' she believes, 'which makes them make excuses for themselves. They always think, \"I could do better were it not for so and so\". Martha was remarkable - unique - in that she had absolutely none of that.'</p> <p>Over the years, Boycott has not indulged herself with too many excuses either. In her memoir of the Seventies, A Nice Girl Like Me, she presented a frank portrait of her addictions before such revelations were vogueish. 'I had a strong feeling that no one would ever give me a job again,' she says. The book was an exercise in rehab. It described an out-of-control early adulthood in which Boycott moved from acid trips and the liberating launch of Spare Rib to drinking bottles of vodka before lunch and waking up with black eyes she could not remember receiving.</p> <p>In 1973, she fell disastrously in love with John Steinbeck Jnr and the pair went on an extended heroin and enlightenment binge in America and the Far East. They started off making love in waterfalls but by the end, she wrote: 'There was only one reason to touch - to look for unbutchered veins.' When she split from Steinbeck, after a spell in a Thai jail for dope smuggling, Boycott, for a long while, drank anything she could get her hands on. Her drinking worsened while her mother slowly died of cancer and she eventually checked herself into a clinic, and wrote her book. When it was published, the reviewer in the Telegraph was moved to offer a prayer for the future of the author and her recently born child, Daisy.</p> <p>Boycott was well able to save herself. Though she still thinks of herself as an addict, her weaknesses now are confined 'to eating and to ideas'. She doesn't, she says, 'mind being an alcoholic: It's not such a bad thing to know what is the instant route to your own destruction.'</p> <p>She emerged from her nadir, Jane Fonda-like, in the Eighties, writing an airport novel and an unlikely diet book. In 1992, she took over the editorship of Esquire and made it, for a while, the best written glossy magazine around, coaxing reportage from the likes of Rian Malan and Gellhorn. When she went to the Independent, it was with a reputation as an editor who cared about writing. Her year at Canary Wharf is best remembered for her visible 'Legalise cannabis' campaign which culminated in a march to Trafalgar Square where Boycott, in crisp white shirt and jeans, addressed a crowd of thousands and earned her Guardian diary sobriquet - Rizla Rosie. Her misjudgments were memorable, too, though. Most notably when, having hired her friend Will Self after he left this paper following a drugs incident on the Prime Minister's plane, she very publicly dumped him in a front-page exclusive when he refused to deny or confirm the original story. 'That was really hard,' she says now. 'That was one of the worst.'</p> <p>Surely she, of all people, could sympathise?</p> <p>'I've become an advocate of tough love where addiction is concerned,' she says, 'though I can't claim I did what I did to Will because I thought it was therapeutic. On the other hand, I didn't think it would make him more of a drug addict than he was.' (Self, never one to bury a hatchet, says of Boycott: 'Words cannot describe what I would like to do to her. Out-takes from a late Kurosawa film come to mind.')</p> <p>Her reign at the Express has not been without controversy, either. There have been consistent suggestions that the paper is too close to the Blair administration, in particular over its pro-European hysteria (Hollick is a leading pro-Europe activist), and in the media ruckus over the withdrawal of a job offer to the Mirror' s political editor Paul Routledge, apparently under pressure from Millbank. There was, too, Findusgate, when James Hughes-Onslow, a journalist Boycott had fired, exacted revenge by secreting a packet of fish fingers in her bathroom, having gained access to her house with an estate agent. The packet was discovered by a pest-control man, following his nose. Boycott had a sense-of-humour failure and threatened to sue.</p> <p>In her two years, though, colleagues suggest she has adapted well to the particular pressures of her (still dwindling) new audience. When she arrived at the Express, it was with much talk of bringing fine writing to a tabloid (she trumpeted the arrival of Andrew Marr, her ill-fated co-editor at the Independent, and the pocket-philosopher Alain de Botton). Two years on, the 'writers' she seems most enthused about are her new million-pound astrologer Jonathan Cainer and her recently assembled team of TV tie-ins: Alan Titchmarsh, Jane Asher, Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and Antony Worrall Thompson. 'They have 22 million viewers a week and they're all in this paper. So that's great. You want to share that with people.'</p> <p>I wonder if she misses working at the more literary end of things.</p> <p>'It's different,' she agrees, 'but you can still find yourself terrifically moved. I was in floods of tears recently over a piece by Alan Titchmarsh about Nelson Mandela's garden.'</p> <p>Green-fingered prose is one of the few things Boycott has to cry about these days. She admits to being happier than she's ever been, at 49, since her marriage last year to barrister Charlie Howard. In a sense, this brought her life full circle. She had known Howard since she was 12, and he crops up in her book hitching a ride west with her in the Salt Lake desert. At 18, they went their separate ways and did not see each other for 28 years.</p> <p>It was George Carman QC, Neil Hamilton's inquisitor, who was the unlikely Pandarus. 'George came to lunch at the Independent and Charlie, who worked in the same chambers, told him to send me his love. George did more than that. He told me that Charlie needed cheering up because his mother had just died, and he just happened to mention that Charlie had been divorced for four years\u0085 so I called him. And we had this wonderful old-fashioned, six-month courtship.' She's now a passionate advocate of marriage. 'I've spent of a lot of time trying to shuffle my present in order to make an OK future,' she says, grinning to herself. 'I look forward to the future.'</p> <p>She sees that future at the Express for the coming few years, but is unworried by the current talk of mergers and takeovers; she could happily walk away. 'I want to make a garden and write a book, a follow-up to the last one about being a woman in the midst of all this newspaper madness, and about being a working single mum. I looked after Daisy on my own from when she was four until last year, when she was 15.'</p> <p>Reflecting on her former selves, she says that one of the virtues of living with a lawyer is that you discover that there is no point in 'what ifs'. And, she says: 'You can always try to pay back. My father is not well at the moment; I have him to stay, sort out his care arrangements. He knows that I did stop drinking in the end. I just wish my mother could have seen that. I sometimes hope she does.'</p> <p>Boycott clearly enjoys the symmetry of her new relationship. Her husband was with her when she began her adventures, and he's back with her now she has come through them. The adventures, she hopes, are by no means over, though. 'In a couple of years, our children will be gone. That would be the time when we might chuck it all in. We might just start a whole new life.' Part of Boycott clearly can't wait.</p>",

Instead, like Lady Berkeley and her upper-class chums, they would rather air their concerns with a well-aimed chocolate eclair and a spin doctor</p> <p>Her family gave its name to one of the most exclusive squares in Mayfair and her parents called her after the ancient queen of the Carthaginians. A grandmother of two, Lady Dido Berkeley is as respectable as they get. But her ladyship is also a full-time eco-warrior. She's installed phone lines, faxes and computers in her Fulham house, converting it into the headquarters of the campaign group Thamesbank. In her sights are the developers who are destroying the beauty and vitality of the Thames.</p> <p>Not for her the combat trousers, tree-top protests and filthy, underground hideouts of the common-or-garden eco-activist. Instead, she wears impeccable suits, has a team of five lawyers and holds receptions in the House of Commons. Lady Berkeley sees her title not so much as a mark of aristocratic lineage as a weapon to be used in her fight for the environment.</p> <p>'If you have six names on a list complaining about something, and one of them has got a title, people listen. It opens doors; if you've got it, use it,' she says. 'When I write to environment groups, I don't use the title, but when I phone up English Heritage or developers, I say it's Lady Berkeley.'</p> <p>Dido Berkeley is no mere posh eccentric. She is part of a new wave of aristocrats championing environmental causes - and going out of their way to be seen to be doing so. The phrase 'socialite and ecologist' first found its way on to the front pages of newspapers a month ago when Birgit Cunningham threw a chocolate eclair into the face of the Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown in full view of the British media. The point, apparently, was to help the British countryside and British farmers, but the message was rather obscured by the pre-shot photographs of her modelling in various seductive poses in the papers the following day.</p> <p>She insists, despite all the rumours, that Max Clifford had nothing to do with it; she used the publicist who helped her promote an organic picnic attended by 4,000 people last year in Greenwich. She's now using her sudden fame to publicise a website she is setting up to promote environmental issues: <a href=\"http://www.chocolate-eclair.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.chocolate-eclair.com</a>.</p> <p>Part-American, part-German and independently wealthy ('I have a portfolio of technology stocks'), she lived in Los Angeles with Liz Hurley and doesn't deny reports she's dated Kevin Costner ('Let's say we're very good friends'). Now back in London, she's insists she is no longer a socialite but a virtual recluse who spends her evening surfing the Net. 'After the sort of people I dated in the US, how can I find a boyfriend here?' she asks. 'But I am very well connected.'</p> <p>One of her connections is heiress Julia Stephenson, the granddaugher of Sir Derek Vestey, founder of the billion-pound Vestey empire. Stephenson,who recently posed nude in Tatler - except for some strategically placed body paint - in order to promote animal welfare, is a living stereotype of the Sloane Ranger. She has all the essentials - a beautiful apartment off Sloane Square, a flat in Gstaad, a trust fund, a mantelpiece stacked with party invitations and the occasional modelling assignment. And, as of a week ago, she is the Green Party candidate for the Greater London Assembly, with Birgit Cunningham acting as her 'direct-action consultant'. 'She's advising me not to throw the cream buns. Why waste a good eclair on someone you don't like when you can eat it?' she muses.</p> <p>Julia and her brother, Mark Brown, are the scions of a family that made its fortune in the meat business. Julia is an avowed vegan and Mark is standing trial for his involvement in last June's Carnival Against Capitalism in the City of London, which ended in \u00a32 million worth of damage. 'People like us have always been environmentally minded, but they are sticking their heads up and being counted now. People have woken up to what's going on. They're travelling a lot and seeing what's happening to the world,' said Julia, who is proud to call herself an eco-toff. 'Even last year, my interests were considered eccentric and I tried not to talk about it. But this year, friends who I thought were sceptical are now asking questions about it. It's now considered fashionable to be green. It's almost cool to be vegan!'</p> <p>Julia insists that those with trust funds make natural environmentalists. 'If you're a trustafarian, you have more time and money to find out what is going on. If you're on the work treadmill, who has time to read the Ecologist magazine? People like me should be applauded for using their time well,' she says. Indeed, the last remaining practical problem facing eco-toffs has been overcome. 'You can now get organic champagne,' says Julia. 'It's rather good.'</p> <p>There is nothing new about the Establishment taking an interest in the environment. They have been doing so ever since medieval monarchs preserved huge swathes of the countryside for their hunting.

      "bodyText": "Swampy is all very well, my dear, but the new eco-warriers wouldn't dream of going underground. Instead, like Lady Berkeley and her upper-class chums, they would rather air their concerns with a well-aimed chocolate eclair and a spin doctor Her family gave its name to one of the most exclusive squares in Mayfair and her parents called her after the ancient queen of the Carthaginians. A grandmother of two, Lady Dido Berkeley is as respectable as they get. But her ladyship is also a full-time eco-warrior. She's installed phone lines, faxes and computers in her Fulham house, converting it into the headquarters of the campaign group Thamesbank. In her sights are the developers who are destroying the beauty and vitality of the Thames. Not for her the combat trousers, tree-top protests and filthy, underground hideouts of the common-or-garden eco-activist. Instead, she wears impeccable suits, has a team of five lawyers and holds receptions in the House of Commons. Lady Berkeley sees her title not so much as a mark of aristocratic lineage as a weapon to be used in her fight for the environment. 'If you have six names on a list complaining about something, and one of them has got a title, people listen. It opens doors; if you've got it, use it,' she says. 'When I write to environment groups, I don't use the title, but when I phone up English Heritage or developers, I say it's Lady Berkeley.' Dido Berkeley is no mere posh eccentric. She is part of a new wave of aristocrats championing environmental causes - and going out of their way to be seen to be doing so. The phrase 'socialite and ecologist' first found its way on to the front pages of newspapers a month ago when Birgit Cunningham threw a chocolate eclair into the face of the Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown in full view of the British media. The point, apparently, was to help the British countryside and British farmers, but the message was rather obscured by the pre-shot photographs of her modelling in various seductive poses in the papers the following day. She insists, despite all the rumours, that Max Clifford had nothing to do with it; she used the publicist who helped her promote an organic picnic attended by 4,000 people last year in Greenwich. She's now using her sudden fame to publicise a website she is setting up to promote environmental issues: www.chocolate-eclair.com. Part-American, part-German and independently wealthy ('I have a portfolio of technology stocks'), she lived in Los Angeles with Liz Hurley and doesn't deny reports she's dated Kevin Costner ('Let's say we're very good friends'). Now back in London, she's insists she is no longer a socialite but a virtual recluse who spends her evening surfing the Net. 'After the sort of people I dated in the US, how can I find a boyfriend here?' she asks. 'But I am very well connected.' One of her connections is heiress Julia Stephenson, the granddaugher of Sir Derek Vestey, founder of the billion-pound Vestey empire. Stephenson,who recently posed nude in Tatler - except for some strategically placed body paint - in order to promote animal welfare, is a living stereotype of the Sloane Ranger. She has all the essentials - a beautiful apartment off Sloane Square, a flat in Gstaad, a trust fund, a mantelpiece stacked with party invitations and the occasional modelling assignment. And, as of a week ago, she is the Green Party candidate for the Greater London Assembly, with Birgit Cunningham acting as her 'direct-action consultant'. 'She's advising me not to throw the cream buns. Why waste a good eclair on someone you don't like when you can eat it?' she muses. Julia and her brother, Mark Brown, are the scions of a family that made its fortune in the meat business. Julia is an avowed vegan and Mark is standing trial for his involvement in last June's Carnival Against Capitalism in the City of London, which ended in \u00a32 million worth of damage. 'People like us have always been environmentally minded, but they are sticking their heads up and being counted now. People have woken up to what's going on. They're travelling a lot and seeing what's happening to the world,' said Julia, who is proud to call herself an eco-toff. 'Even last year, my interests were considered eccentric and I tried not to talk about it. But this year, friends who I thought were sceptical are now asking questions about it. It's now considered fashionable to be green. It's almost cool to be vegan!' Julia insists that those with trust funds make natural environmentalists. 'If you're a trustafarian, you have more time and money to find out what is going on. If you're on the work treadmill, who has time to read the Ecologist magazine? People like me should be applauded for using their time well,' she says. Indeed, the last remaining practical problem facing eco-toffs has been overcome. 'You can now get organic champagne,' says Julia. 'It's rather good.' There is nothing new about the Establishment taking an interest in the environment. They have been doing so ever since medieval monarchs preserved huge swathes of the countryside for their hunting. The Queen is patron of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Duke of Edinburgh is patron of the World Wide Fund for Nature and Prince Charles grows organic crops. The Duke of Wellington, dubbed 'Green Wellies', is also a prominent environmentalist and has a good record on organic crops at his 400-acre park at Stratfield Saye. In the more recent tradition of aristo-radicals, the old Etonian Second Baronet of Hampstead, Jonathon Porritt, is director of Friends of the Earth and the Marchioness of Worcester, Tracy to her friends, is a trustee of Friends of the Earth, associate director of the International Society for Ecology and Culture, and was recently involved in direct action against the Newbury by-pass.

It was a rather chastening experience. Though happy to play at predicting how life for women and men was likely to change in years to come, I felt out of my depth.</p> <p>My three fellow panellists were all academics: Lisa Jardine, Professor of English and Drama at Queen Mary's and Westfield College, University of London; John Sutherland, Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English Literature at University College, London; and, sitting at the microphone directly opposite me, Doctor Helena Cronin, co-director of the Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Sciences at the London School of Economics. I was only there because I'd written a little book - a very little book - entitled The Future of Men. And I'd only done that because Tony Parsons hadn't wanted the job.</p> <p>I made it through the show. But when it was all over, co-panellist Cronin called me to account. Politely but firmly she told me that I had let myself down. A central argument of my book had been that changes in the labour market, women's struggles towards equality, and the ongoing challenges to masculinity made it both possible and desirable for the sexes to share more common ground. This, the good doctor assured me, was a serious mistake. Did I not know that men's and women's natures were essentially different? That, for instance, back in the mists of time they had evolved different 'reproductive strategies' in order that they and their offspring might survive?</p> <p>A few days later I received details of a forthcoming lecture programme - 'Darwin @ LSE' - together with a letter in which Cronin assured me that when I got acquainted with her exciting brand of knowledge, I would realise that the best way to look after both sexes was to accept they were different and meet their needs accordingly.</p> <p>Here, straight from the mouth of its steeliest UK champion, was the key assertion of what frequently feels like the most ubiquitous philosophy of human motivation to permeate public consciousness for ages. Evolutionary psychology - EP for short - is more than just a product of academia. It is a phenomenon of evolution all by itself. It has existed as a distinct, named discipline for barely 20 years, yet sometimes it appears to have taken over the world. It started as a hybrid, a union of two other sciences, evolutionary biology, founded by Charles Darwin, and cognitive psychology, which conceptualised the mind as a 'modular' structure of specialised functions, like a computer or, more prosaically, a Swiss army knife. Drawing on Darwin's theory of 'natural selection' EP's advocates surmised that the mind had been designed to cope with mental demands just as eyes, noses and toenails had been to deal with physical ones. Extending the application of a Darwinian term, they concluded that the mind's capacities were also 'adapted': refined to meet the challenges posed by their environment tens of millions of years ago.</p> <p>And this where the aggravation started. EPs concluded that human behaviour could best be understood, not with foreground reference to the contemporary social conditions, but by attributing it to processes which took place in the Stone Age: processes intimately concerned with differences between the sexes and, indeed, with having sex. It is an EP axiom that the most basic human instinct is to reproduce and that men and women go about this in important different ways. After all, our distant forebears had distinctly separate needs: women, being the carriers, bearers of children in perilous conditions, had an interest in choosing mates who were hearty, healthy and likely to stick around to fight off marauding mammoths and maybe barbecue them too; men, by contrast, had more to gain from promiscuity, partly because they didn't pay for it with pregnancy, partly because for them it was a most effective way of fulfilling their prime directive of perpetuating their genes.</p> <p>Where did this leave everyone else in the gender relations business? In many cases, thoroughly brassed off. In her latest book Why Feminism? the socialist feminist Lynne Segal, Professor of Psychology and Gender Studies at Birkbeck College, University of London, devotes a lengthy chapter to the 'return to Darwin'. She discloses that 'few things are more depressing for me... than the renaissance of a Darwinian fundamentalism, whether in mainstream media debate or in the most powerful strands of the social and biological sciences'. And she is clear that 'the goal [of that renaissance] is not just conceptual containment of potentially unlimited shifts in gender beliefs and practices. It is a return to the allegedly more rigorous authority of the biological sciences of much that has recently been understood as cultural'.</p> <p>In other words, forget your fancy gender studies: the neo-Darwinists were marching us back to basics.</p> <p>Meanwhile, serious Darwinian biologists got pretty fed up too. Steven Rose, Professor of Biology at the Open University, complains that 'very few biologists would accept that the mind is modular in the first place'. He accuses EPs of having 'a Flintstones view' of the human past based on 'endless speculation'. Rose sees EPs as gripped by a kind of chronic tunnel vision, 'insisting on groping for some adaptionist explanation for everything when all sorts of local or social factors might easily account for the activity they're trying to study'. Some EP findings are extrapolated from studies of other species. Rose has particular scorn for these 'dubious animal behaviourists writing scientific pornography'.</p> <p>Such contesting voices, though, seem rarely heard beyond academia. In sharp contrast, EP and its preachers are in your face. Open a newspaper, walk into a bookshop, turn on a radio or TV and you won't be far from some version of the case that every aspect of interaction between a chap and a chapette can only be explained by gene-moulding events millennia ago. Prolific writers and broadcasters, EPs claim to have solved mysteries of everything from infidelity to infanticide, attraction to homicide, jealousy to personal grooming, and every move in the heterosexual mating game. There have been television series promoting EP views, notably Why Men Don't Iron on Channel 4. A recent piece of EP research from Liverpool University showing women prefer tall men because height signifies superior 'resources' gave Nicky Campbell and guests on Radio 5 Live a running gag that lasted them all morning.</p> <p>EP lends momentum and a veneer of intellectual validity to the media's obsession with the 'sex war'. The press is cluttered with EP pronouncements. One Sunday newspaper recently contained no less than three items in which EP viewpoints were expounded, in one case by Don Steele, a 59-year-old American author of guides to having sex with younger women. EP, he explained, proved that 'men are interested in women who are fertile, and the more fertile they are, the more they are interested in them'. He fell for his present wife - his third - because she had 'the finest caboose on the planet' ('caboose' is Yank for 'arse'). We've also been informed - by the Express, the Daily Mail, the Independent On Sunday, the Times Higher Educational Supplement and New Scientist to name but five - that all over the world the key indicator to a man of a woman's fertility is the relationship of her hip measurement to that of her waist. A ratio of 0.7 is deemed ideal. How do we know? Because an evolutionary psychologist from the University of Texas did a survey.</p> <p>EP is running wild in the mainstream. It's all about breeding, see. One of the most vaunted EPs is David Buss, Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan. His book Evolution of Desire: Strategies for Human Mating used evidence from 37 different cultures to make the case that men and women everywhere played the game in different ways with men being more interested in casual sex and women being more concerned about commitment. And, of course, the explanation for these findings could only be evolutionary, disproving the theories of social scientists and social psychologists who've held that such differences have cultural - and therefore alterable - explanations. 'What we have is in fact just the opposite,' Buss said. Make way for the new cocks of the walk.</p> <p>A book of essays critical of EP from both natural and social scientific points of view edited by Steven Rose and his social scientist partner Hilary Rose will be published in July. Entitled Alas, Poor Darwin, it should be an interesting read. But will it get the same attention as the glut of EP volumes scheduled for May? There's a new effort from Buss, Jealousy: The Dangerous Passion, and The Mating Mind by Geoffrey Miller, an American EP working at University College, London who declares in his first chapter that 'Some critics believe that evolutionary psychology goes too far and attempts to explain too much. I think it does not go far enough'. There will be Promiscuity too - sex, sex, sex! - by Tim Birkhead of Sheffield University who elaborates the EP position that women too may be promiscuous as part of their 'mating strategy', though doing it quite differently from men.</p> <p>But before all those, there is the little matter of an EP book on rape: A Natural History Rape, by US academics Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer.</p> <p>It's been rushed forward from the spring to cash in on the controversy it has created in the States. The authors' thesis is that the orthodox, feminist-constructed perception of rape is incorrect. According to Thornhill and Palmer it is not essentially an act of misogynistic violence, but a rather desperate example of an evolved 'mating strategy' committed by men who are particularly desperate to plant their seed. 'Rape,' they write in the US journal The Sciences, should be 'viewed as a natural, biological phenomenon that is a product of the human evolutionary heritage.'</p> <p>What do we make of this? Thornhill has been peddling his rape thesis for years without much attention. Now the climate is right. He and Palmer have been at pains to head off accusations that by declaring rape 'natural' they effectively justify it. Rather, they protest, they are applying science to diagnose rape correctly and help find more effective methods to prevent it; they are not apologists for rape, and have women's wellbeing at heart.</p> <p>This strategy will sicken some. But it may amount to something more than a PR exercise. One of the intriguing developments in EP's rise has been its recent efforts to align itself with feminism. The last popular incarnation of evolutionary theory was epitomised by Richard Dawkins and his book The Selfish Gene. No ambiguities in the negative response to this: it was essentialist, reactionary, anti-feminist. But Christine Griffin, senior lecturer in social psychology at the University of Birmingham, has noticed a re-positioning of EP as well as a re-emergence. At a conference a few years back an EP from the LSE - Helena Cronin's base - announced that his subject had been misunderstood. It wasn't about promoting biological determinism to women's disadvantage. In fact, it was feminism's friend.</p> <p>Now, bolder overtures are being made. Cronin has contributed to publications of Demos, the gender-conscious think-tank beloved of the Government. And on 8 March Demos hosts an LSE conference entitled 'An Evolved Feminism?' Among those speaking will be Cronin and Segal. Lively exchanges seem certain, not least around the proposition that EP is not only backward-looking and over-hyped but also just bad science.</p> <p>Certain questions may be asked. Does anybody really know enough about the human mind to build universal theories about the way it works? Does anyone really understand genes? Does anybody know what it was like for our ancestors on the African savannah millions of years BC? Can anyone match theory with a bit of concrete proof? And beneath all the clamour and controversy evolutionary psychology has stirred, could it be there's almost nothing there at all?</p>",

It is a return to the allegedly more rigorous authority of the biological sciences of much that has recently been understood as cultural'. In other words, forget your fancy gender studies: the neo-Darwinists were marching us back to basics. Meanwhile, serious Darwinian biologists got pretty fed up too. Steven Rose, Professor of Biology at the Open University, complains that 'very few biologists would accept that the mind is modular in the first place'. He accuses EPs of having 'a Flintstones view' of the human past based on 'endless speculation'. Rose sees EPs as gripped by a kind of chronic tunnel vision, 'insisting on groping for some adaptionist explanation for everything when all sorts of local or social factors might easily account for the activity they're trying to study'. Some EP findings are extrapolated from studies of other species. Rose has particular scorn for these 'dubious animal behaviourists writing scientific pornography'. Such contesting voices, though, seem rarely heard beyond academia. In sharp contrast, EP and its preachers are in your face. Open a newspaper, walk into a bookshop, turn on a radio or TV and you won't be far from some version of the case that every aspect of interaction between a chap and a chapette can only be explained by gene-moulding events millennia ago. Prolific writers and broadcasters, EPs claim to have solved mysteries of everything from infidelity to infanticide, attraction to homicide, jealousy to personal grooming, and every move in the heterosexual mating game. There have been television series promoting EP views, notably Why Men Don't Iron on Channel 4. A recent piece of EP research from Liverpool University showing women prefer tall men because height signifies superior 'resources' gave Nicky Campbell and guests on Radio 5 Live a running gag that lasted them all morning. EP lends momentum and a veneer of intellectual validity to the media's obsession with the 'sex war'. The press is cluttered with EP pronouncements. One Sunday newspaper recently contained no less than three items in which EP viewpoints were expounded, in one case by Don Steele, a 59-year-old American author of guides to having sex with younger women. EP, he explained, proved that 'men are interested in women who are fertile, and the more fertile they are, the more they are interested in them'. He fell for his present wife - his third - because she had 'the finest caboose on the planet' ('caboose' is Yank for 'arse'). We've also been informed - by the Express, the Daily Mail, the Independent On Sunday, the Times Higher Educational Supplement and New Scientist to name but five - that all over the world the key indicator to a man of a woman's fertility is the relationship of her hip measurement to that of her waist. A ratio of 0.7 is deemed ideal. How do we know? Because an evolutionary psychologist from the University of Texas did a survey. EP is running wild in the mainstream. It's all about breeding, see. One of the most vaunted EPs is David Buss, Professor of Psychology at the University of Michigan. His book Evolution of Desire: Strategies for Human Mating used evidence from 37 different cultures to make the case that men and women everywhere played the game in different ways with men being more interested in casual sex and women being more concerned about commitment. And, of course, the explanation for these findings could only be evolutionary, disproving the theories of social scientists and social psychologists who've held that such differences have cultural - and therefore alterable - explanations. 'What we have is in fact just the opposite,' Buss said. Make way for the new cocks of the walk. A book of essays critical of EP from both natural and social scientific points of view edited by Steven Rose and his social scientist partner Hilary Rose will be published in July. Entitled Alas, Poor Darwin, it should be an interesting read. But will it get the same attention as the glut of EP volumes scheduled for May? There's a new effort from Buss, Jealousy: The Dangerous Passion, and The Mating Mind by Geoffrey Miller, an American EP working at University College, London who declares in his first chapter that 'Some critics believe that evolutionary psychology goes too far and attempts to explain too much. I think it does not go far enough'. There will be Promiscuity too - sex, sex, sex! - by Tim Birkhead of Sheffield University who elaborates the EP position that women too may be promiscuous as part of their 'mating strategy', though doing it quite differently from men. But before all those, there is the little matter of an EP book on rape: A Natural History Rape, by US academics Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer. It's been rushed forward from the spring to cash in on the controversy it has created in the States. The authors' thesis is that the orthodox, feminist-constructed perception of rape is incorrect. According to Thornhill and Palmer it is not essentially an act of misogynistic violence, but a rather desperate example of an evolved 'mating strategy' committed by men who are particularly desperate to plant their seed. 'Rape,' they write in the US journal The Sciences, should be 'viewed as a natural, biological phenomenon that is a product of the human evolutionary heritage.' What do we make of this? Thornhill has been peddling his rape thesis for years without much attention. Now the climate is right. He and Palmer have been at pains to head off accusations that by declaring rape 'natural' they effectively justify it. Rather, they protest, they are applying science to diagnose rape correctly and help find more effective methods to prevent it; they are not apologists for rape, and have women's wellbeing at heart. This strategy will sicken some. But it may amount to something more than a PR exercise. One of the intriguing developments in EP's rise has been its recent efforts to align itself with feminism. The last popular incarnation of evolutionary theory was epitomised by Richard Dawkins and his book The Selfish Gene. No ambiguities in the negative response to this: it was essentialist, reactionary, anti-feminist. But Christine Griffin, senior lecturer in social psychology at the University of Birmingham, has noticed a re-positioning of EP as well as a re-emergence. At a conference a few years back an EP from the LSE - Helena Cronin's base - announced that his subject had been misunderstood. It wasn't about promoting biological determinism to women's disadvantage. In fact, it was feminism's friend. Now, bolder overtures are being made. Cronin has contributed to publications of Demos, the gender-conscious think-tank beloved of the Government. And on 8 March Demos hosts an LSE conference entitled 'An Evolved Feminism?' Among those speaking will be Cronin and Segal. Lively exchanges seem certain, not least around the proposition that EP is not only backward-looking and over-hyped but also just bad science. Certain questions may be asked. Does anybody really know enough about the human mind to build universal theories about the way it works? Does anyone really understand genes? Does anybody know what it was like for our ancestors on the African savannah millions of years BC? Can anyone match theory with a bit of concrete proof? And beneath all the clamour and controversy evolutionary psychology has stirred, could it be there's almost nothing there at all?",

Even with singers of their calibre, however, the rest of the evening still has to work.

This is the moment that repeats in the mind. A sickening lurch of fear that infiltrates the daily routine once reassuring in its ordinariness and makes itself known with malign insistence in nightmare after nightmare. This is how it was for Alex Hough when she was mugged .</p> <p>Alex, the sister of the novelist Deborah Moggach and one of a robust, sensible family of four daughters, got out of her 2CV car in the north London street where she lived alone after an evening in town on 9 January 1997. It was a quiet side street with a school close by and a building site next door to her home; it didn't occur to her to look out for herself or feel anxious. 'I'd never been frightened,' she explains in her warm, soft voice.</p> <p>She walked between two parked cars, her keys in her teeth so that she could open the door to her flat. A basket containing her handbag was over her arm. Then it happened.</p> <p>'It was pitch dark and I felt this colossal thwack in the back like a battering ram. I think I realised in that instant someone must have been hiding on the building site. I realised he was after my bag. He tripped me with his leg and I went headlong. I fell against the lamppost and on to the pavement. I wasn't scared for myself; I just knew I had to hang on to my handbag. I had it on my elbow and I remember thinking he can't break my elbow; I'm stronger even though he was a big, hefty chap.'</p> <p>Looking back, there is the surreal image of the two of them locked in a struggle on the pavement. 'He was leaning over me and his face was intent, very close to mine. There were no words, just a horrible silence. I had always imagined I would scream for help but I had no energy for that; it all went into hanging on to my bag.'</p> <p>Then, as the mugger pulled with greater force, the strap of the handbag broke and he was off, running down the road. Alex gave chase, but he was too fast and disappeared down a side street. She let herself into her flat, breathing deep with relief once she had locked the door behind her.</p> <p>'At that time, I was very calm. I phoned the police and it was only then, as I was talking, that I saw blood all over the carpet and realised it was coming from my nose. The pain came in the middle of the night. Later, when I saw it on the X-ray, it looked like the shattered windscreen of a car. I could see there was going to be quite a scar.'</p> <p>Around 50,000 people are mugged every year in London alone, and the number of victims is rising all the time, especially among the young (police say most muggers serve their apprenticeships outside schools, relieving children of watches and mobile phones). Last month, the number of victims increased by 20 per cent year on year.</p> <p>It is generally seen as an unpleasant crime but not a terribly serious one, precisely because it is so common. Unlike rape or a stabbing, it is seen as 'impersonal'. There is an expectation that, unless the victim is seriously hurt, mugging is something that will be dealt with and got over fairly swiftly and without too much fuss.</p> <p>It is the prevalence of this view, which Alex believes this to be profoundly wrong, coupled with the rise in figures, which made her decide to talk about her experience, to detail what she went through, the long, long time it has taken to - more or less - process the incident and to live with the residual fear. Hearing this, she thinks, might help someone else in similar circumstances. On that evening, once she had phoned the police, Alex rang her sister Deborah, to whom she is very close.</p> <p>'Debbie is very sensitive and she picked something up in my voice and came straight over.' She took Alex to casualty for the 17 stitches she needed in her broken nose (she later had a skin graft). As the shock wore off, Alex found she was disoriented at home, putting her socks in the fridge and pots of yoghurt in the sock drawer. When she made herself go out to 'get over it', she began to feel more, not less, fearful.</p> <p>She wrote her thoughts down: 'Passers-by walk too close, cars are too fast, voices too loud. Every man coming towards me is going to hit me. Every step behind and I tense for the thump. I was highly over-sensitive, annihilated by an unkind word, pitifully grateful for a kind one.' Then the depression set in. 'That was bad. In the end, I had Prozac, which was a wonderful help. I dealt with the anger better than I thought, rationalising it as impersonal - an anonymous man on drugs and simply desperate for money.'</p> <p>But she couldn't rationalise away her feelings about the fact her mugger was black. 'It had a very nasty, long-term effect of racism. I hated black men after that, as well as being frightened of them.' She pauses. 'It's difficult to say this; it goes right against what I believe philosophically. I felt much too ashamed to talk about it.' She was upset enough by this reaction to go into therapy. 'I didn't want to live my life hating. I am glad to say it's much better now.'</p> <p>Alex was helped by a counsellor from Victim Support and by clinical psychologist Alex Hossack, who is head of Mersey Forensic Psychology Service and works on post-traumatic shock. Hossack understands the particular nature of mugging and believes people need recognition of what has happened and help in finding their way through it.</p> <p>As he explains: 'Because mugging is seen as ordinary, its impact is much underestimated. Mugging can make the victim suddenly feel unsafe in normal surroundings not even linked to what happened. For example, the person can start to be scared when out shopping, going on public transport, into a pub. What they go through is the fear of not being able to control the unpredictable. If the trauma is unresolved, it may be triggered by a quite unrelated incident which triggers flashbacks. They carry the trauma around.'</p> <p>Forcing yourself to go 'on the street' again too quickly is counter-productive, Hossack says, and may even invite the crime again, albeit subconsciously. 'People who've been mugged may often continue to walk down the same street alone at night or carry their wallets in their back pocket as always and so on. What they are doing is inviting the crime again but thinking because they are prepared they will control it next time.</p> <p>'It's far better,' he adds, 'for people to verbalise their experience, so they can deal with the emotional and physical side-effects. This allows the brain to desensitise the experience and accept the information. Then the person is prepared, by being more vigilant, but without carrying the trauma around.'</p> <p>Alex had now moved out to the countryside near Eastbourne, something she had contemplated before, but never got around to doing. She runs a physiotherapy practice, has a cat and dog and a nurturing sense of pleasure in her new rural lifestyle. There is gain, too, she says in finding, 'the attack has made me more focused, more realistic about what can happen and I see that as a good thing'. She gives a throaty laugh. 'I was too unworldly before.'</p> <p>But, of course, there is a negative legacy, a nervousness about going out, an abiding sense of an unsafe world, especially when she comes to London, the knowledge of a vulnerability both physical and psychological that she did not have before.

Sometimes the gesture is political (it took Christo 24 years to succeed in wrapping the Reichstag), but more often these have been environmental interventions - works of art destined to be temporary. And just as the bulk of Christo's work can't be captured or shown in a gallery, so the artist is more of an invention than a man: 'Christo' is, in fact, the Bulgarian Christo Vladimiroff Javacheff and his French wife Jeanne-Claude. Black and White, the exhibition which opens at Annely Juda Fine Art in London on 2 March, shows drawings and photographs of their work from 1958, starting with works on the modest scale of packaged books and continuing through to the more unsettling 1960s project of wrapping a living woman in plastic. But whatever the potential outcome, the images are beautiful - and unreconstructedly avant-garde. Five things wrapped by Christo A coastline in Sydney, 1969 11 small islands in Florida, 1980 to 1983 The Pont-Neuf in Paris, 1975 to 1985 The Reichstag in Berlin, 1971-95 A river in Colorado, 1999 (in progress)",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Beauty online is a cosmetic junkie's dream. Hard-to-find brands are available in your home anytime day or night, there's no overmade-up sales assistant trying to create commission from your volatile T-zone and, further more, one click of the mouse gives you personal advice from experts like the world's hippest make-up artist, Kevyn Aucoin. No wonder industry experts are predicting that beauty will be the fastest-growing online sector over the next five years.</p> <p>Which is all very well, but there are teething problems. When you buy any product from an internet site you want to be 100 per cent sure that what you see is what you get, but with beauty products there are some particular pitfalls. The first problem is that while every website tries its best to ensure the colours shown on screen are correct, this can't be guaranteed. The lighting in the room you're viewing the site in, the tint of your monitor, and even the brightness settings you use can distort hues and shades. 'Many colours are a little out,' says Miriam Naficy, co-president of <a href=\"http://www.eve.com\" target_new> eve.com</a>, one of the top four US beauty sites. 'We're developing software to minimise this, but at the moment we warn customers to read product descriptions carefully. Generally, it's only a problem with foundation which has to be an exact match for your skin - the variation in other products, such as eyeshadows and lipstick, isn't severe enough to cause problems.'</p> <p>Unless you're looking for a fuchsia lipstick or smoky eyeshadow, that is. According to some internet experts, colour difference is most likely if products have pink or grey tones, both of which photograph notoriously badly. They advise ensuring that your screen is clean and that brightness, contrast, etc, are set in the middle. To be completely covered, check the website's refund policy. Some stores, including Boots, don't allow you to return colours once they've been tried.</p> <p>Another problem is the so-called 'grey' market. At present, some major players in the beauty industry - most notably Est\u00e9e Lauder and Lanc\u00f4me - haven't officially sanctioned their products to be sold online by anyone other than themselves. The Boots site, for example, doesn't feature Lauder brands despite selling them in its stores. The same is true for changeslive.com, which offers other big name brands, such as Dior or Almay, but no Lanc\u00f4me or Lauder. There are sites that do sell the two Ls though, and often at discounted rates. 'Approach them with care,' says Naficy, 'because prestige beauty companies do not allow anyone to discount their products. Not mail order, not department stores and not us.'</p> <p>This discounting, combined with the fact that it's not an official site, means that the product you're buying might not be up to scratch. Some will be stolen, but the majority will be damaged, slow sellers or even out of date. 'The grey market is one way for companies to make money from goods they couldn't sell in-store,' says Naficy.

      "bodyText": "Beauty online is a cosmetic junkie's dream. Hard-to-find brands are available in your home anytime day or night, there's no overmade-up sales assistant trying to create commission from your volatile T-zone and, further more, one click of the mouse gives you personal advice from experts like the world's hippest make-up artist, Kevyn Aucoin. No wonder industry experts are predicting that beauty will be the fastest-growing online sector over the next five years. Which is all very well, but there are teething problems. When you buy any product from an internet site you want to be 100 per cent sure that what you see is what you get, but with beauty products there are some particular pitfalls. The first problem is that while every website tries its best to ensure the colours shown on screen are correct, this can't be guaranteed. The lighting in the room you're viewing the site in, the tint of your monitor, and even the brightness settings you use can distort hues and shades. 'Many colours are a little out,' says Miriam Naficy, co-president of eve.com, one of the top four US beauty sites. 'We're developing software to minimise this, but at the moment we warn customers to read product descriptions carefully. Generally, it's only a problem with foundation which has to be an exact match for your skin - the variation in other products, such as eyeshadows and lipstick, isn't severe enough to cause problems.' Unless you're looking for a fuchsia lipstick or smoky eyeshadow, that is. According to some internet experts, colour difference is most likely if products have pink or grey tones, both of which photograph notoriously badly. They advise ensuring that your screen is clean and that brightness, contrast, etc, are set in the middle. To be completely covered, check the website's refund policy. Some stores, including Boots, don't allow you to return colours once they've been tried. Another problem is the so-called 'grey' market. At present, some major players in the beauty industry - most notably Est\u00e9e Lauder and Lanc\u00f4me - haven't officially sanctioned their products to be sold online by anyone other than themselves. The Boots site, for example, doesn't feature Lauder brands despite selling them in its stores. The same is true for changeslive.com, which offers other big name brands, such as Dior or Almay, but no Lanc\u00f4me or Lauder. There are sites that do sell the two Ls though, and often at discounted rates. 'Approach them with care,' says Naficy, 'because prestige beauty companies do not allow anyone to discount their products. Not mail order, not department stores and not us.' This discounting, combined with the fact that it's not an official site, means that the product you're buying might not be up to scratch. Some will be stolen, but the majority will be damaged, slow sellers or even out of date. 'The grey market is one way for companies to make money from goods they couldn't sell in-store,' says Naficy. The trouble is, there's no law forcing companies selling grey market stock to flag their products up as old or damaged. While reputable discounters, such as island-trading.co.uk, admit that some samples on their site are unused testers, slightly damaged, or come without packaging, other stores just pass the stuff off as shop fresh - and disappear when you complain.

      "body": "<p>The last time I saw Douglas Coupland was in a densely crowded basement nightclub near Piccadilly Circus with wood-panelled walls and bunches of plastic grapes hanging from the ceiling. A glitter ball threw squares of mirrored light across the dance floor. Slim-hipped boys modelling themselves on Jarvis Cocker and girls in thrift-shop chic danced to 80s pop music. It was like being in a decadent alpine lodge. Coupland, wearing a plaid shirt and scuffed hiking boots, standing a good head and shoulders taller than most of the crowd, looked glaringly incongruous. Yet he seemed to be entirely at ease. In 1995, Smashing, the club, had become wildly popular in London by celebrating pop music and culture with a carefully considered mix of humour, irony and sincerity. Douglas Coupland, the author whose books filter all three of those approaches through the prism of pop culture, was right at home. </p> <p>Coupland, 38, has just published his seventh novel, Miss Wyoming, but is still best known for his first, Generation X. Subtitled 'Tales for an Accelerated Culture', it gave voice to the concerns of growing numbers of twentysomethings negotiating an uncertain future of low-paid, temporary 'McJobs' in the shifting economic climate of the early 90s. Coinciding with the rise of grunge groups such as Nirvana, the book was seized upon by ad agencies, trend analysts and film producers eager to find their way into the minds and wallets of the 'slacker generation'. Coupland was hailed as their spokesperson, yet, nine years later, the world of insecure employment, virtual relationships and rampant consumer culture that backgrounds his work is no longer just the preserve of twentysomethings. It's familiar to us all. </p> <p>During the mid-90s, I worked at the style magazine The Face. Coupland, who grew up in Vancouver and still lives there, would hang out in our office while on British book tours. Occasionally he'd come out with us, the staff, to a new bar like the Atlantic or a club such as Smashing. Yet although his interest in the shifts and eddies of pop culture was as obsessional as our own, his work has never been defined by that subject. If there are Gap ads and Battlestar Galactica trading cards and IKEA mugs in his novels that's because he's simply reflecting the world he knows. His real interest lies in trying to understand what kind of connections people can form, how they define what's valuable, at a time of intense change. </p> <p>At the centre of Miss Wyoming are John Johnson, a washed-out movie producer and Susan Colgate, a former beauty queen and soap idol whose star has long since faded. Oppressed by the dead weight of their celebrity, they both try to disappear from their lives. But only in meeting each other do they finally find themselves. Rather than an artist of the accelerated world, Coupland writes in order to slow time down and reach out to grasp what's precious in life. The following email interview took place last week between London and Vancouver. Coupland himself arrives in Britain this week for a book tour, but given the way his characters are often forced to face the implications of new technology, email seemed the most natural format for a conversation. </p> <p> <strong> Ekow Eshun</strong> What's the most exciting thing that's happened to you in the 21st century? </p> <p><strong>Douglas Coupland </strong> Being on a plane that flipped sideways just before landing in Wisconsin. Life imitates art. </p> <p> <strong> EE </strong> A plane crash being the pivotal scene in Miss Wyoming - did the author allow himself a moment of wry amusement after the event, or is there no place for irony in the face of near-fatality? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> You know what? It was entirely an ironic experience. In my head I was thinking, 'I knew it, I knew it! I knew this would happen some day.' I live on planes. Sooner or later the roulette wheel hits 00. The time for grim reflection was actually on the ground, with everybody pale-faced around the luggage carousel. Silence. Total silence, and then the dull thunk of luggage rolling down the chute. </p> <p><strong> EE </strong> As I recall, you used to have an interest in Princess Diana which proved very prescient. There are references to Fergie and Diana's sons in Miss Wyoming. Does this mark you as a closet royalist? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I used to really look forward to having a genuinely attractive human being on our money and postage stamps. No more. But it was really spooky to write about D being 'post-fame'. And then the crash. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> Your most recent promotional photos are pretty slick - how important is image to you? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> You think they're slick? Good! About time I fixed it. Everything about my life was fuzzy and lint-covered with Girlfriend in a Coma. I was so sick of it... so tired of hand-knit sweaters and coffee stains and earnest dining. I wanted to turn it all upside down. I'd like to think that's the way David Bowie felt back in the 70s when he was doing annual image overhauls. It always struck me as a very practical way of going about life. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> Hmm, doesn't sound like you were having much fun around that time. What was going on? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> Fun? Not the right word. I gave up on the idea of fun around 1985. What I find works far better than fun is to simply be working on a good, creative project, and around the post- Girlfriend period I wasn't working on creative projects. And the methodologies I was using from previous projects had stopped working. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> What methodologies? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I'd always been a compulsive note taker. It's the same as keeping a sketchbook. But in the middle of Girlfriend I began to resent, nay, hate, my notepads. I lost interest in taking notes, and didn't know what had happened to me. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> What had happened to you? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I think I internalised the note-taking process - in the same way your brain suddenly internalises a language you've been studying for a long time. Suddenly it's not academic - it's simply in your head, a part of you. It took me a year to figure out that what I wanted to move on to was to write entirely from imagination with no notes at all. </p> <p><strong> EE </strong> In Miss Wyoming, your lead characters John and Susan both try to walk away from their over-mediated lives. It's as though you're suggesting there's not enough air to breathe in modern life. </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I think it was Malcolm McLaren (no - I know it was him) who said that (this is a paraphrase) fame is the only adult situation possible in which one can remain a perpetual adolescent. My thinking is that Susan and John are caught in an adolescent warp, and it's no longer viable for them. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> Is it a burden, still being most well known as the Gen X guy almost a decade after it was written? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> Burden? No. I'd be ungrateful if I said otherwise. My dad knows there's some guy out there who painted soup cans, but he doesn't know the name Andy Warhol. Same difference. I should be so lucky. </p> <p><strong> EE </strong> Part of the business of being a modern novelist is not just writing, but having your photo taken, doing book tours, etc. Is there a Douglas Coupland who exists for public perception and, if so, how is he different from the private Doug? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> There's very little difference between the two, which is why all these things are so hard for me. I can't fake enthusiasm. I can't fake being awake. I can't fake anything. I have no idea how actors sit there and spew out the same stuff over and over and over. And it's almost physically painful (an enzyme reaction?) to have to give the same answer to the same question to two different reporters in a row. It's like seasickness. I thought it would get better with time, but instead it's getting worse. I actually don't know what I'm going to do about it. The only part I really do like is the readings. They're the only point in the process where I meet a significant concentration of people who read the work I do. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> The characters in your recent novels seem to be searching for spiritual significance in their lives. </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I agree, but isn't everybody? I can't imagine a person going into a book or movie without secretly wishing to come away from the experience a slightly altered person. </p> <p><strong> EE </strong> You've said before in a previous interview that 'religion is like Lego. You have to build it yourself.' At the risk of sounding, well, corny, are you, too, looking for the spiritual in life? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> Of course. But I'm also looking for some system that will allow me to understand why the people who least deserve it get the most shit piled on them. That's something I've seen happen to many of the people in my life. It's the jerks who drive their Mercedes off into the sunset, isn't it? </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> I know you trained in art and design - whose work do you admire enough to buy today? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> In terms of what I've already bought, it's US pop art from the 60s... Warhol (a Mao and a Brillo box) and a 24-foot serigraph edition of James Rosenquist's F1-11. It's shocking to see in person. Just shocking. I tried to buy a Damien Hirst piece but have you ever tried getting a hold of anybody at the White Cube gallery? I finally gave up. Two years ago, I FedEx'ed Damien Hirst a small table I'd made. Pure hero worship on my part. I never heard back from him, and I have no idea if he even received it. It could well be lolling about some underling's living room. But then that's the deal with unsolicited gifts... there's no law saying you have to acknowledge them. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> Who are your other heroes? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> Vaclav Havel. Joan Didion. Morrissey. Andy Warhol. I know he's dead, but I can't shake this niggling sensation - and perhaps you have the sensation as well - that in some way he's going to, well, return. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> Or that Warhol has never really left, in that the mediated celebrity culture he lived and breathed has now become the oxygen for the whole of society. Still, Joan Didion, Morrissey, Warhol - these are all people who position themselves on the sidelines of the world (I wouldn't say the same about Vaclev Havel), even as they're fascinated by it. Do you fall into that category also? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I disagree about their being on the outside. They're up on stage! They're taking their country out of Soviet bondage. That is not sideliner stuff. What I suppose I like most about them is the distinctness and clarity of their voices. You could read a billion different, say, letters to the editor, and you'd always be able to pick theirs out of the lot. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> In Girlfriend in a Coma, you talk of the need to 'question and question till the world stops spinning'. Much of your work has that sense of wanting to look at them from every angle. After seven books, have you come up with any answers? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> What seems to work is the questioning. If I wasn't doing it, I'd go mad. And the moment you stop, the shit starts piling up. </p> <p><strong> EE </strong> There are few authors that I can think of so interested in the texture of our time, in trying to describe the experience and sensibility of being alive today. How difficult is that to do? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I never think of the sensibility of the moment one way or the other. I mean, I have to breathe all the time, but I don't know whether or not oxygen is reflected in my books. People in North America get very crabby, nay, testy, when they see pop or mass culture appear in books. Sometimes vitriolic. Because I come from the art world, I have no problem incorporating everyday culture into my books. Pop culture and academic art culture fused together in the 50s. But in the literary world, they've always been separate realms. I don't know how much longer that's going to last. Maybe that explains it. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> The British take a smug pleasure in declaring that Americans don't understand irony. </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> And rightly so. One thing I've noticed is that laced with pop references as my books are (and to be honest, I really don't think they're too laced at all - in fact, like the humourless souls mentioned above, I think I rather minimise the pop. If I wanted to, I could make them bleed pop... but I don't) they never seem dated to readers. Microserfs, for example, is set in 1994 and everything in the book is time-expired, but this seems to make it only more popular than ever. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> In Miss Wyoming, Susan Colgate, presumed dead, gets to read her own obituary. What do you think they'll be saying about you after you're gone? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I'm not going to say, because that'll go directly into the obituary files and 30 minutes later I'll be hit by a bus. </p> <p><strong> EE</strong> I wonder, are there previous aspects of Doug that you're now happy to see gone? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> I don't worry as much. If I could go back in time to say, about 20, the one piece of advice I'd give myself is: 'Hey, zitface, stop the worrying.' But then it was probably the worrying that in the end propelled me into writing - the sense that things I felt important were going unsaid. Also, I used to think I looked like such a monster, and now I look at photos of myself at 25 and I could just cry because, while I was no Mel Gibson, I wasn't a monster, either. I wish I could have enjoyed it while it lasted. Now I think I look like an average 38-year-old guy. That's fine. But I was once so... best not to linger here. </p> <p><strong> EE </strong> Are there parts of you which you'd happily reclaim from the past? </p> <p><strong>DC </strong> You know what? No. The rewards of ageing always seem to slightly outweigh the freshness of youth.</p>",

What I find works far better than fun is to simply be working on a good, creative project, and around the post- Girlfriend period I wasn't working on creative projects. And the methodologies I was using from previous projects had stopped working. EE What methodologies? DC I'd always been a compulsive note taker. It's the same as keeping a sketchbook. But in the middle of Girlfriend I began to resent, nay, hate, my notepads. I lost interest in taking notes, and didn't know what had happened to me. EE What had happened to you? DC I think I internalised the note-taking process - in the same way your brain suddenly internalises a language you've been studying for a long time. Suddenly it's not academic - it's simply in your head, a part of you. It took me a year to figure out that what I wanted to move on to was to write entirely from imagination with no notes at all. EE In Miss Wyoming, your lead characters John and Susan both try to walk away from their over-mediated lives. It's as though you're suggesting there's not enough air to breathe in modern life. DC I think it was Malcolm McLaren (no - I know it was him) who said that (this is a paraphrase) fame is the only adult situation possible in which one can remain a perpetual adolescent. My thinking is that Susan and John are caught in an adolescent warp, and it's no longer viable for them. EE Is it a burden, still being most well known as the Gen X guy almost a decade after it was written? DC Burden? No. I'd be ungrateful if I said otherwise. My dad knows there's some guy out there who painted soup cans, but he doesn't know the name Andy Warhol. Same difference. I should be so lucky. EE Part of the business of being a modern novelist is not just writing, but having your photo taken, doing book tours, etc. Is there a Douglas Coupland who exists for public perception and, if so, how is he different from the private Doug? DC There's very little difference between the two, which is why all these things are so hard for me. I can't fake enthusiasm. I can't fake being awake. I can't fake anything. I have no idea how actors sit there and spew out the same stuff over and over and over. And it's almost physically painful (an enzyme reaction?) to have to give the same answer to the same question to two different reporters in a row. It's like seasickness. I thought it would get better with time, but instead it's getting worse. I actually don't know what I'm going to do about it. The only part I really do like is the readings. They're the only point in the process where I meet a significant concentration of people who read the work I do. EE The characters in your recent novels seem to be searching for spiritual significance in their lives. DC I agree, but isn't everybody? I can't imagine a person going into a book or movie without secretly wishing to come away from the experience a slightly altered person. EE You've said before in a previous interview that 'religion is like Lego. You have to build it yourself.' At the risk of sounding, well, corny, are you, too, looking for the spiritual in life? DC Of course. But I'm also looking for some system that will allow me to understand why the people who least deserve it get the most shit piled on them. That's something I've seen happen to many of the people in my life. It's the jerks who drive their Mercedes off into the sunset, isn't it? EE I know you trained in art and design - whose work do you admire enough to buy today? DC In terms of what I've already bought, it's US pop art from the 60s... Warhol (a Mao and a Brillo box) and a 24-foot serigraph edition of James Rosenquist's F1-11. It's shocking to see in person. Just shocking. I tried to buy a Damien Hirst piece but have you ever tried getting a hold of anybody at the White Cube gallery? I finally gave up. Two years ago, I FedEx'ed Damien Hirst a small table I'd made. Pure hero worship on my part. I never heard back from him, and I have no idea if he even received it. It could well be lolling about some underling's living room. But then that's the deal with unsolicited gifts... there's no law saying you have to acknowledge them. EE Who are your other heroes? DC Vaclav Havel. Joan Didion. Morrissey. Andy Warhol. I know he's dead, but I can't shake this niggling sensation - and perhaps you have the sensation as well - that in some way he's going to, well, return. EE Or that Warhol has never really left, in that the mediated celebrity culture he lived and breathed has now become the oxygen for the whole of society. Still, Joan Didion, Morrissey, Warhol - these are all people who position themselves on the sidelines of the world (I wouldn't say the same about Vaclev Havel), even as they're fascinated by it. Do you fall into that category also? DC I disagree about their being on the outside. They're up on stage! They're taking their country out of Soviet bondage. That is not sideliner stuff. What I suppose I like most about them is the distinctness and clarity of their voices. You could read a billion different, say, letters to the editor, and you'd always be able to pick theirs out of the lot. EE In Girlfriend in a Coma, you talk of the need to 'question and question till the world stops spinning'. Much of your work has that sense of wanting to look at them from every angle. After seven books, have you come up with any answers? DC What seems to work is the questioning. If I wasn't doing it, I'd go mad. And the moment you stop, the shit starts piling up. EE There are few authors that I can think of so interested in the texture of our time, in trying to describe the experience and sensibility of being alive today. How difficult is that to do? DC I never think of the sensibility of the moment one way or the other. I mean, I have to breathe all the time, but I don't know whether or not oxygen is reflected in my books. People in North America get very crabby, nay, testy, when they see pop or mass culture appear in books. Sometimes vitriolic. Because I come from the art world, I have no problem incorporating everyday culture into my books. Pop culture and academic art culture fused together in the 50s. But in the literary world, they've always been separate realms. I don't know how much longer that's going to last. Maybe that explains it. EE The British take a smug pleasure in declaring that Americans don't understand irony. DC And rightly so. One thing I've noticed is that laced with pop references as my books are (and to be honest, I really don't think they're too laced at all - in fact, like the humourless souls mentioned above, I think I rather minimise the pop. If I wanted to, I could make them bleed pop... but I don't) they never seem dated to readers. Microserfs, for example, is set in 1994 and everything in the book is time-expired, but this seems to make it only more popular than ever. EE In Miss Wyoming, Susan Colgate, presumed dead, gets to read her own obituary. What do you think they'll be saying about you after you're gone? DC I'm not going to say, because that'll go directly into the obituary files and 30 minutes later I'll be hit by a bus. EE I wonder, are there previous aspects of Doug that you're now happy to see gone? DC I don't worry as much. If I could go back in time to say, about 20, the one piece of advice I'd give myself is: 'Hey, zitface, stop the worrying.' But then it was probably the worrying that in the end propelled me into writing - the sense that things I felt important were going unsaid. Also, I used to think I looked like such a monster, and now I look at photos of myself at 25 and I could just cry because, while I was no Mel Gibson, I wasn't a monster, either. I wish I could have enjoyed it while it lasted. Now I think I look like an average 38-year-old guy. That's fine. But I was once so... best not to linger here. EE Are there parts of you which you'd happily reclaim from the past? DC You know what? No. The rewards of ageing always seem to slightly outweigh the freshness of youth.",

      "body": "<p>Despite popular perception, eating cheese is a healthy option when you know how. I can walk away from chocolate, but if I had to choose three foods to take to a desert island, cheese would be top of the list. Although widely thought of as an indulgent and fattening food, there are in fact many health advantages to eating this dairy product. Cheese is rich in essential vitamins and minerals, as well as protein and yes, fat - which is both necessary and beneficial as long as you get the balance right.</p> <p>Primarily, though, cheese is a particularly valuable source of vitamin A (essential for growth, healthy skin and hair, good vision and healthy tooth enamel); vitamin B complex, which covers a group of substances including B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B12 (essential for the development and maintenance of a healthy nervous system), and vitamin D, which works in conjunction with calcium - one of cheese's principal nutrients - to build and maintain healthy bones and teeth. Our bones need a regular, consistent supply of calcium to ensure that we build and maintain a strong framework and avoid diseases such as osteoporosis, and cheese is one of the most concentrated and easily absorbed sources available.</p> <p>Cheese - particularly Parmesan and other hard, crumbly cheeses such as Cheddar, Stilton and Cheshire - also contains zinc, which has many functions in the body, including the maintenance of a healthy immune system and libido. It can also be a useful protein provider for non-meat eaters, and its fat can act as a good source of energy - most importantly for growing and active kids. Think about giving kids cheese and pineapple cubes, a piece of celery with a slice of ripe Brie or a cheese-and-tomato sandwich as an energy-giving snack.</p> <p>Of course, not everyone gets on with cheese - there are those who have problems digesting the milk sugar (lactose) and/or cow's-milk protein. Both lactose- and milk-protein sensitivities can cause symptoms such as bloating, diarrhoea, sickness, stomach and abdominal cramps and headaches, and can even aggravate skin complaints such as eczema. Lactose sensitivity is mainly due to a deficiency in the body's production of lactase, the enzyme that digests the sugar found in all milk products - particularly cow's, sheep's and goat's milk. Without sufficient lactase, lactose cannot be broken down and absorbed by the body, and therefore there is a build-up of undigested lactose in the gut. Milk-sugar sensitivity can be a transient state - very young children are commonly lactose sensitive until their gut becomes more mature, usually around two years of age.</p> <p>If you are lactose sensitive, you need to avoid all forms of milk (other than soya milk), which include cheese, cream, butter, yogurt, skimmed-milk powder and products containing any of the above, as well as lactose, casein and whey, which might be present in baked and processed products, such as cheese, biscuits and cakes. You also need to look out for foods containing monosodium glutamate (sometimes labelled as MSG or 621), as these frequently contain lactose. Even medicinal and nutritional tablet supplements can contain lactose, so you should check the labels carefully.</p> <p>The lactose content of cheese varies - the lowest concentration can be found in Brie, Edam, Camembert, Gouda, soya cheese and vegetarian Cheddar, which can make them manageable for adults with mild lactose intolerance. With lactose-intolerant children, it's best not to experiment with any cheese (unless advised by your dietician), as you may trigger severe symptoms. Sensitivity to cow's- milk protein is slightly less common, but it can occur at any age. In this case, the sensitivity is not due to an enzyme deficiency, but simply that the body is unable to tolerate the protein molecules. However, you may be able to tolerate sheep's or goat's milk products, including their cheeses.</p> <p>If you suspect that your child has a problem digesting cheese or other milk products, keep a diary recording everything they eat and drink, along with symptoms, for a week or so, and then take this to a doctor or dietician (follow the same advice if you suspect you have a problem with dairy products). The doctor will advise you as to how to balance the diet without certain milk products - it's vital you do not remove them from the diet without ensuring it remains nutrient rich. Women and children in particular need a plentiful supply of calcium.</p> <p>Stress can affect the way the body deals with cheese - the stress hormones, including adrenaline, can make the gut absorb more of the potential aggravator - the lactose or cow's-milk protein - meaning that symptoms can be triggered. This explains why some people are able to eat cheese normally, but when their stress levels are high, a cheese sandwich leaves them feeling lousy and can cause diarrhoea, stomachaches or eczema to flare up. Other factors, such as having a cold or taking antibiotics, can also make the gut temporarily more susceptible to cheese reactions. You should also bear in mind that sometimes it's the quantity which can overload your system. If you suspect that cheese doesn't suit you, reduce your intake: have it a few times a week rather than every day, or just use a little Parmesan on pasta rather than having a thick cheese sandwich. It would be a pity to miss out on all cheese if simply decreasing the quantity would suffice. It's not just the lactose and protein which can cause problems; some people find that cheese gives them vivid dreams and disrupts their sleep. It is thought that vasoactive amines within the cheese trigger various neurotransmitters (chemicals which pass messages from one nerve to another) to go into overdrive and cause dreams. Eating cheese in the morning rather than the evening allows vasoactive amines to pass through your body before you sleep.</p> <p>Some children can have their behaviour aggravated - and hyperactivity (Attention Deficit disorder) can also be exacerbated - by colourings in cheeses, generally the dyed, bright orange or highly processed cheese and spreads (which should be abolished anyway). Check the labels for E102, E110, E124, E127, E210, E219, E320 and E32, as these are common behaviour aggravators. If you stick to the minimally processed cheeses, your body should not react badly.</p> <p>Finally, one of the main reasons that people are wary of cheese is because of its saturated-fat content. Too much saturated fat causes the body to produce excessive amounts of Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), aka bad cholesterol, which can stick to the arteries and cause heart disease. The solution when eating cheese is to add fibre into the equation. Fibre (fruit, vegetables, whole grains, pulses, oats, etc) swell in the presence of water, which builds a perfect 'dam' in the gut, meaning that the quantity of saturated fat absorbed decreases. Simple, and in the long term this tip can help you have a longer and healthier life; accompanying cheese with oat biscuits, fresh apricots, a bunch of grapes or a crisp apple and water lets you enjoy the cheese without suffering the bad-fat effects. Also, cutting the rind off soft cheese can decrease its saturated-fat content by up to a third, and reduces its calorie value.</p> <p>Cheese is a high-fat food, but if you eat it accompanied by fibre, the fibre will swell and stimulate stretch receptors in your stomach lining, which send signals of fullness to the brain. If you eat cheese on its own, this reaction doesn't happen - you receive little satisfaction other than the initial taste, and can end up munching too much. If weight is an issue, again remember to eat cheese with fibre. Don't reach for low-fat cheeses - they frequently taste lousy (which means you'll feel dissatisfied and eat more), are full of unhealthy additives, and rarely contain any beneficial nutrients, such as calcium or vitamin D - a crime, to say the least.</p>",

Walking down the 'rings' between sphere and glass, calibrated to represent time since the Big Bang - every step you take is 75 million years - and coming to the last step, where the relative longevity of mankind is represented by a strip the width of a human hair, it's hard not to find it almost funny, in a way, in the sense of Douglas Adams's clever hyperbole, or even The Onion 's famous spoof of the sense of awe we should rightly have felt on that day in 1969 ('Holy Shit! Man walks on Fucking Moon!'). The exhibition manages to remind you just how very small, and how very beautiful, human life is. For this building, Whatever's Out There Bless America.",

All the stopping and starting doesn't suit a Daimler at all, but the location of the club always makes the first mile a slightly nerve-wracking exercise whatever you're driving. You're immediately plunged into Kings Cross madness, driving a beautiful but unfamiliar vehicle which at times can be slightly less strong on the handbrake than we're used to with a modern car.</p> <p>On the other hand, the way the world responds to a classic car is unbelievable - you can poke your nose into the worst traffic queues, get away with the sneakiest manoeuvres and fellow drivers (bar the odd jealous woman driving a modern tin box) will smile and let you in. The fact is, you can get away with almost anything in a classic.</p> <p>Back to the driving log.

She purred at 70mph which, along with the smell of leather seats, polished wood, the odd petrol smell (why do classic cars always smell?) and a slight hangover from the wine the previous night, made it impossible for my companion to stay awake.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I drove us out to the Sir Charles Napier pub near Chinor, which is a good location for a walk - and the pub is renowned for its food. After a tour-trek, seasonal root vegetables and a glass of local beer for my friend (I made do with water) we started the long drive back. Motorway driving is actually not that easy in classic cars - the mirrors can create some nasty blind spots if you're not careful. Still, once out on the road, we set off back to London at a majestic speed and, after her zoom earlier on, the engine opened up with little difficulty, spluttered less, and made our dodge through Camden traffic altogether less cumbersome than it had been earlier in the day.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the following day turned out to be not nearly as much fun.

But even after what felt like hundreds of stop starts, copious car fumes and a rather greedy fuel gage, I couldn't be persuaded to switch eras.</p> <p>Membership of the Classic Car Club is my treat to myself. I love the fact that I can indulge a driving whim, pick up a different car every time (traffic wardens dependent, of course) and whizz off into the sunset, either as a cool sunglass'd, Kelly McGillis-like chick in a Karmann Ghia or an outrageous older sister who picks up her brother in an E-Type for his birthday, or a doting auntie to Tom (who's eight years old) with a floppy hat and a picnic hamper, who drives a Mark 11 Jag down to the Suffolk coast on a sunny day.

The <b> Skirrid Mountain Inn</b> ,<b> </b> Llanvihangel Crucorney, Monmouthshire (01873 890258), off the A464 Hereford to Abergavenny road, is a good base for climbing in the Black Mountains, but come prepared for its long and gory history. It dates from 1100, when one James Crowther was hanged from a beam in the bar for sheep stealing. Over the centuries, more than 1,800 people have been despatched in the inn, which also doubled as the local courthouse.</p> <p>The Skirrid was also involved in Owain Glyndwr's revolt against Henry IV in the early 15th century, and the 17th-century rebellion led by the Duke of Monmouth against James II. Not surprisingly, the Skirrid is haunted by many ghosts and the rope mark on the hanging beam is clearly visible. Today, it's a remarkably convivial place, with its studded wood door, stone walls and huge log fire. Beers come from Ushers of Trowbridge and include Best Bitter and Founder's Ale, while food comes in the shape of breaded Pencary wedges with home-made quince and elderberry relish; Hereford pork pot with apples, raisins, ginger and cider; and Welsh cockles and mussels in briny broth. Accommodation is available.</p> <p>Alternatively, <b> Cardiff Cottage</b> ,<b> </b> 25 Mary's Street, Cardiff (029 2033 7194), off the A4119, is a classic Cardiff boozer. In the city centre, it has an ornate wooden frontage with a long, narrow single bar and a raised area at the back used mainly by diners. Lunchtime grub includes steak-in-ale pie, fresh fish, curry and lasagne. There's also a roast lunch on Sundays that has them queueing in the streets. The pub serves the ales from Brain's, the local brewery, including Dark, Bitter and the strong SA, which the brewery thinks stands for Special Ale but everyone else in the valleys knows means 'Skull Attack'.</p> <p>Bryn Tyrch means 'boar's hill' - not the best name perhaps for a whitewashed inn that specialises in vegetarian and vegan dishes. But carnivores are also well catered for at <b> Bryn Tyrch, </b> Capel Curig, Conwy (01690 720223), on the A5 near Betwys-y-Coed. This is walking and climbing territory in Snowdonia and the inn will advise on good walks. It has two comfortable bars with fires and reading material. Food is served from noon to 9.30pm and may include zucchini dippers with spicy tomato sauce, and leek-and-bacon cobbler. There's an enormous breakfast - meat, vegetarian or vegan - for guests. Along with ales such as Flowers IPA and Wadworth 6X, there's a tremendous choice of teas and coffees, which come with vegan fruit cake. Accommodation is available.</p> <p>The <b> Olde Bull's Head</b> ,<b> </b> Castle Street, Beaumaris, Anglesey (01248 810329), on the A545, is a 17th-century coaching inn visited by both Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens.

Food is served from a new brasserie lunchtime and evening, and may offer potato gnocchi with baked goat's cheese, leeks and cream, and pork schnitzel with couscous and lemon-and-caper butter. Desserts include traditional bara brith and butter pudding. Handpumped beers are Draught Bass and Worthington, with a regular guest ale, and the range of wines totals more than 200, including several half bottles.

It could be a beer festival, walks called Real Ale Wobbles and Rambles, with free beer at check points, or the World Bog-Snorkelling Championships in August. If you don't know what bog-snorkelling is, it's best not to ask. Beers in the bar include Felinfoel Double Dragon and Hancock's HB.

      "body": "<p>I was pleased to see Maureen Freely's article (News, last week). The bias of the family court system against fathers rarely receives any publicity.</p> <p>The Court Welfare Officer told me that I would never get 50 per cent contact time with my two boys even though I was the principal carer for seven years and their mother played very little part in their upbringing. Now they spend much of the time in her house but being looked after by their mother's cleaning lady.</p> <p>My ex-partner constantly tries to alienate the boys from me, so far without success, but none the less it is very unsettling for them. She told my younger boy, then aged four, that he must not regard my house as his home. He was very disturbed by this and kept asking why he could not have two homes.</p> <p>Court Welfare Officers seem to think that children should not have any rights to two homes - just one, always the mother's.<br><b> Peter Mitchell </b><br>Address supplied</p> <p>\u0095 Like all social workers, Family Court Welfare Officers hold the Diploma in Social Work. All receive training in child development, separation and loss, working with families and receive a national programme of induction. FCWOs' reports are subject to systematic quality checks, not just spell checks, and statutory inspection.</p> <p>Maureen Freely may have thrown in her lot with 'heartbreak' fathers. The responsibility of the Family Court Welfare Service, however, is to safeguard the interests of those who invariably lose when a family splits up - the children.<br><b> John Harding </b>Chief Probation Officer, Inner London Probation Service <br><b>Peter Jeffries </b><br>Secretary, FCWS network of the Association of Chief Officers of Probation</p> <p>\u0095 Readers will appreciate that following family breakdown the Courts (and the Court Welfare Service, among others) are asked to address a wide range of complex issues, often within a highly charged, emotional atmosphere. It is not unusual for parents to refuse to even speak to each other and the Court has the unenviable task of making decisions for children where parents have polarised positions.</p> <p>Any right thinking person has sympathy for a parent who is unjustly denied contact to a child they love. I, for one, as a practising Court Welfare Officer, believe that in clear-cut cases the law should do more. However, the fact is that within the Court process somebody is usually left feeling that they have lost out, even where there is a fair judgment.<br><b> Howard F. Bramwell </b><br>Address supplied</p> <p>\u0095 The planned creation of the new Children and Family Court Advisory Service was announced in the Queen's Speech last November, and will be created under legislation which we are about to lay before Parliament.</p> <p>CAFCAS will create a nationally integrated service to represent the interests of children whose care is to be decided by the courts. It will bring together the existing Family Court Welfare Service, together with the guardian ad litem service, and the children's work currently carried out by the Official Solicitor.</p> <p>The provision of publicly funded family mediation under Part III of the Family Law Act 1996 has been in force since March 1997 and continues to be implemented throughout England and Wales. Over 250 mediation services have now concluded contracts with the Legal Aid Board for family mediation and further contracts will be granted shortly to provide facilities throughout England and Wales by the latter part of 2000.</p> <p>We are working to encourage a more constructive approach to family disputes and to develop a better, more consistent, and more responsive service, which puts the interests of the child at the very heart of what it does.<br><b> Jane Kennedy </b><br>Lord Chancellor's Department <br>London SW1</p>",

      "bodyText": "I was pleased to see Maureen Freely's article (News, last week). The bias of the family court system against fathers rarely receives any publicity. The Court Welfare Officer told me that I would never get 50 per cent contact time with my two boys even though I was the principal carer for seven years and their mother played very little part in their upbringing. Now they spend much of the time in her house but being looked after by their mother's cleaning lady. My ex-partner constantly tries to alienate the boys from me, so far without success, but none the less it is very unsettling for them. She told my younger boy, then aged four, that he must not regard my house as his home. He was very disturbed by this and kept asking why he could not have two homes. Court Welfare Officers seem to think that children should not have any rights to two homes - just one, always the mother's. Peter Mitchell Address supplied \u0095 Like all social workers, Family Court Welfare Officers hold the Diploma in Social Work. All receive training in child development, separation and loss, working with families and receive a national programme of induction. FCWOs' reports are subject to systematic quality checks, not just spell checks, and statutory inspection. Maureen Freely may have thrown in her lot with 'heartbreak' fathers. The responsibility of the Family Court Welfare Service, however, is to safeguard the interests of those who invariably lose when a family splits up - the children. John Harding Chief Probation Officer, Inner London Probation Service Peter Jeffries Secretary, FCWS network of the Association of Chief Officers of Probation \u0095 Readers will appreciate that following family breakdown the Courts (and the Court Welfare Service, among others) are asked to address a wide range of complex issues, often within a highly charged, emotional atmosphere. It is not unusual for parents to refuse to even speak to each other and the Court has the unenviable task of making decisions for children where parents have polarised positions. Any right thinking person has sympathy for a parent who is unjustly denied contact to a child they love. I, for one, as a practising Court Welfare Officer, believe that in clear-cut cases the law should do more. However, the fact is that within the Court process somebody is usually left feeling that they have lost out, even where there is a fair judgment. Howard F. Bramwell Address supplied \u0095 The planned creation of the new Children and Family Court Advisory Service was announced in the Queen's Speech last November, and will be created under legislation which we are about to lay before Parliament. CAFCAS will create a nationally integrated service to represent the interests of children whose care is to be decided by the courts. It will bring together the existing Family Court Welfare Service, together with the guardian ad litem service, and the children's work currently carried out by the Official Solicitor. The provision of publicly funded family mediation under Part III of the Family Law Act 1996 has been in force since March 1997 and continues to be implemented throughout England and Wales. Over 250 mediation services have now concluded contracts with the Legal Aid Board for family mediation and further contracts will be granted shortly to provide facilities throughout England and Wales by the latter part of 2000. We are working to encourage a more constructive approach to family disputes and to develop a better, more consistent, and more responsive service, which puts the interests of the child at the very heart of what it does.

If he were the same man, he would have to admit his complicity in undermining the democratic process during that period. Redwood the MP presumably supported successive legislation covering local government and planning control. The net effect was to reduce the power of local government in favour of central government and big business. He presumably also supported the absurd poll tax and its unsatisfactory successor, the Council Tax, together with capping. There was also the little matter of Tory opposition to any form of devolution. Perhaps John Redwood the journalist could arrange to meet his namesake from the House of Commons and point out the error of his ways. Mark Poarch Emersons Green Gloucs \u0095 Redwood does not seem to be aware of New Labour's proposals which, I understand from a reliable source, have been drawn up for the next general election. Under the New Democracy Bill, only New Labour will be allowed access to the electoral roll and proportional representation is to be introduced for each constituency on the following basis: one third of the votes will be allocated to the people; one third to the unions; one third to retiring MPs. It is reported that many of the Cabinet thought that only New Labour members in the constituency and only New Labour MPs should be enfranchised. However, Alastair ruled that people might perceive this to be undemocratic. Michael Owen Rickmansworth Herts",

In a sign of his increasing anger with government efforts to stifle his revelations about the security services, which he claims are increasingly out of control, he is also calling for an investigation into Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's assertions in 1997 that his allegations were 'pure fantasy'.</p> <p>The names of the agents he says were involved in the Gadaffi plot have been disclosed to The Observer, but for legal reasons we are prevented from publishing them.</p> <p>News that Shayler is revealing the identities of agents will send shockwaves through the intelligence services, whose officers are told to keep their jobs secret even from their family and closest friends. It will also intensify the Government's determination to pursue the errant agent, currently in exile in Paris, through the courts.</p> <p>The Observer has discovered that Shayler sent Home Secretary Jack Straw full details of the alleged plot on 24 November last year, including the name of an MI6 officer who ran the operation and, according to Shayler, paid for the assassination attempt. The letter demanded a criminal investigation into his activities. It is now thought that Shayler is also prepared to name the agent's boss at MI6, codenamed PT16, who is alleged to have authorised the operation.

      "bodyText": "The renegade MI5 agent David Shayler last night dramatically escalated his battle with the Government when he named two serving intelligence officers who he says were involved in a covert operation to assassinate Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gadaffi. Shayler took the unprecedented step of naming the agents in an attempt to force the Government to launch a full inquiry into the affair. In a sign of his increasing anger with government efforts to stifle his revelations about the security services, which he claims are increasingly out of control, he is also calling for an investigation into Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's assertions in 1997 that his allegations were 'pure fantasy'. The names of the agents he says were involved in the Gadaffi plot have been disclosed to The Observer, but for legal reasons we are prevented from publishing them. News that Shayler is revealing the identities of agents will send shockwaves through the intelligence services, whose officers are told to keep their jobs secret even from their family and closest friends. It will also intensify the Government's determination to pursue the errant agent, currently in exile in Paris, through the courts. The Observer has discovered that Shayler sent Home Secretary Jack Straw full details of the alleged plot on 24 November last year, including the name of an MI6 officer who ran the operation and, according to Shayler, paid for the assassination attempt. The letter demanded a criminal investigation into his activities. It is now thought that Shayler is also prepared to name the agent's boss at MI6, codenamed PT16, who is alleged to have authorised the operation. He may also identify his own MI5 line manager, to whom he voiced concerns about what he called a 'Boys' Own' operation. In a weekend of high drama, it emerged that the Government is to sue the former MI5 officer and Associated Newspapers for damages for publishing Shayler's original revelations in August 1997. It also demanded the return of money Shayler has earned as a result of writing about his experiences. 'I have been quiet long enough,' said Shayler from Paris last night. 'Why has there been no inquiry? Now the Government is trying to sue me and that is persecution. They should be made to pay.' Shadow Foreign Secretary Francis Maude said last night: 'There are two simple questions for Robin Cook: \"What was he told?\" and \"Did he mislead the public\"?' In his letter to Straw, Shayler claims he was approached by an MI6 officer, codenamed PT16/B, in late summer 1995 to discuss a case he could not talk about over the telephone.

Phone-in callers to the radio stations say, heck, the only people being framed are involved in gang violence - and if they did not do what they were accused of on this occasion, they sure as hell deserved to be locked up. One former officer said of the scandal: 'People know that most of those now suing the city had gang connections and they don't have much sympathy with that.' People who live with a death threat on their front lawns, as many Angelenos do, with their 'armed response' private security warning signs, are not going to shed too many tears when some shaven-headed gang member finds himself doing a '20-stretch' for something he may not have done. In James Ellroy's LA Confidential , the chief of police responds to a fictional corruption crisis by saying: 'Frankly, we must sate the public's clamour for blood by giving up some of our own.' Frankly, that is the least that is now required to restore confidence in a city where what the police were up to remained confidential for far too long.",

      "body": "<p>Diana 'Dede' Brooks had become more than used to the dramatic telephone call during her six years as chief executive of Sotheby's. The auction-winning bid by phone had become part and parcel of the big money dramas that would unfold weekly in the company's salesroom at its Manhattan headquarters. But none of that prepared her for the news she received by telephone last weekend.</p> <p>During a conference-call board meeting in New York it was decided that both Brooks and Alfred Taubman, the company's chairman and owner, should resign, becoming the latest victims of a massive price-fixing scandal engulfing the billion-dollar world of big money auctioneering.</p> <p>To many in the business the departures were inevitable. In January Sotheby's arch-rival, Christie's - between them they control more than 70 per cent by value of the art business - announced it was co-operating with a US Department of Justice inquiry into the setting up of an alleged illegal cartel between the two firms. In return, Christie's would receive immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>On Christmas Eve Christopher Davidge, Christie's former chief executive, had resigned, allegedly handing over a dossier on collusion between the companies to his successor. Christie's could therefore declare that any wrongdoing had taken place under a defunct regime and it was now putting its house in order.</p> <p>Sotheby's had been hung out to dry. Last week it was talking quietly of reaching a financial settlement with the Justice Department. That, however, is not the end of its troubles. It is also the subject of investigations by the Office of Fair Trading in London and competition regulators at the European Commission.</p> <p>What's more, it is facing more than 40 civil suits from sellers who believe they were over-charged for their business throughout most of the Nineties by exorbitant commission fees. The damages could run into tens of millions of pounds. The effect on Sotheby's share price was immediate. On 30 December the shares were changing hands for \u00a321.62 each. By Friday afternoon you could pick them up for just \u00a311.50.</p> <p>The only comfort that the 256-year-old firm could take from the events of last week is that Christie's is also named in the lawsuits; any deals it has made with the US authorities will not protect it from the potential hammer blow of civil litigation.</p> <p>'I think what we're seeing is a meltdown in the auction business,' said Anna Somers Cocks, editor of the highly regarded Art Newspaper , last week. 'The dominance of these two salesrooms may well be over.'</p> <p>For Dede Brooks it was an ignominious end to a dramatic run at the top of the firm.

      "bodyText": "Diana 'Dede' Brooks had become more than used to the dramatic telephone call during her six years as chief executive of Sotheby's. The auction-winning bid by phone had become part and parcel of the big money dramas that would unfold weekly in the company's salesroom at its Manhattan headquarters. But none of that prepared her for the news she received by telephone last weekend. During a conference-call board meeting in New York it was decided that both Brooks and Alfred Taubman, the company's chairman and owner, should resign, becoming the latest victims of a massive price-fixing scandal engulfing the billion-dollar world of big money auctioneering. To many in the business the departures were inevitable. In January Sotheby's arch-rival, Christie's - between them they control more than 70 per cent by value of the art business - announced it was co-operating with a US Department of Justice inquiry into the setting up of an alleged illegal cartel between the two firms. In return, Christie's would receive immunity from prosecution. On Christmas Eve Christopher Davidge, Christie's former chief executive, had resigned, allegedly handing over a dossier on collusion between the companies to his successor. Christie's could therefore declare that any wrongdoing had taken place under a defunct regime and it was now putting its house in order. Sotheby's had been hung out to dry. Last week it was talking quietly of reaching a financial settlement with the Justice Department. That, however, is not the end of its troubles. It is also the subject of investigations by the Office of Fair Trading in London and competition regulators at the European Commission. What's more, it is facing more than 40 civil suits from sellers who believe they were over-charged for their business throughout most of the Nineties by exorbitant commission fees. The damages could run into tens of millions of pounds. The effect on Sotheby's share price was immediate. On 30 December the shares were changing hands for \u00a321.62 each. By Friday afternoon you could pick them up for just \u00a311.50. The only comfort that the 256-year-old firm could take from the events of last week is that Christie's is also named in the lawsuits; any deals it has made with the US authorities will not protect it from the potential hammer blow of civil litigation. 'I think what we're seeing is a meltdown in the auction business,' said Anna Somers Cocks, editor of the highly regarded Art Newspaper , last week. 'The dominance of these two salesrooms may well be over.' For Dede Brooks it was an ignominious end to a dramatic run at the top of the firm. Known by turns as The Terminator and the Lady Thatcher of Sotheby's, she was credited with bringing financial nous, profitability and vitality to a once staid business. Many sneered at the sales of the effects of Jackie Onassis that she oversaw, but Brooks didn't care. She spent 10 months studying videotapes of veteran auctioneers, so that when the Onassis sale came round she could take to the podium and hammer out the lots herself. The sale proved to be a mammoth success and was televised around the world. She also understood the strength of the Sotheby's brand, using it to great effect in a series of forward-looking Internet ventures. But none of those initiatives changed the underlying volatility of the core art sales business, which has proved her undoing. In 1990, three years before she became chief executive, the art market crashed.

A sale of postwar art at the end of that year netted $4.75 million as against $17.2 million the year before, and the percentage of unsold lots went from 6 per cent to 60 per cent.

      "body": "<p>Unmarried women of England - a warning. If you are tempted to pop the question on Tuesday, think twice. Taking advantage of the first leap year of the New Millennium could result in your financial penury. </p> <p>The average wedding in the UK costs \u00a310,574, according to research by insurer Wedding Plan. And if you live in London, you will probably pay \u00a313,960, about \u00a35,000 more than someone getting married in the North West, where the average is \u00a38,615. </p> <p>If these sums sound ludicrously high to you, just add up the cost of the 'must haves' that will make your wedding a day to remember. Confetti.co.uk, a website designed to help the happy couple plan every last detail, has surveyed the average cost of everything needed for a wedding, from the bride's dress through to a video of the ceremony. </p> <p>The cheapest items on the list are the wedding announcements and bride's hairdressing and make-up at \u00a3100 each. Her shoes, provided she doesn't opt for a pair of Manolo Blahniks, will cost \u00a3125. But there are plenty of expensive items too. The bride's dress will cost an average of \u00a3700, her engagement ring \u00a3850, photography \u00a3400, marquee \u00a32,000, catering, food and drink \u00a32,500, and the honeymoon \u00a32,100. </p> <p>Vanessa, who is planning to get married in June, says it is possible to cut costs in some areas, but the savings usually end up being spent on other things.

      "bodyText": "Unmarried women of England - a warning. If you are tempted to pop the question on Tuesday, think twice. Taking advantage of the first leap year of the New Millennium could result in your financial penury. The average wedding in the UK costs \u00a310,574, according to research by insurer Wedding Plan. And if you live in London, you will probably pay \u00a313,960, about \u00a35,000 more than someone getting married in the North West, where the average is \u00a38,615. If these sums sound ludicrously high to you, just add up the cost of the 'must haves' that will make your wedding a day to remember. Confetti.co.uk, a website designed to help the happy couple plan every last detail, has surveyed the average cost of everything needed for a wedding, from the bride's dress through to a video of the ceremony. The cheapest items on the list are the wedding announcements and bride's hairdressing and make-up at \u00a3100 each. Her shoes, provided she doesn't opt for a pair of Manolo Blahniks, will cost \u00a3125. But there are plenty of expensive items too. The bride's dress will cost an average of \u00a3700, her engagement ring \u00a3850, photography \u00a3400, marquee \u00a32,000, catering, food and drink \u00a32,500, and the honeymoon \u00a32,100. Vanessa, who is planning to get married in June, says it is possible to cut costs in some areas, but the savings usually end up being spent on other things. She and her husband-to-be, William, are limiting the cost of their reception for 170 by providing a hog roast with new potatoes and salad, followed by strawberries grown by the bride's father. But the savings are being diverted in other directions: to the flowers (\u00a31,000), the bride's dress (a Jasper Conran costing \u00a31,900), and the honeymoon (from \u00a32,000 to \u00a34,000).

But if you have lived contentedly together for some time, are there any advantages in marrying, other than a feeling of commitment, family approval and the excuse for a good party? </p> <p>Beth Wilkins joint head of family law at solicitor Pannone &amp; Partners, says it depends who holds the purse strings: 'If you are the weaker party, you are strongly disadvantaged by living with someone and not marrying. </p> <p>'If you are the stronger one financially, there are great advantages in not marrying.' </p> <p>For the more vulnerable partner, often the woman but increasingly a lower-earning man, 'marriage gives security,' she says. 'You can live with a man for 50 years and if the relationship comes to an end, he can throw you out without a bean.' </p> <p>Wilkins recalls one woman who left her husband for another man on whom she lavished money and attention. When she fell ill with multiple sclerosis, her lover left her penniless, and although she was young, she ended up in a council old people's home. </p> <p>An extreme case, certainly, and a fate that is perhaps less likely to befall a woman with her own career and earnings. But if a well-paid woman gives up her job to care for children, she depends on her partner for money, with all the risks this entails, if they are not married. </p> <p>Wilkins says cohabitees who have lived with someone for a long time often misunderstand their rights. 'People say, \"I have lived with her for five years, so she is my common law wife\". There is no such thing. </p> <p>'If you have children, and you are not the breadwinner, the courts will usually ensure that provision is made for you during a break-up. </p> <p>'In the case of a cohabiting couple with children, the mother can make claims on behalf of the children for lump sums and maintenance under Schedule One of the Children Act. She can make no claim for herself. </p> <p>'If one partner in a cohabiting partnership dies, the other may be able to claim on his or her estate.' </p> <p>But the legal rights of unmarried partners are not as clear as those of married couples. And a man has no automatic right to a say in the upbringing of his children if he is not married to the mother, unless she agrees that he has official parental responsibility, or he gets it from a court. </p> <p>'It is not enough for the father's name to be on the birth certificate,' says Wilkins.' </p> <p>There are tax advantages to being married, even though one of the main ones, the married couple's tax allowance, will be abolished from 6 April for couples where both are under 65. From then, the allowance - now worth a little under \u00a3200 a year - will be paid only to couples where at least one partner was born on or before 5 April 1935. </p> <p>There are still tax breaks on the transfer of wealth between husbands and wives, however, so they have advantages over cohabitees. Sharon Linnard of accountant KPMG says: 'On the income side, there is little to choose. On the capital taxes side, there are advantages to being married.' </p> <p>There are moves afoot to improve the legal rights of cohabitees. Wilkins says: 'The current state of affairs is very, very sad, and needs reforming.' </p> <p>But she believes that while cohabitation remains controversial, it is unlikely to be put on the same legal footing as marriage. </p> <p>If you are cohabiting, or plan to, you can protect yourself. </p> <p>Younger couples whose incomes are reasonably evenly matched and who have no children have the least to gain from marrying. So it is perhaps understandable that the cost of a wedding along with all that family stress, is enough to put many couples off. But once the financial balance of power changes, especially if there are children, the pendulum swings in favour of marriage. Without children, the more wealth you have accumulated, the more likely it is that you will benefit from marriage. </p> <p>Wilkins says: ' When you get divorced, the possible claims by the wife, assuming she is financially weaker, are greater the longer you have been married. </p> <p>'If you live together without being married, these factors are irrelevant. You get no credit for the investment made in the relationship.' </p> <p>As the first large generation of cohabitees reaches middle to old age, we could see a rush to the register office. Beware marrying only because it seems the obvious move after a long period of living together, however. Wilkins says: 'I see a lot of cases of long cohabitation: then they marry and it does not succeed.' </p> <p><strong> Should you say I do?</strong><br> </p> <p> If you are flirting with the idea of marriage, here is a guide to the main financial and legal issues issues: </p> <p> \u0095 Made a small fortune on your dot.com shares? If you are married you may be able to save tax on the profits in a way that cohabitees cannot. Mike Warburton of accountant Grant Thornton explains: 'There is no restriction on assets being transferred from one spouse to another, so you can pass investments from one to the other without any tax applying.' </p> <p> \u0095 Each of you continues to benefit from an annual capital gains exemption, now \u00a37,100. If one of you has assets - such as shares or investment property - that would bring profits of more than \u00a37,100 if sold, you can transfer some of it into the spouse's name to take advantage of their allowance. </p> <p> \u0095 Similarly, if one partner pays a higher rate of income tax than the other, or one pays no tax at all, you can put investments in their name to cut the tax bill on interest or dividends from the investment. A warning: these devices can only work if the transfer of ownership is unconditional. So, if you divorce and demand the money back, you could also be landed with a tax bill. </p> <p> \u0095 Married couples also get a better deal over inheritance tax than the unmarried. Husbands and wives can pass as much as they like to each other without triggering a bill. Cohabitees can pass on no more than \u00a3231,000 (the allowance usually rises with inflation each year). This is the annual personal exemption for inheritance tax. </p> <p> \u0095 Husbands and wives normally inherit pensions if one partner dies. Most company schemes will pay a pension, after death of the member, to a surviving spouse. Alternatively, if you are buying an annuity you can buy one with provision for a spouse built in. </p> <p>Cohabitees may state their wishes in writing to the trustees of their pension scheme, but there are no guarantees. </p> <p>Peter Magliocco, of the Annuity Bureau, an adviser specialising in providing annuities from personal pensions and 'money purchase' company schemes, says you can ask on retirement that a pension would pass to partner if you died first. </p> <p>But annuity companies say you need to be able to prove financial dependence. Some insist you do this when the annuity is taken out. Others insist you try to prove it at death. But proving dependence is a grey area. </p> <p> \u0095 The courts can earmark regular pension payments - and from next year, lump sum pension settlements can be agreed when married couples divorce. But cohabitees don't have pension-splitting rights. </p> <p> \u0095 When one unmarried partner dies, the other has no automatic right to inherit from them. If one partner in a marriage dies without a will, the laws of intestacy kick in and a certain amount of the estate automatically passes to the spouse.

The family had been relying on his state and occupational pensions. </p> <p>The woman went to the local citizens advice bureau, which helped her complete an application for a crisis loan, but at the Benefits Agency office she was turned away without anyone looking at the form and told she could not make a claim until she had completed an Income Support form. </p> <p>Physically and emotionally drained, she arranged to return at a later date.

The agency manager wanted her to return to complete the claim, but she was too upset and did not have enough money to get back into town. The CAB pressed the agency to award her a 'widow's lump sum payment' if she returned the next day. It was successful: she was awarded \u00a31,000. </p> <p>Her story shows why the Social Fund (SF) is so loathed by welfare rights advisers - and why there are so many calls for its reform. It is largely designed to help people survive in emergencies when they are struggling with very little money. For people claiming Income Support and other benefits, there is nothing built in for buying a new cooker, for instance, if the old one packs up, or for buying a bed if you are offered an unfurnished flat. In these situations, the usual step is to apply for a 'budgeting' or 'crisis' loan from the fund. A budgeting loan is for intermittent expenses such as a new cooker; a crisis loan is for immediate short-term needs. But there are problems: </p> <p> \u0095 You can be too poor to get a loan. </p> <p> \u0095 You do not have a legal entitlement to a payout. </p> <p> \u0095 You do not have right of appeal to an independent tribunal. </p> <p> \u0095 The amount you receive is heavily affected by the size of the local fund budget and the time you apply. (Although the maximum budgeting loan allowed by law is \u00a31,000, the maximum being paid out in Liverpool is \u00a3145.31 because of the region's many applicants.) </p> <p>In its Welfare Benefits Handbook, the Child Poverty Action Group concludes: 'Critics have likened the SF to a lottery, because whether you receive a payment can depend on when you apply and where you live.' </p> <p>The Church Action on Poverty campaign has become involved and will be launching a campaign to reform the fund on 18 April. </p> <p>So why is the fund in such a parlous state when the Government is making such a song and dance about reducing child poverty and social exclusion? Perhaps the Government is simply afraid of the costs. </p> <p>Significantly, perhaps, the approach of the Social Exclusion Unit has been to look at themes - such as the availability of bank accounts to the poor - rather than trying to tackle the failures of the benefits system or think about the sums of money people have in their pockets. </p> <p>Some welfare advisers believe the Government has added to the problem. In April last year, the Department of Social Security changed from a discretionary system to a computerised and purely objective approach for applications for a budgeting loan. Sue Forster of Liverpool CAB says: 'We feel that the present situation has been made worse by the current government. Under the new system, someone who has just lost their job and may just have lost their house cannot qualify for a grant. It's absolutely outrageous in this day and age that someone in this position cannot get basics such as a bed or a cooker. And there are many people in this situation.' </p> <p>In the past, people who were really desperate for money were often given grants that they did not need to repay. But, just as students are now offered loans rather than grants, so benefit claimants are also expected to repay the money they get. </p> <p>The amount you can receive from the Fund is capped at \u00a31,000, but many categories of people do not qualify for this. Your entitlement to a budgeting loan, for instance, is determined by the size of your household and the length of time you have been claiming. A single person, claiming for the minimum entitlement period of six months, is eligible for just under \u00a3400, according to current rules. </p> <p>Under the old system, some discretion would be shown to, for example, a teenager who was thrown out of his parents' house for telling them he was gay.

CGU shareholders would be deemed to have the same number of shares in the new company, CGNU, while Norwich Union shareholders would get 48 new CGNU shares for each 100 shares they currently own.

The Ecology Building Society has dealt with mortgages for converting a signal box, a lighthouse, an oast house, a water mill and an east London pub, among others. </p> <p>'If the building is redundant from its original purpose, from an environmental point of view it is better to have some use out of it rather than it becoming derelict,' said the society's marketing manager, George Penaluna. </p> <p>Converting a pub, a mill or lighthouse to a home involves considerable work. The Ecology Building Society will lend up to 80 per cent of the current value at any one time - allowing the mortgage to be increased as the work and the property's commensurate value increases. This is subject to income and status and outline planning permission being in place. </p> <p>Some mortgage lenders will only hand over more money at fixed stages - such as the roof going on, or the windows going in - so if you are seeking an advance to fund such a conversion ask how the money will be lent as well as how much. </p> <p>You also need to know that all the necessary permissions are in place. The building may be listed, or in a conservation area. Some local authorities, such as Ashford Borough Council in Kent, have well thought-out guidelines and advice leaflets. You may also be faced with moving a property from business rate to council tax, involving the local valuation officer. </p> <p>You need to be aware of the fickle nature of property booms, particularly outside London and the South East, when enthusiasm for urban and rural conversions may wane with prices. </p> <p>You may be buying a conversion or refurbishment from a professional developer. Redrow Homes, for example, found high demand for their properties on the site of Eastney Barracks, Portsmouth, the former home of the Royal Marines. The project included refurbishment of the old barrack block, armoury and clock tower. 'There is a lot to be said for the traditional feel and the space,' said Redrow Homes managing director Jackie Day. 'The majority of people buying were looking for second, or even third homes and very few needed finance.' </p> <p>But even a commercial developer approaches such projects with caution. 'If you take a clean piece of paper to a clean build you have known costs,' said Jackie Day, 'With a refurbishment, it is not until you get stuck in that you know what you've got.' And not every empty barn or mill should be viewed as a potential home conversion. Turning agricultural buildings into residences can have a profound influence on an area's economic potential. </p> <p>About 20 years ago the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) campaigned to prevent picturesque rural barns being turned into homes without other uses first being explored. A system of government grants to repair barns was put in place, although this grant system has been superseded. </p> <p>Philip Venning, secretary of SPAB, points out that modern economic uses might include anything from farm shops to recording studios. Conversion work should 'respect the historic fabric' of the building and one problem was that major structural work - such as wall and floor strengthening - often meant a barn was all but demolished during conversion. 'What you end up with is a new building in the footprint of the old building,' he said. </p> <p>If a conversion does involve this level of demolition and rebuild, there could be a potential problem in store when you come to sell, counsels Tony Lewis, chairman of the residential valuation and survey panel of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. </p> <p>With a new build there is a requirement for guarantees to be in place from the architect, or the National House Building Council which confirms the standard of the work. This is not a requirement with a conversion, even if the work all but involves demolition and total rebuilding. The owners may face a problem when they come to sell. </p> <p>Pollution may also be an issue, including such things as asbestos, or farm chemicals. 'I looked at one nice barn recently and it had an old sheep dip outside,' said Lewis. 'The client hadn't even considered contamination problems.' </p> <p>You may end up dealing with something more profound than sheep dip. </p> <p>Dr Jeffrey West, secretary of the Anglican Advisory Board for Redundant Churches, points out that an archaeological find could involve the county archaeologist and, if you find a body, the Home Office will have to be informed. </p> <p>Despite popular belief that churches are tumbling onto the market because of dwindling congregations, very few make it into private homes. Just 184 Anglican churches were converted to residential use between 1969 and 1998, out of 1,544 churches dealt with. If you are interested in an Anglican church, a good starting point is the local diocese or the Church Commissioners in London, but again make sure your distant spires are eligible for dream home status. 'We have a case currently where a private individual bought a church and it was not approved by the local authority for residential use. He still owns the church.'</p>",

And not every empty barn or mill should be viewed as a potential home conversion. Turning agricultural buildings into residences can have a profound influence on an area's economic potential. About 20 years ago the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) campaigned to prevent picturesque rural barns being turned into homes without other uses first being explored. A system of government grants to repair barns was put in place, although this grant system has been superseded. Philip Venning, secretary of SPAB, points out that modern economic uses might include anything from farm shops to recording studios. Conversion work should 'respect the historic fabric' of the building and one problem was that major structural work - such as wall and floor strengthening - often meant a barn was all but demolished during conversion. 'What you end up with is a new building in the footprint of the old building,' he said. If a conversion does involve this level of demolition and rebuild, there could be a potential problem in store when you come to sell, counsels Tony Lewis, chairman of the residential valuation and survey panel of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. With a new build there is a requirement for guarantees to be in place from the architect, or the National House Building Council which confirms the standard of the work. This is not a requirement with a conversion, even if the work all but involves demolition and total rebuilding. The owners may face a problem when they come to sell. Pollution may also be an issue, including such things as asbestos, or farm chemicals. 'I looked at one nice barn recently and it had an old sheep dip outside,' said Lewis. 'The client hadn't even considered contamination problems.' You may end up dealing with something more profound than sheep dip. Dr Jeffrey West, secretary of the Anglican Advisory Board for Redundant Churches, points out that an archaeological find could involve the county archaeologist and, if you find a body, the Home Office will have to be informed. Despite popular belief that churches are tumbling onto the market because of dwindling congregations, very few make it into private homes. Just 184 Anglican churches were converted to residential use between 1969 and 1998, out of 1,544 churches dealt with. If you are interested in an Anglican church, a good starting point is the local diocese or the Church Commissioners in London, but again make sure your distant spires are eligible for dream home status. 'We have a case currently where a private individual bought a church and it was not approved by the local authority for residential use. He still owns the church.'",

Nearly half of them - 210 boxes - are from a connoisseur's private hoard. Dozens of email inquiries from prospective bidders are reaching Christie's from America, Greece and Venezuela. </p> <p>Pre-sale estimates range from \u00a3100 to \u00a39,000. Auction prices have recently hit a record \u00a36,400 - at Christie's Geneva in December, for a lot comprising five four-packs of Davidoff Dom P\u00e9rignon, produced in the 1980s. </p> <p>Brian Ebbesen, one of Christie's cigar specialists, will be distributing his auction catalogue at Havana's second annual cigar festival this week. He will be guest auctioneer at the festival's charity sale of limited-edition cigars, to be attended by 1,500 devotees, including Fidel Castro himself. </p> <p>The only cloud hanging over the event is the persistent report that the Cuban state cigar factory, Partagas, has run out of tobacco. </p> <p>Partagas produces some 50 brands, including the Montecristo No.2, the fabled, torpedo-shaped Champagne of Havana cigars, over six inches long. None of these has reached Britain since October, but in Christie's sale there are some perfectly preserved and matured ones from the 1970s and 80s estimated at between \u00a3160 and \u00a3200 for a box of 10 made in 1986, to \u00a31,000 to \u00a31,500 for boxes of 25 made in 1973. </p> <p>These are now rare. So should you invest in them? The answer is: only if you want to see your money go up in smoke. Cigar aficionados do not collect vintage cigars, or even invest in them. They smoke them. </p> <p>Ebbesen advises: 'If I wanted to put money into cigars, I wouldn't buy at auction. I'd buy young cigars from a cigar merchant or in Cuba.' </p> <p>Reason: the high-estimate vintage cigars in the sale were mostly bought when young and have had only one owner, who has either changed his preference in cigars or died. </p> <p>They could still appreciate in price, but most of their potential value has already been achieved - during the two or three decades that they have spent maturing quietly in the darkness of the humidors. </p> <p>Most buyers at auction, Ebbesen says, are seasoned cigar smokers who already have a clear idea of the style and name of vintage cigar they want to buy to smoke. There is no pre-sale tasting; after all, you can hardly put back a half-smoked butt into a box of 25 Montecristos. </p> <p>A few buyers, having successfully bid a hefty \u00a34,000-\u00a35,000 for, say, a box of 25 Davidoff Chteau Yquem, instead of scurrying home to stash the trophy in their humidor, carry it over the road from Christie's auction house to Ch\u00e9, the St James's cigar lounge, bar and restaurant - and promptly put a match to one. Ebbesen is sometimes invited to partake. Investment? It all ends up in the ash tray. </p> <p>But for those who hanker after tasting 'a bit of age' in their cigars, rather than buying for investment, the sale offers cigars several years old at estimates that do not seem exorbitant when compared with the shop price of current-production cigars. </p> <p>Take those ten Montecristo No.2s of 1986, for example: the auction estimate of \u00a3160-\u00a3200 for the box works out at \u00a316-\u00a320 each; Fox, the St James's cigar merchant's is asking \u00a3316 for a fresh box of 25 - \u00a312.64 each. </p> <p>But Tim Cox, manager of Fox's - known to customers as 'the smoking gun' because a cigar is never far from his hand - informed me courteously that he had no Montecristo No.2s left. </p> <p>If I wanted some, I would have to join a waiting list of 50. And it dawned on me that if I joined the bidding for that little lot of 10 Montecristos at Christie's I could find myself swept up in a saleroom price spiral. </p> <p>That's what can happen to a tenderfoot on the cigar trail. </p> <p>Back at Christie's, Ebbesen recommended a number of alternative lots of mature cigars to suit the new enthu siast with a developing taste. What about a box of 25 medium- to full-bodied Cohiba Siglo IV, 5 5/8ins long, produced in 1994, estimated at \u00a3300-\u00a3400, about \u00a314 each? Current-production specimens cost about \u00a315 in cigar shops. </p> <p>Never mind the vicissitudes of cigar-buying: some people cannot even face smoking one, although they enjoy the aroma of other people's. </p> <p>For the mystified and apprehensive, here is some no-nonsense advice about how to smoke a cigar. </p> <p> \u0095 First, slice off the end that goes in your mouth with a sharp blade; not a V-shaped cut or a pierced hole (which would concentrate the heat in your mouth) but a straight cut exposing a wide diameter, so that you can draw freely on all three rolled layers of tobacco. Do not hack so extravagantly that you cut off the cap, the glued-on dome of tobacco that stops the cigar unravelling. </p> <p> \u0095 Firing up: use a match (cedar-wood for preference) instead of a butane or petrol lighter that could leave an unwelcome taste. Before putting the cigar in your mouth, hold it away from you and char the end with the match flame. Roll the cigar, so the end chars evenly and can absorb a flame evenly at the first draw. </p> <p> \u0095 Then put the cigar in your mouth, hold it about a centimetre below the charred tip - and draw. You will be rewarded with a spectacular nine-inch sheet of flame shooting up from the tip. You're on. </p> <p> \u0095 Continue drawing. Roll the smoke round your mouth to get the full flavour. Aficionados insist they do not inhale. That includes Ebbesen, who was a non-smoker when introduced to cigars at Christie's. Some cigarette smokers do inhale cigars. </p> <p> \u0095 The ash? Don't be anxious to flick it off; it helps to keep the cigar at an even temperature. And the vexed question of the paper band? Leave it on until the cigar has shrunk a bit and it has become loose; otherwise its gum might stick to the outer wrapper-leaf and rip it. </p> <p> \u0095 Discard your cigar when it is two-thirds or three-quarters smoked and beginning to taste bitter. Lay it to rest in a dignified manner in the ash tray. </p> <p>Back on the trail of Montecristo No.2, I pleaded with Tatiana Camacho, UK representative of Havana cigars and a director of the British cigar importer Hunters and Frankau. Could she get me some No.2s? </p> <p>Last October's were the last, she confirmed; Britain had received its full quota of 25,000 'sticks', 5 per cent of production. There was a shortage of extra-long tobacco leaves needed for such big cigars, and a shortage of skilled rollers capable of making the torpedo shape. </p> <p>There was also a shortage of Cohiba Robustos (4 7/8in), she said. Since last year's quota of 30,000 sticks, nothing. If you are bent on investing, take note. There is a box of 25 of them, 1997, estimated at \u00a3280-\u00a3380, in the sale. </p> <p>And was it true that Partagas had run out of tobacco? She had heard the talk, she said. 'It sounds like a joke, but it makes you want to cry.' </p> <p>\u0095 Christie's (020 7839 9060). Fox (0171 493 9009). Ch\u00e9 (0171 747 9380).</p>",

For instance, the average 40-year-old could have clocked up a deferred pension from an occupational scheme, a transfer plan (funds from an occupational scheme are invested with an insurance company), a group personal pension, a personal pension and an old-style personal pension - the retirement annuity contract. </p> <p>Add to this additional voluntary contributions (AVCs), freestanding AVCs and, from April 2001, stakeholder pensions and you could have a potted history of UK pension provision in your filing cabinet. Monitoring so many pension pots, which are governed by radically different tax regimes and benefit rules, can be a nightmare. </p> <p>For those with a minimum of \u00a350,000 to invest and who are financially sophisticated, help is at hand in the form of self-invested personal pensions, or Sipps, which allow you to transfer your various pension pots into one fund over which you can make the investment decisions yourself. Pouring all your pension pots into one receptacle has numerous attractions, apart from the 'tidying up' aspect of having all (or most) of your pension arrangements under one umbrella. </p> <p>You should remember that it is not always advantageous to transfer occupational pension funds into a Sipp, so it is essential to take advice from a pensions specialist. </p> <p>In essence, Sipps are upmarket personal pension plans and as such are subject to the same contribution limits, tax and benefit rules as personal pensions. Although Sipps do not come cheap, the larger the fund, the more cost effective they usually become. There is usually a set-up charge and an annual management fee on top of transaction charges for dealing in shares and unit linked funds. Property can also be purchased via a Sipp and providers will quote their own tariffs for such transactions. </p> <p>Another advantage is the wide choice of investments on offer. Sipps permit investment in individual shares, unit and investment trusts, futures and options, insurance company funds and commercial property (within certain limitations). You can also use the assets of the fund as collateral when borrowing to buy commercial property. </p> <p>For the older individual - for example a man who has built up a substantial occupational pension fund, and who leaves a company scheme, say, 10 years before normal retirement date - there may be advantages in transferring the occupational fund into a Sipp because of the higher benefits payable on death before retirement. </p> <p>In this instance, his widow would receive up to 25 per cent of the fund as a tax-free cash lump sum and the balance as an annuity, or she could do income drawdown. His former occupational pension, by contrast, would normally have paid her only a modest pension based on accrued service and salary at the date of his leaving service. </p> <p>The death benefits can be even greater for Sipps not originating from an occupational pension transfer. If the Sipp holder dies before retirement, the entire fund value can be paid to a spouse or dependant, free of inheritance tax. </p> <p>This is because Sipps (like most personal pensions) are written under trust and the death benefits can be paid out expeditiously to beneficiaries because the trustees operate what is called 'discretionary disposal'. This means the proceeds escape having to go through probate and inheritance tax. </p> <p>Wealthy individuals often want to delay having to buy an annuity for as long as possible - because of low annuity rates or because they have other assets to live on and do not have an immediate need to take all their pension. </p> <p>Such people use income drawdown, whereby they keep the bulk of their fund invested in equities and withdraw small amounts (within certain Inland Revenue limits) when required. </p> <p>The rules on income drawdown are far more flexible under the personal pension tax regime than under the occupational pension tax rules, so a large amount of Sipp money stems from this source. </p> <p>Sipps are available from many of the major life insurers such as CGU, Canada Life, Eagle Star, Legal &amp; General, National Mutual Life, Norwich Union, Axa Sun Life, Wintherthur and most of the Scottish pension providers. </p> <p>Other providers include Alliance Trust, Brewin Dolphin, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite, Cater Allen, Close Wealth Management, Cripps Harries Hall, Greig Middleton, HSBC, IPS, Partridge Muir Warren, Pointon York, Rathbones and Rea Brothers. If you are looking for a low-cost, no frills, DIY Sipp, Alliance Trust's is extremely cheap to run in that it has no establishment fee and charges for transactions only. However, it does not permit commercial property investment. </p> <p>It is essential that you take independent advice to ascertain whether a Sipp is appropriate for your particular financial circumstances. Even if it is, with over 30 Sipp plans on the market, you will need help selecting one which fits your investment requirements and the level of transactions you are likely to make. </p> <p>Independent financial adviser Nick Bamford said: 'Sipps are ideal for people who want to take control of their pension fund and who may wish to use the fund to buy a commercial property for their business.' </p> <p>David Hanrahan of accountants RSM Robson Rhodes said: 'The superior death benefits and flexibility of how and when you take income and tax-free cash make Sipps a very attractive alternative to more traditional pension contracts.'</p>",

In this instance, his widow would receive up to 25 per cent of the fund as a tax-free cash lump sum and the balance as an annuity, or she could do income drawdown. His former occupational pension, by contrast, would normally have paid her only a modest pension based on accrued service and salary at the date of his leaving service. The death benefits can be even greater for Sipps not originating from an occupational pension transfer. If the Sipp holder dies before retirement, the entire fund value can be paid to a spouse or dependant, free of inheritance tax. This is because Sipps (like most personal pensions) are written under trust and the death benefits can be paid out expeditiously to beneficiaries because the trustees operate what is called 'discretionary disposal'. This means the proceeds escape having to go through probate and inheritance tax. Wealthy individuals often want to delay having to buy an annuity for as long as possible - because of low annuity rates or because they have other assets to live on and do not have an immediate need to take all their pension. Such people use income drawdown, whereby they keep the bulk of their fund invested in equities and withdraw small amounts (within certain Inland Revenue limits) when required. The rules on income drawdown are far more flexible under the personal pension tax regime than under the occupational pension tax rules, so a large amount of Sipp money stems from this source. Sipps are available from many of the major life insurers such as CGU, Canada Life, Eagle Star, Legal &amp; General, National Mutual Life, Norwich Union, Axa Sun Life, Wintherthur and most of the Scottish pension providers. Other providers include Alliance Trust, Brewin Dolphin, Carr Sheppards Crosthwaite, Cater Allen, Close Wealth Management, Cripps Harries Hall, Greig Middleton, HSBC, IPS, Partridge Muir Warren, Pointon York, Rathbones and Rea Brothers. If you are looking for a low-cost, no frills, DIY Sipp, Alliance Trust's is extremely cheap to run in that it has no establishment fee and charges for transactions only. However, it does not permit commercial property investment. It is essential that you take independent advice to ascertain whether a Sipp is appropriate for your particular financial circumstances. Even if it is, with over 30 Sipp plans on the market, you will need help selecting one which fits your investment requirements and the level of transactions you are likely to make. Independent financial adviser Nick Bamford said: 'Sipps are ideal for people who want to take control of their pension fund and who may wish to use the fund to buy a commercial property for their business.' David Hanrahan of accountants RSM Robson Rhodes said: 'The superior death benefits and flexibility of how and when you take income and tax-free cash make Sipps a very attractive alternative to more traditional pension contracts.'",

      "body": "<p>The investment trust industry has a long and impressive history, dating back to the time of Disraeli. But serious questions have been asked over recent years about its relevance in today's investment market. </p> <p>Investment trusts started as pooled investment vehicles for individuals seeking international exposure, but their share registers have become dominated by institutions. Having developed their investment skills, however, this type of shareholder has been looking for a way out. As a result, the industry has been trying to reawaken the interest of 'the man in the street'. </p> <p>Last October the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) launched the 'its' campaign. Around 170 of its member companies contributed \u00a317.5 million for the first year of a three-year campaign aimed at raising consumer awareness of what investment trusts are and what they offer. TV advertisements have been appearing since October, supported by more than 3,000 posters throughout the country. </p> <p>Backed up by the promotional efforts of individual trusts and management companies, the underlying aim is to reverse the current split of investment trust ownership of one-third individual and two-thirds institutional. This should give trusts more stability, and, in conjunction with the share buyback operations being carried out by a number of trusts, should help stop discounts widening - often seen as one of the biggest drawbacks of investment trust ownership. </p> <p>AITC director general Daniel Godfrey has been widely praised for getting the campaign up and running. A similar generic campaign, suggested for the unit trust industry years ago, never got off the ground because some major companies refused to put their hands in their pockets. Even so, not everyone is happy at the way things are going. </p> <p>Four months into a three-year campaign hardly seems a reasonable time to judge its success or otherwise, but already criticisms are beginning to emerge. Disputes have arisen over the impact of the 'its' advertising. After the first two months, the AITC announced that NOP research showed that over 52 per cent of the target audience recognised the 'its' advertising. A survey carried out by Friends Ivory &amp; Sime (FIS) - one of the sponsors - however, showed just 16 per cent of respondents remembered the 'its' adverts. </p> <p>While the difference was put down to the fact that the AITC survey was prompted - pictures of the 'its' adverts were shown to respondents who were asked if they recognised them, while the FIS survey was unprompted - the argument does expose some underlying misgivings about the campaign. </p> <p>FIS, which has invested \u00a31m in the campaign so far, has been inadvertently caught up in this debate. </p> <p>Marketing manager John Yule says: 'You can't change things overnight. It's a long-term campaign and getting brand awareness takes time.' He does question however, whether they should be promoting investment trusts as such. 'People aren't bothered whether it's a unit trust or an investment trust; they buy Isas and pensions. It's the wrapper that's more important.' </p> <p>Measuring the success or otherwise of the 'its' campaign was never going to be easy.

      "bodyText": "The investment trust industry has a long and impressive history, dating back to the time of Disraeli. But serious questions have been asked over recent years about its relevance in today's investment market. Investment trusts started as pooled investment vehicles for individuals seeking international exposure, but their share registers have become dominated by institutions. Having developed their investment skills, however, this type of shareholder has been looking for a way out. As a result, the industry has been trying to reawaken the interest of 'the man in the street'. Last October the Association of Investment Trust Companies (AITC) launched the 'its' campaign. Around 170 of its member companies contributed \u00a317.5 million for the first year of a three-year campaign aimed at raising consumer awareness of what investment trusts are and what they offer. TV advertisements have been appearing since October, supported by more than 3,000 posters throughout the country. Backed up by the promotional efforts of individual trusts and management companies, the underlying aim is to reverse the current split of investment trust ownership of one-third individual and two-thirds institutional. This should give trusts more stability, and, in conjunction with the share buyback operations being carried out by a number of trusts, should help stop discounts widening - often seen as one of the biggest drawbacks of investment trust ownership. AITC director general Daniel Godfrey has been widely praised for getting the campaign up and running. A similar generic campaign, suggested for the unit trust industry years ago, never got off the ground because some major companies refused to put their hands in their pockets. Even so, not everyone is happy at the way things are going. Four months into a three-year campaign hardly seems a reasonable time to judge its success or otherwise, but already criticisms are beginning to emerge. Disputes have arisen over the impact of the 'its' advertising. After the first two months, the AITC announced that NOP research showed that over 52 per cent of the target audience recognised the 'its' advertising. A survey carried out by Friends Ivory &amp; Sime (FIS) - one of the sponsors - however, showed just 16 per cent of respondents remembered the 'its' adverts. While the difference was put down to the fact that the AITC survey was prompted - pictures of the 'its' adverts were shown to respondents who were asked if they recognised them, while the FIS survey was unprompted - the argument does expose some underlying misgivings about the campaign. FIS, which has invested \u00a31m in the campaign so far, has been inadvertently caught up in this debate. Marketing manager John Yule says: 'You can't change things overnight. It's a long-term campaign and getting brand awareness takes time.' He does question however, whether they should be promoting investment trusts as such. 'People aren't bothered whether it's a unit trust or an investment trust; they buy Isas and pensions. It's the wrapper that's more important.' Measuring the success or otherwise of the 'its' campaign was never going to be easy. Investment trust groups were always likely to benefit from the wider investment powers allowed under the Isa rules compared with Peps, and new business flows depend a lot on general market sentiment. Richard Eliott Lockhart, sales director of Matrix Money Management, feels the campaign has raised awareness, but acknowledges that this won't have fed through into sales as yet. 'If that is going to happen, several other things have to happen first,' he says. 'The current round of share buybacks has to prove that they are setting a floor level under the discount, and the trusts themselves need to pay IFAs initial and renewal commission.' Buybacks, made feasible by the abolition of ACT (advance corporation tax) last April, are where trusts buy their own shares. Charles Cade, investment trust analyst at Merrill Lynch, says most trusts now have the authority to effect buybacks, and they are taking place at a rate of 50-60 per month. So far around \u00a31.8 billion worth of shares have been taken out of the market this way.

      "body": "<p>Catching a successful company early is a dream for most investors. The potential for business growth is far greater than for established companies in the FTSE-100 index. The problem is, how do you pick a winner? </p> <p>Trying to judge future business prospects requires heaps of information and is often a gamble. And it is tough for private investors to gain access to private equity investments at all. </p> <p>Typically, minimum private equity investments in a business may be \u00a310 million - putting such deals in the hands of institutional investors such as pension funds, or the very rich. </p> <p>'Private investors have learnt that you can make good returns from venture-backed capital. But it is very difficult as a private investor to build a portfolio,' says David Thorp, vice-president of the British Venture Capital Association. </p> <p>However, investment trusts which put their money in venture and development capital, or private equity, can provide a way for smaller investors to gain exposure to this high-risk sector. </p> <p>They enable private investors to stake smaller amounts of money and also reduce risk by investing in a wide spread of start-ups. </p> <p>Schroder Ventures Investment Trust, for example, is a fund of funds that invests in all 25 Schroder Ventures funds. On their own these funds are closed to retail investors because of their high levels of minimum investment. </p> <p>Andrew Williams, managing director of Schroder Ventures Holding, says the risks of investing in a venture capital investment trust are lower than perceived. 'The risk (in venture capital) is if you back a horse that doesn't come home. But we are invested in 150 companies,' he says. </p> <p>With Schroder Ventures Investment Trust, not only is the risk spread across many companies, it is also spread from Canada across Europe to Japan. As initial investment takes place at different times, the trust is not exposed to any one part of the economic cycle, says Williams' </p> <p>'Backing early-stage companies is very risky, but if you have a portfolio of them, it is a sound investment,' the BVCA's Thorp says. </p> <p>The association's performance statistics show venture capital investment has outperformed all the FTSE UK indices. On average, venture and development investment trusts posted returns of around 30 per cent over the past six months, according to financial data provider Moneyfacts. And the Association of Investment Trust Companies says the Venture and Development Capital sector was the best performing investment trust sector over five and 10 years. </p> <p>However, the shares of venture capital investment trusts are more volatile than those of trusts holding blue chips. Average volatility - showing how widely share prices fluctuate - of trusts in the sector is 7.06 over five years, according to Moneyfacts, against 4.45 for trusts in the UK General sector. </p> <p>The bulk of venture capital is used to finance existing companies which are in the process of restructuring.

      "bodyText": "Catching a successful company early is a dream for most investors. The potential for business growth is far greater than for established companies in the FTSE-100 index. The problem is, how do you pick a winner? Trying to judge future business prospects requires heaps of information and is often a gamble. And it is tough for private investors to gain access to private equity investments at all. Typically, minimum private equity investments in a business may be \u00a310 million - putting such deals in the hands of institutional investors such as pension funds, or the very rich. 'Private investors have learnt that you can make good returns from venture-backed capital. But it is very difficult as a private investor to build a portfolio,' says David Thorp, vice-president of the British Venture Capital Association. However, investment trusts which put their money in venture and development capital, or private equity, can provide a way for smaller investors to gain exposure to this high-risk sector. They enable private investors to stake smaller amounts of money and also reduce risk by investing in a wide spread of start-ups. Schroder Ventures Investment Trust, for example, is a fund of funds that invests in all 25 Schroder Ventures funds. On their own these funds are closed to retail investors because of their high levels of minimum investment. Andrew Williams, managing director of Schroder Ventures Holding, says the risks of investing in a venture capital investment trust are lower than perceived. 'The risk (in venture capital) is if you back a horse that doesn't come home. But we are invested in 150 companies,' he says. With Schroder Ventures Investment Trust, not only is the risk spread across many companies, it is also spread from Canada across Europe to Japan. As initial investment takes place at different times, the trust is not exposed to any one part of the economic cycle, says Williams' 'Backing early-stage companies is very risky, but if you have a portfolio of them, it is a sound investment,' the BVCA's Thorp says. The association's performance statistics show venture capital investment has outperformed all the FTSE UK indices. On average, venture and development investment trusts posted returns of around 30 per cent over the past six months, according to financial data provider Moneyfacts. And the Association of Investment Trust Companies says the Venture and Development Capital sector was the best performing investment trust sector over five and 10 years. However, the shares of venture capital investment trusts are more volatile than those of trusts holding blue chips. Average volatility - showing how widely share prices fluctuate - of trusts in the sector is 7.06 over five years, according to Moneyfacts, against 4.45 for trusts in the UK General sector. The bulk of venture capital is used to finance existing companies which are in the process of restructuring. Typically, a large company spins off a subsidiary and venture capitalists supply sufficient private equity to allow management to buy the business out. Candover Investment Trust, for example, does not invest in start-up businesses, but rather in management buyouts from maturer companies, sometimes where the business has been listed on the stock exchange. Schroder Ventures has backed Shire Pharmaceuticals, now listed on the main London Stock Exchange, and Tetley Tea, which used to be part of the Allied Domecq conglomerate. Schroder Ventures recently backed a 700-bed hospital being set up outside Delhi. 'It's not all grasping fast-buck stuff - you can also do things with a social purpose,' says Williams. Foreign &amp; Colonial's Enterprise investment trust has outperformed all others in its sector over the past 10 years, with the price of its shares increasing more than tenfold. 'Five years ago, Enterprise was almost totally held by institutions, but there are now around 25,000 private investors,' says Rod Richards, director of F&amp;C Ventures, which manages the Enterprise trust. After 10 years of strong stock market performance, many of Enterprise's investments have been sold or have gone public, so the trust now holds a larger proportion of cash and quoted securities, he says. 'It will take us a bit of time to find new deals to invest in... there is now more competition to do what we are trying to do.' Although the boom in the technology industry is a factor for venture capitalists, Enterprise is not a technology-oriented investment trust, says Richards. Similarly for Candover, technology is not the main game, as its investment is spread across diverse industrial sectors, such as packaging, chemicals and engineering. Over the past 10 years, Candover has produced a compound annual share price return of 20.7 per cent, compared with 14.3 per cent for the FTSE All Share index, says stockbroker Cazenove, which has recently issued a buy recommendation for the stock.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It couldn't happen. Could it? Whispers in the Square Mile suggest that the City is now thinking the unthinkable: BT will no longer exist by the end of the year. </p> <p>It sounds ridiculous. The company that almost singlehandedly turned the UK into a nation of shareholders when it was privatised in 1984, that is the UK stock market's third-largest business, and that made a profit of nearly \u00a34.3 billion in its last financial year, is seen to be increasingly vulnerable to a takeover bid. </p> <p>The company's value fell to just over \u00a360 billion earlier this month - only a fraction higher than its worth in July 1998. Comments by the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, that the telecommunications watchdog, Oftel, was keen to introduce competition to BT's local network earlier than the company had anticipated, helped knock the share price down by 17 per cent in just one day. </p> <p>BT was apparently livid with Brown for meddling in its and the regulator's affairs. But the slump in BT's share price told a much more interesting story than a mere falling-out between New Labour and big business. The fact that BT looked likely to lose one of its biggest cash generators earlier than had been thought sent the market into panic. </p> <p>The City, already concerned about BT's performance following a 6 per cent drop in third-quarter profits announced earlier this year, when the company announced it was axing 3,000 jobs, took fright at Brown's declaration. </p> <p>BT is right to be angry at the way in which Brown hijacked the headlines, but it should not shoot the messenger. Brown can be accused of releasing the information in a slapdash way - telling the Financial Times before informing the Stock Exchange - but the slump in BT's share price is really of its own making. </p> <p>Instead of anticipating that it would soon have to relinquish its local loop monopoly and explaining to the City how it would look to create new earnings streams in the future, BT has spent much of the past two years bitterly trying to frustrate the introduction of competition. </p> <p>BT's rivals are desperate to gain access to the local network because this will allow them to introduce whizzy new technologies that will carry more information at much faster speeds. 'What's holding us up is BT dragging its feet. It's frustrating for all concerned,' said Jonathan Watts, managing director of telecoms firm Colt. </p> <p>BT is instead jealously protecting its territory because this gives it a head start over the rivals: it allows BT to introduce new services and technologies long before the likes of Colt can do so at prices that make economic sense. </p> <p>Its strategy is perhaps understandable. In the business world it is not the duty of privatised incumbents, responsible to shareholders, to make things easy for the emerging competition. </p> <p>But, equally, it illustrates the corner into which BT has painted itself. The question is simple: should BT transform itself into a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art telecoms provider with all the sexy, value-enhancing technology that this entails, or should it retrench and leave the field open to the arrivistes? </p> <p>This tension - between satisfying shareholders and ploughing money into building telecom networks - has inevitable consequences. </p> <p>'BT can't afford to sit back and not embrace those technologies,' said Eddie Murphy, senior consultant at telecommunications consultancy Analysys. 'You could criticise BT for not being able to realise which way the world is going, bite the bullet and embrace new technologies - even though this would damage its financial situation in the short term. But, unfortunately for BT, the markets tend to take a very short-term view at the moment.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, the way BT feels it must go is clear, even though it must tread carefully on the fiduciary sensibilities of its investors. In his annual report last year, chairman Sir Iain Vallance confirmed BT's intention to transform the company from a telephone firm into an achingly modern Internet business. Vallance stated: 'We have aimed to become the most successful worldwide telecommunications group.' </p> <p>He later amended this to: 'Our aim now is to be the most successful worldwide communications group.' The inference is clear: it's no longer good to talk. Instead it's good to allow people to watch, interact and do everything else the new generation of telecoms networks allow. </p> <p>But while BT ponders how it achieves this goal, its rivals are fast leaving it behind. The dramatic convergence between media and Internet companies - such as last month's AOL-Time Warner deal or Vodafone's recent alliance with French media group Vivendi - has thwarted BT's chances of becoming a major new media player. </p> <p>This is not to say BT does not have the potential. Much is made of its joint global venture with US giant AT&amp;T. 'It gives them a presence in every country in the world, and AT&amp;T probably has the strongest brand in the world telecommunications industry,' Murphy said. </p> <p>But if this is the case, BT has yet to communicate the strengths of this alliance to investors. Said one JP Morgan analyst: 'BT is getting better, but it's not nearly as effective as some of the companies out there. It's an important area, but BT hasn't given us any information to date.' </p> <p>This may be because BT itself is still unclear what the alliance means. 'Global alliances have a very poor track record of staying together over the longer term,' Murphy said. 'Having two heads doesn't work.' </p> <p>And BT's ambition to develop its own reach independently of AT&amp;T is open to question. 'It needs to develop a significant global presence,' the analyst added. 'It has stakes in companies, but these are minority stakes. It needs to be more aggressive.' </p> <p>While BT's shares remains low, its chances of doing deals are diminished. Earlier this year, when its share price was above \u00a315, BT held exploratory talks with Telef\u00f3nica of Spain. Apparently these talks collapsed because Telef\u00f3nica's then chairman, Juan Villalonga, wanted the top job for himself - a hope that got short shrift from BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield. . </p> <p>Today, BT shares are changing hands at little over \u00a311. This is some way above the 960p mark the shares fell to following Brown's speech, but it is still dangerously low. It means that BT is now on the back foot. 'A merger with Telef\u00f3nica would be good for BT but it is questionable whether it would be good for Telef\u00f3nica,' the JP Morgan analyst said. </p> <p>In an attempt to focus the City's attention on its value, BT has recently mooted the possibility of hiving off a number of businesses, including BT Cellnet, and Yellow Pages. </p> <p>A possible float of Open, the interactive TV channel that BT co-owns with BSkyB, HSBC and Matsushita, could also be on the cards. Hiving off parts of its empire would also allow BT to concentrate more on its core assets - this is seen as urgent given the present unwieldy structure. </p> <p>More importantly, by drawing attention to a sum-of-its- parts valuation, BT believes it could command a price of around \u00a319 a share - approaching twice what it was worth a couple of weeks ago.

      "bodyText": "It couldn't happen. Could it? Whispers in the Square Mile suggest that the City is now thinking the unthinkable: BT will no longer exist by the end of the year. It sounds ridiculous. The company that almost singlehandedly turned the UK into a nation of shareholders when it was privatised in 1984, that is the UK stock market's third-largest business, and that made a profit of nearly \u00a34.3 billion in its last financial year, is seen to be increasingly vulnerable to a takeover bid. The company's value fell to just over \u00a360 billion earlier this month - only a fraction higher than its worth in July 1998. Comments by the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, that the telecommunications watchdog, Oftel, was keen to introduce competition to BT's local network earlier than the company had anticipated, helped knock the share price down by 17 per cent in just one day. BT was apparently livid with Brown for meddling in its and the regulator's affairs. But the slump in BT's share price told a much more interesting story than a mere falling-out between New Labour and big business. The fact that BT looked likely to lose one of its biggest cash generators earlier than had been thought sent the market into panic. The City, already concerned about BT's performance following a 6 per cent drop in third-quarter profits announced earlier this year, when the company announced it was axing 3,000 jobs, took fright at Brown's declaration. BT is right to be angry at the way in which Brown hijacked the headlines, but it should not shoot the messenger. Brown can be accused of releasing the information in a slapdash way - telling the Financial Times before informing the Stock Exchange - but the slump in BT's share price is really of its own making. Instead of anticipating that it would soon have to relinquish its local loop monopoly and explaining to the City how it would look to create new earnings streams in the future, BT has spent much of the past two years bitterly trying to frustrate the introduction of competition. BT's rivals are desperate to gain access to the local network because this will allow them to introduce whizzy new technologies that will carry more information at much faster speeds. 'What's holding us up is BT dragging its feet. It's frustrating for all concerned,' said Jonathan Watts, managing director of telecoms firm Colt. BT is instead jealously protecting its territory because this gives it a head start over the rivals: it allows BT to introduce new services and technologies long before the likes of Colt can do so at prices that make economic sense. Its strategy is perhaps understandable. In the business world it is not the duty of privatised incumbents, responsible to shareholders, to make things easy for the emerging competition. But, equally, it illustrates the corner into which BT has painted itself. The question is simple: should BT transform itself into a cutting-edge, state-of-the-art telecoms provider with all the sexy, value-enhancing technology that this entails, or should it retrench and leave the field open to the arrivistes? This tension - between satisfying shareholders and ploughing money into building telecom networks - has inevitable consequences. 'BT can't afford to sit back and not embrace those technologies,' said Eddie Murphy, senior consultant at telecommunications consultancy Analysys. 'You could criticise BT for not being able to realise which way the world is going, bite the bullet and embrace new technologies - even though this would damage its financial situation in the short term. But, unfortunately for BT, the markets tend to take a very short-term view at the moment.' Nevertheless, the way BT feels it must go is clear, even though it must tread carefully on the fiduciary sensibilities of its investors. In his annual report last year, chairman Sir Iain Vallance confirmed BT's intention to transform the company from a telephone firm into an achingly modern Internet business. Vallance stated: 'We have aimed to become the most successful worldwide telecommunications group.' He later amended this to: 'Our aim now is to be the most successful worldwide communications group.' The inference is clear: it's no longer good to talk. Instead it's good to allow people to watch, interact and do everything else the new generation of telecoms networks allow. But while BT ponders how it achieves this goal, its rivals are fast leaving it behind. The dramatic convergence between media and Internet companies - such as last month's AOL-Time Warner deal or Vodafone's recent alliance with French media group Vivendi - has thwarted BT's chances of becoming a major new media player. This is not to say BT does not have the potential. Much is made of its joint global venture with US giant AT&amp;T. 'It gives them a presence in every country in the world, and AT&amp;T probably has the strongest brand in the world telecommunications industry,' Murphy said. But if this is the case, BT has yet to communicate the strengths of this alliance to investors. Said one JP Morgan analyst: 'BT is getting better, but it's not nearly as effective as some of the companies out there. It's an important area, but BT hasn't given us any information to date.' This may be because BT itself is still unclear what the alliance means. 'Global alliances have a very poor track record of staying together over the longer term,' Murphy said. 'Having two heads doesn't work.' And BT's ambition to develop its own reach independently of AT&amp;T is open to question. 'It needs to develop a significant global presence,' the analyst added. 'It has stakes in companies, but these are minority stakes. It needs to be more aggressive.' While BT's shares remains low, its chances of doing deals are diminished. Earlier this year, when its share price was above \u00a315, BT held exploratory talks with Telef\u00f3nica of Spain. Apparently these talks collapsed because Telef\u00f3nica's then chairman, Juan Villalonga, wanted the top job for himself - a hope that got short shrift from BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield. . Today, BT shares are changing hands at little over \u00a311. This is some way above the 960p mark the shares fell to following Brown's speech, but it is still dangerously low. It means that BT is now on the back foot. 'A merger with Telef\u00f3nica would be good for BT but it is questionable whether it would be good for Telef\u00f3nica,' the JP Morgan analyst said. In an attempt to focus the City's attention on its value, BT has recently mooted the possibility of hiving off a number of businesses, including BT Cellnet, and Yellow Pages. A possible float of Open, the interactive TV channel that BT co-owns with BSkyB, HSBC and Matsushita, could also be on the cards. Hiving off parts of its empire would also allow BT to concentrate more on its core assets - this is seen as urgent given the present unwieldy structure. More importantly, by drawing attention to a sum-of-its- parts valuation, BT believes it could command a price of around \u00a319 a share - approaching twice what it was worth a couple of weeks ago. The telecoms team at Salomon Smith Barney last week put a break-up value of \u00a316 a share on BT. Expect further talk about the 'real' value of BT in the coming weeks as Sir Peter beats the independence drum. But he will have to beat it very loudly. The usual suspects - primarily the US operators - are circling, and in the fast-moving world of telecoms it is unlikely that they will remain airborne for long. 'A merger of BT and AT&amp;T would solve a lot of problems,' Murphy said. 'If BT were subjected to a takeover bid, running to AT&amp;T as a white knight may be a more profitable alternative.' Such a merger may inject some dynamism into a company that, some observers believe, could do with a change of management. 'BT has made a lot of progress,' said Colt's Watts. 'But I don't understand how you manage a company of that size [it employs 137,000 people] when things are changing so quickly.

And that's only the Mail and the Telegraph on Tony Blair's Ghent speech about Europe. What the Guardian likes to call the 'xenophobic' end of our national press never sleeps when there's a euro in the undergrowth. But some things, fascinatingly enough, do change. </p> <p>Consider, for instance, the Mail 's verdict on the 'corrupt, over-regulated, sclerotic, unemployment-dogged reality' of Europe - and then turn to page 31, section two, of last Tuesday's almost equally sceptic Times. 'Germans reap rewards of putting faith in the euro,' says the headline over a fat chunk of reporting from Michael Woodhead. 'Have you noticed? German exports are up (6 per cent this year); domestic demand is up; unemployment 'is expected to halve in five years.' </p> <p>British newspapers, writes Woodhead, 'may claim that the euro is dead, but Europe is booming and the Germans are in the driving seat'. Moreover (among other cheery signs) the 'often repeated demands for Germany to restructure its economy have disguised the fact that many firms are leaner, fitter and better managed than before'. </p> <p>All credit to the Times . Its editorial pitch may stay broadly the same - indeed, on the same day, it wrote off Gerhard Schroder's economic reforms as 'something of a disappointment' - but at least it doesn't get in the way of publishing contrary evidence when a reporter on the spot finds something different. Will that rigour endure, though, if the whole debate re-ignites (as it surely must if Woodhead is right about 'booming' Europe)? Prepare for another of those great Fleet Street spectacles we call the bonfire of the stereotypes. </p> <p>Even a few weeks ago, the euro question seemed null and void - and William Hague's rural rides to save the pound somewhat out of time.

And that's only the Mail and the Telegraph on Tony Blair's Ghent speech about Europe. What the Guardian likes to call the 'xenophobic' end of our national press never sleeps when there's a euro in the undergrowth. But some things, fascinatingly enough, do change. Consider, for instance, the Mail 's verdict on the 'corrupt, over-regulated, sclerotic, unemployment-dogged reality' of Europe - and then turn to page 31, section two, of last Tuesday's almost equally sceptic Times. 'Germans reap rewards of putting faith in the euro,' says the headline over a fat chunk of reporting from Michael Woodhead. 'Have you noticed? German exports are up (6 per cent this year); domestic demand is up; unemployment 'is expected to halve in five years.' British newspapers, writes Woodhead, 'may claim that the euro is dead, but Europe is booming and the Germans are in the driving seat'. Moreover (among other cheery signs) the 'often repeated demands for Germany to restructure its economy have disguised the fact that many firms are leaner, fitter and better managed than before'. All credit to the Times . Its editorial pitch may stay broadly the same - indeed, on the same day, it wrote off Gerhard Schroder's economic reforms as 'something of a disappointment' - but at least it doesn't get in the way of publishing contrary evidence when a reporter on the spot finds something different. Will that rigour endure, though, if the whole debate re-ignites (as it surely must if Woodhead is right about 'booming' Europe)? Prepare for another of those great Fleet Street spectacles we call the bonfire of the stereotypes. Even a few weeks ago, the euro question seemed null and void - and William Hague's rural rides to save the pound somewhat out of time. It was universally assumed that New Labour had gone cold on entry for the foreseeable or any other future. The Times (again) was telling the Tories to find some policies on health and education, quick. The Mail and Sun could barely bother to raise a ritual froth. What was - and maybe still is - more significant, however, was the cooling of European ardour among erstwhile lovers. The Financial Times is not a 'campaigning' newspaper, but there's been something almost elegiac about its recent editorials.

Several hours of Walking With Dinosaurs, a whole year of game shows? It could open a new overseas bureau for foreign reporting. Or it could show Southampton versus Bradford on a cold Monday night - 90 minutes of Premiership magic all for a mere \u00a35m. </p> <p>Yet this is the glum scenario broadcasters and viewers face if Sir Christopher Bland and Greg Dyke, chairman and director-general of the BBC, are to be believed. 'We just cannot afford \u00a35m per match for Premier League football,' Bland said on Radio 4 last week. </p> <p>And he's right. There were stories in the press suggesting that BSkyB, which holds the current contract for rights, has already offered the UK Premier League \u00a32 billion for a deal starting in the 2001/02 season. </p> <p>Completely untrue, says Sky, on the record. Completely true, say the clubs, off the record. Well informed neutral sources suggest that both the approach and the level of the bid are 'fantasy'. </p> <p>Even today a single \u00a32bn bid would be beyond loss-making BSkyB, which is groaning under the financial strain of going digital. In 1991, when BSkyB blew the competition out of the water by bidding \u00a3304m for a five-year Premiership rights contract, rivals said it would never make money from the deal. They were wrong. It made BSkyB the most profitable broadcaster in Europe. </p> <p>The contract also made Rupert Murdoch's satellite company reliant on football for its profitability - with live sport the key driver for premium subscriptions. In 1996, Sky's new Premiership contract was struck for what seemed a staggering \u00a3647m, this time for only four years. </p> <p>At the time many commentators and newspapers, including this one, hypothesised that we would not see a \u00a31bn bid in 2001. Yet here we are with incredible reports of \u00a32bn for the 20 clubs - an average of \u00a3100m each, though the more successful ones would get more. Assuming 760 fixtures a year, they would get \u00a32.6m per game. </p> <p>Presumably the figure of \u00a35m a match comes from the assumption that this kind of fee could be charged for the juicier fixtures, such as the Leeds vs Manchester United crunch match last weekend. But even here one has to ask how a broadcaster would make a decent margin out of a game it paid \u00a35m for? Given that non-crucial games shown on Sky Sports attract around a million viewers, the answer must be that for 80 per cent of games it would make a loss. </p> <p>But even if \u00a32bn is in the fantasy league of payments, we could certainly see the amount the broadcasters pay go up to \u00a31bn, particularly if Internet rights are included. </p> <p>'What we will absolutely not see this time round is the single big deal', says one chief executive of a leading broadcaster. 'Nobody will be allowed to romp into the market with one enormous knock-out bid.' </p> <p>Others go further and suggest that the Premier League has promised the Office of Fair Trading that it will not sell exclusive live rights in one package to one broadcaster. If so, bundles of matches could be sold to a selection of broadcasters - breaking Sky's monopoly of showing top matches live. If the Premier League has made such an agreement, it is probably just a formalisation of the inevitable. For the first time in the football rights bidding wars, most major broadcasters will have not only an interest in the outcome but also a stake in the clubs. BSkyB, via its abortive bid for Manchester United, still holds a 10 per cent stake in the club and retains close links with its management. It also has 10 per cent of Leeds United. </p> <p>Sky's key competitor in cable, NTL, has stakes in Aston Villa and Newcastle United, and ITV company Granada has a stake in Liverpool. If any new entrant is to snaffle the lion's share of matches, it needs to move quickly. Sky's record in televising football gives it a head start, if not guaranteed tenure. </p> <p>One inhibiting factor for the League was its litigation against the two men hired by its former chief executive Peter Lever to negotiate the football rights - Sam Chisholm and David Chance, former chief executive and managing director of BSkyB. </p> <p>But this obstacle was removed last week when the League settled out of court for \u00a312m plus costs, though some wonder why it was so keen to dispense with Chisholm and Chance, when the coming negotiations are going to prove, as one football executive puts it, 'a nightmare'. </p> <p>One of the knottiest issues is how to deal with the Internet rights - in five years' time, clubs may be able to screen live coverage of all matches over the Net, and charge for them. Sky's acquisitive interest in sports websites flags up its concerns about the Web being the way forward - and if rights are sold separately from broadcast rights, it will prove a further giant headache for the TV companies. </p> <p>The main battle is likely to be between BSkyB, the three major ITV companies and NTL, which is backed by money from France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and Microsoft. The ITV trio, Carlton, United News and Media and Granada, are all likely to want either live rights or highlights, though with Carlton and United News already involved in merger discussions and Carlton/Granada both partners in On Digital, the three would have to think carefully about how to structure a deal. </p> <p>NTL having Bill Gates's money behind it will be sure to push up the price.

But beyond budgetary problems, there are wider concerns. </p> <p>The core issue is that of rapid globalisation. 'We have to step back and see that the whole world has changed,' he says.

Last year's 'HIPC 2' deal turned on developed nations' increasing payments into a trust fund, which would boost the debt relief effort. But many of the countries involved used aid budgets to fund their contributions to it. </p> <p>Malloch-Brown says: 'There is a terrible temptation in developed countries to raid aid budgets to pay for debt relief. Many people argue that HIPC debt relief is relieving countries which can use the money they would have used to reduce debt to spend on public services. </p> <p>That's worthwhile.

It requires someone at the top to insist that this natural tendency to inertia be resisted. </p> <p>Hence FitzGerald's polemics against the status quo.

It remains too slow, too plodding, in the implementation of change, however useful that change might be. </p> <p>Example one: the company buys a few thousand new, all-singing, all-adjustable chairs for its Blackfriars office in London.

Instead of being a manufacturer, it is 'a brand marketing group that happens to make some of its products'. </p> <p>This is a striking shift. It brings Unilever into the realm of the Coca-Colas of this world - companies that own a brand, a logo and a recipe, but which need take no part in making the stuff, so long as it is produced to the right specification. </p> <p>But the sad fact is that over the past decade or so, Unilever hasn't been terribly effective in managing the brands it has.

A youngish chap in a ridiculous fedora and Woody Allen specs, strap-hanging uptown on the Lexington Line, said: 'The subway sums up everything about New York.

Nicholas Fiore works for Clips.com, an Internet company in New York's 'Silicon Alley', the new e-commerce business quarter in SoHo.</p> <p>He and several commuters within elbowing range reluctantly agree that, while far from perfect, things have got a lot better on the subway. 'The New York subway gets a bad rap in London. You lot think there is a murder down here every five minutes, but it really is the best way to get to work,' Fiore added.</p> <p>Things were very different 20 years ago. Crime rates had rocketed and derailments and fires were commonplace. Since then $22.5 billion (\u00a314bn) has been spent on the system to drag it back from the brink of breakdown. A sizable chunk of that money was raised by issuing public bonds, and the transport authority is now poised to offer investors a further \u00a37 billion in bonds to help move the subway from a 20-year 'rescue' phase into a new era of expansion. This is precisely how Ken Livingstone, London mayoral contender, and the Liberal Democrat candidate, Susan Kramer, believe the revival of the dilapidated London Underground should be funded. The Government disagrees, and is trying to push through a plan to lease the infrastructure to private-sector bidders.</p> <p>Paradoxically, Tory mayoral candidate Steven Norris appears to support this strategy while Labour's Frank Dobson revealed last week that if he is elected, he would appoint an independent panel to assess the plan.</p> <p>The Government intends to set up the financial structure unilaterally and then hand a fait accompli to the mayor. But it has always pledged to drop the public-private partnership plan if it does not represent 'value for money' against a public-sector solution, so the issue is still very much up in the air.</p> <p>Tony Blair caused a transatlantic furore last November when, in an interview with The Observer, he sought to discredit Livingstone's policy for funding the Tube by branding New York's subway rescue a financial failure. He said: 'Ken's proposal is that London raise bonds for the Underground. Yet in New York, when the city produced bonds for the subway, the city went bankrupt and central government had to deliver the bonds.'</p> <p>Critics said Blair not only distorted the facts but unfairly besmirched one of New York's great success stories of the past two decades. So how does it look several metres below 42nd Street?</p> <p>Gene Russianoff is senior attorney at the Straphangers Campaign, a powerful lobbying group for passengers. He said: 'Decades of disinvestment brought the subway to breakdown in the late Seventies. It was under-capitalised for the longest time. Throughout the Eighties, trains were breaking down at a record rate, and there were so many derailments and fires and so much trash lying around that the National Transportation Safety Board, which usually investigates plane crashes, launched an inquiry.'</p> <p>Trains broke down every 7,000 miles, passenger numbers slumped to their lowest since 1917 and crime reached a peak in 1990, with 19,000 felonies on the subway. Today, crime is down to 4,000 incidents a year, trains break down only every 77,000 miles and passenger numbers have risen by 17 per cent in those years to 4.5 million a day.</p> <p>Up to 80 per cent of the system is deemed to be in good condition after an almost complete relaying of track and signalling equipment and the replacement or refurbishment of 6,000 train carriages. Many stations have been renovated with gleaming tiles in retro styling and strip lighting. 'The subway used to be the biggest purchaser of 37 watt lightbulbs in the city,' said Russianoff.</p> <p>The basic design of the system, with its low ceilings propped up by glowering girders, and endless exposed platforms disappearing into dark, howling canyons, means that no facelift can quite dispel the bleak atmosphere that makes the subway feel somewhat threatening, if no longer positively terrifying. And, although the authorities deal robustly with graffiti and panhandlers, the cage-like platform dividers, the hard plastic train seats and a total lack of passenger information all add to the hostile environment. </p> <p>The Tube feels positively luxurious by comparison, with its cushioned seats, banks of automatic ticket machines and electronic 'countdown' displays indicating the (much more frequent) trains. Unlike London, however, the New York subway is only moderately overcrowded; it runs round the clock and the $1.50 flat fare will take you from the bottom of Brooklyn to the top of the Bronx. Robert Kiley, currently president of the New York Chamber of Commerce, was in charge of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) during the Eighties, when he and his deputy were known as Batman and Robin - there to save the subway.</p> <p>He said: 'At the start of the Eighties only the MTA was able to go to the debt market, because the city had disgraced itself during the financial crisis of the Seventies.</p> <p>'We used income from fares as collateral for bonding out the capital investment needed for the rescue effort. That was the linchpin of the state of New York getting involved for the first time.' MTA board members are elected by the state governor, city mayor and the seven outlying counties of New York state served by the subway, bus and commuter rail system. It is a deliberately complicated set-up, aimed originally at removing the running of the transport system from the fiscally challenged Big Apple by widening accountability.</p> <p>Kiley asserts that the MTA's structure and the bond scheme were created out of the mess of New York's financial collapse, rather than precipitating it. And most local observers agree that the plan broadly succeeded rather than, as Blair implied, failing and triggering a federal bail-out. 'It worked as a way of rescuing a system that was downright unsafe - and fares have been kept at a reasonable level,' he said.</p> <p>While, contrary to Blair's assertion, neither the US federal government nor the state legislature of New York have ever had to bail out an MTA bond issue, it is true that the state of New York had to step in to oversee and part-fund the city's transport system as part of an all-round public-private rescue effort.</p> <p>However, as Rosemary Scanlon, former New York state deputy comptroller, told The Observer, London Underground is even better placed than the subway to raise funds from a public bond issue because it is running at an operating surplus of around \u00a3250m a year, whereas in the early Eighties the subway was covering only 80 per cent of its operating costs from fare revenues and even now barely breaks even.</p> <p>Therefore London should not be as reliant as New York on subsidies although, in her view, the UK government will be forced to carry on subsidising the London Underground whether it opts for a public bond issue or private- sector financing - something transport minister Lord Macdonald has admitted to The Observer cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>The MTA has invested a total of $30bn (\u00a318.75bn) in public transport for New York since the first capital plan was activated in 1981, with around 75 per cent going into the subway system and the rest invested in buses, bridges and tunnels.</p> <p>Kim Paparello, acting director of finance at the MTA, says that around $10bn of that has come from direct central government, state and city funding. The remaining $20bn has been raised from issuing bonds, with the bulk backed either by revenue from tolls collected on bridges and tunnels feeding traffic into Manhattan or from the 'farebox' - fares plus a share of income from local sales and petrol taxes. The bonds vary widely in length, but typically yield around 5-6 per cent in interest.</p> <p>Paparello says the MTA has around $13bn of debt outstanding, which it is proposing to refinance in order to boost the next five-year plan for upgrading and expanding the subway. The refinancing will raise $3bn and extend the debt. She says: 'The five-year capital programme has been submitted with no fare increases in it. The amount needed to service the debt, including interest and principal, will not rise and we will end up with the same level of debt. It is like refinancing a mortgage at lower rates.'</p> <p>But the $3bn is in addition to another $8bn of new bonds that are to be issued on the back of fare revenues. This is currently creating a storm in New York, combined with a row over the state legislature trying to cut back funding. Russianoff and Kiley are among critics who think the MTA is going to overextend itself and accumulate an unacceptable debt burden, while Scanlon and various transport consultants who are following events believe debt levels are likely to remain reasonable. Scanlon says London is well placed to issue public bonds for the Underground, with its robust fare revenues keeping debt off the public balance sheet.</p> <p> <strong>The subway: Dire, but improving.</strong><br> Passenger journeys per day: 4.5 million<br> Reported annual crimes: 4,500<br> Stations: 468<br> Carriages: 6,000<br> Track miles: 225<br></p> <p><strong>History</strong><br> <strong>1904 </strong>Private company launches subway trains between City Hall, 145th Street and Broadway<br> <strong>1905</strong> Line to the Bronx<br> <strong>1908</strong> Line to Brooklyn<br> <strong>1915</strong> Line to Queens<br> <strong>1940 </strong>City of New York takes over system<br> <strong>1968</strong> Metropolitan Transportation Authority created to run subway<br> <strong>1971</strong> MTA takes over Staten Island Railway<br> <strong>1982</strong> MTA issues bonds to fund rescue capital programmes<br> <strong>1997 </strong>Automation of ticket machines and turnstiles<br> <strong>2000</strong> MTA proposes first major expansion for 50 years: airport links and a new Second Avenue line<br></p> <p><strong>The Underground: Tube hell? </strong><br> Passenger journeys per day: 3 million<br> Reported annual crimes: 11,400<br> Stations: 275<br> Carriages: 4,000 <br> Track miles: 250<br></p> <p><strong>History</strong><br> <strong>1863 </strong>Private company launches first underground railway, between Paddington and Farringdon<br> <strong>1884 </strong>Circle Line opens<br> <strong>1900</strong> Central Line joins the system<br> <strong>1906 </strong>US business funds expansion, and the Bakerloo, Northern and Piccadilly lines are built<br> <strong>1933 </strong>London Transport officially created to operate the Underground network under public control<br> <strong>1969</strong> Victoria becomes first new line since 1907<br> <strong>1975</strong> Jubilee Line opens<br> <strong>1988</strong> Automated barriers on all stations<br> <strong>1999</strong> Jubilee Line extension opens late and over-budget.

Knutsford, shortly to be headed by former Asda boss Archie Norman, denied last week that it was among Storehouse's predators. </p> <p>But a source near the top of Knutsford admitted that Storehouse was on its radar screen. However, Knutsford is much more likely to be planning to take over another retailer. It aims to finalise preparations before the end of March. </p> <p>Since Archie Norman, Nigel Wray, Nick Leslau and Julian Richer took over Knutsford last November, the company has made an abortive assault on venture capital fund Wassall, but has made no move in retailing - the type of business Knutsford targeted at its inception.</p> <p>Storehouse said on Friday afternoon that it had received approaches from potential buyers of either BhS Mothercare or the whole group. The company has effectively been for sale since last summer. Last week's announcement was rushed as news of bid approaches was leaking. The Takeover Panel is thought to have insisted on an announcement.

      "bodyText": "Investment firm Knutsford is aiming to launch an assault on a retail group within the next three weeks: It has been eyeing Storehouse, the BhS-to-Mothercare group, which last Friday announced that it had received several bid approaches. Knutsford, shortly to be headed by former Asda boss Archie Norman, denied last week that it was among Storehouse's predators. But a source near the top of Knutsford admitted that Storehouse was on its radar screen. However, Knutsford is much more likely to be planning to take over another retailer. It aims to finalise preparations before the end of March. Since Archie Norman, Nigel Wray, Nick Leslau and Julian Richer took over Knutsford last November, the company has made an abortive assault on venture capital fund Wassall, but has made no move in retailing - the type of business Knutsford targeted at its inception. Storehouse said on Friday afternoon that it had received approaches from potential buyers of either BhS Mothercare or the whole group. The company has effectively been for sale since last summer. Last week's announcement was rushed as news of bid approaches was leaking. The Takeover Panel is thought to have insisted on an announcement. It is understood that Philip Green - who earlier this month abandoned his ambitious plans to mount an assault on Marks &amp; Spencer - is among those now looking at Storehouse. There are also thought to be several 'financial buyers' - groups which believe that the company could yield sufficient cash to finance a takeover. After Friday's announcement, Storehouse shares rocketed to nearly 50p, setting the value of the company's equity at more than \u00a3200 million.

Nothing new in that, the old-timers may protest, remembering how a winter tour back in the Forties and Fifties would encompass six or seven months away. But this is the twenty-first century. Harare is 10 hours from Heathrow; Perth no more than 20. Now that the world has shrunk, there is no longer the need for a cricket tour to be a route march that strains the minds, bodies and marriages of cricketers and journalists alike. </p> <p>This was crystallised by the recent futile trip to Zimbabwe. England's erstwhile coach, David Lloyd, may deny that this leg of the African tour was a direct consequence of his famous 'We flippin' murdered 'em' outburst at Bulawayo in 1996 and the ill-feeling that his side generated in Zimbabwe. But, in essence, the detour to Bulawayo and Harare was designed to be a bridge-building exercise after that sour tour. Originally a Test match was planned until it was recognised that most of England's Test players were going home in mid-January. Hence four relatively meaningless one-day internationals were scheduled. </p> <p>The sad truth is that these matches were no more welcomed by the Zimbabwean players than they were by the English. Zimbabwe now set off for the Caribbean. If they reach the final of a triangular tournament there, they do not anticipate returning home until the three-way competition in England is completed on 22 July. That makes five months away from home - enough even to wipe the smile off the face of Henry Olonga. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in England, we all seemed to be far more interested in the well-being of Brooklyn Beckham than whether Nasser Hussain's men had triumphed in Harare. For the sake of their cricketers and the integrity of the international game, a high priority for the International Cricket Council should be to rationalise schedules; in particular it is essential to give some meaning to the morass of one-day internationals that now take place around the world. For a year, at least, Matthew Engel has given up the ghost in trying to fit them all into Wisden . </p> <p>Engel departs as editor partly because England have been so poor in the Nineties. 'Any cricket-lover knows that bowlers can keep going far longer if they're taking wickets. I have been obliged to edit Wisden against a background of failure,' he explained. </p> <p>And yet this England tour party do not return in despair. Indeed, despite losing the Test series and the one-day final in Johannesburg, their captain, Hussain, comes home with his reputation greatly enhanced, which is a remarkable achievement. </p> <p>This is partly because Hussain and coach Duncan Fletcher have sought to re-educate the cricketing public. They have been ruthlessly realistic, banishing the idea that England are expected to win... well, because they are England, as they were in the Fifties and Sixties when there were only two or three decent sides in the world. Expectations have been lowered; the goal against South Africa was to 'compete' and that they did for most of the tour, rebounding from their disastrous days with much spirit. </p> <p>Moreover, Hussain himself performed superbly until he ran out of steam in Zimbabwe; as captain he handled the side with a sensitivity that surprised many. Yet he and Fletcher were uncompromising as well - there were to be no compassionate end-of-tour appearances for Gavin Hamilton or Ashley Giles. </p> <p>With the press, Hussain was honest and cooperative, and those media men who stayed to the bitter end were surprised - and delighted - to be invited out for dinner by the tour party (especially since England were paying). Three years ago the players wouldn't even pitch up to the press corps' Christmas pantomime. </p> <p>Hussain, Andrew Caddick and Darren Gough were the three constants in the England team throughout all the winter's international matches These three are now the cornerstone of the England team, whatever the form of cricket. At dinner they could swap notes with the triumvirate of dedicated, ever-present journalists, the only ones who set off with the tour party on 26 October and returned on Friday: Colin Bateman of The Express , John Etheridge of The Sun and David Lloyd (no, not 'Bumble') of The Evening Standard . </p> <p>All six of them deserve medals for perseverance alone. Gavin Hamilton, a vir tual spectator since the first Test in Johannesburg, also warrants a gong of some sort for retaining his sanity. Hussain, Caddick and Gough will be duly rewarded on Wednesday when the names of those players, who are to be given central contracts by the England Cricket Board, are announced at Lord's. </p> <p>The process of awarding central contracts is a delicate one. It is a new system with the potential to alienate the counties and their stalwart players who just miss out on a contract. Badly handled, it could even be divisive within the England team. It is only right that the above-named trio should be rewarded and they will be since they will be guaranteed anything up to \u00a360,000 from the ECB in addition to their existing county salaries, which are likely to range between \u00a350,000 and \u00a370,000. (The counties will be compensated by receiving approximately \u00a350,000 for a player on a full ECB contract.) There will be a sliding scale for those enlisted just for Tests or one-day internationals and the number of previous international appearances will always be taken into account </p> <p>My hope is that the ECB tread warily, initially keeping the number of contracts to a minimum - about a dozen say. They should reward performance, rather than potential and should be confident that all of their contracted players are worthy of a place in the England team next summer. It has been suggested that young hopefuls such as Durham's Stephen Harmison, Surrey's Alex Tudor and Lancashire's Chris Schofield should all be contracted at the lowest level. This is disturbing since the message it sends out is that the ECB do not have any faith in their counties' ability to develop these youngsters' talents. </p> <p>It will be vitally important that Fletcher and Phil Neale can liaise fruitfully with the counties. Whether we like it or not - and Mike Atherton, for one, clearly doesn't - county cricket is our only nursery for international cricketers and the centre cannot afford to alienate the county clubs by employing central contracts heavy-handedly. Moreover there's not that much money in the pot. </p> <p>There will be teething problems. What happens at Yorkshire if captain David Byas wishes to open the batting with Michael Vaughan when England want him to gain more experience at number four? More explosively, what if Gough is prevented from appearing in a Championship match for them while (it must be hoped) Caddick, who likes to stay in rhythm, is permitted to play for Somerset? How will the counties react if the selectors feel obliged to keep dropping contracted players? </p> <p>Worse still, what if England keep losing? Well, the counties will wonder whether any sacrifice has been worthwhile; potential sponsors, who help to provide the funds for these new contracts, will become scarcer and Engel's sabbatical may last a little longer. But I've no doubt that the redoubtable Bateman, Etheridge and Lloyd will keep soldiering on regardless.</p>",

'Any cricket-lover knows that bowlers can keep going far longer if they're taking wickets. I have been obliged to edit Wisden against a background of failure,' he explained. And yet this England tour party do not return in despair. Indeed, despite losing the Test series and the one-day final in Johannesburg, their captain, Hussain, comes home with his reputation greatly enhanced, which is a remarkable achievement. This is partly because Hussain and coach Duncan Fletcher have sought to re-educate the cricketing public. They have been ruthlessly realistic, banishing the idea that England are expected to win... well, because they are England, as they were in the Fifties and Sixties when there were only two or three decent sides in the world. Expectations have been lowered; the goal against South Africa was to 'compete' and that they did for most of the tour, rebounding from their disastrous days with much spirit. Moreover, Hussain himself performed superbly until he ran out of steam in Zimbabwe; as captain he handled the side with a sensitivity that surprised many. Yet he and Fletcher were uncompromising as well - there were to be no compassionate end-of-tour appearances for Gavin Hamilton or Ashley Giles. With the press, Hussain was honest and cooperative, and those media men who stayed to the bitter end were surprised - and delighted - to be invited out for dinner by the tour party (especially since England were paying). Three years ago the players wouldn't even pitch up to the press corps' Christmas pantomime. Hussain, Andrew Caddick and Darren Gough were the three constants in the England team throughout all the winter's international matches These three are now the cornerstone of the England team, whatever the form of cricket. At dinner they could swap notes with the triumvirate of dedicated, ever-present journalists, the only ones who set off with the tour party on 26 October and returned on Friday: Colin Bateman of The Express , John Etheridge of The Sun and David Lloyd (no, not 'Bumble') of The Evening Standard . All six of them deserve medals for perseverance alone. Gavin Hamilton, a vir tual spectator since the first Test in Johannesburg, also warrants a gong of some sort for retaining his sanity. Hussain, Caddick and Gough will be duly rewarded on Wednesday when the names of those players, who are to be given central contracts by the England Cricket Board, are announced at Lord's. The process of awarding central contracts is a delicate one. It is a new system with the potential to alienate the counties and their stalwart players who just miss out on a contract. Badly handled, it could even be divisive within the England team. It is only right that the above-named trio should be rewarded and they will be since they will be guaranteed anything up to \u00a360,000 from the ECB in addition to their existing county salaries, which are likely to range between \u00a350,000 and \u00a370,000. (The counties will be compensated by receiving approximately \u00a350,000 for a player on a full ECB contract.) There will be a sliding scale for those enlisted just for Tests or one-day internationals and the number of previous international appearances will always be taken into account My hope is that the ECB tread warily, initially keeping the number of contracts to a minimum - about a dozen say. They should reward performance, rather than potential and should be confident that all of their contracted players are worthy of a place in the England team next summer. It has been suggested that young hopefuls such as Durham's Stephen Harmison, Surrey's Alex Tudor and Lancashire's Chris Schofield should all be contracted at the lowest level. This is disturbing since the message it sends out is that the ECB do not have any faith in their counties' ability to develop these youngsters' talents. It will be vitally important that Fletcher and Phil Neale can liaise fruitfully with the counties. Whether we like it or not - and Mike Atherton, for one, clearly doesn't - county cricket is our only nursery for international cricketers and the centre cannot afford to alienate the county clubs by employing central contracts heavy-handedly. Moreover there's not that much money in the pot. There will be teething problems. What happens at Yorkshire if captain David Byas wishes to open the batting with Michael Vaughan when England want him to gain more experience at number four? More explosively, what if Gough is prevented from appearing in a Championship match for them while (it must be hoped) Caddick, who likes to stay in rhythm, is permitted to play for Somerset? How will the counties react if the selectors feel obliged to keep dropping contracted players? Worse still, what if England keep losing? Well, the counties will wonder whether any sacrifice has been worthwhile; potential sponsors, who help to provide the funds for these new contracts, will become scarcer and Engel's sabbatical may last a little longer. But I've no doubt that the redoubtable Bateman, Etheridge and Lloyd will keep soldiering on regardless.",

However, the private pain endured by those trapped on the deck of the stricken liner, the SS Cliveden (the phrase is Joyce Grenfell's), has not, hitherto, been much exposed. The life story of Bronwen, Viscountess Astor, shows that the hurt of Profumo goes very deep, all the more so because the affair exposed personal vulnerabilities that money, class and social status were supposed to conceal. </p> <p>She was born Bronwen Pugh, the fourth child of middle-class Welsh parents in 1930. Her father, Alun, was a successful barrister. When David, his only son, died of cancer in his early thirties, it was upon Bronwen that the full weight of parental ambition descended. The results were spectacular. In an astonishingly short space of time in the early 1950s, she became first a celebrated BBC TV presenter, then a successful model, and finally, in Paris, as the favourite of the couturier Balmain, one of the 'mannequins mondial'. The British tabloids styled her 'our Bronwen'; a New York fashion correspondent described her as a 'husky Welsh mannequin' who 'drags a coat down a runway as if she had just killed it and were taking it to her mate'. </p> <p>To Bronwen, life on the catwalk was just 'a game of dressing up'. What really occupied her imagination was a 'spiritual journey' for personal enlightenment, inspired by Gurdjieff and later Teilhard de Chardin. As Stanford puts it, in a typical passage: 'At the same time as she was setting her sights on the flimsy, fun and throwaway world of model girls... she embarked on a lonely and often painful journey to understand her own psyche and soul.' </p> <p>The erotic dimension of Bronwen's mysticism became explicit when, at about the time she first met Bill Astor, she encountered the Almighty through sexual self-expression: 'It was God. I knew it was God. And every cell of my body went into orgasm.' </p> <p>In France, models and prostitutes inhabit the same twilight world. In late Fifties Britain, 'the jolly-hockey-sticks Bronwen' at first refused Bill Astor's invitation to Cliveden on grounds of propriety: 'I couldn't come, because we hadn't been introduced.' Not for long. Bronwen, who describes herself as 'not very amusing... but very lighthearted', soon overcame her scruples. </p> <p>William Waldorf Astor was exactly the kind of man who might appeal to the public and private sides of her character. On paper, he was the supremely well-connected heir to the Astor fortune. In reality, he was a 52-year-old, twice-divorced 'little boy lost' in need of spiritual and psychological rescue, the perfect prey for the socially ambitious, religiously turned-on model. It was a match made for disaster, as Nancy Astor, who publicly disparaged her new daughter-in-law, possibly guessed. </p> <p>As Stanford tells it, Bill Astor was a weak, spoilt man, dominated by his possessive and formidable mother, who never quite cut himself loose from the questionable pleasures of Mayfair and Belgravia. It was possibly this side of his character that had persuaded his father, the equally formidable Waldorf Astor, to pass over his eldest son and hand The Observer to the younger, but more scrupulous, David who, as editor-in-chief, presided over some of The Observer' s finest days. </p> <p>The stage was set for catastrophe. Just as, in the sinking of the Titanic, those who witnessed the first impact initially believed that disaster had been averted, so those who met by the Cliveden poolside on the sultry evening of 8 July 1961would always protest that nothing scandalous had occurred. </p> <p>The truth was otherwise. The good ship Cliveden had been holed and was taking on water fast. Although Bronwen might not much like it, at this point, Stanford, her apologist, has no choice but to rehearse the familiar sequence of events from the drip-drip of metropolitan innuendo and the first references to Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies to the resignation of John Profumo, the Minister of War, to the arrest, trial and suicide of society osteopath Stephen Ward and the utter disgrace and premature death of Bill. </p> <p>Stanford certainly tries hard to make the best case for the Astors, but although the dispassionate reader can feel some sympathy for Bronwen, it's difficult to escape the conclusion that her husband behaved shabbily towards Ward and never satisfactorily answered the charge that he had been unfaithful to his wife. Stanford does not much help his case with his partisan snobbery towards the 'new aristocracy' of 'pop singers, photographers, artists, decorators'. Throughout, the reader is left in no doubt that 'the Cliveden set' was the undeserving victim of 'the new, brutal and classless world of the 1960s'. </p> <p>It would be wrong to dwell too long on the Profumo affair, because Stanford himself has other ecclesiastical fish to fry. </p> <p>In a book of nearly 400 pages, the 'affair' occupies only pages 219-290.

Now, it is much more often seen as resembling a bush, with many branches that briefly flourished until they gave way, or gave rise, to new evolutionary experiments in how to become human. As the only surviving outcome of these experiments, it is easy for us to imagine that this is how it was meant to be. However, a burgeoning fossil record and a host of new techniques with which to study it are showing the complexity of humanity's past. </p> <p>For example, in the last three years we have seen the discovery of the first complete skeleton from near the root of our family tree, and from one of the closest branches to our own, the recovery of DNA from a Neanderthal fossil. Yet in both cases, the additional data seem to confirm that these were branches that did not lead to our own. </p> <p>In the wake of Walking With Dinosaurs, the BBC is now turning its attention to human evolution through a series called Ape-Man. This book, by The Observer's science editor, has been written to accompany the series, but aims to set the background and flesh out the story rather than mirroring the exact programme structures. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Robin McKie's book has the same breadth in time and space as the six programmes, ranging from the beginning of the human story in the African rainforests of five million years ago to the flowering of cave art in Europe near the end of the last Ice Age. It benefits from his trips to sites such as Amud Cave in Galilee, where the Israeli anthropologist Yoel Rak gave McKie such a vivid analogy for the complexity of early human evolution in the shape of the Star Wars bar, where many strange species are thrown together. </p> <p>McKie also experienced at first hand the challenging descent to the 'Pit of the Bones' in the Atapuerca Cave in Spain. Here, a collection of more than 2,000 human fossils representing more than 30 men, women and children somehow accumulated deep in the cave, giving McKie and us an unparalleled glimpse of the origins of the Neanderthals some 300,000 years ago. </p> <p>The expert can always question the way a pet theory has been presented, but whether taken in conjunction with the BBC series or not, this book captures the unsolved mysteries of current human origins research.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ape-Man Robin McKie BBC Worldwide \u00a319.99, pp216 Buy it at BOL Human evolution used to be interpreted as a ladder of progress, leading inexorably to modern humans as the sophisticated peak of perfection. Now, it is much more often seen as resembling a bush, with many branches that briefly flourished until they gave way, or gave rise, to new evolutionary experiments in how to become human. As the only surviving outcome of these experiments, it is easy for us to imagine that this is how it was meant to be. However, a burgeoning fossil record and a host of new techniques with which to study it are showing the complexity of humanity's past. For example, in the last three years we have seen the discovery of the first complete skeleton from near the root of our family tree, and from one of the closest branches to our own, the recovery of DNA from a Neanderthal fossil. Yet in both cases, the additional data seem to confirm that these were branches that did not lead to our own. In the wake of Walking With Dinosaurs, the BBC is now turning its attention to human evolution through a series called Ape-Man. This book, by The Observer's science editor, has been written to accompany the series, but aims to set the background and flesh out the story rather than mirroring the exact programme structures. Nevertheless, Robin McKie's book has the same breadth in time and space as the six programmes, ranging from the beginning of the human story in the African rainforests of five million years ago to the flowering of cave art in Europe near the end of the last Ice Age. It benefits from his trips to sites such as Amud Cave in Galilee, where the Israeli anthropologist Yoel Rak gave McKie such a vivid analogy for the complexity of early human evolution in the shape of the Star Wars bar, where many strange species are thrown together. McKie also experienced at first hand the challenging descent to the 'Pit of the Bones' in the Atapuerca Cave in Spain. Here, a collection of more than 2,000 human fossils representing more than 30 men, women and children somehow accumulated deep in the cave, giving McKie and us an unparalleled glimpse of the origins of the Neanderthals some 300,000 years ago. The expert can always question the way a pet theory has been presented, but whether taken in conjunction with the BBC series or not, this book captures the unsolved mysteries of current human origins research.",

It is 1914 and he was already a musical monster at the age of 32. His Russia was at war, but Stravinsky was not going to surrender to the chaos of Europe or, come to that, of the Ballets Russes. He dressed with eccentric dandyism: red ties, green waistcoats, dazzling check trousers - anything rather than the shabbiness of high-minded old Russia. He sat at a desk like a parade ground, with ranks of coloured ink bottles, lined-up rows of pens, knives and rulers and - like a big gun - 'that particular wheeled instrument which Stravinsky himself had invented for the drawing of staves'. </p> <p>This is the first volume of a grand, vividly written, closely researched and sardonically observed life of the composer. It moves on beyond the well-known accounts of Stravinsky's life by his friend and musical assistant, Robert Craft.

      "bodyText": "Stravinsky: A Creative Spring - Russia and France 1882-1934 Stephen Walsh Jonathan Cape \u00a330, ppp720 Stephen Walsh gives us a snapshot of Igor Stravinsky at home in Switzerland. It is 1914 and he was already a musical monster at the age of 32. His Russia was at war, but Stravinsky was not going to surrender to the chaos of Europe or, come to that, of the Ballets Russes. He dressed with eccentric dandyism: red ties, green waistcoats, dazzling check trousers - anything rather than the shabbiness of high-minded old Russia. He sat at a desk like a parade ground, with ranks of coloured ink bottles, lined-up rows of pens, knives and rulers and - like a big gun - 'that particular wheeled instrument which Stravinsky himself had invented for the drawing of staves'. This is the first volume of a grand, vividly written, closely researched and sardonically observed life of the composer. It moves on beyond the well-known accounts of Stravinsky's life by his friend and musical assistant, Robert Craft. A Creative Spring takes readers up to 1934, the end of a long transformation. He had just become a French citizen; Diaghilev, 'my passionately beloved Seriozha', had died a few years before. The composer's marriage to his long-suffering cousin Katya was breaking down, and he was spending much of his life with the fascinating Vera Sudeykin, later his second wife. Stravinsky was still impressed by Mussolini and had behaved with what Walsh calls 'repellently calculating' ambiguity in Nazi Germany in order to get himself accepted by the new masters there.

Empty Gestures, as I'm sure everyone will recall (I vividly remember my delight in opening the first hardback edition), consists of 303 numbered blank pages followed by an extensive index and bibliography. The reader (or more accurately, the reader/ writer) is invited to copy the references in the index into the relevant blank page until all have been reproduced.

W. and A.Durand, The Life History of Civilisation - 'either a work of overwhelming invention or a vast pile of shit' (New York Times).\" </p> <p>This is the dichotomy at the very heart of Mamet's book. Well, deciding between the two propositions is a very subjective affair and it would be easy to temporise and say that Wilson may not be a work of overwhelming invention or a vast pile of shit, but maybe something in between or different. But that would be to duck (possibly goose) the issue and, worse, avoid Mamet's implicit challenge to judge the work in those terms. </p> <p>Which side to come down on then? I repeat, these judgments are subjective and depend on a whole raft (particularly if you're on one at the time) of distracting ephemera. Was the milk a bit off in the fridge this morning? Are those spots of blood on the white sofa from the dog? Has Graham Hick failed again? All these and many more considerations can and do influence a balanced judgment of literary worth. However, today I was woken with a kiss, the mail brought me a postcard from my eldest son in Mongolia, I saw the first primrose down Tanners Lane and I came down firmly on the side of the second term.

Switch Off Your Television Set and Go and Do Something less Boring Instead , and on... perhaps even as far as EastEnders or Hollyoaks. Mrs Slocombe's Pussy will be a romp back through all our yesterday teatimes and furtive, late last nights, with acute personalised twist, a logical literary successor to those other warm, witty, self-deprecating, thirtysomething male confessional memoirs full of scabby-kneed, jumpers-for-goalposts nostalgie de la boue-pies or, if you like (and forgive me, do), recherche de la full-temps perdu. </p> <p>Like Nick Hornby and his Arsenal, Giles Smith and his rubbish pop band and John O'Farrell and his hilariously unfashionable politics before him, Jeffries attempts to raise wry smiles as he clobbers us with his cleverness. When he succeeds, the result is a deftly executed and amiable read. Chapter One is entitled '1967: Bill and Ben's Hats' and Jeffries kicks off with a lengthy Proustian reverie about eating custard tarts with his brother, Neil, at their nan's during Watch With Mother. </p> <p>Often, however, Stuart and Neil watched without their mother, contemplating the awesome beauty of what was then, to Jeffries, 'the most mournful, heartrending tune that has ever been played' - Valerie Cardnell singing 'in a voice of chilly purity' 'Time to stop play/ Just for today/ Andy and Teddy must now go away/ Andy is waving goodbye/ Goodbye/ Goodbye,' just before each of the letters spelling the words Andy Pandy were replaced by - what? Do you remember, children? Do you? That's right! Daisy heads.</p> <p>Ah, warm nostalgia indeed, if entirely unconvincing on one major count, namely the fact that the title fight (childhood division) for 'the most mournful, heartrending tune ever played' obviously features the theme from White Horses versus that of Robinson Crusoe and anyone who says otherwise is talking complete rot. </p> <p>Which is the whole problem with TV criticism - for every piece of smart-arsery from a broadsheet hack there will be several thousand equally pithy observations along the lines of 'Look at the state of that arse!' from an armchair-bound Jim Royle wannabe. Fact: we're all TV critics - some of us just get paid for it. Given this, I wonder at whom Mrs Slocombe is aimed and what constitutes its unique selling point?</p> <p>All that custard-tart stuff, alongside the revelation that watching thirtysomething made the then twentysomething author yearn for wood floors and venetian blinds if not babies, is too personal for what Jeffries himself describes as 'media studies types', while the extremely low-voltage candour of the 'confessional' is unlikely to satisfy junkies of that genre, for whom the emotional ante has clearly been upped in recent years. Indeed, reading at considerable length about the consumption of custard tarts in childhood would probably only be interesting if we knew that, say, brother Neil had simultaneously been forced to eat his in a cupboard under the stairs. And even then only probably. </p> <p>Jeffries also claims that, as an adult, when he heard of plans to recreate Bill and Ben, he 'was upset. It was as though someone had burgled my heart and taken away something that meant a great deal to me', which is most likely untrue, but if it really is true is an admission unlikely to resonate with any but the most emotionally constipated reader. </p> <p>Because the book is about watching TV, a passive activity, it is also a wallflower's guide to not having had much of a life. Thus it is via TV that Jeffries is given the opportunity to do the de rigueur footie memoir (too young to recall 1966, football only became important via the 1970 World Cup Finals - 'Was it my imagination or was colour more intense in Mexico than it was in England?' Jeffries muses. Confusingly, however, he finishes the footie reverie by observing that: 'Football, not boxing, is the beautiful game'). </p> <p>And it is via TV, too, that Jeffries has the opportunity to do a music memoir (like every other man under 50 with a word processor, he was once in a predictably overlooked but undoubtedly rubbish band. And he's watched a lot of Eurovision Song Contests, too). And, yes, it is TV that allows Jeffries to dabble in political memoir (being at Oxford when Brideshead Revisited was first televised ensured that, as a lad from the Midlands who grew up in a cul-de-sac, he couldn't bring himself to read any Waugh for years). </p> <p>Though there is much that is clever and intuitive about Stuart Jeffries's journalism for the Guardian; by the same token, there is a great deal in this book that seems forced, though perhaps this is highlighted by a fundamentally flawed premise - torn between pop cultural criticism and hip confessional, Mrs Slocombe pretty much fails on both counts. </p> <p>Incidentally, Why Don't You... Switch Off Your Television Set and Go and Do Something Less Boring Instead pops up in Jeffries's conclusion, only he calls it Why Don't You Just Turn Off Your Television Set And Go Out And Do Something Less Boring Instead, and I could have sworn... well, perhaps we're both a little bit right and a little bit wrong, a little bit 'whoar' and a little bit 'whay'. But that's TV criticism for you.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mrs Slocombe's Pussy: Growing Up in Front of the Telly Stuart Jeffries Flamingo \u00a312.99, pp389 Buy it at BOL Call me extraordinarily perceptive but I think there's a hint in the title that readers may be in for a bit of confessional autobiography alongside what is clearly intended to be a witty and perspicacious metacritique of late twentieth-century television output. 'Growing up in front of the telly' immediately tells me (and as Jeffries and I are both British thirtysomethings, I think I can comfortably make numerous assumptions) that the reader will be taken on a warm nostalgic ramble through The Woodentops and Thunderbirds, with a bit of Bagpuss, Bill and Ben, with Trumpton's near-legendary firefighters (Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb) thrown in for good measure. We may then be led gently but firmly by the hand through the metaphorical sandpit towards Blue Peter, Magpie and Why Don't You... Switch Off Your Television Set and Go and Do Something less Boring Instead , and on... perhaps even as far as EastEnders or Hollyoaks. Mrs Slocombe's Pussy will be a romp back through all our yesterday teatimes and furtive, late last nights, with acute personalised twist, a logical literary successor to those other warm, witty, self-deprecating, thirtysomething male confessional memoirs full of scabby-kneed, jumpers-for-goalposts nostalgie de la boue-pies or, if you like (and forgive me, do), recherche de la full-temps perdu. Like Nick Hornby and his Arsenal, Giles Smith and his rubbish pop band and John O'Farrell and his hilariously unfashionable politics before him, Jeffries attempts to raise wry smiles as he clobbers us with his cleverness. When he succeeds, the result is a deftly executed and amiable read. Chapter One is entitled '1967: Bill and Ben's Hats' and Jeffries kicks off with a lengthy Proustian reverie about eating custard tarts with his brother, Neil, at their nan's during Watch With Mother. Often, however, Stuart and Neil watched without their mother, contemplating the awesome beauty of what was then, to Jeffries, 'the most mournful, heartrending tune that has ever been played' - Valerie Cardnell singing 'in a voice of chilly purity' 'Time to stop play/ Just for today/ Andy and Teddy must now go away/ Andy is waving goodbye/ Goodbye/ Goodbye,' just before each of the letters spelling the words Andy Pandy were replaced by - what? Do you remember, children? Do you? That's right! Daisy heads. Ah, warm nostalgia indeed, if entirely unconvincing on one major count, namely the fact that the title fight (childhood division) for 'the most mournful, heartrending tune ever played' obviously features the theme from White Horses versus that of Robinson Crusoe and anyone who says otherwise is talking complete rot. Which is the whole problem with TV criticism - for every piece of smart-arsery from a broadsheet hack there will be several thousand equally pithy observations along the lines of 'Look at the state of that arse!' from an armchair-bound Jim Royle wannabe. Fact: we're all TV critics - some of us just get paid for it. Given this, I wonder at whom Mrs Slocombe is aimed and what constitutes its unique selling point? All that custard-tart stuff, alongside the revelation that watching thirtysomething made the then twentysomething author yearn for wood floors and venetian blinds if not babies, is too personal for what Jeffries himself describes as 'media studies types', while the extremely low-voltage candour of the 'confessional' is unlikely to satisfy junkies of that genre, for whom the emotional ante has clearly been upped in recent years. Indeed, reading at considerable length about the consumption of custard tarts in childhood would probably only be interesting if we knew that, say, brother Neil had simultaneously been forced to eat his in a cupboard under the stairs. And even then only probably. Jeffries also claims that, as an adult, when he heard of plans to recreate Bill and Ben, he 'was upset. It was as though someone had burgled my heart and taken away something that meant a great deal to me', which is most likely untrue, but if it really is true is an admission unlikely to resonate with any but the most emotionally constipated reader. Because the book is about watching TV, a passive activity, it is also a wallflower's guide to not having had much of a life. Thus it is via TV that Jeffries is given the opportunity to do the de rigueur footie memoir (too young to recall 1966, football only became important via the 1970 World Cup Finals - 'Was it my imagination or was colour more intense in Mexico than it was in England?' Jeffries muses. Confusingly, however, he finishes the footie reverie by observing that: 'Football, not boxing, is the beautiful game'). And it is via TV, too, that Jeffries has the opportunity to do a music memoir (like every other man under 50 with a word processor, he was once in a predictably overlooked but undoubtedly rubbish band. And he's watched a lot of Eurovision Song Contests, too). And, yes, it is TV that allows Jeffries to dabble in political memoir (being at Oxford when Brideshead Revisited was first televised ensured that, as a lad from the Midlands who grew up in a cul-de-sac, he couldn't bring himself to read any Waugh for years). Though there is much that is clever and intuitive about Stuart Jeffries's journalism for the Guardian; by the same token, there is a great deal in this book that seems forced, though perhaps this is highlighted by a fundamentally flawed premise - torn between pop cultural criticism and hip confessional, Mrs Slocombe pretty much fails on both counts. Incidentally, Why Don't You... Switch Off Your Television Set and Go and Do Something Less Boring Instead pops up in Jeffries's conclusion, only he calls it Why Don't You Just Turn Off Your Television Set And Go Out And Do Something Less Boring Instead, and I could have sworn... well, perhaps we're both a little bit right and a little bit wrong, a little bit 'whoar' and a little bit 'whay'. But that's TV criticism for you.",

'Cheating scouse bastards' was a common refrain around the time of their last-minute mix-up over a substitution in the FA Cup tie against Sunderland, and although the club escaped from that episode with no lasting stain on their character, 46 yellow cards and seven reds so far this season tell a sorry story.

Tranmere, needless to say, often score from Challinor's 46-yard monsters. </p> <p>'We're very committed, that's all,' said striker David Kelly, conjuring a euphemism of his own. That virtually goes without saying at a club managed by the unashamedly aggressive John Aldridge, whose stunning turnaround at Prenton Park has been highlighted by two glorious cup runs, yet whose sense of security is still threatened by a lowly League position. There is no doubt Tranmere's fighting spirit has troubled a number of Premiership sides, and if today's game were being played in Birkenhead, the shrinking violets of Leicester might not fancy their chances, but Aldridge's players have not been making a similar impression on First Division opponents. </p> <p>Given the financial constraints that Aldridge was under at the start of the season, and the fact the club were bottom in October, Rovers have already pulled off a minor miracle in putting a six- or seven-point safety cushion between themselves and the bottom three.

'It has been a tremendous managerial apprenticeship here,' he said. 'I've had three different chairmen and had to sell nearly \u00a310 million worth of players just to survive. The lads know I was on the verge of walking out. I couldn't keep selling players. Fortunately, I managed to bring in some lads who had been shown the door by other clubs and they all gelled within four or five weeks, but I had a hell of a lot to learn. You never stop learning as a player and I don't think I've done badly.' </p> <p>A comparison with John Barnes's experiences at Celtic suggests itself. 'That was unfortunate,' Aldridge said. 'It was a massive job for him to take. I'm sure he will come good again, but maybe it is better to start in the lower reaches and go up in stages, as I've done. Management is very stressful, but it's less boring than playing golf every day, which is what I'd probably be doing.' </p> <p>Management brings criticism too, as the managers of Leicester and Tranmere will have noticed. 'I possibly have something in common with Martin O'Neill,' Aldridge said. 'He's done a magnificent job. They work very hard and nullify teams like Arsenal, yet get criticised. We get criticised for being a long-ball team, but when you have good midfield players like we have, and so do Leicester with Muzzy Izzet and Neil Lennon, there's no point in bypassing the midfield. We did play long balls against Newcastle last Sunday, it didn't do us much good.' </p> <p>Tranmere swith happily to long-ball mode every time they win a throw-in, but Aldridge dismisses Barry Venison's suggestion they rely too heavily on Challinor. 'We've scored 50-odd goals this season and maybe eight or nine from throws. That's a decent percentage, it puts teams under pressure, but it's daft to say it's all we rely on.' </p> <p>Rovers nevertheless practise the ploy in training. 'We do set-play work on corners, free-kicks and long throws,' Kelly said. 'Always have. Dave is only new to Premiership teams, anyone who has been watching football in this division will know we've been working on it for years. At Middlesbrough a couple of years back he got the ball beyond the far post from the halfway line and you could hear the whole crowd going \"Wow\".' </p> <p>You could almost hear the same thing on Wednesday when people realised Liverpool might not be wasting their money if they bought Emile Heskey. With Wayne Allison cup-tied, Leicester look to have a clear edge in a final that may be short on the 'wow' factor, but Aldridge knows from personal experience that well-motivated underdogs occasionally have their day at Wembley.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tranmere Rovers manager John Aldridge has gone to great lengths to keep his Cup heroes together. Some might say he has gone a little too far by threatening to drop players from today's Wembley Worthington Cup line-up against Leicester City if they do not sign new contracts. </p> <p>None of the Tranmere players has reached a Wembley final before and it might be a long wait before they get there again. Goalkeeper John Achterberg blocked Premiership attacks from Coventry, Middlesbrough and Sunderland this year, but for the club's 'biggest game ever' he is on the bench. 'I am not the only one who is surprised about Aldridge's move this time,' says a disappointed Achterberg, who will not be rushed into a new deal - and has now been axed. </p> <p>After beating Sunderland 1-0 in that controversial FA Cup tie, when Achterberg performed heroics to keep a clean sheet, Aldridge offered him a new three-year con tract. But Achterberg stalled. 'If he had offered me that contract a few months earlier, I would probably have signed. But I have been doing well and the eyes of England and Europe are on Tranmere, I may have other options. It's only natural.' </p> <p>Aldridge is squeezing those who prevaricate. Frenchman George Santos was the first 'victim' of Aldridge's 'sign or be dropped' policy. Alan Mahon was next. Contract wrangles left midfielder Mahon on the bench as Aldridge's frustration grew at the lack of a pointer to the youngster's future intentions. </p> <p>Mahon and utility player Gary Jones, another contract target, both did play in last Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final against Newcastle. Achterberg was told that he would be replaced by Joe Murphy - as soon as Murphy had recovered from a broken collarbone - if he did not sign his contract. </p> <p>Achterberg did not sign and he did not play. It left 19-year-old Murphy up against Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson with only one game for the reserves behind him since his injury in December - and he conceded three. 'I can only conclude that I was dropped for these two cup matches because I did not sign the contract,' says Achterburg, who stresses that he has enjoyed two happy years with Aldridge whom he describes as 'a winner'. </p> <p>It would be hard to imagine Aldridge benching key players today to make a point. Then again, as Achterberg pointed out: 'After all the strange decisions he has made in the last two years, it would not surprise me. With Aldridge you just never know.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tranmere Rovers manager John Aldridge has gone to great lengths to keep his Cup heroes together. Some might say he has gone a little too far by threatening to drop players from today's Wembley Worthington Cup line-up against Leicester City if they do not sign new contracts. None of the Tranmere players has reached a Wembley final before and it might be a long wait before they get there again. Goalkeeper John Achterberg blocked Premiership attacks from Coventry, Middlesbrough and Sunderland this year, but for the club's 'biggest game ever' he is on the bench. 'I am not the only one who is surprised about Aldridge's move this time,' says a disappointed Achterberg, who will not be rushed into a new deal - and has now been axed. After beating Sunderland 1-0 in that controversial FA Cup tie, when Achterberg performed heroics to keep a clean sheet, Aldridge offered him a new three-year con tract. But Achterberg stalled. 'If he had offered me that contract a few months earlier, I would probably have signed. But I have been doing well and the eyes of England and Europe are on Tranmere, I may have other options. It's only natural.' Aldridge is squeezing those who prevaricate. Frenchman George Santos was the first 'victim' of Aldridge's 'sign or be dropped' policy. Alan Mahon was next. Contract wrangles left midfielder Mahon on the bench as Aldridge's frustration grew at the lack of a pointer to the youngster's future intentions. Mahon and utility player Gary Jones, another contract target, both did play in last Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final against Newcastle. Achterberg was told that he would be replaced by Joe Murphy - as soon as Murphy had recovered from a broken collarbone - if he did not sign his contract. Achterberg did not sign and he did not play. It left 19-year-old Murphy up against Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson with only one game for the reserves behind him since his injury in December - and he conceded three. 'I can only conclude that I was dropped for these two cup matches because I did not sign the contract,' says Achterburg, who stresses that he has enjoyed two happy years with Aldridge whom he describes as 'a winner'. It would be hard to imagine Aldridge benching key players today to make a point. Then again, as Achterberg pointed out: 'After all the strange decisions he has made in the last two years, it would not surprise me. With Aldridge you just never know.'",

      "body": "<p> Can films change the world? The director of this year's most controversial film, The Hurricane, ponders the question. An energetic 73, Norman Jewison isn't given to flip answers. 'When I was young I thought I could change the world. When I was young I thought my films were going have a tremendous effect. </p> <p>'When I made The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! (1966) I had the chance to have the first screening with the Vice President of the United States and the next screening in Moscow with 2,000 people. I think it made people smile, and laugh at the ridiculous confrontation of the Cold War. But I don't think it changed anything. I don't think films have that much effect.' </p> <p>He pauses, reconsiders: 'They help, I guess, if one or two people pay attention. Maybe they are more important now than they were. They've become the literature of this generation. I think films are the engines that drive television, and there are cassettes and DVDs, they see them again and again. So maybe...' </p> <p>Jewison has had a strange career. Toronto-born and based he may be, but he is the classic Hollywood pro, having directed everything from Doris Day comedies to Rollerball, Jesus Christ Superstar to Moonstruck - at least one masterpiece and plenty of duds. But the one thing that marks him out is a thread of liberalism, taking in the classic In The Heat Of The Night (1967), F.I.S.T .(1978), a union drama starring Sylvester Stallone, ...And Justice For All (1979) and A Soldier's Story, a 1984 film which marked the first time that Jewison worked with Denzel Washington, star of The Hurricane. </p> <p> The Hurricane is loosely - we'll come back to that - the story of how an African-American teenager and a group of Canadian activists helped clear the name of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, a middleweight title contender who was jailed for murder in 1966. He maintained his innocence, becoming a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the early Seventies, the subject of a great Bob Dylan song. After two trials and endless appeals, Carter's conviction was finally overturned in 1985, a decision backed by the Supreme Court in 1988. </p> <p>The film is a big anti-racist tearjerker, in the best sense of the term. Washington is astonishing as Carter, a complex, angry, difficult and independently minded man who has never made things easy for himself. </p> <p> The Hurricane has done well at the box office, too.

Yes. Did he struggle with his rage? Yes. Were the police fair? No. Were they racist, trying to pin a murder on him? Yes.' </p> <p>It is a curious coincidence that The Hurricane stands together in the dock with two other 'true stories' that exist somewhere to the left of mainstream America, and yet are big budget Hollywood productions. One is The Insider, the expos\u00e9 of Big Tobacco, the other is Cradle Will Rock, Tim Robbins's reconstruction of the fate of publicly funded, progressive theatre during the Depression, with a cast of characters that includes Orson Welles and Nelson Rockefeller. All three reconstruct history for narrative purposes so openly that it has been easy to pick holes in them. After seeing both The Hurricane and Cradle With Rock, my companions burst out: 'It can't have really happened like that, can it?' And the answer is, no, it didn't.

Three weeks ago the Governor Of Illinois stopped all executions in that state because there were nine people on death row through DNA evidence, and lab tests proved them innocent.

Not only convicted of a capital crime, but sentenced to death. Isn't that pretty scary? There are only two industrialised countries that still maintain capital punishment: the US and Japan.

      "bodyText": "Can films change the world? The director of this year's most controversial film, The Hurricane, ponders the question. An energetic 73, Norman Jewison isn't given to flip answers. 'When I was young I thought I could change the world. When I was young I thought my films were going have a tremendous effect. 'When I made The Russians Are Coming! The Russians Are Coming! (1966) I had the chance to have the first screening with the Vice President of the United States and the next screening in Moscow with 2,000 people. I think it made people smile, and laugh at the ridiculous confrontation of the Cold War. But I don't think it changed anything. I don't think films have that much effect.' He pauses, reconsiders: 'They help, I guess, if one or two people pay attention. Maybe they are more important now than they were. They've become the literature of this generation. I think films are the engines that drive television, and there are cassettes and DVDs, they see them again and again. So maybe...' Jewison has had a strange career. Toronto-born and based he may be, but he is the classic Hollywood pro, having directed everything from Doris Day comedies to Rollerball, Jesus Christ Superstar to Moonstruck - at least one masterpiece and plenty of duds. But the one thing that marks him out is a thread of liberalism, taking in the classic In The Heat Of The Night (1967), F.I.S.T .(1978), a union drama starring Sylvester Stallone, ...And Justice For All (1979) and A Soldier's Story, a 1984 film which marked the first time that Jewison worked with Denzel Washington, star of The Hurricane. The Hurricane is loosely - we'll come back to that - the story of how an African-American teenager and a group of Canadian activists helped clear the name of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, a middleweight title contender who was jailed for murder in 1966. He maintained his innocence, becoming a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the early Seventies, the subject of a great Bob Dylan song. After two trials and endless appeals, Carter's conviction was finally overturned in 1985, a decision backed by the Supreme Court in 1988. The film is a big anti-racist tearjerker, in the best sense of the term. Washington is astonishing as Carter, a complex, angry, difficult and independently minded man who has never made things easy for himself. The Hurricane has done well at the box office, too. But it has been attacked by journalists who think it takes a few too many liberties with the facts; by one of Carter's lawyers, who thinks too much credit goes to the left-wing Canadians who joined Carter's cause in the early Eighties; by people in Patterson, New Jersey who still believe Carter was guilty all along; and even by one of Carter's boxing opponents, who complains that a scene with Carter battering him senseless distorts the truth. All these queries are reckoned to have been enough to deprive The Hurricane of a Best Picture Oscar nomination. Jewison has detailed answers to all of the criticisms.

Do I think there is controversy about Rubin Carter? Absolutely. Is it going to last until the grave? Yes! Was he mean-spirited, criminal-minded and full of rage? Yes! Did I show him full of rage?

He was nearly always plain Stan until 80,000 folk craning around me at Wembley (everyone, that is, except the dumbstruck Bolton end) began chanting 'On Stanley, on!' in the decisive last 20 minutes of the 1953 FA Cup Final when Blackpool turned a 3-1 deficit into a fabled 4-3 victory. We were so impressed and bewitched by the wizard that nobody harkened much to pioneer anoraks missing the point as usual by objecting that the final was being named after the wrong Stanley. Mortensen, not Matthews, was their man because he scored a hat-trick. </p> <p>As with the cigarettes, as with the boots (and, statistically, the final) some portions of Matthews' legend can seem like the production of smoke and mirrors. </p> <p>For instance, the Matthews column. A good dozen years before Danny Blanchflower typed his own stuff for Fleet Street, Matthews was the first active footballer with a national column... of which he didn't write a word. It was the work of Ken Abram, a wartime paratrooper and the northern sports editor of the Sunday Express, in whose office I first met Stan. When I say met, it was actually a case of looking up from my desk in 1951 and there he was. Taller than I realised from having seen him since boyhood always stooped in match photographs and jerky newsreels. About 5ft 10in at a guess and with a full head of sleek, light-brown hair that would have caught everyone's eye on a Brylcreem poster. </p> <p>But another winger, an outside-left, not -right like Matthews, had waltzed off with the Brylcreem contract. Denis Compton (Test cricketer, Arsenal footballer) and Matthews played together for England in eight wartime internationals, most notably an 8-0 obliteration of Scotland at Maine Road in 1943. Tommy Lawton scored four of the goals and two years later planted a most fruitful shot into the astute mind of Matthews. 'Look,' said the great centre-forward, indicating 133,000 spectators at Hampden Park as the war was ending. 'We've filled the place, but the bloody gatemen are paid more than us!' </p> <p>Matthews, unknown to the authorities and the snitches of 88 league clubs with their vested interest in keeping players shackled by the maximum wage, found an answer within 12 months. Testimonial appearances. </p> <p>Josh McCosh, a Scottish defender granted a benefit match for his management of the now defunct Dublin club Drumcondra, told me long ago at his home in Ayr of the brainwave that made the event a smash hit: 'I got in touch with Stan, offered to fly him from Blackpool and back in a day with \u00a3500 in notes for playing.' </p> <p>Stan came and so did the star-starved Irish people. Dalymount Park, which held 46,000 (only 1,800 seated), filled not far short of bursting. Drumcondra, even with Matthews, lost 6-0 to their guests from Greenock Morton but McCosh and Stan were laughing. The manager, in a country where workers slaved for \u00a33 a week, picked up nearly \u00a32,500 after expenses. As for Matthews, a wage of \u00a310 a week feels more bearable when one can pocket a year's undetected money in a day. </p> <p>Ernie Taylor, the little inside-right who partnered Matthews in the 1953 final, once blackguarded him as 'The meanest man in football.' I know a reporter who was packing in the Seventies for a flight to Malta where he was to write two articles on Stan's self-imposed exile when the office phoned to say: 'He wants the fee [\u00a33,000] in cash.' Sheer greed? Not in my opinion. Matthews was only protecting himself in a profession fraught with sudden danger and a world so quick to exploit footballers. </p> <p>From early life in Ludlow Street, Hanley, Stoke, and his father's barber-shop behind a tobacconist's in Market Street (two minutes' walk from the statue now burgeoning with wreaths), Stan Matthews had a close-up of life's pitfalls. </p> <p>A big brother lost a leg in Flanders, father Jack Matthews plied his cut-throat razors and brushes while aching all over with pain from which even his exceptional stamina and evasiveness could not protect him in the boxing ring. It's said Jack had 350 fights but they were mostly for modest purses except for a non-title bout in the Potteries against the European bantam champion, Tommy Harrison. Twenty rounds; folks liked their money's worth in those days. </p> <p>At 14, Stan signed for Stoke City instead of Port Vale, the club he supported. Yet it worked out well. He was playing for England at 19, married to the trainer's daughter at 20 and might have stayed for ever in the Potteries but for the war taking him to Blackpool and Scotland where he played for Rangers, Morton and in a Scottish Cup semi-final for Airdrie. </p> <p>This was the world of guest appearances unlimited and white fivers slipped into uniform breast pockets after any vic tory. No surprise really that, despite five years on RAF pay, Stan and Betty could celebrate peace by buying themselves an hotel in Blackpool. Tiled like an Odeon entrance and hard by the Tower. </p> <p>Once, as manager Tony Waddington told me, Stan charged the club 200 gold sovereigns (about \u00a36,000) for playing an extra, uncontracted tour match in the Middle East. No paper money, only gold coins were acceptable. Waddington had to enlist help from the home club and local traders in the market to provide them. </p> <p>Whatever Stan cost, he was worth it. At 46, the oldest player in the Football League and yet still able to bamboozle full-backs into falling flat on their backs. He helped Stoke back into the First Division. Promotion was clinched by a 2-0 home win that relegated opponents, Luton Town. I was in the dressing-room afterwards watching Stan wave away champagne before slipping his arm round a blind fan's shoulders and leading him round the dressing-room to meet every player and talk about the game that he had only heard. </p> <p>Bill Harvey, Luton's manager, watched with me. He didn't, unlike so many of today's sour bosses, snarl or rail against fate, but said: 'Look at Stan. He deserves everything he's had from football. He's so human.' </p> <p>This brings me to Pat Brogan, the friend who, at the family's request, broke the news of Stanley's death in time to arrange the armbands and silence at Wembley. For the past 20 years or so, hardly anybody has been closer to Stan than Brogan. He had a special 'in' as a middleweight boxer who fought three eventual world champions - Alan Minter, Maurice Hope and, as an amateur, John Conteh - on their way up. Stan, who had sparred with pros, never lost his love of the noble art and Brogan took him to every show in the Potteries and far beyond. He says, 'In thousands of hours together, I never heard him swear or use bad language. He always remembered what his father taught him which was never to be goaded into losing one's temper.' </p> <p>It was this controlled calm which once led Jimmy Armfield, Blackpool's captain and Matthews' right-back, into describing him to me with a word which he may well feel inappropriate now. </p> <p>'He could have been an assassin,' said Armfield, not meaning that Stan had the slightest streak of murder in his nature, but that he possessed almost inhuman concentration on his work. He instanced a match at Chelsea when Matthews was left in a crumpled heap by a full-back not far from twice his size. </p> <p>'Mistimed tackle,' they call it now, but that's nothing like the term employed by Armfield. He recalled: 'Stan was off for 20 minutes. No substitutes then, of course. When he came back, he said only one thing to me: \"Knock it in! Keep knocking it in\". He wanted more and more of the ball.' </p> <p>Armfield obliged and saw Matthews heading straight for his tormentor. The damaged leg, strapped like a mummy's, must have been throbbing almost intolerably. </p> <p>'That made no difference,' said Armfield. 'He dummied him, then dummied him again. When the ball came back once more, Stan tied him in knots. The crowd began laughing. Stan was something of a national treasure and spectators all over didn't like seeing him chopped down unfairly. This change of mood drained the full-back. From big bully, he turned into a demoralised wreck. Quivering as Stan walked towards him, tapping the ball enticingly and daring the giant to challenge for it. And, all the time, laughter and contempt from the crowd as he retreated to his own goal-line.' </p> <p>In all the obituaries and reminiscences you have read in the past three days, that is something which nobody mentioned. </p> <p>Sir Stanley Matthews? By God, he was brave!</p>",

Denis Compton (Test cricketer, Arsenal footballer) and Matthews played together for England in eight wartime internationals, most notably an 8-0 obliteration of Scotland at Maine Road in 1943. Tommy Lawton scored four of the goals and two years later planted a most fruitful shot into the astute mind of Matthews. 'Look,' said the great centre-forward, indicating 133,000 spectators at Hampden Park as the war was ending. 'We've filled the place, but the bloody gatemen are paid more than us!' Matthews, unknown to the authorities and the snitches of 88 league clubs with their vested interest in keeping players shackled by the maximum wage, found an answer within 12 months. Testimonial appearances. Josh McCosh, a Scottish defender granted a benefit match for his management of the now defunct Dublin club Drumcondra, told me long ago at his home in Ayr of the brainwave that made the event a smash hit: 'I got in touch with Stan, offered to fly him from Blackpool and back in a day with \u00a3500 in notes for playing.' Stan came and so did the star-starved Irish people. Dalymount Park, which held 46,000 (only 1,800 seated), filled not far short of bursting. Drumcondra, even with Matthews, lost 6-0 to their guests from Greenock Morton but McCosh and Stan were laughing. The manager, in a country where workers slaved for \u00a33 a week, picked up nearly \u00a32,500 after expenses. As for Matthews, a wage of \u00a310 a week feels more bearable when one can pocket a year's undetected money in a day. Ernie Taylor, the little inside-right who partnered Matthews in the 1953 final, once blackguarded him as 'The meanest man in football.' I know a reporter who was packing in the Seventies for a flight to Malta where he was to write two articles on Stan's self-imposed exile when the office phoned to say: 'He wants the fee [\u00a33,000] in cash.' Sheer greed? Not in my opinion. Matthews was only protecting himself in a profession fraught with sudden danger and a world so quick to exploit footballers. From early life in Ludlow Street, Hanley, Stoke, and his father's barber-shop behind a tobacconist's in Market Street (two minutes' walk from the statue now burgeoning with wreaths), Stan Matthews had a close-up of life's pitfalls. A big brother lost a leg in Flanders, father Jack Matthews plied his cut-throat razors and brushes while aching all over with pain from which even his exceptional stamina and evasiveness could not protect him in the boxing ring. It's said Jack had 350 fights but they were mostly for modest purses except for a non-title bout in the Potteries against the European bantam champion, Tommy Harrison. Twenty rounds; folks liked their money's worth in those days. At 14, Stan signed for Stoke City instead of Port Vale, the club he supported. Yet it worked out well. He was playing for England at 19, married to the trainer's daughter at 20 and might have stayed for ever in the Potteries but for the war taking him to Blackpool and Scotland where he played for Rangers, Morton and in a Scottish Cup semi-final for Airdrie. This was the world of guest appearances unlimited and white fivers slipped into uniform breast pockets after any vic tory. No surprise really that, despite five years on RAF pay, Stan and Betty could celebrate peace by buying themselves an hotel in Blackpool. Tiled like an Odeon entrance and hard by the Tower. Once, as manager Tony Waddington told me, Stan charged the club 200 gold sovereigns (about \u00a36,000) for playing an extra, uncontracted tour match in the Middle East. No paper money, only gold coins were acceptable. Waddington had to enlist help from the home club and local traders in the market to provide them. Whatever Stan cost, he was worth it. At 46, the oldest player in the Football League and yet still able to bamboozle full-backs into falling flat on their backs. He helped Stoke back into the First Division. Promotion was clinched by a 2-0 home win that relegated opponents, Luton Town. I was in the dressing-room afterwards watching Stan wave away champagne before slipping his arm round a blind fan's shoulders and leading him round the dressing-room to meet every player and talk about the game that he had only heard. Bill Harvey, Luton's manager, watched with me. He didn't, unlike so many of today's sour bosses, snarl or rail against fate, but said: 'Look at Stan. He deserves everything he's had from football. He's so human.' This brings me to Pat Brogan, the friend who, at the family's request, broke the news of Stanley's death in time to arrange the armbands and silence at Wembley. For the past 20 years or so, hardly anybody has been closer to Stan than Brogan. He had a special 'in' as a middleweight boxer who fought three eventual world champions - Alan Minter, Maurice Hope and, as an amateur, John Conteh - on their way up. Stan, who had sparred with pros, never lost his love of the noble art and Brogan took him to every show in the Potteries and far beyond. He says, 'In thousands of hours together, I never heard him swear or use bad language. He always remembered what his father taught him which was never to be goaded into losing one's temper.' It was this controlled calm which once led Jimmy Armfield, Blackpool's captain and Matthews' right-back, into describing him to me with a word which he may well feel inappropriate now. 'He could have been an assassin,' said Armfield, not meaning that Stan had the slightest streak of murder in his nature, but that he possessed almost inhuman concentration on his work. He instanced a match at Chelsea when Matthews was left in a crumpled heap by a full-back not far from twice his size. 'Mistimed tackle,' they call it now, but that's nothing like the term employed by Armfield. He recalled: 'Stan was off for 20 minutes. No substitutes then, of course. When he came back, he said only one thing to me: \"Knock it in! Keep knocking it in\". He wanted more and more of the ball.' Armfield obliged and saw Matthews heading straight for his tormentor. The damaged leg, strapped like a mummy's, must have been throbbing almost intolerably. 'That made no difference,' said Armfield. 'He dummied him, then dummied him again. When the ball came back once more, Stan tied him in knots. The crowd began laughing. Stan was something of a national treasure and spectators all over didn't like seeing him chopped down unfairly. This change of mood drained the full-back. From big bully, he turned into a demoralised wreck. Quivering as Stan walked towards him, tapping the ball enticingly and daring the giant to challenge for it. And, all the time, laughter and contempt from the crowd as he retreated to his own goal-line.' In all the obituaries and reminiscences you have read in the past three days, that is something which nobody mentioned. Sir Stanley Matthews? By God, he was brave!",

      "body": "<p>You could just picture Martin O'Neill pacing his living-room, perhaps in tracksuit bottoms and sweatshirt, and wincing as he watched. When Emile Heskey tumbled clumsily over an Argentine defender and lay still for a minute or two, the Leicester City manager must have been cursing Kevin Keegan. When the muscular striker later took an arm in the face, O'Neill may well have been hurling more than abuse at the screen. </p> <p>In the event, the England manager has done O'Neill a favour for the club's big event, the Worthington Cup final against Tranmere Rovers at Wembley this afternoon. Heskey emerged physically undiminished and psychologically enhanced by his promising performance of pace and power on his full debut for the national team. If hapless Tranmere do not suffer the backlash, then Leicester will surely have ill-served and ill-used Heskey today. </p> <p>In 90 minutes, Heskey went from a 6ft 2in, 14-stone bundle of raw material to a player of greater stature, a potential partner for Alan Shearer, having all but cemented his place in Keegan's Euro 2000 squad. All this against the prime steak of Argentina, if not performing to their peak certainly not wishing to be embarrassed. Tranmere should now seem like easy meat. </p> <p>'I told him that when you're driving in your car back to Leicester after the game trying to think about the Worthington Cup final, don't think, \"I wish I had done that, I wish I had tried that,\" but to just go out and do it,' said Keegan. 'I think he did what I asked of him. He was very positive and I really liked the partnership with Alan Shearer, probably most of all those I have tried.' </p> <p>Keegan spoke also of Heskey giving England an option in attack. When the Liverpool pair of Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler are fully fit again, they seem certainties for the summer 22 but Heskey also fulfils Shearer's preference for a target player alongside him as well being the sort of Old Englishe totem that so unsettles defenders unused to the high ball still prevalent in the Premiership. Heskey should see the humiliating withdrawal of the Argentina captain Roberto Sensini as his marker after just 35 minutes as a real feather in his cap. </p> <p>On the night several points were made - though hardly that English football was restored to full health after the Scotland defeat, given only one shot on target - it was interesting that Keegan pulled off Shearer first and left on Heskey until 12 minutes from time. And to think O'Neill had requested Heskey's omission. </p> <p>Before Euro 2000, we might even see Heskey and Owen paired, as they were so successfully for England Under 21 against Greece three years ago. And not only for England. Liverpool remains Heskey's likely destination, since he supported them as a boy and John Barnes was as much a hero of the shy, taciturn lad as Gary Lineker. It could even be next week, win or lose today, should Leicester decide to cash in now rather than the summer when Heskey has just a year left on his contract. </p> <p>One can certainly see why any striker would want him alongside, with the attention he attracts as diversion and the space he creates as a result. Steve Claridge, whose canny game dovetailed well with Heskey's at Filbert Street in his formative years, enjoyed his old partner's performance. 'I was pleased for him. Everyone knows that he is quick and powerful, but his talent is also under-rated. What sets him apart is that while there are a lot of big strikers around, there are very few with his ability.' </p> <p>Like Keegan, who talked about Heskey building on this, Claridge would now like to see him kick on to a new level. 'Because of his strength, he's been used a certain way, with the ball over the top for example, and a lot of teams in the Premiership can't stop what he's got. But he probably needs to improve his first touch and his link play for the international game. He's 22 and has got time to learn.' </p> <p>Heskey proved himself a quick learner last Wednesday. His first touch after 30 seconds gave the ball to Argentina and he did not see it for another three minutes. After that, he protected it well and his link play showed a huge improvement since Claridge's day as he brought others into the game. When Jason Wilcox delivered a ball into the inside-left channel, Heskey held it up neatly before laying it off to Dennis Wise. On another occasion, David Beckham would have been proud of Heskey's ball out wide to Wilcox. </p> <p>Just as with England's performance, though, it is too soon to get carried away. There are many aspects to Heskey's game that need honing before he is the finished article, which is why a move to a bigger club, with more variation in their game and a larger collection of talented players than Leicester possess, will suit him well in the near future. Leicester can be a sow's ear and Heskey is in need of a silk purse. And while his finishing can certainly improve, he also needs to be with a team that creates more chances. </p> <p>Indeed, goalscoring is the first reservation about him, shown by only five this season. It was not hard to see why. In his eagerness to please, at one point he pulled the ball back towards Shearer rather than shoot after a splendidly direct run. The angle was narrow, but it was difficult to imagine Shearer not going for goal in the same situation. Heskey himself admitted to his agent after the game that at Filbert Street he would have taken the shot. </p> <p>Professionals also talk of Heskey's penchant for running from 'inside to out', in other words, away from goal. The prolific scorers with similar pace, as Ian Wright and Nicolas Anelka showed at Arsenal, run 'outside to in'. The potential, to be used more often, is there, though. Against Arsenal last season, Heskey cut inside from the right and scored with a fierce shot from his left foot. Martin Keown admitted to being surprised by the improvement in his left foot. Frequently, Heskey's starting position is deep, because he is required to do so much donkey work for his club and so that he can drag defenders with him to create the space for the long ball in behind. As Wright discovered at international level, it works less often against the cannier, deeper defences. </p> <p>In addition, there were times against Argentina when Heskey had done some good work to instigate an attack but was not then in the penalty box for the final ball. Nor at the highest level, is he likely to get so many chances in the air, with supply from the wings restricted and top teams conceding fewer free-kicks in dangerous areas. </p> <p>And while his enthusiasm is to be encouraged, it should be tempered with the advice that sometimes discretion is the better part of valour. The early upending was an example that you can't play when injured or on your backside. At that moment, his nickname of Bruno seemed less to do with his physique than the fact that he seemed to go down so easily. He has a big heart, though. After the elbow from Roberto Ayala, you could almost hear him saying to the trainer: 'It's OK. I can go one more round.' </p> <p>As Claridge says, 'He can get better but he's already got a lot.' As Keegan said, 'If he does that on Sunday, he will pull the house down.' Heskey himself accepts the goalscoring criticism and believes today to be a good opportunity to respond. </p> <p>The best of Buenos Aires only just coped. Birkenhead's finest will be harder pressed to manage.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Without wishing to pour cold water on the near-euphoria that followed England's game against Argentina last week, I would like to add a dose of reality to proceedings. </p> <p>There are lies, damned lies and statistics and the two most telling statistics were that England managed just one real shot on target, and that possession was given away more than one in three times. For all the talk of an encouraging performance from a team that is taking shape to challenge for the European Championship, those are worrying facts. </p> <p>The major problem is Kevin Keegan's persistence with a formation based on three central defenders and two wing-backs.

      "bodyText": "Without wishing to pour cold water on the near-euphoria that followed England's game against Argentina last week, I would like to add a dose of reality to proceedings. There are lies, damned lies and statistics and the two most telling statistics were that England managed just one real shot on target, and that possession was given away more than one in three times. For all the talk of an encouraging performance from a team that is taking shape to challenge for the European Championship, those are worrying facts. The major problem is Kevin Keegan's persistence with a formation based on three central defenders and two wing-backs. It is a system Terry Venables used from time to time and Glenn Hoddle placed a lot of faith in, but has been largely discarded by the rest of the world in favour of a 4-4-2 formation. I have been to coaching seminars around the world, and the consensus is that the notion of using wing-backs is fundamentally flawed if you are aiming to play attacking football, unless you have outstanding players in those positions.

The last Englishman who came into this category was Paul Gascoigne and the nearest we have now is Joe Cole, who has just turned 18. Until we are able to integrate Cole into England's midfield, we will continue to struggle in terms of goalscoring because teams playing wing-backs tend not to concede too many goals but nor do they score many.

      "body": "<p>According to Kevin Keegan the jury is still out on David Beckham as a central midfielder, but it was significant that shortly after England's encouraging draw with Argentina the manager spoke of restoring him to his right-sided role and switching him inside again only in some unforeseen emergency. 'Becks is still possibly best on the right, but I needed to see him in the middle and I wouldn't hesitate to throw him in there again,' Keegan said. 'He can only get better.' </p> <p>Possibly he needs to, for as our statistics show, Beckham's distribution left plenty of room for improvement. Diego Simeone said England gave the ball away too easily, and the normally accurate Beckham is in the dock as chief culprit. No fewer than 30 of his passes went astray, compared to 27 to a team-mate, giving the Manchester United player the worst ratio on the night. Stats do not tell the whole story, and Beckham is obliged to be more adventurous in his passing than Paul Scholes or Jason Wilcox, but the same could be said of Dennis Wise, whose figures of 40 successful passes and only 10 failures suggest he made a more effective midfield contribution. </p> <p>So if the most obvious conclusion at Wembley was that Emile Heskey had just played himself into the squad for Euro 2000, the next was that Wise had done likewise. Beckham did not do enough to convince Keegan that he can hurt opponents from midfield as much as he can from the right, nor did Kieron Dyer step forward as an adequate alternative, though Darren Anderton remains a possibility. </p> <p>Beckham's deployment in the middle also seemed to subdue Paul Scholes, so it was little wonder Wise caught the eye. Perhaps he was allowed to by Argentina, who rarely put Wise's defensive qualities to the test, but even if Keegan prefers the security of Paul Ince for the real competition, he is not so well off for creative, intelligent midfielders that he can afford to leave Wise out of the final 22. </p> <p>Like Heskey, Wise needs to keep an eye on various Sicknotes, but whereas the return of Michael Owen or even Robbie Fowler might push the Leicester striker to the sidelines, it is much more debatable whether Jamie Redknapp or Anderton will stake strong enough claims in the next three months. In addition to Fowler and Owen, Keegan mentioned Tony Adams and Graeme Le Saux as players he is hoping to see fit by the time Brazil arrive in May. By then he will have named a squad of 35, to be trimmed to 22 after the Ukraine game on 31 May and as he intends to take three goalkeepers he effectively has only nine outfield options to add to whatever he decides to be his strongest team. </p> <p>'That will be the difficult bit,' Keegan said. 'I'm going to have to go to people I like, players who have not let me down, and say \"Sorry, not this time\". But play ers know I can only pick 22 names, even if around 30 have a chance.' </p> <p>Keegan's thinking should become clearer by the end of May, when he will at least know who will be fit for Euro 2000. Hopefully he will also know then what shape of team he is going to take into the opener against Portugal. At the moment he appears undecided. The back three went well enough on Wednesday, even permitting a sight of Rio Ferdinand as sweeper, but it turned out to be more a test of Argentina's defence than England's. The last time Keegan was asked whether he favoured a three or a four, he said he preferred to wait and see who turned up. Now he intends to spend the next three months thinking about it, which probably amounts to much the same thing. Adams's fitness is possibly the key, and Keegan is the sort of coach who will listen to his players' preferences (invariably a back four) instead of imposing a system on them. For what it is worth though, Keegan insisted Wednesday's exercise was the first time he had enjoyed free rein to try out exactly what he had in mind. </p> <p>'I could have gone with a three or a four,' he said, 'and although I wouldn't like to commit myself at this stage I thought the back three did a sterling job. We looked very solid. I kept telling the players we won't meet anyone as strong as Argentina in Euro 2000, and I still don't think we will.' </p> <p>Keegan had Alan Ball drafted in to convey the same positive message, partly because the England dressing-room strikes him as one of the quietest he has come across. 'I'm looking for them to be more vocal,' he said. 'When I was playing for England the dressing-room was full of people who would get at each other to bring out the best in everyone. Bally was one of them, and that's why I brought him in, because if people know one thing about him it's that he loved playing for England. It doesn't bother me, it just means you've got to talk a bit more as a manager, though in fact Sol Campbell is a leader without saying too much, so is Gareth Southgate and Alan Shearer. Even Dennis Wise is the same. But it's not a problem if we don't say a word as long as we do our talking on the pitch, which I thought we did at times against Argentina. I said to Arthur Cox, \"We're very quiet\", and he said, \"Don't worry. They won't be when it matters\".' </p> <p> That remains to be seen; what is certain is that when England reconvene in three months' time, when it matters will be very near. Keegan's sympathy with club managers persuaded him to allow this break, but that doesn't mean he's happy with the situation. 'International football is in danger of playing second fiddle to the Champions League,' he said. 'There's nothing anyone can do about it; it's just a fact of life.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>Before Holland-Germany kicked off on Wednesday, the Dutch captain Edgar Davids gave the German libero Lothar Matth\u00e4us a bunch of flowers. The 38-year-old Matth\u00e4us was playing his 144th international, which (as long as you don't count certain African players, which Fifa don't) is a world record. </p> <p>The bouquet was almost as big as Davids himself, and Matth\u00e4us must have been surprised, first of all to discover that the socially dysfunctional Davids was the Dutch captain, and secondly to get a present from a Dutchman. He inspected the flowers, presumably for incendiary devices, then waved them at the crowd. More people applauded than whistled. </p> <p>That too must have been a shock. Matth\u00e4us has been loathed by the Dutch almost since he played them in his first international in 1980. As the evening went by, he found out why the mood had changed: Holland pasted Germany and should have won by far more than the final score of 2-1. The Dutch have stopped hating the Germans because they have stopped fearing them. The English, who meet Germany in Euro 2000 and the World Cup qualifiers, might one day follow suit. </p> <p>The game, a friendly, was embarrassing at times, particularly for Zoltan Sebescen, the German making his debut at right-back. Sebescen was a surprise choice, having played only eight games in the Bundesliga for Wolfsburg. By the end of the first half, when he had been at fault for both Dutch goals, I caught myself wondering: as many as eight? Had Erich Ribbeck, the German coach, confused Sebescen with another Zoltan Sebescen? Ribbeck said afterwards that he deserved the blame, because he had picked Sebescen. It must have cheered Sebescen up no end. </p> <p>The German press also accorded some blame to Sepp Maier, the keepers' coach, who had been quoted before the game as saying that Holland were one of the weakest teams in Europe. This had motivated the Dutch - and some explanation is certainly required for their uncharacteristic attempt to win a game. </p> <p>Later Maier explained that he had been joking, as everyone knew the Dutch were in fact one of the best teams in Europe. German jokes, said Mark Twain, are no laughing matter. The German football team increasingly is. </p> <p>Oliver Kahn is an excellent keeper who on Wednesday saved Germany from a rout. Markus Babbel, the future Liverpool player, and Thomas Linke, are good man-markers, who usually remember to keep between their strikers and the goal. But when they get the ball it is all they can do to tap it to Matth\u00e4us. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us should consider changing his name to Lothar Matth\u00e4us II to distinguish him from the Lothar Matth\u00e4us who won the World Cup for Germany in 1990. Matth\u00e4us II has a chiefly administrative role. He debates with the referee, decides when the ball has to be thrown back to the opposition for a free-kick, and occasionally, when there is no one near him, hits a 30-yard pass to remind you of what was. Given sufficient warning, he also tackles. That the Dutch winger Boudewijn Zenden chose instead to sprint past him was shameful. </p> <p>Christian Ziege of Middlesbrough has won back his place at left-half. He is fast, skillful, and has a great shot, which gave the Germans a goal at a moment when the Dutch had a man off the field. However, there remains something adolescent about Ziege, who has seldom played as well as he can. Beside him, Jens Jeremies did his usual trick of charging around while giving a decent pass about once every five miles, and Liverpool's Didi Hamann again showed he would have made few previous German teams. More promising was Sebastian Deisler, the 20-year-old 'German David Beckham' who made his debut in Sebescen's place after half time. </p> <p>In attack, Germany notionally play with two wingers. It would be more accurate to say that two of their players stand motionless on the flanks somewhere in the region of the other team's full-backs. Mehmet Scholl again showed that while he is a rare creative German footballer he is not a very productive one, while on the other wing Oliver Neuville has lost form entirely. Ribbeck talked later of dropping him and reverting to 4-4-2. </p> <p>Oliver Bierhoff, the German centre-forward, is unmatched when it comes to heading in crosses. However, since the Germans hardly ever got within sight of the Dutch goal on Wednesday, much less produced a cross, he was redundant. </p> <p>The shock was not that the Germans were mediocre. That was well known, and has seldom stopped them before. The shock was that in the last 20 minutes, when they were trailing by one goal and the Dutch succumbed to their customary Attention Deficit Disorder (or are they tripping on LSD? ), the Germans never looked like coming back. </p> <p>'These are the only players I have,' Ribbeck has said. It has never been clever to bet against Germany, but this summer, bet against Germany.</p>",

He is fast, skillful, and has a great shot, which gave the Germans a goal at a moment when the Dutch had a man off the field. However, there remains something adolescent about Ziege, who has seldom played as well as he can. Beside him, Jens Jeremies did his usual trick of charging around while giving a decent pass about once every five miles, and Liverpool's Didi Hamann again showed he would have made few previous German teams. More promising was Sebastian Deisler, the 20-year-old 'German David Beckham' who made his debut in Sebescen's place after half time. In attack, Germany notionally play with two wingers. It would be more accurate to say that two of their players stand motionless on the flanks somewhere in the region of the other team's full-backs. Mehmet Scholl again showed that while he is a rare creative German footballer he is not a very productive one, while on the other wing Oliver Neuville has lost form entirely. Ribbeck talked later of dropping him and reverting to 4-4-2. Oliver Bierhoff, the German centre-forward, is unmatched when it comes to heading in crosses. However, since the Germans hardly ever got within sight of the Dutch goal on Wednesday, much less produced a cross, he was redundant. The shock was not that the Germans were mediocre. That was well known, and has seldom stopped them before. The shock was that in the last 20 minutes, when they were trailing by one goal and the Dutch succumbed to their customary Attention Deficit Disorder (or are they tripping on LSD? ), the Germans never looked like coming back. 'These are the only players I have,' Ribbeck has said. It has never been clever to bet against Germany, but this summer, bet against Germany.",

Giggs, looking fully restored after resting his hamstring injury in midweek, played a delightful pass for Cruyff to run on and score. Once Cruyff accepted Giggs's defence-splitting pass without breaking stride, he produced an unstoppable shot past Sullivan. For a while either side of the interval it looked as if United might finish up with three or four goals, but although they bombarded the Wimbledon area, the Cole-Sheringham partnership failed to spring any surprises.

Yet just when Wimbledon's last line of defence looked to have done enough to win the game on his own, he was let down by his team-mates' reckless ambition. When Cort won a corner 10 minutes from time Wimbledon threw everbody forward and had no one on duty to prevent Giggs picking up Beckham's clearing header.

In a separate development, the Stock Exchange confirmed that evidence about deals involving Morgan and his broker was handed to the Department of Trade and Industry almost two weeks ago, far faster than normally. The department will examine the evidence and hand the material to the Crown Prosecution Service if it believes a crime has been committed.",

Jones, Henry, Mahon, Kelly, S. Taylor. <br>Substitutes: Thompson, Morgan, Black, Yates, Achterberg. <br></p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> The first cup final of the season and an intriguing match-up between these two resilient sides. Leicester's seventh visit to Wembley in the last nine seasons. They should be paying rent.<br> <strong>3</strong> An early test for Challinor as Heskey is released on the left by Taggart. He is equal to the task and concedes the corner. Murphy gathers the centre with confidence.<br><strong>5</strong> Tranmere's first attack as Mahon turns Taggart on the right wing and brings the ball towards Flowers' left-hand post. The shot is hit low and hard, which the keeper parries away for a corner. Flowers comes for the centre but fumbles slightly before catching it. He looks a little nervous.<br><strong>8</strong> The over-exuberant Clint Hill slides in on Oakes two-footed studs-a-blazin' and is lucky to receive a mere caution. Oakes is poleaxed. The free-kick, from the right flank 35 yards out, is flicked on by Heskey and Murphy does well to get down to the header by his left-hand post and make the save.<br><strong>10</strong> Tranmere break through a long-ball from Henry that Flowers bravely clears the instant before Kelly arrives at speed. The ball goes out of play for a throw on the left and up steps Dave Challinor. After an age of drying and fondling the ball is thrown hard and low straight into the arms of Flowers. The crowd like it though.<br><strong>15</strong> A good confident start from the Premiership side and Tranmere are hanging on at the moment. A free kick from Elliott on the right is headed well clear by Hazell, but the ball is redistributed to the crowd-pleasing Savage on the right, who whips in a curling, deep cross to the far post, headed away by Challinor for another Leicester corner. Again the set piece is a disappointment but Heskey regains possession and breaks into the box on the left. All he has to do is square it to Cottee in front of goal but he shoots and hits side netting as his teammates look on, incredulous.<br><strong>18</strong> For Cottee read Kelly as Tranmere break and Mahon's vision releases Taylor into the left of the Leicester area and as Kelly is screaming for the ball but Taylor's shot has already cleared the crossbar.<br><strong>20</strong> A Challinor throw is a time-consuming affair. Never in a hurry to reach the touchline, an eternity of rubbing and drying and then the delivery itself is a merciful release. Good things may come to those who wait but Leicester fans would disagree. Incidentally, nothing comes of the throw.<br><strong>24</strong> A short throw from Challinor to Parkinson! Again, the move breaks down on the left of this Leicester defence as Guppy and even Heskey are happy to drop back and muck in. Tranmere may have more luck on the right of this determined Premiership back four, but there lurks Savage.<br><strong>28</strong> Savage wins a corner on the right.<br><strong>29 GOAL Leicester 1 - 0 Tranmere</strong> Guppy whips in an inswinging cross as Elliott's run takes him away from Challinor just as he rises and meets the centre over the penalty spot. His power header cannons down off the crossbar and brushes Murphy's back before crossing the line. Great header, bad marking.<br><strong>31</strong> Tranmere try and respond through a Challinor throw (what else?) but Flowers is starting to enjoy plucking these out of the air.<br><strong>34</strong> Heskey's control and touch hasn't left him after his midweek efforts for England. An Elliott cross is flicked down by the Leicester forward for Oakes to drive one, but Hazell blocks well. Leicester regain possession and build again through Lennon.<br><strong>36</strong> Cottee finds space on the right and his cross is high but Heskey brushes off the challenge of Challinor and gravity as he rises and meets the centre with a header that Murphy can only watch as it just shaves his top left-hand corner.<br><strong>38</strong> A Tranmere corner on the right hit well to the far post but Flowers rises from a crowd of players and claims well. Leicester look in control and are enjoying the lion's share of the possession and attacking play. The Tranmere midfield are giving away the ball too many times as up front Kelly and Taylor begin to show their frustration.<br><strong>43</strong> Taggart to Heskey inside his own half. The England debutant runs past Roberts and Parkinson until he is finally up-ended by Hill just outside the box. The challenge is an ugly one and Hill is on a yellow already but the referee just awards the free kick. The set-piece is rolled square to Lennon, who hits a rising, swerving shot that only just clears the bar.<br><strong>47</strong> Half time. Tranmere have done well in only conceding one during the first 45 minutes. Leicester literally have been in a different league to their rivals over this first half.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Leicester restart the game. After a round of head-tennis in the midfield the ball falls invitingly for Tranmere in the form of Taylor on the right. As Kelly gesticulates in the penalty area, Taylor decides to have a go from 30 yards on the far right. The next thing the ball touches is the running track.<br><strong>47</strong> Cottee meets a pass from Lennon on the volley but the effort is straight at Murphy from 15 yards on the left.<br><strong>49</strong> Good interplay between Mahon, Taylor and Parkinson as Tranmere pass it around the right-midfield. The ball runs out of a goal kick but some early encouragement for the Nationwide League side.<br><strong>54</strong> An injury to Cottee and some untidy play in midfield as the game has lost its rhythm.<br><strong>55</strong> If Leicester lose this, Muzzy Izzet will want to buy every video that is produced of this final and then destroy them all. Heskey, who uses his strength to see of Challinor, plays in Izzet on the right-hand side of the Tranmere box, on his own in acres of space. With only Murphy to beat, he somehow puts his first touch behind him and then manages to lose the ball. Referee Alan Wilkie pulls his right-calf muscle and is stretchered off. Referee Richards steps into the fray.<br><strong>60</strong> Tranmere are managing to get some width as they attack, but the crosses are poor in quality. Leicester are looking a little ragged as Tranmere look to push up and chase the game.<br><strong>62</strong> Izzet is enjoying the run of the right-wing, and wins another corner. The centre is overhit and then played back in by Lennon to Heskey, who turns Clint Hill. The Tranmere defender extends his left foot and catches Heskey's trailing leg...<br><strong>64 Clint Hill sent off</strong> With only Murphy between Heskey and the goal, that foul was always going to land Hill in trouble. The free kick cannons of the wall from 25 yards, just right of centre.<br><strong>65 Tranmere substitution:</strong> Yates for Parkinson. Aldridge has no choice but to bring on a more defensive player to compensate for the loss of Hill.<br><strong>69</strong> Tranmere have stepped up a gear as they watch time slip away. A deflected shot brings them a corner on the right. A melee ensues and the ball finally pops lose and is cleared. Flowers still hasn't made a save this half.<br><strong>72</strong> Izzet, storming through the centre-right, collides with the high boot of Dave Challinor and the long-throw specialist is booked. Leicester press forward from the free kick and Elliott volleys straight into the arms of Murphy in the centre of the goal.<br><strong>75</strong> Mahon intercepts a pass from Sinclair deep in his own half. The Tranmere midfielder runs to within 30 yards of the Leicester goal. As Taylor cuts across the area screaming for a pass, Mahon winds up and scuffs his shot. Goal kick.<br><strong>76 Leicester substitution:</strong> Impey for Oakes.<br><strong>77 GOAL Leicester 1 - 1 Tranmere</strong> 'You only need 10 men' reads a banner in the Tranmere end. Mahon's long ball is flicked on by Taylor into the path of Kelly to the right of Flowers' goal. With an acute angle and a former England goalkeeper to beat, Kelly drills his shot inside the post and slightly less than half of Wembley goes mad.<br><strong>81 GOAL Leicester 2 - 1 Tranmere</strong> Tranmere 'enjoyed' being level for 240 seconds. Matt Elliott again at Murphy's right-hand post with another excellent header from a Steve Guppy corner. The other, slightly larger half of Wembley is delirious. <br><strong>83</strong> A corner to Tranmere, but the cross is flicked away by Tranmere's nemesis, Elliott.<br><strong>84</strong> Izzet, Cottee and Lennon against Hazell with Murphy on his line. The ball falls to Lennon after Cottee's shot, and the Leicester midfielder side-foots the ball precisely over the bar. <br><strong>87</strong> Four consecutive corners to Tranmere as they turn up the heat on the Leicester defence. Finally, Flowers comes and claims the fourth centre.<br><strong>88 Leicester substitution:</strong> Marshall for Cottee.<br><strong>89</strong> Leicester are four minutes away from next season's UEFA Cup. Kelly collects the ball on the edge of the Leicester box on the right. His deep cross is met by Taylor at the back post and Flowers produces a great save to tip his header over his top-left-hand corner. the corner is cleared.<br><strong>92</strong> Last chance for Tranmere, but Leicester win possession and Heskey saunters towards the left-corner flag. Whistles from the Leicester fans as Tranmere win back possession and the ball is crossed into the Leicester box one last time. The referee's whistle blows. Free kick to Leicester.<br><strong>95</strong> Full time: Leicester 2 - 1 Tranmere. Congratulations to Leicester City, Worthington Cup Winners 1999-2000.<br></p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Royal Dutch/Shell and BP Amoco both revealed this month that they had slashed their costs by similar amounts last year - $1.5 billion (\u00a3940 million) for Shell and $2.1bn for BP. Both promised that savings will rise to $4bn by 2001. But while the City applauded Shell and marked its shares sharply higher, the reaction to BP was simply to ask what it could do for an encore. </p> <p>The reason for this is partly that BP is embroiled in a battle with US regulators over its proposed acquisition of Arco, and this has dampened the performance of its shares. But it is also because Shell's cost savings are the result of its own good housekeeping, while BP's arise largely from the integration of BP and Amoco following their 1998 merger. </p> <p>'Mergers do give the chance of cutting costs,' said Stephen Hodge, group treasurer - and soon to be director of finance - at Royal Dutch/Shell. 'But it is like a shot of heroin. The question is, where do you go next?' </p> <p>Shell came to cost-cutting rather late in the day, but has taken to it with all the zeal of a true convert. Its targets have already been raised once, and many analysts think its current $4bn estimate will prove conservative. Capital spending, once a gushing tap, was slashed by 40 per cent in 1999; return on capital jumped from 2.8 per cent to 12.1 per cent, putting its promise of 14 per cent, which once looked hopelessly optimistic, well within reach. </p> <p>For that, Shell investors have to thank the oil price. Brent crude may currently be soaring above $25 a barrel, but late in 1998, it had sunk as low as $10. A year earlier, Shell had embarked on a restructuring programme aimed at improving its dull performance. </p> <p>The collapse in the oil price exposed that programme as much too tame - and the City was questioning whether it could meet even those undemanding targets. Hodge admits that the collapse was a useful catalyst that 'sharpened the focus', although he insists that the foundations for the changes seen today were laid as far back as 1996. At the heart of the restructuring was a dismantling of the 'baronies', the Shells-in-miniature who dictated what happened in their parts of the world. </p> <p>They were replaced with a structure based on the four core businesses - exploration and production, downstream gas and power, oil products and chemicals. Hodge says: 'Years ago, we would have had 4,000 or 5,000 people who would have gone around claiming: \"I'm from head office and this is what I want you to do.\" In reality, the number who should be able to say that should be counted in the low hundreds. The rest were experts in refining, chemicals or whatever.' </p> <p>Various previous attempts at curtailing the power of the baronies had had little impact. This time, to show it was serious Shell did the unthinkable: it sold off their head offices. </p> <p>Nine have gone, including the old headquarters of the Shell Transport &amp; Trading company on London's Strand. 'That deeply hit people's self-image,' said Hodge. 'They were usually called Shell House and were a monument to the grandiose management schemes. Moving out of them helps to make sure the culture changes last.' </p> <p>Changes were not limited to the country fiefdoms. Any part of the business that could be described as an overhead was forced to start thinking of itself as a business. Hodge winces when people compare this with the BBC, where the creation of an 'internal market' has been derided as an expensive failure: 'It does create some bureaucracy which you have not had previously. But it is so liberating for the people in the business.' </p> <p>Different parts of the business restruc tured themselves in slightly different ways. The research and technical services part of the oil products business now calls itself Global Solutions, and has external customers. Meanwhile in the exploration and production business, research and technical services has evolved into a venture capital-type fund, generating ideas which Shell is thinking of spinning off into the market. </p> <p>Even the finance department has had to rethink its business. 'In central finance, there are about 40 people. But in the financial services organisation, there are perhaps 400 or 500. They have got outside business too, and their morale is higher.' </p> <p>It is the impact on morale that really differentiates an internally generated restructuring from one dictated by a merger, Hodge believes. 'It is perhaps slower than a slash and burn but, in the long run, it is more effective. If you can afford to do it at a slower pace, you should. But of course, everyone wants to go slower still - that was why it was good to have the oil price shock.' </p> <p>Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell's committee of managing directors, said when he announced the results that he was surprised by the speed of the restructuring. Hodge attributes that partly to the shift in the restructuring from the first to the second phase. 'When you first do a reorganisation, you realise that a third to a half of the people are not required any more. Then people say, \"I didn't realise what we could do\" and you find that another third of the people can go.' Since 1998, 16,000 people across the group have gone. </p> <p>The restructuring has targeted another cost which had become bloated: capital spending. The country barons were used to getting whatever they asked for, provided the returns were above the cost to the group of financing it. The result was an inflated capital budget and a large number of projects which could not really be justified. </p> <p>Now, Shell uses the same criteria for assessing the project but, instead of just approving everything that is asked for which meets that test, it limits the capital available and chooses only those with the best return. Hodge says that its analysis showed that, the more the group spent, the lower the additional return it made. Limiting spending to projects which really made a difference to group return made more sense. </p> <p>The result last year was a 40 per cent drop in capital spending, to $9.5bn. That reduction was partly because a number of big projects ended in 1998 but Hodge thinks the scale of the fall gives the right message to the City and to Shell employees. This year, it will rise again - but only to perhaps $10.5bn rather than the $13.5bn seen in the past. </p> <p>Some analysts worry that the dramatic drop in spending means it is missing opportunities. Hodge dismisses that. 'The real test is our production forecasts. Oil production is growing. Gas production is growing.' What matters is picking the right things to spend money on. 'People used to talk about oil companies controlling the world. We certainly don't any more. And the capital expenditure mentality, the idea that you get strength from controlling assets, is misleading.' </p> <p>In some parts of the business, Hodge admits, having strength is important: exploration assets, for example, or its network of 40,000 petrol stations. The more difficult area is the mid-point: the refineries, say, which were once such a big part of the macho oil industry culture. Now, Hodge likens these to bank branches: assets that have outlived their usefulness. That does not mean Shell will get rid of all its refining capacity - although that may come. At the moment, he says: 'We are all afraid that if we try having no refineries, and therefore no control over that element of the value chain, we could get squeezed.' </p> <p>BP was initially forced into its restructuring following a boardroom coup and a dividend cut in 1992, and other oil companies have also been through the restructuring mill before consolidation. Critics of Shell say its late conversion to the need for efficiency means it has missed out on the global consolidation that has created giants such as Exxon Mobil and BP Amoco. Hodge insists they never wanted to be part of it. </p> <p>'There are no huge gaps in our portfolio - BP and Exxon both had those. And we always felt that the big companies were fully valued. If you are paying a 20 or 30 per cent premium to that, it is hard to see it adding shareholder value.'</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stanley Kubrick, the gregarious hermit of St Albans who died last March, withdrew A Clockwork Orange from distribution in Britain in 1974. So when it opens next month this will be the first opportunity anyone under the age of 44 has had to see it legally in this country. Of course, those who haven't sought out bootleg copies or watched it abroad will know the movie from its iconic opening shot in which Malcolm McDowell as the delinquent teenage hero, Alex, stares directly into the camera, a mix of malevolence and charm, a bowler hat on his head, grotesque false lashes on his right eye. They can now decide for themselves whether that font of wisdom, Halliwell's Film and Video Guide, gets it right by calling it 'a repulsive film in which intellectuals have found acres of significance\u00c9 it is pretentious and nasty rubbish for sick minds who do not mind jazzed-up images and incoherent sound'. They might incline more to Luis Bu\u00f1uel's view that 'it is the only movie about what the modern world really means'. </p> <p>The film's absence from our screens is almost as long as the 30-year ban on Lady Chatterley's Lover, which was, of course, always available in an expurgated version. As a result of the mystique that has grown up around it, this fugitive film has been the constant subject of discussion and speculation, assisted by the refusal of its creator to make public his later feelings about it. </p> <p>The story begins in 1960 when the 43-year-old Anthony Burgess returned from Singapore to find the England he'd left in the late Forties transformed into an ugly divided country where the last seedy Teds prowled the streets of London and race riots had erupted in our big cities. Believing, incorrectly, that he was terminally ill, Burgess set out to write a rapid succession of short novels to provide for his wife, one of them being A Clockwork Orange, published in 1962. Set in an Orwellian near future, it was his response to the New Britain that so disturbed him and also to ideas in the air on both sides of the Iron Curtain about controlling social deviants by chemical and psychological conditioning. </p> <p>Alex, the 15-year-old leader of a violent teenage gang, is arrested for murder by an authoritarian state and subjected to aversion therapy that leaves him incapable of distinguishing between good and evil. On his release into an increasingly repressive society, he is unable to function and becomes a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. The tone of Burgess's ironic novella is controlled by Alex's idiolect (a personal, self-devised language) compounded of rhyming slang, Carroll-like conflations, baby talk, Romany, and above all borrowings from Russian. The year Burgess returned home, Noel Annan headed a committee to study the teaching of Russian in British schools and on a visit to Russia Burgess had seen marauding teenagers in Moscow. </p> <p>As a Catholic, Burgess was concerned with sin and free will and the novel's central Christian proposition was put by T.S. Eliot in an essay on Baudelaire: 'So far as we are human, what we do must be either evil or good; so far as we do evil or good, we are human; and it is better, in a paradoxical way, to do evil than to do nothing: at least we exist. It is true to say that the glory of man is his capacity for salvation; it is also true to say that his glory is his capacity for damnation.' </p> <p>The novel was not especially well received and Burgess's US publishers, much to his annoyance, cut the final chapter in which a grown-up Alex looks back sadly on his depredations, and added a glossary of Nadsat, Alex's idiolect. For a pitifully small sum he sold the book outright to a pair of US producers who made millions by selling it on to Warner Brothers and sharing in the profits of the picture. A Clockwork Orange was Kubrick's fourth production since settling in England in 1960 and it completed a trilogy of admonitory science-fiction movies concerning the fate of the individual in a dehumanised near-future that began with Dr Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey. </p> <p>A Clockwork Orange was the culmination of a couple of decades of movies about juvenile delinquency, a subject that greatly worried censors and moral guardians on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1954 the BBFC banned the Marlon Brando biker flick The Wild One outright (it was eventually released here in 1968), while the following year Clare Booth Luce, as US ambassador to Italy, intervened to prevent The Blackboard Jungle being shown in competition at Venice. Kubrick found a distancing effect that was the visual equivalent of Alex's Nadsat (only a little of which he used). West Side Story had become the acceptable face of teenage gang warfare, so Kubrick stylised and choreographed the violence, setting it to music that ranges from Rossini overtures to 'Singin' in the Rain'. McDowell, the rebel from within the Establishment in Lindsay Anderson's If, was perfect casting as the rebel from outside the world of privilege, and was to be stuck with an iconic role nearly as restricting as Anthony Perkins's Norman Bates. Kubrick, who had only read the US edition of the novel, didn't include Burgess's final chapter, nor did his film explain the title. The latter, in fact, derives from a remark the novelist overheard on a London bus ('He's as queer as a clockwork orange') and used for a book by Mr Alexander, the writer whose wife Alex rapes. </p> <p>The film emerged at the end of 1971 when war was raging in Vietnam and spilling over onto the streets and campuses of North America and Europe. And it came immediately after three extremely violent movies - William Friedkin's The French Connection and Don Siegel's Dirty Harry, both right-wing pictures that endorse state violence, and Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, which seeks to justify retaliatory violence by the middle-class against lower-class predators. Only Kubrick's movie, which directly challenged the state, as well as featuring a dangerously anti-social youth, attracted the attention of the US censors. They offered it an 'X' Certificate (the kiss of death for a big budget film), which was reduced to an 'R' when Kubrick made token cuts. The film polarised the critics. The most hostile British reviews came from the Daily Telegraph and the Communist Morning Star, and several local authorities refused to license it. </p> <p> A Clockwork Orange did well enough at the box office, then suddenly disappeared from British screens. Its absence was not immediately recognised and it was thought to have run its commercial course. Most people were unaware of its having been withdrawn until 1979 when no copy was available for the National Film Theatre's Kubrick retrospective. Only then was there talk of copycat crimes, of gangs dressed like Alex threatening beating up vagrants. Arthur Bremmer, the would-be assassin who crippled Governor George Wallace in 1972, had apparently seen the movie, and Vincent LoBruto's 1998 biography of Kubrick contains vague accounts of English crimes supposedly inspired by it. That Kubrick was behind the picture's withdrawal is certain, but his motives remain obscure. The rumour that the lives of the director and his family had been threatened if it were not withdrawn has not been substantiated, and even seems to have been denied. </p> <p>Discussion of the ban was re-animated in 1990 when the Royal Shakespeare Company mounted a musical version of A Clockwork Orange written by Burgess and Mike Daniels, with music by U2's Bono and The Edge, and starring Phil Daniels as a chirpy cockney Alex. It didn't follow Les Miserables into the West End and wasn't very impressive. But the day the play opened the London Evening Standard 's front page lead about the government's latest reform package was headed 'PUNISHMENT FOR THE 1990s - Jail the dangerous criminals, hard labour for the rest', while inside was a report on gang muggings headed 'Fear that Stalks the Streets' and a story about a 1970s Secret Service disinformation scheme known as 'Operation Clockwork Orange'. The film and book still seemed relevant. </p> <p>The musical had no effect on the movie's availability. Kubrick was adamant. Channel Four included clips from it in a documentary about the picture and successfully defended its rights to fair usage in the courts. Warner Brothers were more successful in 1993 when they sued the little Scala Cinema Club in King's Cross for illegally showing a bootleg copy of the movie. The Scala went out of business. The next year Warners released Natural Born Killers, which has been and gone, and been forgotten. </p> <p>It is ironic that a powerful multinational corporation such as Time-Warner should have been taking such Draconian actions over a picture so morally concerned with the oppression of the weak by the powerful and the defence of free will. Whether anyone will be the better off for seeing A Clockwork Orange is debatable.

      "bodyText": "Stanley Kubrick, the gregarious hermit of St Albans who died last March, withdrew A Clockwork Orange from distribution in Britain in 1974. So when it opens next month this will be the first opportunity anyone under the age of 44 has had to see it legally in this country. Of course, those who haven't sought out bootleg copies or watched it abroad will know the movie from its iconic opening shot in which Malcolm McDowell as the delinquent teenage hero, Alex, stares directly into the camera, a mix of malevolence and charm, a bowler hat on his head, grotesque false lashes on his right eye. They can now decide for themselves whether that font of wisdom, Halliwell's Film and Video Guide, gets it right by calling it 'a repulsive film in which intellectuals have found acres of significance\u00c9 it is pretentious and nasty rubbish for sick minds who do not mind jazzed-up images and incoherent sound'. They might incline more to Luis Bu\u00f1uel's view that 'it is the only movie about what the modern world really means'. The film's absence from our screens is almost as long as the 30-year ban on Lady Chatterley's Lover, which was, of course, always available in an expurgated version. As a result of the mystique that has grown up around it, this fugitive film has been the constant subject of discussion and speculation, assisted by the refusal of its creator to make public his later feelings about it. The story begins in 1960 when the 43-year-old Anthony Burgess returned from Singapore to find the England he'd left in the late Forties transformed into an ugly divided country where the last seedy Teds prowled the streets of London and race riots had erupted in our big cities. Believing, incorrectly, that he was terminally ill, Burgess set out to write a rapid succession of short novels to provide for his wife, one of them being A Clockwork Orange, published in 1962. Set in an Orwellian near future, it was his response to the New Britain that so disturbed him and also to ideas in the air on both sides of the Iron Curtain about controlling social deviants by chemical and psychological conditioning. Alex, the 15-year-old leader of a violent teenage gang, is arrested for murder by an authoritarian state and subjected to aversion therapy that leaves him incapable of distinguishing between good and evil. On his release into an increasingly repressive society, he is unable to function and becomes a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. The tone of Burgess's ironic novella is controlled by Alex's idiolect (a personal, self-devised language) compounded of rhyming slang, Carroll-like conflations, baby talk, Romany, and above all borrowings from Russian. The year Burgess returned home, Noel Annan headed a committee to study the teaching of Russian in British schools and on a visit to Russia Burgess had seen marauding teenagers in Moscow. As a Catholic, Burgess was concerned with sin and free will and the novel's central Christian proposition was put by T.S. Eliot in an essay on Baudelaire: 'So far as we are human, what we do must be either evil or good; so far as we do evil or good, we are human; and it is better, in a paradoxical way, to do evil than to do nothing: at least we exist. It is true to say that the glory of man is his capacity for salvation; it is also true to say that his glory is his capacity for damnation.' The novel was not especially well received and Burgess's US publishers, much to his annoyance, cut the final chapter in which a grown-up Alex looks back sadly on his depredations, and added a glossary of Nadsat, Alex's idiolect.

      "body": "<p>Most movie versions of Henry James have been adapted by Europeans or non-Americans. The same is true of another American expatriate, Patricia Highsmith, a great admirer of James. Apart from her first book, Strangers on a Train (made in Hollywood by Londoner Alfred Hitchcock and former English public schoolboy Raymond Chandler), the films based on her work have been made by continental directors - Ren\u00e9 Cl\u00e9ment, Wim Wenders, Claude Chabrol, Claude Miller. </p> <p>Now British writer-director Anthony Minghella has followed up his English Patient with the equally seductive The Talented Mr Ripley, the novel Cl\u00e9ment filmed in 1959 as Plein Soleil. </p> <p>Highsmith's basic story is simply put and Minghella follows it. A low-born New York charmer, Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), is dispatched by a rich businessman, Herbert Greenleaf (James Rebhorn), to bring his playboy son, Dickie (Jude Law), back from his lotus-eating life on the Mediterranean. </p> <p>But instead Ripley, envious of Dickie's lifestyle, kills him and assumes his identity. The film is, however, anything but simple and Minghella has taken imaginative liberties with the novel, including making Dickie's death an unpremeditated killing rather than a murder and making Ripley a total stranger to Dickie before their first meeting. </p> <p>All the scenes in America are contained in a superbly edited sequence that accompanies the opening credits, which begin with the shuffling of various adjectives in the title before arriving at the ambiguous 'talented' to describe the anti-hero. </p> <p>We're shown Tom mistaken for a Princeton graduate at a smart Manhattan party because of his borrowed blazer; Tom in a different kind of uniform as a lavatory attendant at Carnegie Hall; Tom playing classical piano on stage after the audience has left; Tom being briefed by Mr Greenleaf; Tom learning about jazz as a way of ingratiating himself with the saxophone-playing Dickie; Tom triumphantly sailing out of New York aboard the Queen Mary on his first-class, all-expenses-paid trip. </p> <p>Minghella's own credit comes over the ship steaming down the East River to Europe. Thereafter, Tom is ever present. We see and experience everything from his point of view. </p> <p>The movie subtly evokes the alluring expatriate world of the late 1950s, when Italy was moving from postwar austerity towards la dolce vita. The rich, young Americans Tom meets and seeks to emulate are Jamesian characters released from Victorian restraints, the girls travelling without chaperones, the boys being aggressively hedonistic. </p> <p>The mercurial Dickie plays with his affections; Dickie's sensible girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) keeps a kindly distance between herself and the newcomer; Dickie's snobbish friend Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman) cruelly patronises Tom; Marge's rich lookalike Meredith (Cate Blanchett) accepts him as an equal because she thinks he's Dickie. Tom, who proclaims his talents for forgery, impersonation and lying, learns that he cannot enter this world as himself. He must transform his identity, changing his clothes and his character. </p> <p>One is reminded of the passage in The Rich Boy in which Scott Fitzgerald tells us that 'the very rich are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical where we are trustful... they think, deep in their hearts, that they are better than we are because we had to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves'. In the movie, Tom is less the casebook amoral psychopath of the novel and more a victim of class in his desire to be 'a fake somebody rather than a real nobody'. </p> <p>In fact, various key incidents of The Talented Mr Ripley - a socially ambitious outsider helped by a rich benefactor, a pregnant, working-class woman, a fight in a small boat that leads to an ambiguous killing, an alluring upper-class woman just beyond the hero's reach - make the picture look like a refracted version of Theodore Dreiser's novel An American Tragedy, which George Stevens filmed as A Place in the Sun. </p> <p>In addition, two dramatic traditions merge in Tom - the American fascination with the confidence trickster who can change himself like a social chameleon, and that recurrent story in fact and fiction (Martin Guerre, Anastasia, endless westerns) in which someone is transformed by taking on the identity of another, becoming in some ways more real than the person imitated. </p> <p>Only about an hour in does the film become anything approaching an orthodox thriller, and it continues to grip like a vice as the action moves from San Remo to Naples, Rome, and Venice. Ripley emerges as a brilliant manipulator and we share in, positively admire, his criminal artistry, partly because we despise the milieu he has entered. </p> <p>Having brought out the homoerotic undercurrent in the relationship between Tom and Dickie, Minghella goes on to suggest that bi-sexuality might be a necessary condition to being Ripley. Tom's floating identity is as much a puzzle to him as to us and one of the recurrent images is of Ripley in reflecting surfaces - the water in Dickie's bath, a piano lid, the glazed tiles of a hotel floor, a magnifying shaving mirror - often grossly distorted. In the final shot, a mirror on a swinging door constantly picks up and loses the benumbed Ripley. </p> <p>There are unforgettable moments in this beautifully crafted movie as there are in The English Patient. One thinks of the Hitchcockian coup de cin\u00e9ma that has four swimmers emerge from the sea carrying a Madonna at a religious festival to be followed by a dead body suddenly surfacing beside them.

      "body": "<p>Mark Wahlberg says that he did not particularly mean for any of this to happen. 'I just fell into the acting thing as kind of an accident,' he says. In his life, an odd pattern is emerging. At the age of 28, he has already found success in four different worlds - crime, pop music, modelling and acting - and, the way he usually tells it, he never really went looking for any of it. It's hard to believe, especially in the case of his acting career. Not just because he can be so good at it, but because in his best roles - Boogie Nights' Dirk Diggler, for instance - he can be good in the deep, disturbed, enchanting and subtle ways usually associated with actors who burn to act and yearn to lose themselves within their characters. </p> <p>But, on the surface, what he says appears to be true. By the end of 1993, Wahlberg was regarded as a washed-up pop-rap star and underwear model with a blemished reputation. In his pop heyday, he had been offered plenty of bad movies and he appeared briefly in one, a 1993 TV movie called The Substitute, for the cash: two days' work playing a student whose throat gets sliced by a bottle. But it didn't really even interest him. </p> <p>Then Penny Marshall and Danny DeVito, who had seen his Calvin Klein posters, said they wanted to see him for a movie they were putting together called Renaissance Man. He was supposed to read the script beforehand, but he didn't bother. 'I just wanted to meet them,' he says, 'because I'd grown up watching them on TV and I was really big fans of both of them.' The three of them talked for about an hour, after which he went outside and tried to learn a couple of pages, came back in and auditioned. </p> <p>So, I ask, what on earth made you think you could do it? </p> <p>'Well, I just figured I'd been bullshitting my way through life and lying and I believed it, and that's pretty much what they told me acting was about. We had had some pretty funny conversations about my life and the trouble I was in, so I had to be honest with myself for once and realise that I'd been doing it my whole life anyway. You know, I'd always gotten over the judges and the lawyers and my mother, so I figured I could do it.' </p> <p>He got the part. In the end the film itself, in which he played an army trainee in a remedial education course, wasn't much, but there was an attractively nervous verve to his performance which was captivating. He was on to something. </p> <p>Do you think that if they hadn't called, you would have ended up as an actor? </p> <p>'No. I was very uninterested. I don't know what would have happened. I don't think about it too much.' </p> <p>We meet in the bar of the Sunset Marquis Hotel in Los Angeles. He has been busy promoting his new movie, Three Kings, a semi-comic action romp in which he appears as one of a band of renegade soldiers after the Gulf War alongside George Clooney, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze. His hair is longer than usual, and he has thick stubble - both for his next film, the real-life maritime disaster movie The Perfect Storm. They start filming next week, but he's already been getting into the role. 'We've been going out on fishing trips, gutting fish and chopping heads off with hacksaws,' he says. 'Ugly work.' </p> <p>He starts on the first of many beers, which he chugs through at an impressive pace. (I assume this is his natural tendency, but it may actually be method drinking: the following week he will tell his Three Kings co-star Ice Cube that he's drinking a lot of beer because he's playing a fisherman.) </p> <p>After a few minutes, he narrows his eyes in the candlelight. 'Have we met before?' he asks. </p> <p>It is late 1992. Marky Mark is 21. He lifts up his sweatshirt and shows me his third nipple. It is situated a few centimetres below his regular left nipple, though slightly closer in towards the sternum. He's not bashful about it. 'It's chillin',' he says. 'It's bugged. It's the real joint, OK?' </p> <p>It is smaller than the others, but is, he insists, a nipple just the same. He had it checked out when he was young, when all three were the same size. They told him not to worry; that it's not a health hazard, that some people have five or six. </p> <p>This extra nipple is mentioned in the official Marky Mark book which will come out in a few weeks, the one which begins with the sentence 'I wanna dedicate this book to my dick.' Right now, things are going well. With the help of his older brother Donnie, who is in the teen group New Kids on the Block, Marky has had quite some success leading his pop-rap posse Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. His pop gimmick is to drop his pants and show his underwear, and this has just led to a synergistic contract as a model for Calvin Klein. </p> <p>In the book, he says about the third nipple, 'Bitches like to suck it', but when I ask him about this, he writhes with embarrassment and says he never realised that quotes like that would end up actually being printed. So is it true? I ask. </p> <p>'Yeah. Girls like to play with it. I like them to play with it.' </p> <p>The third nipple more than the first two? </p> <p>'Nah,' he says; less an answer than a refusal to answer. </p> <p>He doesn't want to talk about this any more. He looks away. 'It was just something fucked up to say.' </p> <p> Mark Wahlberg grew up in Boston, the youngest of nine children. His mother, Alma, was a nurse who also worked in a bank. His father, Donald, was a trucker. The happiest days Wahlberg remembers when he was young were when they'd all get in his father's big rig - mum, dad and youngest son in the front together, the rest of the kids in the back - and head off to the beach. </p> <p>'He was very funny with people,' says his brother Donnie, now also an actor (The Sixth Sense, Ransom). 'When he was little, he used to pose in the kitchen, climb up on the counter and do muscle poses. He always kind of told stories, somewhat exaggerated. He was a bit of an actor in some ways, without really trying to be an actor. That was his mode of survival or whatever.' </p> <p>Mark thinks that he's like his mother in the way he wants to do good and make everybody happy: 'being overly concerned with what's going on, prying into other people's business but never feeling comfortable enough to talk about my own'. But he thinks he's most like his dad. 'Stubborn,' he says. 'Insecure in certain ways.' One thing he has learned from his dad's example is how unhappy and alone his father is nowadays: 'I think when he got to that time in his life or that place in his life when he had a chance to open and let somebody in, he didn't. It's definitely one of his mistakes that I'm trying to learn from.' </p> <p>His parents split up when he was 11. Mark's never really been able to talk to his father about what happened. 'I would like to know,' he says, 'but I don't think he'd like to talk about it.' </p> <p>At one point, Wahlberg would sleep in a room with his five older brothers. If I'd done that, I tell him, I'd want to live on my own forever. He shakes his head. 'I've been on my own for a number of years now,' he says, 'but I've also found myself very alone. My family looks at me differently now, and that's the hardest thing to deal with, because you want to go home and be the person that you used to be. Obviously, I'm 28 years old and I can't go home and just be my mum's little baby.' </p> <p>He swigs his beer. He is clearly in something of a maudlin mood tonight. 'Things could be worse,' he says. 'I always tell myself that.' </p> <p>People would think you'd be living the life. You've got money, looks, career... </p> <p>'It's all going to go sometime. You can't take it with you. I'm not saying you should wake up every day with sunshine streaming out of your head. If I could get one day a month, I would be very grateful. But I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. I'm just figuring certain things out. It's taken me a while, and some things I could probably do without knowing.' </p> <p>What kind of things do you wish you didn't know about yourself? </p> <p>'Um, I don't know. Answering that would get me in a lot of trouble.' </p> <p>Things that you wish you didn't know you were capable of? </p> <p>'No. I think maybe even finding out that I'm as sensitive as I am, or as vulnerable as I am, when it comes to certain things. It's weird: I've been to prison, I've seen the worst sort of violence and negative shit in the streets, but when it comes to putting my heart on the line and letting somebody get to know me in a relationship, it's very difficult.' </p> <p> One chilly Sunday in late 1992, Marky Mark drives me in his new, shiny black Mercedes 300SL convertible around the rough area of Boston where he grew up. A policeman tells him to slow down. 'Sorry 'bout that, buddy,' Marky Mark says to the cop and then, afterwards, says to me, 'They are nothing but dickheads, man - I was doing five miles an hour!' </p> <p>The houses in Dorchester all look fairly run down. Many are boarded up. He shows me the place where the Wahlberg family lived, after his parents split up. He shows me the local boys' club where he was banned for life when he was 12. 'But they let me in now,' he says. On the wall opposite he points out his graffiti tag - 'MM'. </p> <p>Marky Mark talks about being young. About how bad was just the way they knew how to be. 'We used to stand on the bridge and throw rocks at the cars that drove by on the highway. That was the cool thing to do.' </p> <p>I ask him whether they'd break windows and he looks at me with amazement, and perhaps a little contempt. 'Breaking windows wasn't anything,' he says. 'We used to be derelicts, man. My whole crew.' He describes how they'd stand in the alley and 'whip a boulder off the side of a taxicab', because it was fun when the rock hit the cab, and better fun if it left a dent, and even better if the cab driver gave chase. </p> <p>He shows me the alley in question, and he shows me some new houses built over the spot where they used to strip the cars they'd stolen. He shows me the house where he used to practise rapping on the turntables in the basement. He shows me the place where his friend got his head split open by a baseball bat and Marky had to drag him across the street to safety. </p> <p>Marky parks the car and runs up to a house where a friend lives, looking anxiously behind him every few seconds at the car. He knows what people round here will do to a car like that. 'If I seen a nice Benz like this and it had a nice stereo like this,' he says, 'I'd take it.' </p> <p>His friend isn't in, so we drive on. A couple of streets away, Marky mutters that another of his friends got killed round here. He shakes his head. Stupid. His friend got drunk, and the girlfriend called the cops, and so his friend tried to jump from one roof to another. And didn't make it. Went right through a fence. </p> <p> Wahlberg says that other actors come up to him and tell him they're jealous of him. Because of his experiences. Because he's really been to jail and all that. They'll say to him, excitedly, 'Yeah, I got in a fight, too, one time and kicked the shit out of this guy', or they'll say, 'I almost got arrested one time.' In a way, Wahlberg finds it funny, but it's obvious he also finds it sad and pathetic. </p> <p>Jail: there's nothing much nice about it. He mentions that a friend of his from home, the only kid from the neighbourhood who graduated college, has just been in jail for nine months. 'Smart kid,' he says. 'Taught me at 12 years old how to rob people, how to mess people up, how to burn people's houses down.' </p> <p>Wahlberg recites a screed of their exploits. Hiding in the shops, in a rack of clothes until the store closed. Ten of them at a time, sometimes. ('A friend of mine almost got shot by security, breaking out of the store.') Going downtown, to where all the college kids and yuppies were, sticking somebody up with a knife or a gun. Going in a store, beating up the cashier, taking the cash. </p> <p>It goes on. 'We'd steal cars, go to a suburban town outside Boston and smash into a gun store or whatever, run in there and ransack the store... We'd steal a car, go to a mall, walk in the door, grab a rack of Polo jackets and leather jackets, run out the door, dive in the car and speed away... We'd go out to car dealerships and steal 10 IROCS or 10 Monte Carlo SSs; we were into the American sports cars when we were younger, get on the highway, 10 of us, all in brand-new cars, and get a chase with the cops; they can only chase one of us. </p> <p>'The scams are the ways to make money: you stand on the corner, people come into the neighbourhood to buy drugs, you say, \"Give me the money\", put the money in your pocket and look away from them; and they're, \"What are you doing? Are you going to get it?\"; \"Get what? I don't know what you're talking about - there's a cop car going by, flag the cop car and tell them you gave me money to buy some coke.\" So many ways to hustle.' </p> <p>They'd deal drugs, too: 'We'd sell weed and coke. I mean, if you get some valium, some percs, pills or anything like that, you sell them... mushrooms, ecstasy, mescalin, but the money was mostly coke and weed.' Once his mother found thousands of dollars in the house. 'Spent a lot of it, too,' he laughs. 'She didn't know where it came from, but she knew it was there and she needed it.' </p> <p>He made a lot, and had a car before he had his licence. But maybe he was also always a little different. 'When I was selling drugs, I always kept a job,' he says. 'I was bagging groceries for $3 an hour. And bought a BMW. It didn't matter how much money I was making, it still felt like I had some sort of excuse. I had a legitimate job - I would work three hours a day.' </p> <p>'On one hand, it was par for the course with the family,' Donnie observes of his younger brother's years of badness. He says he's never quite known what Mark actually did and didn't do: 'I think it's in his personality to exaggerate, but I don't think he needs to.' </p> <p> The night which led to his time in jail, he and his friends found these joints belonging to his friend's mother and smoked them. They didn't realise the joints were laced with PCP, and maybe that explained something of what happened. But the truth is that they had done things like this before. The truth was, they had done worse. </p> <p>'We were getting into a fight with that guy over beer,' Marky Mark says. 'He had a case of beer, we didn't have no money, we wanted to take it.' There were about eight of them, so the victim didn't have much chance. 'I had no idea who he was. He just lived in the building we were hanging round. He was kinda older. I think he was a Vietnamese guy. He just had that case of Budweiser, man, and somebody grabbed him and it kinda turned into a big beef. I don't even remember it that much because I was that fucked up, but I remember waking the next morning in jail.' </p> <p>He doesn't want me to misunderstand. He's sorry for what he did. 'I regret things like that. I try to better myself and put all that behind me. And people don't understand - they call me soft. Whatever. Yeah, I am soft. I'm a good person. I've got a soft heart. I'm about peace, man.' </p> <p>But how, I ask him, can he square those ideas about peace with being the kind of person who could hurt someone because you wanted their beer? </p> <p>He rocks back into his chair, and looks right at me. This is 1992. He's only 21. 'That's some kind of fucked-up question,' he says quietly. </p> <p> 'He is,' says David O Russell, director of Three Kings, 'one of the most confident people I have met in my life. As an actor, he is fearless; he'll do anything. What he brings to the scenes is this cut-the-crap realism, and yet he has all these other dimensions. And he has very, very high standards. He has ambitions on a par with De Niro. He and Ice Cube have already had three careers, and they have that kind of street thing where you just set out to do something, and don't take any shit about it.' Russell is one of several people who note what an excellent mimic he is. 'He would do scenes all day, from The Godfather or Dog Day Afternoon. He's a sampler.' </p> <p>Wahlberg says that he complained too much on the shoot for the last 40 days: 'We were in the middle of nowhere and there was nothing to do. And the second I left, I missed it, and I felt really bad about complaining.' ('He loves to bellyache,' Russell confirms. 'He complained the most,' agrees Ice Cube, who bonded with him over the similarities of their backgrounds. 'I told him it was because he can get away with it. Young American white kid. He can get away with being whatever he wants to be.') </p> <p>During the shoot Wahlberg managed to avoid discomfort when he could. Even on a movie set, he knows how to cheat the odds in his favour. There is a pivotal scene in the film where a milk truck explodes, and where the principal characters are supposed to get covered in waves of milk. Wahlberg figured something out. The master shot was being filmed first - the truck would only explode once - and all the days of filming them half-submerged in the milk would follow it. 'Being the smart ass that I was,' Wahlberg explains, 'I jumped on these sandbags.' In the master shot, the milk barely touched him, and so for continuity's sake, he would have to stay dry thereafter. 'I had my eyes set on that thing from the second we got out there,' he says. For the week, his co-stars had to jump back into the milk every morning. 'I had to wet my boots,' he grins, 'because my boots got wet.' </p> <p>Russell says that he doesn't believe Wahlberg premeditated the sandbag leap - 'I think he got lucky' - but says that his escape from wetness drew barbed, amused indignation from his co-stars, especially George Clooney. </p> <p> Recently, there have been unsettling echoes of both his recent and more distant pasts in his sleep. Maybe, he suggests, it's because, though he doesn't watch much TV, he'll watch anything about crime or courts or jail, often just before bedtime. 'I had a dream where me and Ice Cube escaped from our cell and we're in prison, but we're wearing our army fatigues, which is our wardrobe in the movie, and we're running around trying to find this other kid that I know and he doesn't even know, getting chased by guards, and we're going to get more time...' </p> <p>Sometimes he knows this is all a dream, but sometimes he's really scared. ('That's a terrible dream,' reflects Ice Cube. 'When you come from where we come from, in a way you feel like you're getting away with something.') </p> <p>Wahlberg is a religious man. 'I just try to say my prayers right before I go to bed,' he says, 'so I'm thinking good stuff.' </p> <p>Sometimes he kneels, usually he lies in bed. He does it even when he's with someone: 'It's just something that I need to do.' He feels bad if he skips the prayers, and sometimes he feels bad when he says them. 'For instance, if I'm with my girlfriend and we made love and I have to pray,' he explains, 'I feel guilty, and the first thing I do is say, \"I'm sorry, I know we're not married and we shouldn't be having sex...\"' He says that he prays for himself, and his family and his friends. 'But more importantly,' he says, 'I pray for the people that don't have God in their lives.' </p> <p>He says that the only person he has in his life who he can really talk to is Father Flavin, the parish priest he has known since he was young. 'The only guy who isn't trying to get anything out of me,' Wahlberg says. He spent an afternoon with Father Flavin a couple of weeks ago when he was feeling really bad. He'd been keeping a lot of stuff inside. He'd been spending time around people he knew, and yet still found himself feeling alone. And there were other things. Relationship problems. Family stuff. His father's health. 'Feeling guilty about things I've done in the past,' he says. 'Ones from a long time ago, and recent ones. Every little thing kind of weighs upon my shoulders. It's just how I am. I have a tendency to feel very guilty.' A laugh. 'I don't know - I'm just getting really soft in my old age. I never felt guilty about anything up until I actually started to have good things happen to me in my life.' </p> <p> The great Mark Wahlberg public nightmare of 1993 - a few months after I first spent time with him - began when The Village Voice revealed the details of the crime for which he was imprisoned, focusing heavily on the racial nature of the attack. (A civil rights injunction had been served against Wahlberg two years earlier for physically and verbally attacking a black youth; on the night of the crime for which he was imprisoned, it was stated in court that he struck the Vietnamese man over the head with a 5ft wooden pole and then, minutes later, punched another Vietnamese man in the eye several blocks away. Wahlberg has always maintained that neither event was racially motivated.) </p> <p>In some ways he was fair game - fundamentally, he had done what they said - but the tenor of the coverage was less fair. The suggestion was that he had tried to hide all this (which, of course, argued for the possibility that he was still hiding and harbouring such impulses and biases), but that suggestion was wrong. The incident had been alluded to in the pop media, and when I had brought it up with him months before (for an article which was never published), he had discussed it and acknowledged the race of his victim, regretfully but openly. </p> <p>Two further incidents followed, this time fingering Wahlberg as homophobic. On the British TV show The Word he refused to condemn on the spot some hateful anti-gay comments by reggae star Shabba Ranks, and at a Hollywood party he was accused of disparaging one of Madonna's entourage as 'a homo'. It's a charge he has always rebuffed, and he is enduringly furious that in this period Calvin Klein simply let their relationship lapse, implying to him either that it was too dangerous commercially for them to stand up for him or that tacitly they believed him guilty. 'I was upset for a long time, because I put myself out there for them and they just left me hanging.' </p> <p> Months passed after the assault on the Vietnamese man, but eventually there was a trial, and Marky Mark was sentenced to serve three months of a two-year sentence. He would be incarcerated for 52 days. 'The thing I remember was seeing my mother so crushed,' he says. 'Having to say goodbye to my mother in the courthouse that day - I'm 17, all dressed up in a sweater and shoes.' For the first 10 days in jail, what drove him mad was that he had to wear these horrible prison jeans and his courtroom shoes, and he kept slipping all over the place. He was so glad when he finally got some sneakers. </p> <p>It wasn't like he didn't know people in jail. A lot of the guys he'd grown up with were there. Some inmates tried to test him at the beginning, but once he'd shown them he wasn't scared they left him alone. But it was still hard in there. Waking up every morning at seven o'clock to the sound of doors slamming. Dreaming he was at home, then opening his eyes to find he was still imprisoned. Calling home every day and listening to his mother crying. He tried to keep himself to himself. Stay inside his own head. Wait. </p> <p> Wahlberg is thinking about acting, a skill and pastime about which he now cares, but which offers him such troubles. 'In every movie I've done, I've learned more about myself. Probably more that I don't like... What I get out of it is exactly what I put into it. I feel what my character is supposed to feel in the scene, before I shoot the scene, and after I'm done. It sucks a lot of the time, because I do a lot of darker, heavier stuff. It weighs on me, you know.' </p> <p>His greatest, strangest performance so far is playing the long-membered porn star at the centre of Boogie Nights. He is good at the cocksure, strutting, macho stuff, but what is much more impressive is how fine he is at all the bumbling, confused, sexually unsure stuff. He allows a character who you'd expect as a combination of the amusing and unlovely to crunch your heart. 'He's one of those natural raw-talent guys,' says Boogie Nights director Paul Thomas Anderson. 'To a certain extent, it's a kind of uneducated talent, which is what you love about it. You get this minefield of stuff.' </p> <p>There are other Mark Wahlberg films, films you have never seen. These are the movies he writes and films himself. He's now done eight or nine of them. 'Really out-there shit,' he concedes. 'Nobody can believe that it's me actually thinking this up.' </p> <p>The first, 16A, was about a musician being seduced by a producer who is trying to convince him to be in a movie, and who brings him out to Hollywood, hooks him up with the girls and hotels and limos. 'He gets there,' Wahlberg says, 'and listens to this guy's spiel and then he goes into the bathroom and commits suicide.' Wahlberg loved the idea that this guy would kill himself rather than deal with all the nonsense. 'That was a very heroic ending.' </p> <p>He is serious about these films. He says that - 'and it may sound crazy' - making them properly for public consumption is what he would like to end up doing. He has earmarked one called The Undertaker ('with this guy who owns a funeral parlour, and he gets rid of all these bodies for the mob, but he has sex with the dead bodies') as where he'd like to start. </p> <p>They seem the product of a very sick and depraved mind, I say. Where does this come from in your head? </p> <p>'Just a lot of time on my hands.' </p> <p>Do you talk to Father Flavin about this? </p> <p>'No, he's never seen any of them. I've already made them, and I know God's seen them. Father Flavin is really cool and open-minded. He just saw Three Kings with me when I saw it for the first time and he loved it. He loved the violence. He's a hip priest, he really is.' </p> <p> Wahlberg says that he's in a relationship he's been in for a while. 'But I don't feel comfortable talking about it, because I don't know how to feel comfortable in the relationship, at times,' he says. 'I haven't been in very many serious relationships and [he laughs wryly] I haven't learned how to function in a serious relationship.' </p> <p>The first thing people will think, hearing that, is that you must behave really badly. </p> <p>'Yeah, I have a hard time staying faithful. It's not that. I wish I were that simple. I have a hard time trusting, you know. I've been hurt before and I have hurt people before. I want more than anything to have a normal life and have a family and have kids, and give them all the things I never had. I had love, you know. At times it was hard love. I wouldn't change it for anything, but it is difficult.' </p> <p>Later, he says, 'I haven't felt comfortable to open up to any one person in my life.' And adds, 'I'm not looking to open up with everybody. I'm just hoping that I find one person that I can share with.' </p> <p>I don't disbelieve this - Mark Wahlberg is, I think, studded with very real and fresh contradictions - but it easy to pick up a very different impression. When I ask David O Russell why Wahlberg does any of this, Russell laughs and says, 'Because he likes to get girls.' When I suggest that Wahlberg is hankering for something more permanent, Russell responds: 'He has a part of him that very much wants to settle down and have a family, but right now that part doesn't have a prayer. He can't help himself. He loves to have fun. We went out with him, and it was exactly what I knew it would be - rolling with his posse, Armani suits - and wherever he goes he's surrounded by women giving him phone numbers and kissing him. He loves it.' </p> <p>'I haven't had a night out with him in a long time, just because I know what that's like - nothing that a married man like me should be doing,' says Paul Thomas Anderson. </p> <p>I don't think it is unusual for Wahlberg to leave different people with very different impressions. 'He has natural personality and he has survival instincts and charm and charisma, and he knows how to apply it to any situation in life,' says his brother. 'That's what his upbringing gives him. Drop him into a fire and he will find some water. And he's applying it in Hollywood.' </p> <p>'He's so smart,' says Anderson, affectionately. 'If he ever comes off like he doesn't know what's going on, it's a con.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mark Wahlberg says that he did not particularly mean for any of this to happen. 'I just fell into the acting thing as kind of an accident,' he says. In his life, an odd pattern is emerging. At the age of 28, he has already found success in four different worlds - crime, pop music, modelling and acting - and, the way he usually tells it, he never really went looking for any of it. It's hard to believe, especially in the case of his acting career. Not just because he can be so good at it, but because in his best roles - Boogie Nights' Dirk Diggler, for instance - he can be good in the deep, disturbed, enchanting and subtle ways usually associated with actors who burn to act and yearn to lose themselves within their characters. But, on the surface, what he says appears to be true. By the end of 1993, Wahlberg was regarded as a washed-up pop-rap star and underwear model with a blemished reputation. In his pop heyday, he had been offered plenty of bad movies and he appeared briefly in one, a 1993 TV movie called The Substitute, for the cash: two days' work playing a student whose throat gets sliced by a bottle. But it didn't really even interest him. Then Penny Marshall and Danny DeVito, who had seen his Calvin Klein posters, said they wanted to see him for a movie they were putting together called Renaissance Man. He was supposed to read the script beforehand, but he didn't bother. 'I just wanted to meet them,' he says, 'because I'd grown up watching them on TV and I was really big fans of both of them.' The three of them talked for about an hour, after which he went outside and tried to learn a couple of pages, came back in and auditioned. So, I ask, what on earth made you think you could do it? 'Well, I just figured I'd been bullshitting my way through life and lying and I believed it, and that's pretty much what they told me acting was about. We had had some pretty funny conversations about my life and the trouble I was in, so I had to be honest with myself for once and realise that I'd been doing it my whole life anyway. You know, I'd always gotten over the judges and the lawyers and my mother, so I figured I could do it.' He got the part. In the end the film itself, in which he played an army trainee in a remedial education course, wasn't much, but there was an attractively nervous verve to his performance which was captivating. He was on to something. Do you think that if they hadn't called, you would have ended up as an actor? 'No. I was very uninterested. I don't know what would have happened. I don't think about it too much.' We meet in the bar of the Sunset Marquis Hotel in Los Angeles. He has been busy promoting his new movie, Three Kings, a semi-comic action romp in which he appears as one of a band of renegade soldiers after the Gulf War alongside George Clooney, Ice Cube and Spike Jonze. His hair is longer than usual, and he has thick stubble - both for his next film, the real-life maritime disaster movie The Perfect Storm. They start filming next week, but he's already been getting into the role. 'We've been going out on fishing trips, gutting fish and chopping heads off with hacksaws,' he says. 'Ugly work.' He starts on the first of many beers, which he chugs through at an impressive pace. (I assume this is his natural tendency, but it may actually be method drinking: the following week he will tell his Three Kings co-star Ice Cube that he's drinking a lot of beer because he's playing a fisherman.) After a few minutes, he narrows his eyes in the candlelight. 'Have we met before?' he asks. It is late 1992. Marky Mark is 21. He lifts up his sweatshirt and shows me his third nipple. It is situated a few centimetres below his regular left nipple, though slightly closer in towards the sternum. He's not bashful about it. 'It's chillin',' he says. 'It's bugged. It's the real joint, OK?' It is smaller than the others, but is, he insists, a nipple just the same. He had it checked out when he was young, when all three were the same size. They told him not to worry; that it's not a health hazard, that some people have five or six. This extra nipple is mentioned in the official Marky Mark book which will come out in a few weeks, the one which begins with the sentence 'I wanna dedicate this book to my dick.' Right now, things are going well. With the help of his older brother Donnie, who is in the teen group New Kids on the Block, Marky has had quite some success leading his pop-rap posse Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. His pop gimmick is to drop his pants and show his underwear, and this has just led to a synergistic contract as a model for Calvin Klein. In the book, he says about the third nipple, 'Bitches like to suck it', but when I ask him about this, he writhes with embarrassment and says he never realised that quotes like that would end up actually being printed. So is it true? I ask. 'Yeah. Girls like to play with it. I like them to play with it.' The third nipple more than the first two? 'Nah,' he says; less an answer than a refusal to answer. He doesn't want to talk about this any more. He looks away. 'It was just something fucked up to say.' Mark Wahlberg grew up in Boston, the youngest of nine children. His mother, Alma, was a nurse who also worked in a bank. His father, Donald, was a trucker. The happiest days Wahlberg remembers when he was young were when they'd all get in his father's big rig - mum, dad and youngest son in the front together, the rest of the kids in the back - and head off to the beach. 'He was very funny with people,' says his brother Donnie, now also an actor (The Sixth Sense, Ransom). 'When he was little, he used to pose in the kitchen, climb up on the counter and do muscle poses. He always kind of told stories, somewhat exaggerated. He was a bit of an actor in some ways, without really trying to be an actor. That was his mode of survival or whatever.' Mark thinks that he's like his mother in the way he wants to do good and make everybody happy: 'being overly concerned with what's going on, prying into other people's business but never feeling comfortable enough to talk about my own'. But he thinks he's most like his dad. 'Stubborn,' he says. 'Insecure in certain ways.' One thing he has learned from his dad's example is how unhappy and alone his father is nowadays: 'I think when he got to that time in his life or that place in his life when he had a chance to open and let somebody in, he didn't. It's definitely one of his mistakes that I'm trying to learn from.' His parents split up when he was 11. Mark's never really been able to talk to his father about what happened. 'I would like to know,' he says, 'but I don't think he'd like to talk about it.' At one point, Wahlberg would sleep in a room with his five older brothers. If I'd done that, I tell him, I'd want to live on my own forever. He shakes his head. 'I've been on my own for a number of years now,' he says, 'but I've also found myself very alone. My family looks at me differently now, and that's the hardest thing to deal with, because you want to go home and be the person that you used to be. Obviously, I'm 28 years old and I can't go home and just be my mum's little baby.' He swigs his beer. He is clearly in something of a maudlin mood tonight. 'Things could be worse,' he says. 'I always tell myself that.' People would think you'd be living the life. You've got money, looks, career... 'It's all going to go sometime. You can't take it with you. I'm not saying you should wake up every day with sunshine streaming out of your head. If I could get one day a month, I would be very grateful. But I don't want to sound like I'm complaining. I'm just figuring certain things out. It's taken me a while, and some things I could probably do without knowing.' What kind of things do you wish you didn't know about yourself? 'Um, I don't know. Answering that would get me in a lot of trouble.' Things that you wish you didn't know you were capable of? 'No. I think maybe even finding out that I'm as sensitive as I am, or as vulnerable as I am, when it comes to certain things. It's weird: I've been to prison, I've seen the worst sort of violence and negative shit in the streets, but when it comes to putting my heart on the line and letting somebody get to know me in a relationship, it's very difficult.' One chilly Sunday in late 1992, Marky Mark drives me in his new, shiny black Mercedes 300SL convertible around the rough area of Boston where he grew up. A policeman tells him to slow down. 'Sorry 'bout that, buddy,' Marky Mark says to the cop and then, afterwards, says to me, 'They are nothing but dickheads, man - I was doing five miles an hour!' The houses in Dorchester all look fairly run down. Many are boarded up. He shows me the place where the Wahlberg family lived, after his parents split up. He shows me the local boys' club where he was banned for life when he was 12. 'But they let me in now,' he says. On the wall opposite he points out his graffiti tag - 'MM'. Marky Mark talks about being young. About how bad was just the way they knew how to be. 'We used to stand on the bridge and throw rocks at the cars that drove by on the highway. That was the cool thing to do.' I ask him whether they'd break windows and he looks at me with amazement, and perhaps a little contempt. 'Breaking windows wasn't anything,' he says. 'We used to be derelicts, man. My whole crew.' He describes how they'd stand in the alley and 'whip a boulder off the side of a taxicab', because it was fun when the rock hit the cab, and better fun if it left a dent, and even better if the cab driver gave chase. He shows me the alley in question, and he shows me some new houses built over the spot where they used to strip the cars they'd stolen. He shows me the house where he used to practise rapping on the turntables in the basement. He shows me the place where his friend got his head split open by a baseball bat and Marky had to drag him across the street to safety. Marky parks the car and runs up to a house where a friend lives, looking anxiously behind him every few seconds at the car. He knows what people round here will do to a car like that. 'If I seen a nice Benz like this and it had a nice stereo like this,' he says, 'I'd take it.' His friend isn't in, so we drive on. A couple of streets away, Marky mutters that another of his friends got killed round here. He shakes his head. Stupid. His friend got drunk, and the girlfriend called the cops, and so his friend tried to jump from one roof to another. And didn't make it. Went right through a fence. Wahlberg says that other actors come up to him and tell him they're jealous of him. Because of his experiences. Because he's really been to jail and all that. They'll say to him, excitedly, 'Yeah, I got in a fight, too, one time and kicked the shit out of this guy', or they'll say, 'I almost got arrested one time.' In a way, Wahlberg finds it funny, but it's obvious he also finds it sad and pathetic. Jail: there's nothing much nice about it. He mentions that a friend of his from home, the only kid from the neighbourhood who graduated college, has just been in jail for nine months. 'Smart kid,' he says. 'Taught me at 12 years old how to rob people, how to mess people up, how to burn people's houses down.' Wahlberg recites a screed of their exploits. Hiding in the shops, in a rack of clothes until the store closed. Ten of them at a time, sometimes. ('A friend of mine almost got shot by security, breaking out of the store.') Going downtown, to where all the college kids and yuppies were, sticking somebody up with a knife or a gun. Going in a store, beating up the cashier, taking the cash. It goes on. 'We'd steal cars, go to a suburban town outside Boston and smash into a gun store or whatever, run in there and ransack the store... We'd steal a car, go to a mall, walk in the door, grab a rack of Polo jackets and leather jackets, run out the door, dive in the car and speed away... We'd go out to car dealerships and steal 10 IROCS or 10 Monte Carlo SSs; we were into the American sports cars when we were younger, get on the highway, 10 of us, all in brand-new cars, and get a chase with the cops; they can only chase one of us. 'The scams are the ways to make money: you stand on the corner, people come into the neighbourhood to buy drugs, you say, \"Give me the money\", put the money in your pocket and look away from them; and they're, \"What are you doing? Are you going to get it?\"; \"Get what? I don't know what you're talking about - there's a cop car going by, flag the cop car and tell them you gave me money to buy some coke.\" So many ways to hustle.' They'd deal drugs, too: 'We'd sell weed and coke. I mean, if you get some valium, some percs, pills or anything like that, you sell them... mushrooms, ecstasy, mescalin, but the money was mostly coke and weed.' Once his mother found thousands of dollars in the house. 'Spent a lot of it, too,' he laughs. 'She didn't know where it came from, but she knew it was there and she needed it.' He made a lot, and had a car before he had his licence. But maybe he was also always a little different. 'When I was selling drugs, I always kept a job,' he says. 'I was bagging groceries for $3 an hour. And bought a BMW. It didn't matter how much money I was making, it still felt like I had some sort of excuse. I had a legitimate job - I would work three hours a day.' 'On one hand, it was par for the course with the family,' Donnie observes of his younger brother's years of badness. He says he's never quite known what Mark actually did and didn't do: 'I think it's in his personality to exaggerate, but I don't think he needs to.' The night which led to his time in jail, he and his friends found these joints belonging to his friend's mother and smoked them. They didn't realise the joints were laced with PCP, and maybe that explained something of what happened. But the truth is that they had done things like this before. The truth was, they had done worse. 'We were getting into a fight with that guy over beer,' Marky Mark says. 'He had a case of beer, we didn't have no money, we wanted to take it.' There were about eight of them, so the victim didn't have much chance. 'I had no idea who he was. He just lived in the building we were hanging round. He was kinda older. I think he was a Vietnamese guy. He just had that case of Budweiser, man, and somebody grabbed him and it kinda turned into a big beef. I don't even remember it that much because I was that fucked up, but I remember waking the next morning in jail.' He doesn't want me to misunderstand. He's sorry for what he did. 'I regret things like that. I try to better myself and put all that behind me. And people don't understand - they call me soft. Whatever. Yeah, I am soft. I'm a good person. I've got a soft heart. I'm about peace, man.' But how, I ask him, can he square those ideas about peace with being the kind of person who could hurt someone because you wanted their beer? He rocks back into his chair, and looks right at me. This is 1992. He's only 21. 'That's some kind of fucked-up question,' he says quietly. 'He is,' says David O Russell, director of Three Kings, 'one of the most confident people I have met in my life. As an actor, he is fearless; he'll do anything. What he brings to the scenes is this cut-the-crap realism, and yet he has all these other dimensions. And he has very, very high standards. He has ambitions on a par with De Niro. He and Ice Cube have already had three careers, and they have that kind of street thing where you just set out to do something, and don't take any shit about it.' Russell is one of several people who note what an excellent mimic he is. 'He would do scenes all day, from The Godfather or Dog Day Afternoon. He's a sampler.' Wahlberg says that he complained too much on the shoot for the last 40 days: 'We were in the middle of nowhere and there was nothing to do. And the second I left, I missed it, and I felt really bad about complaining.' ('He loves to bellyache,' Russell confirms. 'He complained the most,' agrees Ice Cube, who bonded with him over the similarities of their backgrounds. 'I told him it was because he can get away with it. Young American white kid. He can get away with being whatever he wants to be.') During the shoot Wahlberg managed to avoid discomfort when he could. Even on a movie set, he knows how to cheat the odds in his favour. There is a pivotal scene in the film where a milk truck explodes, and where the principal characters are supposed to get covered in waves of milk. Wahlberg figured something out. The master shot was being filmed first - the truck would only explode once - and all the days of filming them half-submerged in the milk would follow it. 'Being the smart ass that I was,' Wahlberg explains, 'I jumped on these sandbags.' In the master shot, the milk barely touched him, and so for continuity's sake, he would have to stay dry thereafter. 'I had my eyes set on that thing from the second we got out there,' he says. For the week, his co-stars had to jump back into the milk every morning. 'I had to wet my boots,' he grins, 'because my boots got wet.' Russell says that he doesn't believe Wahlberg premeditated the sandbag leap - 'I think he got lucky' - but says that his escape from wetness drew barbed, amused indignation from his co-stars, especially George Clooney. Recently, there have been unsettling echoes of both his recent and more distant pasts in his sleep. Maybe, he suggests, it's because, though he doesn't watch much TV, he'll watch anything about crime or courts or jail, often just before bedtime. 'I had a dream where me and Ice Cube escaped from our cell and we're in prison, but we're wearing our army fatigues, which is our wardrobe in the movie, and we're running around trying to find this other kid that I know and he doesn't even know, getting chased by guards, and we're going to get more time...' Sometimes he knows this is all a dream, but sometimes he's really scared. ('That's a terrible dream,' reflects Ice Cube. 'When you come from where we come from, in a way you feel like you're getting away with something.') Wahlberg is a religious man. 'I just try to say my prayers right before I go to bed,' he says, 'so I'm thinking good stuff.' Sometimes he kneels, usually he lies in bed. He does it even when he's with someone: 'It's just something that I need to do.' He feels bad if he skips the prayers, and sometimes he feels bad when he says them. 'For instance, if I'm with my girlfriend and we made love and I have to pray,' he explains, 'I feel guilty, and the first thing I do is say, \"I'm sorry, I know we're not married and we shouldn't be having sex...\"' He says that he prays for himself, and his family and his friends. 'But more importantly,' he says, 'I pray for the people that don't have God in their lives.' He says that the only person he has in his life who he can really talk to is Father Flavin, the parish priest he has known since he was young. 'The only guy who isn't trying to get anything out of me,' Wahlberg says. He spent an afternoon with Father Flavin a couple of weeks ago when he was feeling really bad. He'd been keeping a lot of stuff inside. He'd been spending time around people he knew, and yet still found himself feeling alone. And there were other things. Relationship problems. Family stuff. His father's health. 'Feeling guilty about things I've done in the past,' he says. 'Ones from a long time ago, and recent ones. Every little thing kind of weighs upon my shoulders. It's just how I am. I have a tendency to feel very guilty.' A laugh. 'I don't know - I'm just getting really soft in my old age. I never felt guilty about anything up until I actually started to have good things happen to me in my life.' The great Mark Wahlberg public nightmare of 1993 - a few months after I first spent time with him - began when The Village Voice revealed the details of the crime for which he was imprisoned, focusing heavily on the racial nature of the attack. (A civil rights injunction had been served against Wahlberg two years earlier for physically and verbally attacking a black youth; on the night of the crime for which he was imprisoned, it was stated in court that he struck the Vietnamese man over the head with a 5ft wooden pole and then, minutes later, punched another Vietnamese man in the eye several blocks away. Wahlberg has always maintained that neither event was racially motivated.) In some ways he was fair game - fundamentally, he had done what they said - but the tenor of the coverage was less fair. The suggestion was that he had tried to hide all this (which, of course, argued for the possibility that he was still hiding and harbouring such impulses and biases), but that suggestion was wrong. The incident had been alluded to in the pop media, and when I had brought it up with him months before (for an article which was never published), he had discussed it and acknowledged the race of his victim, regretfully but openly. Two further incidents followed, this time fingering Wahlberg as homophobic. On the British TV show The Word he refused to condemn on the spot some hateful anti-gay comments by reggae star Shabba Ranks, and at a Hollywood party he was accused of disparaging one of Madonna's entourage as 'a homo'. It's a charge he has always rebuffed, and he is enduringly furious that in this period Calvin Klein simply let their relationship lapse, implying to him either that it was too dangerous commercially for them to stand up for him or that tacitly they believed him guilty. 'I was upset for a long time, because I put myself out there for them and they just left me hanging.' Months passed after the assault on the Vietnamese man, but eventually there was a trial, and Marky Mark was sentenced to serve three months of a two-year sentence. He would be incarcerated for 52 days. 'The thing I remember was seeing my mother so crushed,' he says. 'Having to say goodbye to my mother in the courthouse that day - I'm 17, all dressed up in a sweater and shoes.' For the first 10 days in jail, what drove him mad was that he had to wear these horrible prison jeans and his courtroom shoes, and he kept slipping all over the place. He was so glad when he finally got some sneakers. It wasn't like he didn't know people in jail. A lot of the guys he'd grown up with were there. Some inmates tried to test him at the beginning, but once he'd shown them he wasn't scared they left him alone. But it was still hard in there. Waking up every morning at seven o'clock to the sound of doors slamming. Dreaming he was at home, then opening his eyes to find he was still imprisoned. Calling home every day and listening to his mother crying. He tried to keep himself to himself. Stay inside his own head. Wait. Wahlberg is thinking about acting, a skill and pastime about which he now cares, but which offers him such troubles. 'In every movie I've done, I've learned more about myself. Probably more that I don't like... What I get out of it is exactly what I put into it. I feel what my character is supposed to feel in the scene, before I shoot the scene, and after I'm done. It sucks a lot of the time, because I do a lot of darker, heavier stuff. It weighs on me, you know.' His greatest, strangest performance so far is playing the long-membered porn star at the centre of Boogie Nights. He is good at the cocksure, strutting, macho stuff, but what is much more impressive is how fine he is at all the bumbling, confused, sexually unsure stuff. He allows a character who you'd expect as a combination of the amusing and unlovely to crunch your heart. 'He's one of those natural raw-talent guys,' says Boogie Nights director Paul Thomas Anderson. 'To a certain extent, it's a kind of uneducated talent, which is what you love about it. You get this minefield of stuff.' There are other Mark Wahlberg films, films you have never seen. These are the movies he writes and films himself. He's now done eight or nine of them. 'Really out-there shit,' he concedes. 'Nobody can believe that it's me actually thinking this up.' The first, 16A, was about a musician being seduced by a producer who is trying to convince him to be in a movie, and who brings him out to Hollywood, hooks him up with the girls and hotels and limos. 'He gets there,' Wahlberg says, 'and listens to this guy's spiel and then he goes into the bathroom and commits suicide.' Wahlberg loved the idea that this guy would kill himself rather than deal with all the nonsense. 'That was a very heroic ending.' He is serious about these films. He says that - 'and it may sound crazy' - making them properly for public consumption is what he would like to end up doing. He has earmarked one called The Undertaker ('with this guy who owns a funeral parlour, and he gets rid of all these bodies for the mob, but he has sex with the dead bodies') as where he'd like to start. They seem the product of a very sick and depraved mind, I say. Where does this come from in your head? 'Just a lot of time on my hands.' Do you talk to Father Flavin about this? 'No, he's never seen any of them. I've already made them, and I know God's seen them. Father Flavin is really cool and open-minded. He just saw Three Kings with me when I saw it for the first time and he loved it. He loved the violence. He's a hip priest, he really is.' Wahlberg says that he's in a relationship he's been in for a while. 'But I don't feel comfortable talking about it, because I don't know how to feel comfortable in the relationship, at times,' he says. 'I haven't been in very many serious relationships and [he laughs wryly] I haven't learned how to function in a serious relationship.' The first thing people will think, hearing that, is that you must behave really badly. 'Yeah, I have a hard time staying faithful. It's not that. I wish I were that simple. I have a hard time trusting, you know. I've been hurt before and I have hurt people before. I want more than anything to have a normal life and have a family and have kids, and give them all the things I never had. I had love, you know. At times it was hard love. I wouldn't change it for anything, but it is difficult.' Later, he says, 'I haven't felt comfortable to open up to any one person in my life.' And adds, 'I'm not looking to open up with everybody. I'm just hoping that I find one person that I can share with.' I don't disbelieve this - Mark Wahlberg is, I think, studded with very real and fresh contradictions - but it easy to pick up a very different impression. When I ask David O Russell why Wahlberg does any of this, Russell laughs and says, 'Because he likes to get girls.' When I suggest that Wahlberg is hankering for something more permanent, Russell responds: 'He has a part of him that very much wants to settle down and have a family, but right now that part doesn't have a prayer. He can't help himself. He loves to have fun. We went out with him, and it was exactly what I knew it would be - rolling with his posse, Armani suits - and wherever he goes he's surrounded by women giving him phone numbers and kissing him. He loves it.' 'I haven't had a night out with him in a long time, just because I know what that's like - nothing that a married man like me should be doing,' says Paul Thomas Anderson. I don't think it is unusual for Wahlberg to leave different people with very different impressions. 'He has natural personality and he has survival instincts and charm and charisma, and he knows how to apply it to any situation in life,' says his brother. 'That's what his upbringing gives him. Drop him into a fire and he will find some water. And he's applying it in Hollywood.' 'He's so smart,' says Anderson, affectionately. 'If he ever comes off like he doesn't know what's going on, it's a con.'",

      "trailText": "<p>As Lastminute.com prepares to float, co-founder Martha Lane Fox talks to  Jamie  Doward</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was on a Sunday morning shortly after the launch of <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\" target=\"_new\">Lastminute.com</a>, the e-commerce website which offers everything from holidays to gifts, that one of the company's co-founders, Martha Lane Fox, took the telephone call. 'This voice said, \"The site's OK, but there's something missing. I can book the holidays and everything, but I can't get a date\".' A slightly alarmed Lane Fox put the phone down. </p> <p>Perhaps the voice will be able to realise his wish soon. 'If you think you need it at the last minute, the chances are we're probably looking to go there,' Lane Fox says. This typifies the message the 27-year-old Oxford graduate is now trying to drum home. Lastminute, which is gearing up to float on the stock market in the next few weeks, has a lot of potential, runs the message. Like the company's exhortation to its 800,000 registered users, Lastminute.com is keen to 'do something'. </p> <p>The company will need potential by the bucket load to justify its likely valuation when it floats. Lastminute, which is only 18 months old and turned over around \u00a32.6 million in the 12 months to September 1999, is likely to be valued at up to \u00a3400m when it is listed on the Nasdaq and London Stock Exchanges. </p> <p>Given the huge demand for Internet stocks, the firm is likely to be worth far more than this shortly afterwards. </p> <p>Lane Fox, who, with the company's co-founder and fellow Oxford graduate, Brent Hoberman, 31, jointly holds a 20 per cent stake in the firm, knows that to justify this sort of value over the longer term, Lastminute needs to develop its business strategy and become an indispensable online Jim'll Fix It for web surfers, rather than just a cute idea. </p> <p>Personalisation will be the key to Lastminute making the shift from well-intentioned website to one capable of make serious money. </p> <p>Lane Fox paints an enticing scenario: 'Soon our service will be able to message your mobile phone, saying things like, 'We've found the holiday that meets you and your friends' requirements - sun shine, the chance to drink good red wine, and it's only four hours away.\" Having a site that feels personal will be critical.' </p> <p>By doing this, of course, Lastminute should develop a much closer relationship with its users. The company, whose earnings model is based primarily on commission fees, may boast that it has approaching a million of them registered - a figure which is currently growing by more than 30 per cent a month - but it needs to convert this sort of interest into sales. </p> <p>Just because Internet users have registered an interest does not mean they are buyers. Indeed, a typical user now buys something from Lastminute between two and three times a year. </p> <p>But equally, by building sophisticated databases which are aware of users' likes and dislikes, Lastminute reinforces its position with its 1,000-plus suppliers, which include British Airways, Bass Hotels, Conran Restaurants and Virgin. </p> <p>The company knows that this is its unique selling point: one which will differentiate it from the major travel agents selling on the Web. And because of this, all the major airlines and hotel groups are keen to see their names under the Lastminute umbrella, a desire which allows the company to build critical mass. </p> <p>'They [the travel agents and the like] own the supply, but they don't have the volume that we can offer,' she says. </p> <p>True, people visit Lastminute because of its reputation for being an Internet hub - somewhere they know they will find a holiday or a restaurant or whatever. But what about the threat of a major ticket seller developing its own site, and then squeezing its margins to price Lastminute out of the equation? It may not be able to offer the breadth of holidays but, hey, look at those prices. Where would that leave Lastminute, the e-commerce intermediary? </p> <p>Lane Fox dismisses that possibility. 'Companies can't do it on their own website because they fear cannibalisation.' Perhaps, but what about companies such as Egg, the online bank set up by Prudential? The wily Pru deliberately established a completely different online brand for this reason. What would stop a big player doing something similar? </p> <p>Even if this were a possibility, Lane Fox says, Lastminute has first-mover advantage. 'You'd still have to set the company up, and we're starting to get a critical mass in Europe,' she says. </p> <p>Indeed the company already has offices in London, Paris, Munich and Stockholm, and has plans to roll out its brand across the rest of the continent. Lane Fox also admits that the company is now looking to get into the US through its alliance with bargain travel retailer priceline.com. </p> <p>And besides, Lastminute is keen to be seen as much more than a bucket shop for late holidays. Speciality services include everything from last-minute babysitters to firms that bring you breakfast in bed. </p> <p>'It isn't just about cheap travel. Someone may be desperate to get a hotel room in a particular place, or else their girlfriend is going to kill them. We may be able to offer it to them - but at a price,' Lane Fox says. She says that last Valentine's Day proved there were was a huge untapped market for this sort of last-minute premium service. </p> <p>In addition to broadening its geographical reach, Lastminute is keen to spread itself across as many different technological platforms as possible. It has deals with BT Cellnet and Orange to put services on their mobile phone networks, and has signed up with interactive cable TV company Telewest. </p> <p>Money from the float will be ploughed into developing the site, which Lane Fox admits needs improving. 'We've spent a lot developing the back end [the electronic stuff that goes on behind the scenes when you click your mouse] but we want to do more with the front end [the bit you look at].' </p> <p>Lane Fox who, apparently for public relations reasons, is now the face and mouth of Lastminute, leaving Hoberman - who dreamt up the company - in the background, admits to being surprised at how quickly it has grown. </p> <p>Indeed, initially she didn't think it could work at all.

      "bodyText": "It was on a Sunday morning shortly after the launch of Lastminute.com, the e-commerce website which offers everything from holidays to gifts, that one of the company's co-founders, Martha Lane Fox, took the telephone call. 'This voice said, \"The site's OK, but there's something missing. I can book the holidays and everything, but I can't get a date\".' A slightly alarmed Lane Fox put the phone down. Perhaps the voice will be able to realise his wish soon. 'If you think you need it at the last minute, the chances are we're probably looking to go there,' Lane Fox says. This typifies the message the 27-year-old Oxford graduate is now trying to drum home. Lastminute, which is gearing up to float on the stock market in the next few weeks, has a lot of potential, runs the message. Like the company's exhortation to its 800,000 registered users, Lastminute.com is keen to 'do something'. The company will need potential by the bucket load to justify its likely valuation when it floats. Lastminute, which is only 18 months old and turned over around \u00a32.6 million in the 12 months to September 1999, is likely to be valued at up to \u00a3400m when it is listed on the Nasdaq and London Stock Exchanges. Given the huge demand for Internet stocks, the firm is likely to be worth far more than this shortly afterwards. Lane Fox, who, with the company's co-founder and fellow Oxford graduate, Brent Hoberman, 31, jointly holds a 20 per cent stake in the firm, knows that to justify this sort of value over the longer term, Lastminute needs to develop its business strategy and become an indispensable online Jim'll Fix It for web surfers, rather than just a cute idea. Personalisation will be the key to Lastminute making the shift from well-intentioned website to one capable of make serious money. Lane Fox paints an enticing scenario: 'Soon our service will be able to message your mobile phone, saying things like, 'We've found the holiday that meets you and your friends' requirements - sun shine, the chance to drink good red wine, and it's only four hours away.\" Having a site that feels personal will be critical.' By doing this, of course, Lastminute should develop a much closer relationship with its users. The company, whose earnings model is based primarily on commission fees, may boast that it has approaching a million of them registered - a figure which is currently growing by more than 30 per cent a month - but it needs to convert this sort of interest into sales. Just because Internet users have registered an interest does not mean they are buyers. Indeed, a typical user now buys something from Lastminute between two and three times a year. But equally, by building sophisticated databases which are aware of users' likes and dislikes, Lastminute reinforces its position with its 1,000-plus suppliers, which include British Airways, Bass Hotels, Conran Restaurants and Virgin. The company knows that this is its unique selling point: one which will differentiate it from the major travel agents selling on the Web. And because of this, all the major airlines and hotel groups are keen to see their names under the Lastminute umbrella, a desire which allows the company to build critical mass. 'They [the travel agents and the like] own the supply, but they don't have the volume that we can offer,' she says. True, people visit Lastminute because of its reputation for being an Internet hub - somewhere they know they will find a holiday or a restaurant or whatever. But what about the threat of a major ticket seller developing its own site, and then squeezing its margins to price Lastminute out of the equation? It may not be able to offer the breadth of holidays but, hey, look at those prices. Where would that leave Lastminute, the e-commerce intermediary? Lane Fox dismisses that possibility. 'Companies can't do it on their own website because they fear cannibalisation.' Perhaps, but what about companies such as Egg, the online bank set up by Prudential? The wily Pru deliberately established a completely different online brand for this reason. What would stop a big player doing something similar? Even if this were a possibility, Lane Fox says, Lastminute has first-mover advantage. 'You'd still have to set the company up, and we're starting to get a critical mass in Europe,' she says. Indeed the company already has offices in London, Paris, Munich and Stockholm, and has plans to roll out its brand across the rest of the continent. Lane Fox also admits that the company is now looking to get into the US through its alliance with bargain travel retailer priceline.com. And besides, Lastminute is keen to be seen as much more than a bucket shop for late holidays. Speciality services include everything from last-minute babysitters to firms that bring you breakfast in bed. 'It isn't just about cheap travel. Someone may be desperate to get a hotel room in a particular place, or else their girlfriend is going to kill them. We may be able to offer it to them - but at a price,' Lane Fox says. She says that last Valentine's Day proved there were was a huge untapped market for this sort of last-minute premium service. In addition to broadening its geographical reach, Lastminute is keen to spread itself across as many different technological platforms as possible. It has deals with BT Cellnet and Orange to put services on their mobile phone networks, and has signed up with interactive cable TV company Telewest. Money from the float will be ploughed into developing the site, which Lane Fox admits needs improving. 'We've spent a lot developing the back end [the electronic stuff that goes on behind the scenes when you click your mouse] but we want to do more with the front end [the bit you look at].' Lane Fox who, apparently for public relations reasons, is now the face and mouth of Lastminute, leaving Hoberman - who dreamt up the company - in the background, admits to being surprised at how quickly it has grown. Indeed, initially she didn't think it could work at all. Hoberman suggested the idea in 1996, while working at Spectrum, a consultancy specialising in new media strategies. 'I said it was far too complex and you would need thousands of suppliers, but, of course, that's what the web sorts out,' Lane Fox says. The company raised \u00a3600,000 to get going. Its backers include venture capital firm Arts Alliance Advisers, as well as France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, Deutsche Telekom, Sony Music Entertainment and Intel. There was only one major problem when the pair had decided to launch the business. A Sardinian businessman had registered the name. Both Lane Fox and Hoberman were adamant that their site had to be called Lastminute.com, and the Sardinian was happy to sell it for several thousand pounds. Today the company's name is everywhere, as Lastminute, already the second most recognised e-tailer in the UK after Amazon, looks to boost its profile before it floats. The fact that airports operator BAA is also an investor helps: it means the Lastminute name will be plastered on numerous billboards at travel destinations across the land. 'The brand is vital. It has quite a sexy image. We're not trying to be a big computer company; we're about empowering the consumer,' Lane Fox says. The question is, though, whether enough consumers believe this.

      "body": "<p>Nudging the rich juices of a braised faggot, or dissolving into the hot onion gravy that accompanies a Cumberland sausage, the poor swede at least stands something of a chance - especially when it has been mashed with half its weight in butter and crowned with Kerala's entire harvest of black pepper. Beyond that, served as a stand-alone vegetable or floating in a thin stew, this pale golden globe is the most unwelcome of vegetables, losing ground in the last decade to sugar-sweet mangetout and out-of-season asparagus. Yet I must own up to a fondness for this root, particularly when it comes mashed into a translucent amber mound or tucked into the folds of a genuine Cornish pasty.</p> <p>OK, so it has a bit of a PR problem. A swede has none of the explicit elegance of the asparagus spear, the intricate beauty of the globe artichoke or the touchy-feely virtue of an aubergine. A swede is little more than a big lump of starch. And while it may be a deep amber when cooked and buttered, in the vegetable rack this baby is simply beige. Few vegetables are as heavy to carry home, yield so little juice or smell so unappetising. To add insult to injury, a swede is prone to give you gas. So even if I do succeed in convincing you to befriend this lonely root, you may end up cursing me later. </p> <p>Time and time again, the dear old swede is passed over for something prettier, juicier or simply sweeter. I do it myself, pouncing on the lush bundles of spinach, the crunchy carrots and bushy purple sprouting, leaving the lone fawn and mauve lump sobbing in the vegetable rack. It doesn't help that a swede is the cheapest vegetable, and that it finds itself inextricably associated with the stews and braises we have ditched for the dazzling flavours of the Far East or the sexy warmth of the Italian kitchen. In short, the swede needs some help.</p> <p>Yesterday, I fried some in butter, poured in a measure of stock and left the golden chunks to soften and soak it all up. It was a surprising success. I had meant it to accompany a sausage hotpot I was giving friends for supper, but ended up eating the entire panful before they arrived. The secret was to let the slices of vegetable caramelise slightly in the butter and to let them become fully tender, almost squashy, before I tucked in. Two nights ago, I hid more of the orange cubes in a deeply inauthentic Cornish pasty (I chucked the sacred beef in favour of a shoulder of pork) and good they were, too. Tonight, it's thin slices of the fat root baked with sage and chicken stock. </p> <p>The least popular vegetable it may be, but at least the swede can boast a recipe that is a classic of the British kitchen, which is more than anyone can say for mangetout or mini-sweetcorn. Bashed neeps, as the Scots call them, are one of the most famous of our vegetable dishes, and with just cause. They are best known for their affiliation with haggis, but they deserve to be brought out more often than once a year. They are easy to get wrong. Overcooking will cause them to disintegrate, and a tight hand with the butter and the black pepper will leave everyone wondering why you bothered. Mashed swede is only worth eating when half a packet of butter is suspended in it. The black pepper should be freshly cracked, so that it is truly fragrant. Butter and black pepper is the mantra of swede aficionados. </p> <p>I should pass on a small tip to those who find swede a difficult vegetable to deal with. Shorn of its thick outer peel, a swede has a habit of slipping under the knife (I find parsnips do the same, especially when wet). This can be dangerous. I get round this by cutting off a lump from one side and using this flat side to stand the swede on while I cut. On the occasions I don't do this, I inevitably have to retrieve the hard and slippery creature from the floor and usually just miss cutting myself in the process. </p> <p>There is just enough betacarotene in a swede to qualify for inclusion in the sacred list of orange vegetables that are now considered so good for us, though if it is antioxidants you are eating it for, then you might do better to munch on a carrot, bunny-style. Perhaps it is the thought of all the spring produce currently pushing its way up through the soil that spurs me on, but I am happy to make the most of the last of the winter roots. Parsnips, fat carrots and swedes have all been boiled and mashed in my kitchen this week. I have also braised sliced swede with chicken stock and herbs and tried - unsuccessfully - to make a soup from them. </p> <p>You must be assuming I am sitting here in a cloud of gas. Truth told, root vegetables rarely give rise to what Julia Child, the doyenne of American TV cooks, coyly refers to as the 'rooty-toots' unless they are savagely undercooked. There is no joy in an underdone swede. The trick is to take them to the edge of collapse, but to catch them before they disintegrate. That way, they will be sweet, tender and trouble-free.</p> <p><strong>Swede with butter and stock</strong><br> Don't be put off by the word 'stock'. Stock made from a powder or even a cube is fine for this - in fact, I think it is almost better. </p> <p>500g swede <br>35g butter <br>500ml stock, vegetable or chicken, from powder, a cube or the real thing</p> <p>Peel the swede, cut in half lengthways, and then in half again, then slice it so that you end up with small pieces no thicker than your little finger, rather like saut\u00e9 potatoes. Now melt the butter in a shallow pan set over a moderate heat and add the swede. Don't stir or move it around the pan for a minute - simply leave the pieces to colour on their flat sides, then turn them. When they are golden-brown around the edges, pour in the stock and bring to the boil.</p> <p>Once it is boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer and leave for 15 minutes or so until the swede is deep orange-gold and tender enough to squash with a fork. You may need 5 minutes or so longer. The liquid will have reduced to a buttery juice. Serve the swede straightaway (it needs to be very hot to be good) with a grind of black pepper and salt. </p> <p><strong>Baked swede</strong> <br>Serves 4 as a side dish</p> <p>1 large swede (about 650g peeled weight) <br>40g butter <br>2 medium onions, peeled and thinly sliced <br>a few sage leaves <br>1 small sprig of rosemary <br>chicken or vegetable stock, to cover</p> <p>Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Cut the swede into slices about as thick as a pound coin. It is easier and safer to do this by first cutting a slice from one side and using this to steady the swede as you cut. Generously butter a baking dish or roasting tin. Lay the slices of swede and onion in the dish, seasoning them with salt and black pepper and strewing a few sage and rosemary leaves as you go. Ladle over the stock so that it just about covers the vegetables - a matter of five or so ladlefuls - then dot on the rest of the butter. </p> <p>Bake in the preheated oven for an hour or so, turning the swede in the stock from time to time, until the vegetables are tender enough to crush between your fingers. Serve as a side dish, with some of the juices spooned over. </p> <p><strong>Pork, swede and leek pasties</strong> <br>I know better than to use the word 'Cornish' to describe these - I once lived there, and have no wish to tread on the toes of any pasty purists. The pastry here is somewhat shorter and more crumbly than that usually used for meat pies. Makes 3 </p> <p>for the pastry <br>60g butter <br>60g lard <br>225g plain flour <br>a little milk or beaten egg for brushing</p> <p>350g cubed pork, not too lean <br>1 medium-sized leek <br>a little butter <br>1 medium-sized swede (about 350g peeled weight)</p> <p>Rub the butter and lard into the flour with your fingertips, or blitz it all in a food processor, until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Drizzle in enough very cold water - it will be about 3 tbsps - for you to be able to bring the dough into a firm, smooth ball, then leave it in a cool place to rest.</p> <p>Cut the pork into chunks about the diameter of a thumbnail. Trim the leek, discarding the tough, dark-green bits, and cut them across into thin pieces. Melt a little butter in a shallow pan and fry the leeks till they start to wilt, but without letting them colour. Cut the peeled swede into small cubes, then add it to the leeks when they are approaching tenderness. They will brighten in colour after a few minutes' cooking. When they have been cooking for 5 minutes or so, and the leeks are tender, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool slightly before continuing.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Cut the pastry into three and roll each piece out into a circle about 20cm across, using a plate to cut round. Toss the pork with the warm leeks and swedes, and season generously with salt and black pepper. Divide the filling between the pastry discs, piling it up in the middle. Brush a little water, milk or beaten egg round the rim of the pastry, then bring the left and right edges of each piece of pastry together, pressing them firmly to seal. Pinch the pastry together to crimp the seam. Make a small airhole in the top, then brush the pasties with milk or beaten egg. </p> <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180C/gas mark 5 and continue baking for 35 minutes until the pastry is golden brown.</p>",

Once it is boiling, turn the heat down to a simmer and leave for 15 minutes or so until the swede is deep orange-gold and tender enough to squash with a fork. You may need 5 minutes or so longer. The liquid will have reduced to a buttery juice. Serve the swede straightaway (it needs to be very hot to be good) with a grind of black pepper and salt. Baked swede Serves 4 as a side dish 1 large swede (about 650g peeled weight) 40g butter 2 medium onions, peeled and thinly sliced a few sage leaves 1 small sprig of rosemary chicken or vegetable stock, to cover Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6. Cut the swede into slices about as thick as a pound coin. It is easier and safer to do this by first cutting a slice from one side and using this to steady the swede as you cut. Generously butter a baking dish or roasting tin. Lay the slices of swede and onion in the dish, seasoning them with salt and black pepper and strewing a few sage and rosemary leaves as you go. Ladle over the stock so that it just about covers the vegetables - a matter of five or so ladlefuls - then dot on the rest of the butter. Bake in the preheated oven for an hour or so, turning the swede in the stock from time to time, until the vegetables are tender enough to crush between your fingers. Serve as a side dish, with some of the juices spooned over. Pork, swede and leek pasties I know better than to use the word 'Cornish' to describe these - I once lived there, and have no wish to tread on the toes of any pasty purists. The pastry here is somewhat shorter and more crumbly than that usually used for meat pies. Makes 3 for the pastry 60g butter 60g lard 225g plain flour a little milk or beaten egg for brushing 350g cubed pork, not too lean 1 medium-sized leek a little butter 1 medium-sized swede (about 350g peeled weight) Rub the butter and lard into the flour with your fingertips, or blitz it all in a food processor, until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Drizzle in enough very cold water - it will be about 3 tbsps - for you to be able to bring the dough into a firm, smooth ball, then leave it in a cool place to rest. Cut the pork into chunks about the diameter of a thumbnail. Trim the leek, discarding the tough, dark-green bits, and cut them across into thin pieces. Melt a little butter in a shallow pan and fry the leeks till they start to wilt, but without letting them colour. Cut the peeled swede into small cubes, then add it to the leeks when they are approaching tenderness. They will brighten in colour after a few minutes' cooking. When they have been cooking for 5 minutes or so, and the leeks are tender, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool slightly before continuing. Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Cut the pastry into three and roll each piece out into a circle about 20cm across, using a plate to cut round. Toss the pork with the warm leeks and swedes, and season generously with salt and black pepper. Divide the filling between the pastry discs, piling it up in the middle. Brush a little water, milk or beaten egg round the rim of the pastry, then bring the left and right edges of each piece of pastry together, pressing them firmly to seal. Pinch the pastry together to crimp the seam. Make a small airhole in the top, then brush the pasties with milk or beaten egg. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, then turn down the heat to 180C/gas mark 5 and continue baking for 35 minutes until the pastry is golden brown.",

      "byline": "Monty Don",

      "body": "<p>I had a letter last autumn asking me why I never wrote about balconies and when I was going to address myself to rectifying this situation. The reason I have never written a word about balconies is that I have never possessed one. Not of any kind. I wish I had, because they strike me as being an entirely civilising bit of architecture. We went on holiday last November to a place near Naples, and we had not one, not two, but three balconies. None of them had anything that amounted to a view, but it was lovely to sit on them in the evening, looking down on the roof gardens below and watching the sun slide behind the houses. But if I had a balcony at home and it was my only private (semi-public) outdoor space, I would certainly want to use it as a garden. </p> <p>For a start, everything is going to have to be grown in a container of some kind. These do not have to be pots - a friend of mine grew a wide range of vegetables in grow bags on his balcony - but containers have the major disadvantage of needing more feeding and much more watering than a soil-based garden. A balcony, of course, is small enough to fit an inexpensive, computer-controlled irrigation system. I think I would equip any balcony of mine with this as a safety net, if I went away, but I would not let it be a substitute for the daily watering of plants with a can which, in this situation, is an important part of gardening and involves looking at each plant, checking up on it, reacquainting yourself with it. Chatting to it, if need be. </p> <p>Depending on its size, a balcony is a cross between a walk-in window box and a roof garden, and it is worth considering both parents of this hybridisation in order to make the most of it. The biggest problem of both environments is exposure. Stuck on top or on one side of a building, plants and humans are open to every breath of wind that comes their way. The same winds that gently freshen a summer's day on the ground can amount to a ruthlessly desiccating blast a few floors up. This has to be filtered, even on the smallest balcony, with some kind of screen. Trellis works well, as would a wicker screen of some kind. I once interviewed the architect Rick Mather in his roof garden, and he had created screens from polycarbon panels fixed to a framework of scaffolding poles. It looked very good indeed and was effective at keeping out the wind while also creating some privacy, while at the same time not blocking out much light. </p> <p>If you use trellis, it has the advantage that you can clothe it with a climber or two. It should also be possible to grow a couple of climbers in pots to grow up round the window that leads on to the balcony, and for these I would choose sweetly scented plants with an overlapping season. If it was a south- or west-facing balcony with a reasonable degree of protection, I might have Clematis armandii that would flower in April and early May, followed by a rose such as Rosa 'F\u00e9licit\u00e9 Perp\u00e9tue'. The point about these two is that both are evergreen, both have white flowers and both are luscious. If it was a more shaded balcony, I might grow the lovely burgundy red rose 'Souvenir du Dr Jamain', which I grow successfully in pots outside our back door here, and a couple of clematis, perhaps an alpina for early spring blueness and a viticella such as Clematis 'Ville de Lyon' or C 'Purpurea Plena Elegans'. </p> <p>Now, I know that there are those who would advise going for less vigorous plants when using climbers in a container, but my experience is that almost anything - and I mean anything - will grow perfectly well in a pot of some kind, as long as it is well fed and watered, and that you use the largest container that will fit the space while still being aesthetically pleasing. In fact, there is a self-limiting factor invoked by restricting root growth which means that you can grow climbers that are officially 'too big' in a small space. </p> <p>The other climbers that would be ideal for a balcony are annual ones. Sweet peas would be wonderful, as long as they had lots of water and rich compost. Choose the older grandiflora varieties as they are exquisitely fragrant as well as beautiful. Runner beans make brilliant decoration and moderate eating (never my favourite veg) as long as they have loads of water. Morning-glory (Ipomoea) is rather tender but will grow if you are facing south in the south. Nasturtiums (Tropaeolum) won't take any frost but will survive in almost any conditions above freezing, and actively prefer poor soil; they will smother a trellis in late summer and autumn. </p> <p>The orientation of a balcony is the most vital factor. If it faces north, it will never get direct sunlight, and will be a much less desirable place to sit out on. If it faces east, it will be lovely in the morning, and if it faces west, you will get all the evening sun. If it faces south, you will, of course, get sunshine for most of the day, but with this extra brightness comes some potential problems. If the sky is grey, it tends to suck up light and colour, especially in the middle of the day. Which, incidentally, is why the current fashion for using bright blues on surfaces such as wood, render or tiling is so misplaced. It looks brilliant in bright sunshine but deeply shabby under a grey sky. So glaucous greys and blues will look best. </p> <p>Any balcony or roof gardener has to resist the temptation to choose plants that create a luscious, overgrown effect, even though that can look fantastic, and might work if it was very sheltered. But big, fat-leaved plants tend to be those that come from warm, wet conditions, and any balcony in the UK is likely to oscillate between being either cold and wet or warm and dry. Half of the equation will not do. It is better to choose plants that will enjoy a certain amount of desiccation and a limited, but happy, life in a container. As a generalisation, these tend to be plants with narrow, silvery leaves, such as lavender, rosemary or artemisia, or small, felted leaves such as Helichrysum petiolare. Hostas are an exception to this rule, adding a fat luxuriousness, and would be especially suitable for a shaded balcony, although they must not be allowed to dry out. </p> <p>Bulbs do very well in containers, providing that they have really good drainage, and with the limited space of a balcony, a single medium-size pot can have snowdrops, crocuses, daffodils and tulips all following on from each other if they are planted in layers, with the tulips deepest, then the daffs, then the crocus with the snowdrops just below the surface. Summer bulbs, such as alliums and lilies, are ideal for pots, too, the only caveat being that although pretty hardy, they are best kept reasonably dry in winter, so either bring them indoors or cover them. </p> <p>The secret of all gardening in restricted spaces is to cram but not clutter. Keep it simple, but pack in as much as possible. That applies to every aspect of a tiny garden, including colours, textures, even scents. Never be precious or minimal - the smaller the space, the harder it is for that to work and, anyway, I think that minimalism goes against the point of a balcony garden. You are trying to reclaim and enclose a space from the sky, whereas minimalism is all about creating interesting and beautiful spaces. A balcony has the same ambivalent relationship between public and private as a box in the opera. Possible to get up to limited jiggery-pokery, but always in the public gaze to some extent. </p> <p>It's important to remember that public face and to make the balcony part of the architecture of the building and the street. Just allow your planting to spill over the edge and fall down the building with the same luxuriousness I love in the balconies of Venice, overlooking a tiny side canal and no more than a few feet from buildings on the other side. Often up to half a dozen tiers of balcony will each drip with trailing geraniums - sometimes all the same leaf and colour, looking mind-blowingly beautiful despite, or perhaps because of, the total simplicity. </p> <p> <strong> Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer</strong> </p> <p>Observer readers can buy a Summer Storm Patio Collection for \u00a311.99, including UK p&amp;p.

Bulbs do very well in containers, providing that they have really good drainage, and with the limited space of a balcony, a single medium-size pot can have snowdrops, crocuses, daffodils and tulips all following on from each other if they are planted in layers, with the tulips deepest, then the daffs, then the crocus with the snowdrops just below the surface. Summer bulbs, such as alliums and lilies, are ideal for pots, too, the only caveat being that although pretty hardy, they are best kept reasonably dry in winter, so either bring them indoors or cover them. The secret of all gardening in restricted spaces is to cram but not clutter. Keep it simple, but pack in as much as possible. That applies to every aspect of a tiny garden, including colours, textures, even scents. Never be precious or minimal - the smaller the space, the harder it is for that to work and, anyway, I think that minimalism goes against the point of a balcony garden. You are trying to reclaim and enclose a space from the sky, whereas minimalism is all about creating interesting and beautiful spaces. A balcony has the same ambivalent relationship between public and private as a box in the opera. Possible to get up to limited jiggery-pokery, but always in the public gaze to some extent. It's important to remember that public face and to make the balcony part of the architecture of the building and the street. Just allow your planting to spill over the edge and fall down the building with the same luxuriousness I love in the balconies of Venice, overlooking a tiny side canal and no more than a few feet from buildings on the other side. Often up to half a dozen tiers of balcony will each drip with trailing geraniums - sometimes all the same leaf and colour, looking mind-blowingly beautiful despite, or perhaps because of, the total simplicity.

      "body": "<p>I didn't need to be told that Beijing had changed.

But I give them credit for trying.</p> <p>I expected Beijing to be a kind of Chinese St Petersburg, a city with a wonderful heritage, but looking as though the painters had come in one day and then forgotten to come back, leaving their pots and pans behind, along with the garbage.</p> <p>That's not the case here. Modern Beijing is catching up with its present as well as its past and the first thought that comes to mind, gazing out of a coach window, is that it bears little resemblance to the place we knew from newspapers, television and history books.</p> <p>It has beautifully ornate paved walkways adjoining the wide streets - too wide, it has to be said, because no one has yet thought of the idea of traffic islands on which you can take refuge from the cars (some small, some large, and surprisingly many very large indeed), buses and seemingly millions of bicycles. The bicycles, for years the trademark of Beijing, haven't changed. (I saw a man clutching what looked like a wardrobe in one hand and the handlebars in the other.) Nor have the great ancient treasures of China - except that they are now displayed with the same love and care as they were created with.</p> <p>I would like to say I took a slow boat to China. I come from a generation where the title of an old song comes flooding back every time I hear of people going to that country on holiday. Other visitors see chopsticks lying next to a plate of Peking duck. Some have the picture of men and women dressed in identical ill-fitting blue uniforms riding those bicycles, carrying the Thoughts of Chairman Mao.</p> <p>There were no slow boats going my way, so I had to take a fast plane. And when I got there, nobody (well, just one or two) was wearing a blue tunic, buttoned up to the neck. And the only time I saw copies of the Thoughts was in a street market, where the book - which at one time had been the local version of the Bible - fought for room among a collection of fur hats, made in Russia. The hats sold faster than the books.</p> <p>If only the recent history of China could so easily be dismissed. What is true is that there is a constant effort being made to try to let people realise that things have changed because they needed changing. I imagine, however, that had there been any Tibetans in our party, they may have made some comments about plus \u00e7a change .</p> <p>People were not afraid to talk about Tiananmen Square and all it represented. 'Our government said almost nobody was killed,' said one government employee without too much prompting. 'We know that more than 100 died. It wouldn't happen today.'</p> <p>That was another difference about modern China. They are ready to admit mistakes without risking having to walk in procession with dunces' caps on their heads. There is, as we know, still religious intolerance in China.</p> <p>One of our guides said: 'But young people are coming back to religion. They are Buddhists whereas their parents were party members. My parents never joined the party - and my grandfather was imprisoned because he was a doctor with the nationalist army.' A decade ago, he wouldn't have talked like that. Now, it is almost part of the organised tours. Pre-emptive strikes? Perhaps, but in the Eighties, it would all have been denied. And punished.</p> <p>I suspect the principal guide showing us around - 'call me John' - was more happy about the commentary he gave us on the sights. It was a lot more pleasant for him to tell us about our five-star hotel. It proved to be as good as any we've ever stayed in.</p> <p>The commentary was interesting. John taught us as much about the English language as he did about China - a country which, he said, was bustling with modern inventions. All that was good in the West, they had there. There were the supermarkets, where you collected your food - 'noddles' a speciality - in a 'trooly' (the supermarkets are super-clean, and there's usually someone who speaks enough English to prevent you picking up something you wouldn't wish to know about). All this was made possible by what everyone on our very comfortable coach first took to be the 'garment' industry. There seemed to be many places making dresses and suits. But, then, we had to believe John when he said that much of his country's progress was due to these 'garment offices'. Finally, it dawned. He was talking about the 'Government'.</p> <p>I can't say I blame the officials wanting to concentrate on modern successes and on ancient history rather than on what has happened so recently.</p> <p>Neither, though, should we ignore the fact that when woad-painted men in England were running from cave to cave, an axe in one hand and the hair of a comely maiden in the other, Chinese people were building houses, heating iron pots they had made from moulds, decorating dishes with simple, but brilliant geometric patterns that Habitat might wish it had patented, and creating figures in pure gold.</p> <p>I saw those in Xian, at the site of a 6,000-year-old Neolithic village, now lovingly contained inside a museum. Xian is best-known for its terracotta warriors, the life-size models of more than 2,000 soldiers sculpted from life on the instructions of an emperor who had wanted to kill all his troops so they would guard him in his tomb. He was persuaded that this wasn't a terribly good idea and contented himself with having the models made. They were discovered only in the Seventies by a farmer who had been instructed to get his land ready for a power station.</p> <p>What he found was more powerful than any plant intended to generate electricity. Parts of the exhibition go round the world, but nothing can compare with the view of thousands of these troops standing in line with their horses as though waiting for the order to advance. The detail is incredible - from the curl of their moustaches to the folds on their boots.</p> <p>The faces of the men, all different, could have been those of the people who showed us around the building erected on the the spot where they were found - and where, it is believed, another 4,000 are still buried. And, a nice touch, the farmer is on site, sitting behind a desk, signing, in exquisite script, guide books.</p> <p>But it's not just the warriors that cause such a frisson of excitement. Preserved in a glass case is a life-size model, which had been buried with the emperor, of his gold carriage - in gold and bronze. Every detail of the carriage, the reins, the sunshade, the superbly crafted wheels was perfectly preserved. But, above all, there are his four horses - so real I swear I could see steam pouring from their nostrils, particularly those of the one bridling on the right.</p> <p>I had never yearned to see China. It always seemed too far away, too 'primitive', too 'authoritarian', too 'dangerous'. And I hated what had gone on there. Besides which, I could never manage chopsticks.</p> <p>Two of our dearest friends, on the other hand, loved all that stuff about rickshaws and pagodas, and Tiananmen Square was a long time ago for them. My wife Sara and I agreed to be persuaded, took what, in the scheme of things, was a very economical tour - and the eyes were opened from the moment we began that journey into Beijing and then stepped outside the hotel into the cold of a winter's morning, with a bright sun above shining on bright people - if, that is, you could ignore the presence of very, very young child beggars, brought in, I was told, from the country. These are little girls of five or six for whom the less caring rural Chinese have to find a use. And they represent the real black spot on the face of Beijing.</p> <p>The guides tried to explain it, but didn't excuse what can only be described as this 2000-era sin. If this is modern Chinese capitalism - along with the superb stores and the great cars - then something has gone awry. It was easier for the guides to explain how they respected the government policy of restricting parents to having one child per family. They have little choice; another mouth to feed means no job, no social security, virtual ostracism. And in those rural areas, that child has to be a boy.</p> <p>The girls are lucky to survive - and when they do, they are condemned to begging. No European is privileged to escape from them. Your hearts are touched - until you see their 'ponces' in the background, ready to scoop up all they have collected.</p> <p>I wish I hadn't seen them. But if you want to see China, they can't be ignored. It is difficult to understand why a country that is so proud of so much allows this to go on.</p> <p>The Great Wall was a lot less contentious, of course. It was cold on top of that wall the day we went, huddled together looking and feeling like a pack of Antarctic explorers. But what we saw, what we felt, was a moment of wonder at what is indeed one of the Great Wonders of the World. A wall, parts of which are 3,500 years old, stretching for 4,000 miles, built as a defence barrier to counter marauding Mongolian armies, is still there, as strong and defiant as ever.</p> <p>You walk and walk along its structure - most of that now used was built in the fifteenth century - surrounded by a landscape that cries out to be videoed. But what really struck me was the quality of the brickwork, some of it still laid, still pointed the way it was 1,500 years before we started counting our own calendar - but at a time when the Chinese had mastered a civilisation few at this end of the earth knew anything about.</p> <p>We were, of course, lucky. Charlie, the guide in Xian, was better than any I had ever experienced. He and the other guides provided by a London-based company, Cultural Tours, seemed to take their job seriously enough to be sure that no meal offered offended the people who had ordered a vegetarian diet. The diets were also there, without asking, on the internal Air China flights. What was more, people who had requested certain seating arrangements on the flight from Heathrow always got them on the internal flights, too. That was due to Cathie, the resident courier who seemed to be provided with a kind of inbuilt radar.</p> <p>Naturally, we did the things tourists are expected to do. The silk market in Beijing was full of such ridiculously cheap bargains - you can be asked the equivalent of \u00a330 for a pair of silk pyjamas and walk away having paid \u00a35.50 - that I, a confirmed market hater, loved it. I didn't love the Chinese opera nearly as much (except the English language surtitles explaining a disappointed wife's song to her husband, 'I know you'd rather go and play in the brothel') but I'm glad I went.</p> <p>The Chinese don't go to their operas themselves, at least not to the ones specialising in entertaining tourists. But you see them at all the historic sites.</p> <p>We went in a kind of assembly-line production, but we cherished it all. One minute, Tiananmen Square - minus any sign of what had happened in 1988 - the Chairman Mao mausoleum and the government buildings, the next the Forbidden City. I suppose I had expected that to be Forbidden to us, too. But it wasn't. We walked in the footsteps of the Ming emperors - and of Peter O'Toole, who had filmed the Oscar-winning The Last Emperor there with Bernardo Bertolucci.</p> <p>Then there were the Ming tombs - more treasures, each one more amazing than the one before. There were gold statues, beautiful jewellery, but what struck me was a crown used by some ancient empress - and very much like the one worn by the Dowager Empress in the movie.</p> <p>Walking with history - and with your trusty camcorder - is not just a holiday, it's an education.</p> <p>A country that has seen its share of propaganda has opened itself up to an unsuspecting Western world like the petals of a lotus flower.</p> <p><b>Factfile</b></p> <p>\u0095 Michael Freedland paid \u00a3820 for a 10-day tour with Cultural Tours (0207 636 7906).

My wife Sara and I agreed to be persuaded, took what, in the scheme of things, was a very economical tour - and the eyes were opened from the moment we began that journey into Beijing and then stepped outside the hotel into the cold of a winter's morning, with a bright sun above shining on bright people - if, that is, you could ignore the presence of very, very young child beggars, brought in, I was told, from the country. These are little girls of five or six for whom the less caring rural Chinese have to find a use. And they represent the real black spot on the face of Beijing. The guides tried to explain it, but didn't excuse what can only be described as this 2000-era sin. If this is modern Chinese capitalism - along with the superb stores and the great cars - then something has gone awry. It was easier for the guides to explain how they respected the government policy of restricting parents to having one child per family. They have little choice; another mouth to feed means no job, no social security, virtual ostracism. And in those rural areas, that child has to be a boy. The girls are lucky to survive - and when they do, they are condemned to begging. No European is privileged to escape from them. Your hearts are touched - until you see their 'ponces' in the background, ready to scoop up all they have collected. I wish I hadn't seen them. But if you want to see China, they can't be ignored. It is difficult to understand why a country that is so proud of so much allows this to go on. The Great Wall was a lot less contentious, of course. It was cold on top of that wall the day we went, huddled together looking and feeling like a pack of Antarctic explorers. But what we saw, what we felt, was a moment of wonder at what is indeed one of the Great Wonders of the World. A wall, parts of which are 3,500 years old, stretching for 4,000 miles, built as a defence barrier to counter marauding Mongolian armies, is still there, as strong and defiant as ever. You walk and walk along its structure - most of that now used was built in the fifteenth century - surrounded by a landscape that cries out to be videoed. But what really struck me was the quality of the brickwork, some of it still laid, still pointed the way it was 1,500 years before we started counting our own calendar - but at a time when the Chinese had mastered a civilisation few at this end of the earth knew anything about. We were, of course, lucky. Charlie, the guide in Xian, was better than any I had ever experienced. He and the other guides provided by a London-based company, Cultural Tours, seemed to take their job seriously enough to be sure that no meal offered offended the people who had ordered a vegetarian diet. The diets were also there, without asking, on the internal Air China flights. What was more, people who had requested certain seating arrangements on the flight from Heathrow always got them on the internal flights, too. That was due to Cathie, the resident courier who seemed to be provided with a kind of inbuilt radar. Naturally, we did the things tourists are expected to do. The silk market in Beijing was full of such ridiculously cheap bargains - you can be asked the equivalent of \u00a330 for a pair of silk pyjamas and walk away having paid \u00a35.50 - that I, a confirmed market hater, loved it. I didn't love the Chinese opera nearly as much (except the English language surtitles explaining a disappointed wife's song to her husband, 'I know you'd rather go and play in the brothel') but I'm glad I went. The Chinese don't go to their operas themselves, at least not to the ones specialising in entertaining tourists. But you see them at all the historic sites. We went in a kind of assembly-line production, but we cherished it all. One minute, Tiananmen Square - minus any sign of what had happened in 1988 - the Chairman Mao mausoleum and the government buildings, the next the Forbidden City. I suppose I had expected that to be Forbidden to us, too. But it wasn't. We walked in the footsteps of the Ming emperors - and of Peter O'Toole, who had filmed the Oscar-winning The Last Emperor there with Bernardo Bertolucci. Then there were the Ming tombs - more treasures, each one more amazing than the one before. There were gold statues, beautiful jewellery, but what struck me was a crown used by some ancient empress - and very much like the one worn by the Dowager Empress in the movie. Walking with history - and with your trusty camcorder - is not just a holiday, it's an education. A country that has seen its share of propaganda has opened itself up to an unsuspecting Western world like the petals of a lotus flower.

      "body": "<p>On the afternoon of Friday 29 August 1997 a team from Special Branch acting on instructions from MI5 smashed into a flat in St George's Drive, Pimlico, owned by David Shayler and his girlfriend, Annie Machon, both former intelligence officers. In the three-day search that followed, the flat was ransacked for documents to incriminate Shayler, who had gone public in a Sunday newspaper a week earlier with his claims about MI5 incompetence. In the search, the police took away a handful of innocent papers. They also stripped the couple's sheets, which they confiscated along with a pair of Machon's knickers. But they overlooked a report Machon had written for a management consultancy, into personnel problems at MI5. </p> <p>Shayler has always claimed that he was merely attempting to highlight serious flaws in the way the intelligence services operate in Britain. The operation to find evidence in his own case seemed to prove his point. In the years since, however, the focus has shifted away from the substance of Shayler's claims and on to the reliability of the man himself. Until this month, even the interest of the media was drying up. In the year that followed his release, Shayler slipped out of the public eye, exiled in Paris, eking out a living as a journalist using his increasingly out-of-date knowledge of intelligence. He still lives with Annie, who acts as spokeswoman for 'Public Friend No 1', spending much of her time travelling between France and Britain, something which Shayler is unable to do. They live in a flat in Paris's comfortable 11th arrondisement , close to the Bastille. It is unlikely they are still surviving on the money received for the original Mail on Sunday article, around \u00a339,000, but Shayler has continued to work as a journalist, notably for Mohamed al-Fayed's Punch magazine, in which he writes a monthly column. Much of the life of the couple centres around the caf\u00e9s and restaurants near the Gare du Nord, where they meet lawyers and journalists for sometimes several lunch appointments a week. </p> <p>Both are French speakers - Shayler's degree was in French - but are nevertheless isolated and desperate to return to Britain. Machon, a Cambridge classics graduate, has remained a somewhat enigmatic figure: blonde, slim and extremely careful with her words, she could not be more different to her partner. Throughout the past three years, she has studiously avoided talking about her own experiences in intelligence. Apart from Tony Benn, no MP has publicly defended Shayler. This weekend one prominent Labour backbencher said that Shayler was his own worst enemy: 'He has become a media personality, always willing to appear on TV and get quoted in the papers and that does enormous damage to his credibility.' </p> <p>From the outset, Shayler has had an image problem. When he walked free from La Sant\u00e9 prison in France in November 1998 he claimed a victory for free speech and justice. He had successfully demonstrated to the satisfaction of the French courts that he was a whistleblower, not a traitor. All attempts by the British government to extradite him had been deemed politically motivated. Shayler felt he had been vindicated. As he left the prison his delight was captured by French photographer Jacques Brinon. This single photograph, which appeared on the front pages all over the world, probably did more for Her Majesty's Government's case than any previous smears about his unreliability and incompetence. It showed Shayler with his hands behind his head, eyes half closed and mouth wide, revealing the full extent of his double chin. With a Middlesbrough FC away strip visible under his jacket, he looked for all the world like a fat, stupid football yob. When the papers arrived on the desk of MI5 chief Stephen Lander the image staring out at him must have confirmed his beliefs that this was a man who was not 'one of us', who should never have been recruited in the first place. </p> <p>Shayler has been described variously as a ' born rebel', a 'blabbermouth' and a 'troublemaker'. The Foreign Secretary himself said that his talk of the involvement of British agents in a plot to kill Colonel Gadaffi of Libya was 'pure fantasy'. For his enemies , the combination of Shayler's appearance, his quickfire patter and an obsession with football, make him a distinctly dodgy geezer. But people who have met Shayler describe him as charming and amenable, and capable of inspiring a surprising amount of loyalty among friends and associates. The events of the past two weeks increasingly suggest that Shayler has been telling the truth from the beginning. An MI6 document posted on the Internet appeared to confirm there had been of a plot to kill the Libyan leader in early 1996 as Shayler had said. The suspicion that Shayler has highlighted serious wrongdoing by the intelligence services is given added credibility by the lengths to which the British state is prepared to go to silence him, including this weekend's news that the Government is taking out a civil action against him. </p> <p>David Shayler joined MI5 as part of a recruitment drive in the early Nineties to attract a new breed of non-public school, non-Oxbridge graduates who would shake up the moribund service. With the end of the Cold War, it was felt that MI5 had to shift the emphasis of its operations towards the very real threat from the IRA, Islamic fundamentalists and hostile regimes in the Middle East. A cryptic advert appeared in national newspapers in 1991 showing three empty chairs, with the catchline 'Godot Isn't Coming'. It read: 'If you have already achieved plenty, but now find yourself marking time, stuck in a rut and unable to progress, then it's time to act.' Shayler, who attended a Buckinghamshire grammar school and Dundee University, seemed the perfect candidate - bright, able, with experience of the real world, but without any traditional preconceptions of how an intelligence officer should behave. He even had a background in left-wing politics, campaigning for the miners during the 1984 strike, and as a student editor publishing extracts from Spycatcher , the memoirs of former MI5 agent Peter Wright, but even this did not exclude him from what he believed was a reformed service. </p> <p>According to Shayler, he and other officers of his generation soon became disillusioned with intelligence work. Most of it seemed to involve shuffling papers and getting official clearance for the endless MI5 phone taps on ordinary individuals. He became appalled by the level of surveillance of tiny extreme left groups, while the intelligence service was unable to stop terrorist acts by the IRA such as the bombings at Bishopsgate and Canary Wharf. Most seriously he was convinced that MI5 and MI6 agents often acted outside the rule of law, knowing they were unlikely to be punished. After raising his concerns with senior officers he, like many of his colleagues, left around the time the Labour government came to power in 1997 pledging to make the intelligence services more accountable. </p> <p>Tony Benn believes Shayler has raised important issues about the way MI5 and MI6 operate without any real control from Ministers or Parliament: 'If what he was saying was irrelevant and inaccurate they could easily dismiss it. What he is doing must be extremely unsettling to the secret services.' Benn, a Cabinet Minister in the Wilson government, added: 'What Shayler has demonstrated is that you can challenge the muddles and bungles of the intelligence services as long as you don't challenge their right to do it.' </p> <p>Others are less convinced. One former Tory Cabinet Minister told The Observer that he had it on good authority that Shayler 'got into the service by mistake', that there were distinct indications that Shayler had entered MI5 'with the specific object of finding embarrassing things and publishing them'. Shayler describes himself as 'almost autistic' in his memory for detail about the history of Middlesbrough football club, and admits to having a chip on his shoulder about the public school and Oxbridge types who dominated MI5 and MI6 while he was there. But opponents should not underestimate his chippiness and his memory for detail. It has served him very well so far. </p> <p><strong> David Shayler</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Born: </strong> Middlesbrough, 24 December 1965 </p> <p><strong> Girlfriend:</strong> Annie Machon </p> <p><strong> Studied: </strong> Grammar school, Buckinghamshire; Dundee University </p> <p><strong> Jobs: </strong> Sunday Times trainee (sacked); newspaper proprietor (launched student newspaper, the Paper) ; spy (resigned) </p> <p><strong> Lives:</strong> Paris, 11th arrondisement</p>",

So what does a female biographer make of him? </p> <p>Marion Meade has researched her subject thoroughly and, to the unbiased observer (which I am not - I love his films), this seems a meticulous and even-handed description of events. I suppose it is not her job to tell us her initial attitude or how it changed during the course of the project; perhaps it is sufficient to say that this was written without Allen's approval and without talking to him. </p> <p>Meade knows her biographical onions, having written five of them already, including those of Buster Keaton (no relation) and Eleanor of Aquitaine - surely the perfect preparation for writing the story of Woody and Mia. This one is as gripping as a detective novel. However, should the private life of an artist remain private and his or her work be judged on its merits alone? Do we want to know how pernickety he is about his food and about his showers and how he has treated his friends and lovers? Well, yes, probably. Will it change our opinion of his movies? No. </p> <p>The prologue tells of the day in 1992 when Farrow discovered those polaroids of her adopted daughter, resulting in Allen's hitherto cloudy domestic life coming under exceptional journalistic and legal scrutiny. Then Meade goes back to before the beginning, describing the refugees from Austria and Russia from whom Allan Stewart Konigsberg was descended, and brings us up to the present day. She has read every single word written about and by him, and interviewed a host of people but not his inner circle. </p> <p>There are plenty eager to slag him off (though sometimes off the record) and just as many keen to defend him, both as a man and as an artist. We actors all want to work for him. His work may not be everyone's cup of tea but his brew of witty stories of dysfunctional relationships is still enjoyed across the world. Indeed, a minor irritation is Meade's continual quoting of only 'domestic' (US/Canada) box-office figures for films to back up her argument of his perceived highs or lows and his apparent reliance on studios willing to lose money on his work. She admits that Annie Hall made $25 million at home initially but made $100m worldwide in the decade following, so why not let us have the full story on the others? </p> <p>She is merciless in exposing all the man's foibles as father, lover or employer. In Allen's case there will always be special interest in the off-camera drama, since he appears to use his own life as material and because some of the best roles in his movies have been written for and realised by his romantic partners. But reading of the time when his domestic life became international news and he was embroiled in an unedifying custody wrangle, one cannot but feel desperately sorry for all the children involved who must have endured such pain and confusion.</p> <p>I had no idea just how successful he had been as a stand-up - he was a big television star before moving into films. However, the transitions - from teenage newspaper gag writer to sketch writer to stand-up to screenwriter to comic movie director to his current auteur status - were never easy. The first time Allen faced an audience he bombed. Nine years later he was directing his first movie, Take The Money And Run. Early screenings were disastrous. After re-editing it became a hit, establishing his style and introducing the character of the 'nebbishy neurotic who would take his place alongside Chaplin's Little Tramp and Keaton's Great Stoneface'. </p> <p>His dissatisfaction with his own work is a constant theme. He was prepared to junk Manhattan entirely at one stage. His movies never come out as he imagined them (except perhaps The Purple Rose of Cairo). He feels that 'When you do comedy, you're not sitting at the grown-ups' table but at the children's table.' Comedy is somehow not worthy, certainly a view generally reflected by the Oscar voters - though he has won 12 nominations, equalling Billy Wilder. </p> <p>Now married to Soon-Yi, they have adopted a child. According to a paparazzo who has been around him for years, he has changed. 'He's settled. He jokes. He seems happy.' He is no longer in therapy. Mia Farrow has adopted yet more children. I would not disagree with Vincent Canby (chief film critic of the New York Times 1968-93) when he asks: 'Who else has written, acted in and directed his own films over such a length of time? In any discipline that kind of longevity would be mind-boggling. He has dominated the second half of the twentieth century.' </p> <p>We all have friends who make some choices in life with which we do not agree. They're still our friends - we just know them a little better. Woody's films are still my friends.</p>",

Do we want to know how pernickety he is about his food and about his showers and how he has treated his friends and lovers? Well, yes, probably. Will it change our opinion of his movies? No. The prologue tells of the day in 1992 when Farrow discovered those polaroids of her adopted daughter, resulting in Allen's hitherto cloudy domestic life coming under exceptional journalistic and legal scrutiny. Then Meade goes back to before the beginning, describing the refugees from Austria and Russia from whom Allan Stewart Konigsberg was descended, and brings us up to the present day. She has read every single word written about and by him, and interviewed a host of people but not his inner circle. There are plenty eager to slag him off (though sometimes off the record) and just as many keen to defend him, both as a man and as an artist. We actors all want to work for him. His work may not be everyone's cup of tea but his brew of witty stories of dysfunctional relationships is still enjoyed across the world. Indeed, a minor irritation is Meade's continual quoting of only 'domestic' (US/Canada) box-office figures for films to back up her argument of his perceived highs or lows and his apparent reliance on studios willing to lose money on his work. She admits that Annie Hall made $25 million at home initially but made $100m worldwide in the decade following, so why not let us have the full story on the others? She is merciless in exposing all the man's foibles as father, lover or employer. In Allen's case there will always be special interest in the off-camera drama, since he appears to use his own life as material and because some of the best roles in his movies have been written for and realised by his romantic partners. But reading of the time when his domestic life became international news and he was embroiled in an unedifying custody wrangle, one cannot but feel desperately sorry for all the children involved who must have endured such pain and confusion. I had no idea just how successful he had been as a stand-up - he was a big television star before moving into films. However, the transitions - from teenage newspaper gag writer to sketch writer to stand-up to screenwriter to comic movie director to his current auteur status - were never easy. The first time Allen faced an audience he bombed. Nine years later he was directing his first movie, Take The Money And Run. Early screenings were disastrous. After re-editing it became a hit, establishing his style and introducing the character of the 'nebbishy neurotic who would take his place alongside Chaplin's Little Tramp and Keaton's Great Stoneface'. His dissatisfaction with his own work is a constant theme. He was prepared to junk Manhattan entirely at one stage. His movies never come out as he imagined them (except perhaps The Purple Rose of Cairo). He feels that 'When you do comedy, you're not sitting at the grown-ups' table but at the children's table.' Comedy is somehow not worthy, certainly a view generally reflected by the Oscar voters - though he has won 12 nominations, equalling Billy Wilder. Now married to Soon-Yi, they have adopted a child. According to a paparazzo who has been around him for years, he has changed. 'He's settled. He jokes. He seems happy.' He is no longer in therapy. Mia Farrow has adopted yet more children. I would not disagree with Vincent Canby (chief film critic of the New York Times 1968-93) when he asks: 'Who else has written, acted in and directed his own films over such a length of time? In any discipline that kind of longevity would be mind-boggling. He has dominated the second half of the twentieth century.' We all have friends who make some choices in life with which we do not agree. They're still our friends - we just know them a little better. Woody's films are still my friends.",

      "body": "<p>Schools, says Ralph Tabberer, the new chief executive of the Teacher Training Agency, are the original knowledge business, and getting them right is the fundamental building stone of a 'knowledge economy' based on increasing individual and collective human capital. </p> <p>With 450,000 teachers currently in employment, schools are also the largest knowledge business. That makes the Government quango's role of staffing them with trained professionals vital. The agency must hang on to its market share as the country's largest graduate recruiter (30,000 a year) while consistently improving quality of intake and output and filling gaping holes in shortage subjects - maths, science and languages. </p> <p>'We have to approach this as a business,' says Tabberer. 'As a recruitment agency, we need to compete with the very best to raise the number of able graduates coming into the profession'. </p> <p>Competing with dot.coms and new media may seem daunting - particularly for someone without a personnel or marketing background. But Tabberer, a trained teacher and a former adviser at the Department for Education and Employment, insists that when he says 'there has never been a better time to enter teaching,' he is not just whistling to keep his spirits up. 'We really do have a cheerful story to tell,' he says. </p> <p>His optimism is based on a convergence of factors. First, 'a management revolution in schools which bears comparison with anything in the public sector'. English schools responsible for their own management now have more of their destiny in their own hands, and the best are run by excellent leaders. Ofsted says that teaching quality is going up - and pupil achievement with it. </p> <p>A second reason is the reforms to the teaching profession. These include performance-related pay - a controversial issue. But more important, says Tabberer, is the element that prospective entrants value most: prospects. Classroom teachers can now earn more without taking on management responsibilities, while a head can rise to the \u00a370,000 range. 'Golden hellos' of \u00a35,000 are on offer in shortage subjects. </p> <p>Third, these far-reaching internal reforms coincide with profound changes in work generally. People are more mobile both within and between professions, notes Tabberer, and teaching must evolve to take advantage of the trend. </p> <p>For people who have worked in the private sector, teaching offers the satisfaction of 'making a difference' and direct engagement with the young.

      "bodyText": "Schools, says Ralph Tabberer, the new chief executive of the Teacher Training Agency, are the original knowledge business, and getting them right is the fundamental building stone of a 'knowledge economy' based on increasing individual and collective human capital. With 450,000 teachers currently in employment, schools are also the largest knowledge business. That makes the Government quango's role of staffing them with trained professionals vital. The agency must hang on to its market share as the country's largest graduate recruiter (30,000 a year) while consistently improving quality of intake and output and filling gaping holes in shortage subjects - maths, science and languages. 'We have to approach this as a business,' says Tabberer. 'As a recruitment agency, we need to compete with the very best to raise the number of able graduates coming into the profession'. Competing with dot.coms and new media may seem daunting - particularly for someone without a personnel or marketing background. But Tabberer, a trained teacher and a former adviser at the Department for Education and Employment, insists that when he says 'there has never been a better time to enter teaching,' he is not just whistling to keep his spirits up. 'We really do have a cheerful story to tell,' he says. His optimism is based on a convergence of factors. First, 'a management revolution in schools which bears comparison with anything in the public sector'. English schools responsible for their own management now have more of their destiny in their own hands, and the best are run by excellent leaders. Ofsted says that teaching quality is going up - and pupil achievement with it. A second reason is the reforms to the teaching profession. These include performance-related pay - a controversial issue. But more important, says Tabberer, is the element that prospective entrants value most: prospects. Classroom teachers can now earn more without taking on management responsibilities, while a head can rise to the \u00a370,000 range. 'Golden hellos' of \u00a35,000 are on offer in shortage subjects. Third, these far-reaching internal reforms coincide with profound changes in work generally. People are more mobile both within and between professions, notes Tabberer, and teaching must evolve to take advantage of the trend. For people who have worked in the private sector, teaching offers the satisfaction of 'making a difference' and direct engagement with the young. But, Tabberer goes on: 'We also need to be attractive to 21-year-olds who aren't ready to make a life decision - who intend to teach for 10 years and then do something else - although once we have them we do hope to keep them.' Meanwhile, the leadership, presentation and interpersonal skills that teach ing develops are in demand in other professions, although teaching's image may need improvement before it proves a popular recruiting ground. The changing employment landscape demands big changes in TTA priorities. Having survived its first five-year review (and some heavy criticism last year for failing to meet recruitment targets), the agency has seen its remit trimmed to the twin objectives of recruiting teachers and seeing they are trained to the highest standards. In the first case that involves more than nifty ad campaigns. (Despite sniffy reactions from some teachers, the 'You always remember a good teacher' series provoked a flood of enquiries, he says.) It means increasing the conversion ratio at every stage of the process of forming a teacher, from initial enquiry to the end of the induction year. On the training front, the priority is to 'listen to the voice of the prospective teacher' and smooth the way for every type of entrant, from the postgraduate taking the normal route to those adopt ing a second career. 'This is all about modularity - tailoring courses to the individual - and lifelong learning,' Tabberer says. The agency also has specific targets to attract more teachers from ethnic minorities, and more men. He is satisfied that the agency now has the tools for the job (not to mention the measurements to see if it is succeeding); therefore it must deliver. Is he right to be optimistic? Not everyone is sure. One high-flying deputy head, a recruit from industry, entirely agrees that at a personal level teaching offers powerful satisfactions - its biggest plus.

Barclays and others are unlikely to be happy with this, but they may have to swallow it, especially since Cruickshank is adamant that 30p is all it really costs to deliver the folding stuff through the hole in the wall.

It was a scenario first suggested here last August (OK, so it has taken a while) and made inevitable by the irritation of Ministers over inquiries launched, or sometimes not launched, by the OFT. </p> <p>While it's always nice to see someone out of step with the Blairites, it was easy to see why Bridgeman had to go: he wasn't delivering the results that made consumers beam, and he spent a lot of time nosing around in unimportant frivolities such as selling football matches via TV to punters. </p> <p>Who could be our new champion of fair trade?
