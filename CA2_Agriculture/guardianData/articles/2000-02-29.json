Subs: Cudicini, Sutton, Di Matteo, Ambrosetti, Morris, Lambourde, Thome.<br></p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> After a brief hibernation, the Champions' League Second Phase resumes with Chelsea visiting a fragile Marseille side. Chelsea have named an attacking eleven with Poyet, Flo and Zola all starting.<br><strong>2</strong> Chelsea, after a positive start, are still asleep defensively. Bakayoko beats Harley with ease on the right and his cross is struck low towards Pouget. The Marseille forward had pulled well away from Leboeuf, but could only scuff his shot wide of De Goey's goal. A great chance and the home side should be one-up.<br><strong>5</strong> After their defensive lapse, Chelsea have settled into their rhythm well. Flo in particular looks very comfortable. The Norwegian international turns Blondeau inside-out on the left before thrashing the ball into the side netting from 15 yards as Zola waited on the penalty-spot.<br><strong>7</strong> Harley has his first chance to overlap and appears to relish the 'challenge' of Blondeau. The young Englishman beats the right-wing back with ease before delivering a cross to Flo at the far post. His nod-down is towards Zola, who shapes to hit a waist-high volley goalwards. His balance and shape are a little off and as a result his shot is too. Goal kick.<br><strong>12</strong> Free kick to Chelsea just inside their own half and everyone pushes up. The ball in is poorly hit but as the ball is cleared Flo is fouled on the centre-right 30 yards from goal.<br><strong>13</strong> It's Zola to take but his effort disappears straight into the wall. The rebound drops to Leboeuf, but his shot is charged down and the home side can break upfield.<br><strong>16 GOAL Marseille 1 - 0 Chelsea</strong> Well that's a surprise. Pires with some space and time on the right, decides against the cross and cuts into De Goey's box. Spotting the Chelsea keeper a little distance away from his near post, he puts his head down and hits a perfect drive that clips the near post then shoots into the net off the far post. Silence reigns as even the home crowd can't believe this Goal of the Unexpected.<br><strong>19</strong> Flo finds half a yard on Luccin in a central position just outside the Marseille area. He tries his luck with his left foot but Trevisan covers well and palms the low shot wide of his right-hand post.<br><strong>22</strong> Chelsea keep possession well as Flo and Zola exchange crosses on from first the left, then the right. Eventually Trevisan comes and claims one. Some encouragement for Chelsea as they seem to be able to get behind the Marseille defence with ease.<br><strong>25</strong> Bakayoko conducts an attack with his back to the goal and his feet just outside the middle of the Chelsea box. After much interplay, he finally receives and tries to turn, only to be met by a strong challenge from Desailly which leaves him requiring some attention off the pitch.<br><strong>27</strong> De Goey will be thanking Harley after a timely block. A low square ball from Dalmat on the left scoots behind a retreating Chelsea back four, to be met by a thunderous drive by goalscorer Pires. His shot is deflected by a desperate lunge from Harley. Marseille win a corner and Chelsea manage to clear.<br><strong>30</strong> Chelsea on the rack as Pires, Bakayoko and Pouget combine with a succession of short passes. Pouget eventually latches onto a flicked header from Bakayoko and it's only a last-ditch challenge from Desailly that denies him a shot at De Goey.<br><strong>34</strong> Pires nutmegs Desailly and so big Marcel bundles him over. Nothing comes of the free kick.<br><strong>38</strong> Chelsea are simply being outplayed in every department, especially by the magnificent Pires on the Marseille right, who is really enjoying making Desailly's night as long and as miserable as possible. Dennis Wise has been virtually anonymous this half.<br><strong>41</strong> Again Flo finds some space on the right thanks to a searching pass from Petrescu. Poyet chests down to Zola outside of the Marseille area on the left. His volley is powerful but always rising. Goal kick.<br><strong>42</strong> More Chelsea pressure results in a free-kick on the left, about 45 yards out. Zola takes and his high, inswinging cross to the far post evades Flo, Desailly and Trevisan before going out of play just outside the keeper's left-hand post.<br><strong>46</strong> The referee brings a great half for the home side to a close. At this point Chelsea will do well to earn a draw, but Marseille look very capable of adding to their tally in the second half.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Chelsea restart the match after some 'motivational' words from Graham Rix and Ray Wilkins. Vialli has to call the shots via a mobile phone from the stand as he serves his touchline suspension from a previous game.<br><strong>46</strong> Marseille are up and at Chelsea straight away, again with Pires on the right making it to the byline and whipping in a low cross that De Goey does well to smother at the feet of Bakayoko.<br><strong>48</strong> Another foul from Desailly on Pires, this time flush on the right-wing touchline. The centre is cleared, but Chelsea lose possession and then concede a corner. The visitors clear, but surrender possession yet again. Finally De Goey hoofs it 70 yards upfield.<br><strong>51</strong> Pouget, Pires and Bakayoko combine again to slice apart this Chelsea defence with short, simple passes and excellent running off the ball. Bakayoko drifts into right the Chelsea area, lays it off to Pires who crosses to the far post where Pouget rises to head wide of De Goey's left post. Chelsea are doing well just to deny Marseille a second goal.<br><strong>55</strong> The seemingly tireless Leroy dispossesses Deschamps just 35 yards away from the Chelsea goal in a central position. The young Marseille player knows exactly where the goal is and launches one, but Desailly gains enough ground in the last moments to deflect Leroy's powerful shot.<br><strong>58</strong> Chelsea seem to be making small inroads into the home team's domination of this game. Dennis Wise has drifted out to the right and is finding more time and space. His centre this time is overhit and the Chelsea forwards trudge back and assume the position.<br><strong>60</strong> Wise pops up as a forward, running onto a pass from Flo. Abardonado shields the ball from the England midfielder, and as Wise is in mid-tumble the referee is already signalling play on.<br><strong>61 Chelsea substitution:</strong> Di Matteo for Deschamps.<br><strong>64</strong> Desailly has suffered a gash on his left leg and may not last much longer. The Chelsea defence looks easy to penetrate - Bakayoko muscles his way past Leboeuf and Desailly and plays in Pouget on the right. The Marseille forward lashes the ball past De Goey and high into the net, but the verdict is offside. <br><strong>67</strong> Some time and space for Wise in central midfield and he uses it well, chipping the ball up to Flo on the centre-left edge of the Marseille area. His first touch is to chest the ball up, and his second touch is an ill-judged volley high into the night sky. A half-chance, at best.<br><strong>70</strong> Blondeau's confidence has increased exponentially since beginning of the match. now he feels up to spearheading a dangerous-looking counterattack on the right. His cross is overhit and straight at De Goey.<br><strong>72 Marseille substitution:</strong> De La Pena for Pouget.<br><strong>74</strong> Chelsea, to their credit, are pressing further and further forward whilst still trying to pass the ball into attacking positions. The move breaks down between Wise and Zola and Marseille break quickly down the right with Bakayoko. Chelsea concede a corner.<br><strong>76</strong> The set-piece is well cleared by Leboeuf and falls to Zola. The diminutive Italian runs 60 yards but his final ball is weak and the home side can clear, but only as far as Di Matteo. His shot from the centre-right is scuffed and trickles off for a goal kick.<br><strong>79</strong> An excellent run from Dalmat on the left brings the crowd to its feet. His attempted cross with his left foot from the byline is blocked by Leboeuf, but the rebound falls back at the feet of Dalmat, who hits a low, curling drive just wide of the far post.<br><strong>81 Chelsea substitution:</strong> Morris for Ferrer; Sutton for Flo.<br><strong>83</strong> Sutton controls well inside the left of the Marseille box. He lays off to Zola, who cannot hit the ball as hard as he wants. Trevisan sees it late but saves well. Sutton is already proving to be more of a handful for the Marseille defence than the departed Flo.<br><strong>86</strong> A small confrontation on the pitch as Chelsea go close. Sutton is played in by an excellent flick from Morris on the right. Sutton's shot is well saved by Trevisan and the keeper recovers well to smother the rebound at Morris' feet. Some of the home side didn't like Sutton's challenge on their keeper and tell him about it. He disagrees and tells them about it. It takes five Chelsea players and the ref. to halt the debate.<br><strong>89 Marseille substitution:</strong> Moses for Bakayoko.<br><strong>90</strong> Dennis Wise is belatedly making things happen on the right. The Chelsea captain wins a corner which Poyet meets with a bullet header from 10 yards and somehow Trevisan turns it outside his left-hand post. The second corner is the keeper's as soon as it's kicked. Four minutes of added on time to go.<br><strong>93</strong> Chelsea launch long-ball after long-ball but to no avail as the home back four stand firm. The ball eventually makes its way out to Zola on the left, but his cross is too close to Trevisan, who collects despite having Dennis Wise launch himself at his chest at the precise moment the ball meets his gloves.<br><strong>94</strong> Full time: Marseille 1 - 0 Chelsea.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Fifa, the world game's governing body, admitted for the first time yesterday that there is nothing to stop national federations from paying clubs for releasing their players for international duty. </p> <p>Its general secretary Michel Zen Ruffinen, speaking here at a Football Expo debate on players' wages, commented that there is nothing in the regulations to prevent the Football Association and other national federations from compensating clubs whenever players are called up, a scenario that is bound to inflame the build-up to Euro 2000. </p> <p>Zen Ruffinen was replying to a statement by the chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association Gordon Taylor that the English FA had always resisted paying compensation as it is not permitted to do so. \"Such a regulation does not exist,\" said Zen Ruffinen. \"In fact it has never existed.\" </p> <p>The general secretary said the world body was now prepared to debate the issue following informal talks with the so-called G14 group, an inde pendent body comprising Europe's most influential clubs, so long as one or more national federation makes an official approach.

      "bodyText": "Fifa, the world game's governing body, admitted for the first time yesterday that there is nothing to stop national federations from paying clubs for releasing their players for international duty. Its general secretary Michel Zen Ruffinen, speaking here at a Football Expo debate on players' wages, commented that there is nothing in the regulations to prevent the Football Association and other national federations from compensating clubs whenever players are called up, a scenario that is bound to inflame the build-up to Euro 2000. Zen Ruffinen was replying to a statement by the chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association Gordon Taylor that the English FA had always resisted paying compensation as it is not permitted to do so. \"Such a regulation does not exist,\" said Zen Ruffinen. \"In fact it has never existed.\" The general secretary said the world body was now prepared to debate the issue following informal talks with the so-called G14 group, an inde pendent body comprising Europe's most influential clubs, so long as one or more national federation makes an official approach. Taylor welcomed the apparent change of heart, describing it as a \"watershed\". \"It has always been said by the FA that they could not do a deal with the clubs because it was not allowed,\" Taylor said at the end of the first day of this annual forum for the sport's movers and shakers. \"This is a very significant change.\" In recent weeks leading clubs have intensified their opposition to releasing players for international duty, especially friendly matches.

It's becoming critical.\" He acknowledged, however, that not all federations were as wealthy as England, Germany and Italy, and said that to get developing countries to pay compensation may be impossible. \"If they find there is nothing left in the pot how are they expected to look after the grass roots?

      "body": "<p>Alan Shearer, by choosing the manner of his retirement from international football, has invited fresh carping from critics who, as his performances have waned, have been increasingly irritated by his unsullied reputation. The charge of selfishness intensified yesterday as he rationalised his decision to retire as an England player after the European championship this summer. </p> <p>Shearer, his detractors raged, is a man who wants everything on his own terms, a player whose overriding self-interest in naming the date of his England retirement has left Kevin Keegan in an invidious position, a fading national icon who in reality is as pure as the driven slush. </p> <p>It was little wonder, therefore, that Shearer chose to expand on his decision yesterday not in a suspicious England environment but at Newcastle United's training ground in Chester-le-Street. Here the affection for him remains unqualified. \"Kick a guy enough and he'll decide he's had enough,\" said one Geordie fan yesterday. Many in the north-east feel the same. </p> <p>Shearer's loyalties to Newcastle have always been equally strong. \"I love this football club,\" he said. \"Hopefully Newcastle will benefit from this decision. I might not play in the next World Cup but maybe I can win an FA Cup final for Newcastle United. </p> <p>\"If I am to play my best for the next four years then I need to pace myself and that means having a summer break. Over the past 10 years I have been playing 11 months a year; I've never had more than three weeks off. I'm not complaining, because that is a measure of the success I have had, but it can't go on for ever. </p> <p>\"I want to stay sharp, fit and strong, both physically and mentally. I don't want anyone else telling me I am slowing down. I want to do it my way and I have done that.\" </p> <p>When Shearer began to contemplate international retirement last October his clash of personalities with Rudd Gullit remained fresh in the mind and his rejuvenation under Bobby Robson had barely begun. Since then family matters have strengthened his resolve; his wife, Lainya, is expecting their third child in September. </p> <p>His England career had lately been driven more by professional dedication and personal ambition than by any sense of passion.

      "bodyText": "Alan Shearer, by choosing the manner of his retirement from international football, has invited fresh carping from critics who, as his performances have waned, have been increasingly irritated by his unsullied reputation. The charge of selfishness intensified yesterday as he rationalised his decision to retire as an England player after the European championship this summer. Shearer, his detractors raged, is a man who wants everything on his own terms, a player whose overriding self-interest in naming the date of his England retirement has left Kevin Keegan in an invidious position, a fading national icon who in reality is as pure as the driven slush. It was little wonder, therefore, that Shearer chose to expand on his decision yesterday not in a suspicious England environment but at Newcastle United's training ground in Chester-le-Street. Here the affection for him remains unqualified. \"Kick a guy enough and he'll decide he's had enough,\" said one Geordie fan yesterday. Many in the north-east feel the same. Shearer's loyalties to Newcastle have always been equally strong. \"I love this football club,\" he said. \"Hopefully Newcastle will benefit from this decision. I might not play in the next World Cup but maybe I can win an FA Cup final for Newcastle United. \"If I am to play my best for the next four years then I need to pace myself and that means having a summer break. Over the past 10 years I have been playing 11 months a year; I've never had more than three weeks off. I'm not complaining, because that is a measure of the success I have had, but it can't go on for ever. \"I want to stay sharp, fit and strong, both physically and mentally. I don't want anyone else telling me I am slowing down. I want to do it my way and I have done that.\" When Shearer began to contemplate international retirement last October his clash of personalities with Rudd Gullit remained fresh in the mind and his rejuvenation under Bobby Robson had barely begun. Since then family matters have strengthened his resolve; his wife, Lainya, is expecting their third child in September. His England career had lately been driven more by professional dedication and personal ambition than by any sense of passion. Too often, for supporters and players alike, England exists as a cluster of prejudices and affiliations. As his England stature declined, accusations of self-interest fuelled the abuse and denunciation that he now routinely endures on virtually every Premiership ground outside St James' Park. In the derisive world of English football it is only a short journey from favourite to favouritism. When they could not even find the energy to boo him at Hillsborough on Saturday it became clear that Sheffield Wednesday had accepted the inevitability of relegation. He insists this malign atmosphere has not influenced his decision, as anyone so strong-willed and single-minded must - \"I use it as a spur; they don't boo bad players\" - but, had England given one of its finest servants of the past decade the respect and affinity he deserves, the decision would have been much harder to make. Shearer's determination to decide his own future arises, in reality, not so much from selfishness as self-esteem. And that is the stuff that separates a good sportsman from an ordinary one, that supplies the fortitude to survive the bad times. Why expect a player whose prime assets have included an ordered mind, a shrewd intent and a sense of empowerment not to map out his own future with the same rationale? Shearer has expressed a willingness to play for England after Euro 2000 \"in an emergency\" - less a sign of vacillation than an attempt to avoid further charges of selfishness. He has not planned his retirement so fastidiously in a scheming attempt to align himself as Robson's managerial successor at Newcastle United or to wrest control from Keegan's hands. He has done it now because he has too much self-respect to allow a voracious media to determine when he goes. The predictable sound of baying is from a pack that has been denied its kill.",

They married off her older sister aged 15, having decided to use their scarce resources for their son's education at the expense of their daughters'. Shalina used to worry about lessons and tests, but she worries much more about having to get married and bear children while still a child herself. Shalina used to dream about being a doctor, but now faces a life of cleaning houses during the day and tutoring younger children at night. Shalina now wishes she were a boy. </p> <p>Shalina and millions of her peers are denied something many of us take for granted. They are denied a fundamental human right spelled out in international instruments their governments have signed on to - such as the universal declaration of human rights and the convention on the rights of the child - the right to education. It is often said that education empowers girls by building up their confidence and enabling them to make informed decisions about their lives. For most of the world's girls, that means not being forced into a marriage while in your teens because you have no other choice; it is about managing pregnancies so that they do not threaten your health, your life or your livelihood; about seeking and obtaining medical care for your children and yourself when you need it; about child care and nutrition; about ensuring that your children attend at least primary school. </p> <p>It is about being able to earn an income when women before you earned none; about knowing and enjoying rights which women before you never knew they had; about educating your children to do the same, and their children after them. It is about bringing to a close a previously never-ending spiral of poverty and powerlessness. It is, in short, about ensuring a decent life for an entire generation and succeeding generations. </p> <p>Education is, quite simply, an investment that yields a higher profit than any other. It is what makes possible the development of entire communities, countries and continents. It is the most effective form of defence spending there is. </p> <p>So why are so many millions of girls denied it? In many societies, women are systematically marginalised; and yet, when catastrophe strikes - whether it be in the form of illness, conflict or hardship - they bear the biggest burden. Nothing illustrates this more amply than the impact of HIV/Aids. Girls are most likely to care for a sick family member and help manage the household. Prevented from going to school, they are denied information about how to protect themselves against the virus. Deprived of an education, they risk being forced into early sexual relations with older men or into prostitution, and thereby becoming infected. They pay many times over the deadly price of not going to school. </p> <p>If we are to change this cruel and unjust state of affairs, we need to do more than build new classrooms. We need to remove the constraints that lead parents to keep their daughters out of school. And once girls are in school, we must ensure that school prepares them for life, by developing curricula, textbooks and teaching attitudes that emphasize the life skills they will need. But societies must first recognise that educating girls is not an option; it is a necessity. </p> <p>In the Middle East, a few countries have already eliminated the gender gap in primary schooling. Others in the region have come to recognise the need to educate girls, if only to ensure they have a better-trained and qualified labour force. </p> <p>Some African countries, too, have made progress in reducing gender bias. Malawi has cut the direct costs of schooling by eliminating school fees and abolishing compulsory uniforms. Guinea has reduced the domestic burdens of girls, by digging wells and providing mechanical mills. It has introduced regulations to ensure that boys and girls share chores in school, and legislation that makes it illegal to force girls to marry before they have completed nine years of school. </p> <p>These are welcome examples. But they are not nearly enough. The world needs a coordinated strategy on the scale of the challenge. We need all those with the power to change things to come together in an alliance for girls' education: governments, voluntary progressive groups and above all, local communities, schools and families. That is why this spring, the United Nations is launching a new global initiative to educate girls. </p> <p>The 12th century Arab philosopher Ibn Rushd declared that \"a society which enslaves its women is a society doomed to decay\".

In rural Egypt, most are girls. </p> <p>Manal's story is typical of many girls in the poor areas of Egypt, which experts describe as pockets of resistance to the government's campaign for universal education. </p> <p>According to Adolescents and Social Change in Egypt, a survey by the independent New York-based Population Council, school enrolment among girls has been increasing by about 1.25% a year.

Her school, a two-storey house on a dusty footpath in the middle of the village, is run by the Salama Moussa project, which provides basic education for children between nine and 13 who were never sent to school. In rural Egypt, most are girls. Manal's story is typical of many girls in the poor areas of Egypt, which experts describe as pockets of resistance to the government's campaign for universal education. According to Adolescents and Social Change in Egypt, a survey by the independent New York-based Population Council, school enrolment among girls has been increasing by about 1.25% a year. But there is a gap of about 10 percentage points between the enrolment of boys and girls. This gap is most evident in Upper Egypt, the provinces south of Cairo, where the study says there are 71 girls per 100 boys enrolled in primary school (6-10 years of age), 64 per 100 in preparatory school (11-13 years of age) and 51 per 100 in secondary school.

To make ends meet and stretch his salary to around \u00a395 a week, Mr Cabezas has to take on two teaching jobs, starting the first at crack of dawn and finishing the second long after sunset. It does not leave much time for his young family. While the children in his charge are lively and anxious to learn, they are doing so, he says, against great odds. </p> <p>\"There is a lot of delinquency round here,\" Mr Cabezas says. \"Many of the parents are illiterate or have problems with drugs.\" The current state of Mexico's economy means that there is little money available for repairing and equipping schools; classes are held in small brick rooms. </p> <p>Another teacher, Felipe Mercado - who also works in two different schools and has to travel across this city of 23m people to complete his second stretch of the day - says that one of the greatest problems is trying to persuade children that there is a point to an education when many who study hard and earn qualifications end up unable to find work, competing as they are with the 10% of the population who attend private schools. </p> <p>The differences are multiplied in parts of Mexico with large indigenous populations. The index for educational deprivation - lack of facilities, schools, opportunities - is 20 times higher in areas where the indigenous population is more than 70% than it is in Mexico City. Illiteracy rates for indigenous people are five times the national average. </p> <p>But if it is hard for all the children in the poorer parts of both urban and rural Mexico to achieve their potential, for girls in the education system the problem is magnified. In the last major survey of illiteracy, eight of every 100 men could not read or write; for women, the figure was 13. </p> <p>\"This is still a very macho society,\" says Malu Valenzuela of GEM (Grupo de Educacion Popular con Mujeres), an organisation campaigning to promote women in education. While girls do better than the boys at primary level, she says, they fall away afterwards for a variety of reasons. </p> <p>Although 97% of Mexican children enter the primary school system, the drop-out rates thereafter are high and with more and more women entering the workforce - around 35% now - there is a greater need for someone to look after the small children; this usually means an older sister. </p> <p>Officially, boys and girls are treated equally within the system, she says, but in fact, from an early age the girls find themselves standing very much second in line. To try to counter this, GEM has been distributing hundreds of copies of a special card game, The Game of Possibilities, it has devised to get children to challenge the stereotypes of men and women in Mexican society. </p> <p>Gabriela Delgado, the director of Promujer, an organisation set up by the Mexico City government to advance the rights of women, said that while officially girls might receive the same education as boys in the capital, they had cultural and economic factors against them in that it was still traditional for men to be regarded as the main wage-earners. In a staunchly Catholic country, girls too often found themselves pregnant very young and having to leave school early. </p> <p>\"Women still don't have the same opportunities as men,\" she said. But she added that serious attempts were being made to encourage girls to see wider prospects for themselves in education. New textbooks were introduced nationally in 1996 to try to break the stereotypical view of girls as simply deferential, caring mothers. Things are gradually changing: while in 1980, women made up only 37% of students studying the sciences, this has risen to about 45%. </p> <p>Mexican education has always been a sharper political topic than in most other countries in the world: in 1933 President Abelardo Rodriguez enacted a constitutional reform that made public education \"socialistic,\" which at the time meant that it was to be secular and rational as opposed to religious. </p> <p>In a recent opinion poll asking people who were the most respected and least respected professions in the country, the results put politicians, police officers and journalists at the bottom while the top three were doctors, priests and - teachers.

But Khurty's dream offers a rare glimmer of fantasy among those of her friends squatting in a shady corner of the playground. The rest of these girls have more serviceable expectations. One wants to be a teacher, another a doctor, a third an engineer like her father. </p> <p>Since Mauritius introduced free education in 1977, girls have enjoyed increasing equality of opportunity in the island's education system, as families were no longer forced to concentrate their resources on the male children they believed would benefit more from schooling. </p> <p>The Mauritian population is now highly literate (97% according to the most recent figures). At primary level, there is almost 100% enrolment, while at secondary level - where enrolment hovers around 60% - the gender difference is negligible. But a competitive scholastic environment, coupled with the demands of a growing economy, have created other concerns. </p> <p>\"The problem now is that every parent wants their child to be a high-flyer,\" says Kurty's head teacher, Kamla Bansoodeb. She insists that there is no difference in performance between girls and boys at Sir Veerasamy Rangadoo government school, in Quatre Bornes, a suburb of the capital city Port Louis. </p> <p>\"In the past in Asian households, girls weren't encouraged to get an education, but now that doesn't happen so much. We have a mixture of children here, and we don't differentiate between the child of a maidservant and the child of an office worker. All are ambitious to get into the top secondary colleges, and then go on to tertiary education.\" </p> <p>Khurty and her friends are studying for their certificate of primary education (CPE) examinations. At the end of the primary cycle, there is a desperate scramble for places in good secondary schools, commonly referred to as \"star schools\". Only the top 4,000 out of 30,000 who take part in the CPE exams are admitted to the best schools on the basis of the rank they attain. </p> <p>Inevitably, many parents are turning to private tuition to boost their children's chances, putting added pressure on the young. </p> <p>\"It used to be the case that lower income families preferred their children to fail the CPE so that they could send them out to work,\" says Ms Bansoodeb. \"But now the law says that children can't work until they reach the age of 15.\" </p> <p>There is no safety net for the 30% of schoolchildren who fail the CPE. Vocational training is limited, and there is growing concern that these chidlren will be roaming the street or being employed illegally. </p> <p>At Stanley government school in the neighbouring suburb of Rose Hill, the head teacher, Kailashandra Rajcoomar, is similarly adamant that no gender difference exists in the classroom. Stanley has been identified as a \"project school\" under a scheme that was started in 1994 to provide problem schools with special grants, extra teacher training and counselling sessions for parents and children. </p> <p>\"There is no difference between boys and girls. That idea vanished a long time ago. They are equal throughout primary and secondary education. Girls want to get a good education and to go out to work, in white-collar jobs rather than agriculture.\" Like Kamla Bansoodeb, Mr Rajcoomar relies heavily on parental involvement. \"Many of our children come from broken families. They grow up in poverty, their parents have alcohol or drug problems, many are illiterate, and we have children who don't want to learn because they aren't disciplined at home. We spend a lot of time talking to parents, encouraging them to send their children to school.\" </p> <p>As more and more girls enter education, and stay in it for longer, there has been a resultant surge in women entering the labour force, especially the island's thriving textile industry. Mauritius currently ranks first among sub-Saharan countries according to the Gender Related Development Index published by the UN Development Programme, which measures gender disparities in life expectancy, educational attainment and income. </p> <p>But as job opportunities open up for them, working women's burdens have grown. They remain largely responsible for household chores and there are concerns that the younger generation is not psychologically equipped to cope with the increased freedom that economic independence brings. </p> <p>The education minister, Kadress Pillay, points to the recently released results of the higher school certificate, taken at the end of secondary school, in which girls enjoyed a 75% pass rate, compared with 70% for boys. \"It is still a very conservative society, highly Indianised, but it is fairly liberal from an educational point of view. </p> <p>\"We're far from the situation where a 16-year-old girl can have her own life, but the mentality is changing. The judiciary is now female-dominated, and it's an evolutionary process that we need to encourage. </p> <p>\"In a society that is changing so quickly, I believe less in skills and knowledge that will become obsolete and more in values and perennial knowledge - the capacity to understand others in a mixed culture, to be broad-minded, to think creatively and critically.\" </p> <p>The education system is still highly elitist, he says. \"We create a few captains of industry and leave the rest to work in their factories. Society is highly classified, and the whole purpose of an education system should be to reduce the gap between rich and poor. The only way to create a balanced society is to create a balanced individual. Who is the nation if not the individual? That's why education is the driving force.\" </p>",

But a competitive scholastic environment, coupled with the demands of a growing economy, have created other concerns. \"The problem now is that every parent wants their child to be a high-flyer,\" says Kurty's head teacher, Kamla Bansoodeb. She insists that there is no difference in performance between girls and boys at Sir Veerasamy Rangadoo government school, in Quatre Bornes, a suburb of the capital city Port Louis. \"In the past in Asian households, girls weren't encouraged to get an education, but now that doesn't happen so much. We have a mixture of children here, and we don't differentiate between the child of a maidservant and the child of an office worker. All are ambitious to get into the top secondary colleges, and then go on to tertiary education.\" Khurty and her friends are studying for their certificate of primary education (CPE) examinations. At the end of the primary cycle, there is a desperate scramble for places in good secondary schools, commonly referred to as \"star schools\". Only the top 4,000 out of 30,000 who take part in the CPE exams are admitted to the best schools on the basis of the rank they attain. Inevitably, many parents are turning to private tuition to boost their children's chances, putting added pressure on the young. \"It used to be the case that lower income families preferred their children to fail the CPE so that they could send them out to work,\" says Ms Bansoodeb. \"But now the law says that children can't work until they reach the age of 15.\" There is no safety net for the 30% of schoolchildren who fail the CPE. Vocational training is limited, and there is growing concern that these chidlren will be roaming the street or being employed illegally. At Stanley government school in the neighbouring suburb of Rose Hill, the head teacher, Kailashandra Rajcoomar, is similarly adamant that no gender difference exists in the classroom. Stanley has been identified as a \"project school\" under a scheme that was started in 1994 to provide problem schools with special grants, extra teacher training and counselling sessions for parents and children. \"There is no difference between boys and girls. That idea vanished a long time ago. They are equal throughout primary and secondary education. Girls want to get a good education and to go out to work, in white-collar jobs rather than agriculture.\" Like Kamla Bansoodeb, Mr Rajcoomar relies heavily on parental involvement. \"Many of our children come from broken families. They grow up in poverty, their parents have alcohol or drug problems, many are illiterate, and we have children who don't want to learn because they aren't disciplined at home. We spend a lot of time talking to parents, encouraging them to send their children to school.\" As more and more girls enter education, and stay in it for longer, there has been a resultant surge in women entering the labour force, especially the island's thriving textile industry. Mauritius currently ranks first among sub-Saharan countries according to the Gender Related Development Index published by the UN Development Programme, which measures gender disparities in life expectancy, educational attainment and income. But as job opportunities open up for them, working women's burdens have grown. They remain largely responsible for household chores and there are concerns that the younger generation is not psychologically equipped to cope with the increased freedom that economic independence brings. The education minister, Kadress Pillay, points to the recently released results of the higher school certificate, taken at the end of secondary school, in which girls enjoyed a 75% pass rate, compared with 70% for boys. \"It is still a very conservative society, highly Indianised, but it is fairly liberal from an educational point of view. \"We're far from the situation where a 16-year-old girl can have her own life, but the mentality is changing. The judiciary is now female-dominated, and it's an evolutionary process that we need to encourage. \"In a society that is changing so quickly, I believe less in skills and knowledge that will become obsolete and more in values and perennial knowledge - the capacity to understand others in a mixed culture, to be broad-minded, to think creatively and critically.\" The education system is still highly elitist, he says. \"We create a few captains of industry and leave the rest to work in their factories. Society is highly classified, and the whole purpose of an education system should be to reduce the gap between rich and poor. The only way to create a balanced society is to create a balanced individual. Who is the nation if not the individual? That's why education is the driving force.\"",

      "bodyText": "The news organisation ITN yesterday denied fabricating images of Muslim refugees in a Bosnian detention camp during its coverage of the Balkan conflict. The accusation, published in Living Marxism magazine, had been \"highly damaging\" to ITN, its lawyers told the high court in London. Living Marxism is being sued by ITN and two reporters over an article titled The picture that fooled the world, which questioned the credibility of a 1992 report from two camps run by Bosnian Serbs. Footage from the camps at Trnopolje and Omarska, which were at the centre of persistent allegations of torture and executions, captured world attention and prompted numerous commentators, including the US president, George Bush, to liken the scenes to those seen in Nazi death camps. At the centre of the case is the image of an emaciated Bosnian Muslim prisoner, Fikret Alic, who was seen standing behind a barbed wire fence at the Trnopolje camp. ITN says Living Marxism's February 1997 article, written by a German journalist, Thomas Deichmann, was wrong to claim that the image was created by \"camera angles and editing\" and that there was no barbed wire fence surrounding the camp. Tom Shields QC, for ITN, said the criticism of the broadcasts and the journalists involved had been a \"highly damaging attack upon their respective reputations and professional integrity\". The libel case, due to last three weeks, is expected to have far-reaching implications for the credibility of news coverage around the world. ITN and two reporters, Penny Marshall and Ian Williams, are claiming damages from the magazine's editor, Michael Hume, and its publishers over the article, an editorial and a press release. The magazine denies libel and pleads justification. The judge, Mr Justice Morland, and the jury were shown several hours of unedited footage shot in Bosnia in August 1992, as well as the final bulletins which were broadcast that month. Mr Shields told the jury of 10 men and two women: \"You will see footage of the appalling physical conditions of some of those men, of the armed guards who were there, and you will also see how all those who visited both those camps were shocked by what they saw. \"Among the sights to greet them was that of an emaciated man stripped to the waist in the heat, standing behind barbed wire.\" The footage showed Ms Marshall and Mr Williams - who were accompanied by an armed Serb escort - visiting the detention camps in an attempt to verify allegations that Bosnian Serbs were interning Bosnian Muslims in concentration camps. The journalists, who had been invited by the Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to see the camps for themselves, were also handed an undeveloped reel of film, secretly taken by an inmate, which showed images of emaciated men with severe bruising. Mr Shields said: \"Judgments have to be made about what should be broadcast. Their task as they saw it was to report back what they had seen.\" The jury was then shown the Living Marxism press release sent to the media in January 1997 detailing the claims made in the article, which said the \"misleading\" picture had provoked an international outcry. The court heard that the magazine had refused to withdraw the defamatory allegations in the press release, to withdraw the article or to apologise for its contents. The press release claimed that Mr Deichmann, an expert witness at the Bosnian war crimes tribunal, had seen unbroadcast ITN footage which showed that barbed wire did not surround the camp but a small enclosure beside it from which the news team filmed. Mr Hume had also argued in the press release that \"taking sides cannot be an excuse for taking liberties with the facts\". Mr Shields told the court: \"Anyone reading that would have understood it to mean that the claimants had fabricated and broadcast distorted footage which deliberately misrepresented and sensationalised the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims at Trnopolje. \"They also allege that they kept quiet about this for four and a half years.\" The case continues today.",

The arts minister, Alan Howarth, said the aim was to avoid claimants, many of whom might be very old, being forced to take expensive and long legal proceedings. He said: \"Dreadful things happened in the Nazi era. We can, even at this distance of time, do something to enable some justice to be done. I believe this represents a responsible and fair approach to the resolution of claims.\" Useful links First report on the spoliation of works of art during the Holocaust and second world war period The institutions British museum National gallery National museums and galleries of Wales Walker art gallery, Merseyside Scottish national portrait gallery Scottish national gallery of modern art National gallery of Scotland National portrait gallery Science museum Tate gallery Victoria and Albert museum National museums of Scotland",

I have been doing my flat-stomach exercises, sit-ups morning and night, but abs sense does not appear to have made the heart grow fonder. How could he do this to me? And just because his girlfriend is visiting from Chicago for a week. Is he in this for keeps or not? </p> <p>The appeal of the trainer is threefold. You go to the gym to take control of your life: to exercise properly, eat properly, drink properly, get your mind and body into some sort of harmony. You go briefly to escape: the music is that techno-ambient stuff they play in nightclubs, all spacy and trance-like - exercise as drug. Movers and shakers come (a) because they can afford it; but (b) because it is a place where they don't have to do any moving and shaking - instead they are moved and shaken. (Here we have a paradox: they are taking control of their lives by ceding control to a trainer for three hours a week; prominent in life, they choose to become anonymous in this techno-industrial environment.) </p> <p>But you also go to be loved. I haven't had so much attention since I was about five, when I had to leave my mother clinging and weeping (me, not my mother) to go to school. For one hour, three times a week, Sam talks to me, asks me how I am, tells me how to exercise, cajoles me, laughs at my jokes, flatters my ego, scribbles in a policeman's notebook, cares. At least I thought he did. </p> <p>In his absence, Lucy has been looking after me. Lucy is a former international swimmer and has been putting me through my paces in the pool. For about 30 years, I have been labouring under the delusion that I was rather good at breaststroke. Once, in Greece, I swam out too far and found the current against me. A Shelleyan death beckoned, but my trusty breaststroke got me home. Now I discover I can't do it after all: the stroke is too fast, the legs insufficiently extended, the breathing all wrong, and my head never goes in the water, which strains the neck. It has to change, Lucy says. </p> <p>But start to think about it - about how to breathe and pull your arms back at the same time - and the whole thing disintegrates. I am currently at the disintegration stage and will not be visiting Greece this summer. Lucy has explained the theory but the practice, especially the breathing, is harder. I keep inhaling under water with disastrous results: I used to be able to do about 30 lengths (very slowly, frequent stops); I can now do about half a length before spluttering to a stop. </p> <p>But the darkest hour, etc, etc. I know it will be worth it in the end. And I look great in the new goggles, don't you think? (Film critic Peter Bradshaw, photographed last year at his local lido, pioneered this trend in Guardian writers appearing in swimming apparel, and I think it could be a real circulation-booster. There are apparently moves to extend it soon to the comment pages.) </p> <p>Happily, my front crawl is faring better: just adding goggles, slowing down the stroke and not waving my head about wildly has improved it by about 30%. </p> <p>Swimming is extremely hard work - halfway through these one-hour sessions I was really tired - but is reckoned to be a superb way of exercising: all the muscle groups get used and it is good cardio-vascular exercise too. </p> <p>Here are a few tips, courtesy of Lucy: </p> <p>\u0095 Unlearning bad habits is tough, so it's worth teaching children to swim properly. </p> <p>\u0095 Try to swim for half an hour two or three times a week. </p> <p>\u0095 Goggles - to help you swim in the water, rather than on top. </p> <p>\u0095 Breathing properly is the key to swimming well - practise your breathing at the side of the pool, dipping your head in and out of the water to establish a pattern. </p> <p>\u0095 Running in the pool - with your feet off the ground - is a good form of non-impactive exercise. </p> <p>\u0095 Using a float and going up and down the pool by just kicking your legs will strengthen leg muscles. (It's tiring, though: I had a long walk one afternoon after one of these sessions and found it very hard going, my legs almost seizing up.) </p> <p>Lucy is tough on fat - and tough on the causes of fat. Having discovered that one Saturday I ate sausages for lunch and a pizza for dinner, she gave me a daily food and drink chart to fill in, asking me what I ate, whether I was hungry, and whether I enjoyed it. Filling in the form was such a chore that I was inclined to eat nothing, but that approach is a disaster since your blood sugar level falls and you then stuff yourself in a bid for instant energy. </p> <p>Little and often is the preferred routine: a hearty, healthy breakfast (muesli rather than bacon and black pudding, naturally); mid-morning fruit; a jacket potato and salad lunch; mid-afternoon fruit (take those giant-sized Mars bars away); fish or chicken in the evening, with fruit salad and yoghurt (preferably one of those enzyme-filled biological ones). </p> <p>My food sheets of course looked nothing like this. Lucy said I ate too much too late (she suggests eating little or nothing after 8pm); I had had a box of popcorn at the cinema (nutritionally not too bad except for the high salt levels); and had stuffed nuts and olives at a party (nuts are only good if you eat them straight from the shells). Lucy said I should give up coffee completely, cut out sugar in tea, eat less bread - it's more fattening than you think - and spread the butter very thinly. </p> <p>Look, thanks Lucy, but perhaps two-coffees-max Sam wasn't so bad after all.</p> <p>\u0095 Stephen Moss is spending three months working out at Matt Roberts At One, 1 Aldwych, London WC2.

      "body": "<p>Mid-morning at the surgery of a big inner-city practice. In reception, there's a computer terminal, but the shelves are full of wallets stuffed with patients' notes. Receptionist to elderly woman: \"Who are you here to see?\" Patient: \"I don't know. They told me a new name on the phone.\" </p> <p>This isn't an Alan Bennett play; it's a surgery in Highbury, north London, but there is drama behind the scenes. For here, as in all NHS practices, GPs are studying a new survey by the British Medical Association (BMA) on their changing role. </p> <p>Will the growth of walk-in clinics and consultations by telephone (NHS Direct) undermine the traditional doctor-patient relationship, the report wonders. Do patients value that relationship anyway, or would they rather be seen quickly by any available medic rather than wait for an appointment with their own GP? </p> <p>At this Highbury surgery, the care of 11,300 patients is in the hands of five partners - plus two registrar GPs, newly qualified, spending one year here - three nurses, six staff in reception, and a practice manager. There's also a counsellor and a health visitor who come for several sessions a week to the surgery, which occupies the lower floors of a Victorian villa. </p> <p>For a branch of the NHS supposedly in transition, this all looks very familiar. Waiting to be seen is a 27-year-old woman, a patient here since she was a baby, who says that nothing can ever replace face-to-face contact with her GP. She has a computer at home but would never use the net for health information, \"because you'd be paying for it\". </p> <p>Also waiting is a financial consultant with her young son. She hasn't heard of NHS Direct - it isn't available in London yet - but she reckons it would be useful if there was a crisis with the children in the dead of night. She, too, thinks the family doctor system is working pretty well - apart from occasional niggles about waiting times for appointments, and with the caveat that she prefers, as far as possible, to see the same GP. </p> <p>Much of this is music to the ears of Dr Nick Brand, a partner for five years. He knows that the tide of change is always lapping round general practice, but he chose general practice because he likes taking care of families, generation by generation. </p> <p>Primary care, the gateway of the NHS, remains fulfilling in spite of increasing bureaucratic demands, and patients' rising expectations, says Brand. The workload is changing, and pressures increasing, however. \"Depression is our bread and butter. It's 30% of what we see.\" </p> <p>Patients classified as \"the worried well\" are a growing proportion that eat up consultation time, says another staff member. They want advice and reassurance, and see themselves as informed consumers. Quite often, it's the practice nurses who deal with them. </p> <p>Brand, however, seems rather glad that NHS Direct isn't yet available in the London area. He's a believer in the 10 minute face-to-face consultation. There's one chore, though, he would happily give up: the letters that tenants seeking better council housing ask him to write to support their applications. Council officials don't take a blind bit of notice, he's been told. But patients still insist, and he still obliges. </p> <p>As for more flexible opening hours, the GPs aren't keen to change. Brand points out that, for several years, the practice had late nights: a walk-in surgery that in effect meant that the queue wasn't cleared till around 10pm. But patients didn't like sitting around for so long; and as more women GPs became partners - three out of five now - they were unhappy with unsocial hours, so the scheme was dropped. </p> <p>There's more interest in starting early morning and late evening surgeries from the practice nurse manager, Geri Hearne. \"Patients just want us to be here 24 hours a day,\" she says. Late opening could be made possible by closing for longer in the middle of the day, between 1 and 4pm, she says - though afternoon clinics would have to be rescheduled. </p> <p>Patients in general are likely to see more nurses working alongside GPs. One medical academic in the BMA survey forecast a dissolving of the boundary between doctors and nurses: a decade hence, they could all be \"clinicians\". </p> <p>That's a bold prediction. Hearne says it's true that surgeries are benefiting from \"a flood of nurses\" who are quitting hospitals for the friendlier hours, greater autonomy and absence of a pecking order that makes work in general practice much more pleasant. </p> <p>In some surgeries, the BMA survey found, some nurses can deal with 30% of patients. But strict limitations remain: nurses can't prescribe drugs; and, while NHS Direct is a new avenue for them, it is run entirely by highly-qualified sisters who have to follow strict protocols of questions in dealing with phone callers and, says Hearne, aren't allowed to use their initiative. </p> <p>But how about technological change? Brand smiles at the mention of \"paperless practices\" where all patients records are stored electronically. </p> <p>This practice has had a computer for 10 years - but it's of limited use: booking appointments, repeat prescription, and partners' emails. A new system is being installed, and within a year the partners will be making notes on-screen as they see patients. More efficient but not more space-saving: the law says they must still hang on to those wallets.</p>",

She, too, thinks the family doctor system is working pretty well - apart from occasional niggles about waiting times for appointments, and with the caveat that she prefers, as far as possible, to see the same GP. Much of this is music to the ears of Dr Nick Brand, a partner for five years. He knows that the tide of change is always lapping round general practice, but he chose general practice because he likes taking care of families, generation by generation. Primary care, the gateway of the NHS, remains fulfilling in spite of increasing bureaucratic demands, and patients' rising expectations, says Brand. The workload is changing, and pressures increasing, however. \"Depression is our bread and butter. It's 30% of what we see.\" Patients classified as \"the worried well\" are a growing proportion that eat up consultation time, says another staff member. They want advice and reassurance, and see themselves as informed consumers. Quite often, it's the practice nurses who deal with them. Brand, however, seems rather glad that NHS Direct isn't yet available in the London area. He's a believer in the 10 minute face-to-face consultation. There's one chore, though, he would happily give up: the letters that tenants seeking better council housing ask him to write to support their applications. Council officials don't take a blind bit of notice, he's been told. But patients still insist, and he still obliges. As for more flexible opening hours, the GPs aren't keen to change. Brand points out that, for several years, the practice had late nights: a walk-in surgery that in effect meant that the queue wasn't cleared till around 10pm. But patients didn't like sitting around for so long; and as more women GPs became partners - three out of five now - they were unhappy with unsocial hours, so the scheme was dropped. There's more interest in starting early morning and late evening surgeries from the practice nurse manager, Geri Hearne. \"Patients just want us to be here 24 hours a day,\" she says. Late opening could be made possible by closing for longer in the middle of the day, between 1 and 4pm, she says - though afternoon clinics would have to be rescheduled. Patients in general are likely to see more nurses working alongside GPs. One medical academic in the BMA survey forecast a dissolving of the boundary between doctors and nurses: a decade hence, they could all be \"clinicians\". That's a bold prediction. Hearne says it's true that surgeries are benefiting from \"a flood of nurses\" who are quitting hospitals for the friendlier hours, greater autonomy and absence of a pecking order that makes work in general practice much more pleasant. In some surgeries, the BMA survey found, some nurses can deal with 30% of patients. But strict limitations remain: nurses can't prescribe drugs; and, while NHS Direct is a new avenue for them, it is run entirely by highly-qualified sisters who have to follow strict protocols of questions in dealing with phone callers and, says Hearne, aren't allowed to use their initiative. But how about technological change? Brand smiles at the mention of \"paperless practices\" where all patients records are stored electronically. This practice has had a computer for 10 years - but it's of limited use: booking appointments, repeat prescription, and partners' emails. A new system is being installed, and within a year the partners will be making notes on-screen as they see patients. More efficient but not more space-saving: the law says they must still hang on to those wallets.",

      "body": "<p>The humiliation is the stuff of every woman's nightmares - the plastic gloves, the cold metal ratchet smothered in KY jelly, the ludicrous \"dignity sheet\" which hides your indignity from no one but yourself, and of course that hideous scraping. Worst of all is the cheery nurse, chit-chatting about the weather as if poking a spreadeagled stranger's cervix were as mundane as stepping on someone's toe at the supermarket checkout. </p> <p>Yes, the smear test is truly awful, and waiting for the results can be nerve-wracking too. Even when they come back negative there's always a niggling fear - thanks to those much-publicised lab blunders - that your smear was checked by a particularly dozy work experience student with severe myopia. </p> <p>In spite of all this, 4m British women take the smear test each year - and the results are undoubtedly a stunning success. Although there are 5,000 new cases of cervical cancer a year, and 2,000 deaths in this country - many among young women - the death rate has fallen by 42% since 1994. That means the screening programme is saving around 1,000 lives each year. </p> <p>Last week, however, the department of health announced three pilot studies to screen women for the sexually-transmitted human papilloma virus (HPV), which has been proved to cause - or at least be a factor in - up to 99% of all cervical cancers. If you don't have the virus, you're highly unlikely to get the cancer. Vaccines to prevent HPV infection, and anti-viral drugs to fight cervical cancer, are both on the drawing board, but the screening, which will start at three sites around the country this summer, will have the most immediate effect. </p> <p>If it proves cost-effective, the test, which screens for the virus in material taken during normal smear tests, could go nationwide within two years. This would let doctors identify patients at greatest risk and monitor them carefully. </p> <p>In the pilot study, women with mild or borderline smears will be tested for HPV. If the results are positive, they will be sent for a colposcopy, where the cervix is examined under high magnification. Any areas showing potentially malignant cellular change can then be removed. If they test negative, they will have a repeat smear and HPV test six months later. If the abnormality has not worsened and the HPV results are still negative, they will go back to the normal screening cycle. </p> <p>Crucially, it is thought HPV screening could also improve the cancer-spotting accuracy of cytology labs by up to 50%, because cytologists would be prompted to look more closely at the smears of patients who are HPV-positive, and therefore at higher risk. </p> <p>But if everyone agrees the test has massive potential, why isn't it being made universally available, and why are pilots only starting in 2000, when a good HPV test has been around since 1991? As ever with the NHS, the answer relates to cost. The DNA screening and additional colposcopies will have to prove their worth in terms of lives and money saved on surgery and radiotherapy. Smear testing already costs the government \u00a3132m per year, and HPV screening, as well as being more expensive, will probably raise costs still more, because improved detection will lead to a higher initial incidence of cancer. </p> <p>Specialists point out that the test is still not widely available anywhere else in Europe. \"There are other issues to look at, too, for example how women might cope with the anxiety of discovering they have the virus, and then going through the extra tests, when in all probability they won't ever go on to get cancer,\" says a department of health spokesperson. </p> <p>But Dr George Walker, medical director of WellCare Lifestyle Clinics, which recently started offering a private HPV test, takes a different view. \"The test offers peace of mind,\" he says. \"A lot of women have changes in their smear result, and are told to come back for a repeat smear six months or a year later. They may spend all that time worrying, fearing the worst, and feeling helpless. </p> <p>\"If they have the HPV test, a large majority will find out they are not at risk, and can stop worrying. However, women with the high-risk strain could be sitting on a timebomb, in which case their doctor will ensure they are monitored much more carefully.\" So far only WellCare, Marie Stopes clinics, and BMI hospitals are offering the test pri vately - all at more than \u00a3100 a throw. </p> <p>So, should women be panicking, shelling out for the private test, or moving to one of the health authority areas (still not chosen) where the pilots will take place? A British Medical Journal report last December said it \"may be prudent\" to take the test, but Dr Jo Reynolds, of the Cancer Research Campaign, thinks not. \"We need the results of the pilot schemes to decide on its efficacy,\" she says. \"Right now, the most important thing is to get women to have the regular smear test. Unfortunately, bad publicity has caused a lot of fear. Half of all women currently dying of cervical cancer have never had a smear.\" She says regular smear tests can usually identify cervical cancer at an early stage, with 69% of women still alive five years after treatment. </p> <p>Dr Paul Sasieni, a senior epidemiologist at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, welcomes the pilot studies, but says: \"The government should have been much more pro-active in funding research into HPV. It was clear for a long time that screening would have enormous potential, but the funding was almost non-existent.\" </p> <p> Meanwhile, the search for a cure for cervical cancer continues. Some scientists predict the virtual elimination of the disease within a generation; for girls born today, the smear test could come to seem as bizarre as Elizabethan dentistry. </p> <p>Dr Sasieni is enthusiastic about anti-HPV vaccines, which are being tested in several international trials. Although larger trials are still needed, it is likely that schoolchildren (boys included) or even babies (to eliminate ethical debates about the age at which children start having sex), will be vaccinated in the not-too-distant future to help stop the spread of HPV. Meanwhile, scientists at York University have just finished an eight-year study to map the structure of the virus. This will allow the design of a drug to stop it from reproducing, and will be taken by women with the early stages of cervical cancer. Lead scientist Dr Norman Maitland says: \"A drug may be available within 10 years, in which case we can say that cervical cancer will be almost wiped out.\" </p> <p>This may be good news for very young girls. But what about women aged 30 and above, who run the highest risk of developing cervical cancer? Dr Maitland says: \"Screening is already very good, and cervical cancer is really quite rare. Incidence is falling all the time.\" </p> <p>He is even up-beat about lab errors. \"Mistakes happen, but Britain is no worse than anywhere else. Because nearly all smears here are done by the NHS rather than privately, we just get to hear about the mistakes more often.\" </p> <p>\u0095 There are around 80 strains of the HPV virus. About 30 of them are associated with genital tract infections, and 10 with cervical cancer. Very few other cancers have proven to be linked to a virus. </p> <p>\u0095 Women who have had many sexual partners, or start having sex early, are at greatest risk of developing cervical cancer through HPV infection. Around 15% of young women are infected with the virus at any one time, but most fight it off within a couple of months, never even knowing they were infected. Only about 2% of these women will ever go on to develop cervical cancer. </p> <p>\u0095 The virus seems to gain a foothold in those with a lowered immune response, and works by inserting its own genes into the DNA of cells in the cervix, causing them to divide uncontrollably. Other factors include smoking, other cervical infections and poor hygiene. Poorer women also run a higher risk, because they are less likely to have smear tests. Unlike breast cancer, there is little or no genetic predisposition to cervical cancer. </p> <p>\u0095 Britain's cervical cancer rate is similar to most other developed countries even though American women are advised to have smear tests on a yearly basis, while some British health authorities only suggest a test once every five years. This is because cervical cancer generally spreads slowly. However, it spreads faster among younger women, in rare cases causing death within one or two years. </p> <p>\u0095 Rates of cervical cancer are higher in southern and eastern Europe, either because of greater promiscuity or earlier sexual development and childbirth. Israel has abnormally low rates because of attitudes to pre-marital sex. </p> <p>\u0095 Some studies have suggested there was a peak in the number of cervical cancer cases in the 80s among women who had been actively involved in the \"free love\" era of the 60s. </p> <p>\u0095 The risk of cervical cancer-related HPV infection can be cut down by use of condoms and spermicide. </p> <p>\u0095 The WellCare Lifestyle Clinics are on: 0808 1003133.</p>",

That has to cover emergency measures for food, shelter, health, water and sanitation, education, communication and co-ordination. Funds have been made available (by Portugal and the UK, Italy, France, the US, and the Organisation for African Unity, among others). South Africa has provided helicopter support. But this is all on the level of disaster relief, rather than reconstruction. The amount of money the country owes still outstrips what it earns. Mozambique was seen to be tackling its problems well. Will that help it gain the money it needs? It should do. But when an unforeseen natural disaster affects a rich country, people expect money from the state for the losses they suffer, and frequently get it. The property of people in poor countries is not as well safeguarded as the property of those living in rich countries. Many of those Mozambicans who have lost crops or had land or property ruined face the arduous task of starting all over again. The facts \u0095Mozambique is part of the Commonwealth - the organisation of ex-British colonies. It is the only member that was formerly a Portuguese colony. \u0095There are 19 million Mozambicans. \u0095 80% of the workforce is involved in agriculture. \u0095 Further information: the International Crisis Group has compiled a valuable directory of web resources on and from Africa. \u0095For the latest on the relief effort.",

It is this image that started me down the road which has led, after two years, to a meeting in which I am going to tell her about the film I have made about her.</p> <p>Thirty-five years after the picture was taken in the cells of Hyde police station it remains a symbol of pure evil. Hardly a month has gone by when it has not appeared in the Sun or the Mirror or, come to that, on the BBC.</p> <p>It serves as an instant reminder of appalling crimes at the same time as Hindley and the relatives of the murdered children engage in a grim struggle. She is trying to win her freedom in the courts, while they continue to point out the horrific nature of her crimes in an effort to ensure that she dies behind bars.</p> <p>She was sentenced to life in 1966 for the murder of 12-year-old John Kilbride and 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey, and being an accessory in the killing of 17-year-old Edward Evans. Her lover, Ian Brady, was sentenced to life for all three murders. In 1986, the pair confessed that they had also killed 10-year-old Keith Bennett and 16-year-old Pauline Reade.</p> <p>There is no doubt who is winning the legal argument about her continued imprisonment. In 1982, the then lord chief justice, Lord Lane, recommended that she serve 20 years. Successive home secretaries, influenced by the very raw and lasting pain of the victims' families, have overruled him; first increasing that sentence, then saying that she should never be freed.</p> <p>Last week the House of Lords heard Myra Hindley's legal challenge to the home office's right to do so. Even her QC, Edward Fitzgerald, who recently won a similar case on behalf of the killers of James Bulger, is not optimistic about the chances of success.</p> <p>Many millions of words have been published about the crimes in the years since the Moors Murders trial, but there remains one striking gap in accounts of the case: no one has come close to explaining what turned a good Catholic girl from Manchester into a woman capable of the most appalling crimes.</p> <p>It is as if, paralysed by the sheer horror of the killings, we have been unable to progress beyond expressing disgust for Hindley. Even the home office has never thought to have her interviewed by a psychiatrist. Our strong emotional response has never been matched by a proper understanding of the case.</p> <p>When Hindley herself has spoken about her crimes in the past, the picture which has emerged has been incomplete. First, her confession to the police in 1986 formed the basis of a book by Chief Superintendent Peter Topping. This work was limited by the fact that he was interested in solving murders, not answering why they took place. Then, five years ago, Hindley wrote in the Guardian about her life. This account, although fascinating, was comparatively brief and dealt largely with her life before the murders took place. Either taken together, or separately, neither account was comprehensive. It was in order to address this that I wrote to Hindley and asked her to tell me about her life and the events leading up to the Moors Murders. Perhaps in increasing our knowledge of the murders it will be possible to understand better how to respond to them and decide whether some crimes really are so terrible that the people who commit them should die behind bars.</p> <p>My conditions were straightforward. I would deal fairly and responsibly with the material. She would receive no payment or have any control over how it was used. I expected her to say no. Then, one Sunday morning, I was sitting reading the papers when my office phone rang. I was startled to hear her strong, low voice at the end of the line.</p> <p>\"Hello, Duncan. I can't talk for long. I haven't got many units on my phonecard.\"</p> <p>The sound of prison corridors echoed down the line as I concentrated on telling her exactly what it was that I wanted to do. \"I understand that it can't be a film for me. I know that what you do has to be balanced. I just feel it's right after all this time to explain what happened. Then people can decide what they think.\"</p> <p>Over the space of a few months, nearly 200 closely typed pages of foolscap pour through my letterbox. The material describing her childhood is more detailed than any previous account. The letters which deal with the murders are profoundly disturbing. Then there are the phonecalls, which become a part of my Sunday routine. The letters recall the events of over 30 years ago with a clarity only possible in someone who has been locked up since they took place. That sharpness does not extend to the order in which they are described, she chops and changes between different episodes. The effect is that of a bloody mosaic.</p> <p>After a while I find that carrying these fragmented, violent images around with me is interfering with daily life. I stop giving the letters more than a single reading before filing them to be assessed as a whole later on. When I return to examine the letters a few months later it is with the help of a forensic psychiatrist who knows more about the Moors Murders than any other. Professor Malcolm MacCulloch was responsible for Brady's transfer from prison to Ashworth secure psychiatric hospital, where he interviewed him over several years.</p> <p>He believes that understanding the events which lead up to crimes like the Moors Murders can help predict and prevent them. He does, however, sound a note of caution about taking them at face value. The letters are clearly only what Hindley wants to write. \"One has to look at what is there and what is missing.\"</p> <p>The letters are easier to judge as a whole. The fact that they do not pursue a tidy linear narrative makes them raw and immediate. It is the occasional use of dramatic devices such as cliff hangers which brings things sharply back into focus. Is she using them to stop the letters being boring or is she trying to construct events to show her in the best possible light?</p> <p>The streets where Hindley describes growing up have been demolished. The main landmarks of her childhood, however, remain: her primary school, the monastery church of St Francis and the pub where her father used to drink.</p> <p>\"I detested him because of the way he beat my mother, which was often - as soon as we heard the first raised voice and the inevitable sound of fighting, we used to rush in and my gran would hit him with a rolled-up newspaper and I'd cling on to his legs and try to get him off my mother. This always resulted in my being kicked out of the way or slapped and even punched.\" Professor MacCulloch believes that the description of her childhood and the way she stood up to her father demonstrate an ability to deal calmly with violent situations.</p> <p>\"I think there are clues here in that she describes her father as being tough and abusive towards her mother. She withstood what might be construed as abuse. I think on balance the evidence is that she is a tough-minded and independentminded woman, who later came not to be revolted by some of the things she was engaged in,\" he says.</p> <p>Hindley's teenage years were quite normal; she fell in love with a childhood sweetheart, got engaged and drifted in and out of secretarial jobs.</p> <p>The former head of Greater Manchester CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Geoff Knupfer, has little doubt about the future that awaited her. He took her confession in 1986 and has known her for longer than any other police officer.</p> <p>\"I think she was a perfectly normal girl prior to meeting Brady. Had she not met Ian Brady and fallen in love with him, she would have fallen in love and got married and had a family and been like any other member of the general public.\"</p> <p>But one day, the tide of chance washed her up on the doorstep of Millward's Merchandise, a chemical firm in Gorton, Manchester. She was given a dictation test by the boss, passed it and was taken round to meet her new colleagues. Among them was Brady.</p> <p>\"I'd always been a romantic dreamer falling in love with film stars - I was crazy about James Dean and Elvis - and had read and heard the phrase 'falling head over heels in love' but never thought it would happen to me. But as soon as Ian Brady looked at me and smiled shyly, that's exactly what happened.\"</p> <p>Brady was just 21 but had already done time in borstal and Strangeways prison. A photograph taken at the time shows him looking cocky, fit and smart in tweeds. A man who knows he is attractive to women. Although she was strongly drawn to him, Hindley says that she did not understand the way he behaved towards her.</p> <p>\"That first year of working in the same office as Ian was mental torture. Sometimes he would speak to me normally, other times he ignored me completely. I was far too proud to let him see the way I felt about him, and never showed how hurt I was when he'd been nasty to me. I wrote everything down in a diary which I kept locked in one of my desk drawers. Sometimes I would write that I hated him because he was cold and cruel; other times I would beg God to let him love me the same way as I loved him.\"</p> <p>Eventually, Brady did make a move on her. It was at the office Christmas party. \"Someone put the record player on. I was too drunk to remember what was playing, but to my utter amazement Ian suddenly pulled me up off my chair and began staggering around dancing with me. I thought I would die from being held in his arms; even though he was a lousy dancer and trampled all over my feet.\"</p> <p>As she swayed into the arms of Brady, Hindley was taking the first steps on the road to murder. The question is whether she went down it willingly or was pushed. In her letters, as she has written previously in the Guardian, she says that Brady began indoctrinating her, turning her against black people and Jews. Then he began working on her religion. Before she met him she worshipped in the same congregation as the first Moors Murder victim, Pauline Reade.</p> <p>\"He scorned me for believing all the crap in the Bible, for going to church, Mass, with its mumbo jumbo and incense and confession.\" Hindley says that Brady combined his indoctrination of her with sexual violence. Her description of the first time they had sex reads more like that of a rape than a loving encounter.</p> <p>The descriptions of sexual violence intensify over the next 18 months. Towards the end of this period Hindley claims that Brady was regularly raping, beating and sexually humiliating her. She says that was when Brady introduced her to the idea of killing. He gave her a book called Compulsion. In it a 12-year-old child is abducted and murdered. It even has a character called Myra.</p> <p>\"I told him it was a very disturbing book, but why exactly had he wanted me to read it? One night he asked me if I wanted to see anyone I didn't like dead. I said no, don't be silly.</p> <p>\"Then one evening - and he hadn't been drinking - he told me he wanted to do a perfect murder and I was going to help him.\"</p> <p>Professor MacCulloch says that the descriptions of sexual violence are important because they are more detailed and extreme than in the confession she made to the police. One explanation is that she did not consider these details relevant. Another is that she is exaggerating what happened in order to make it look as if Brady terrorised her into becoming his accomplice.</p> <p>\"The letters contain some interesting points of inconsistency in that they seem to be verbatim the accounts she gave to the police, but embellished to develop the theme of Brady terrorising and demeaning her,\" says MacCulloch.</p> <p>Hindley says that Brady also drugged her and threatened to kill her and her grandmother. When she tried to get away by joining the Naafi (which provided canteen services to the military) he beat and anally raped her.</p> <p>It was after this failed escape attempt that she agreed to go scouting for children in her van. She didn't pick any up. \"I just couldn't do what he wanted me to do.\"</p> <p>But on July 12 1963, she says she finally did give in. She left her house in the Gorton area of Manchester in her van. Brady was following on his motorbike.</p> <p>\"I saw a young girl walking down the street on her own with nobody else in sight. He flashed his light and I slowly drew up just behind the girl, opened the passenger door and called to her to ask if she could spare a minute. She turned round and to my horror it was Pauline Reade.\"</p> <p>Pauline Reade was a friend of her sisters and they had been members of the same congregation. She was on her way to a dance, yet Hindley says she agreed to help her to look for a glove she said she'd lost on Saddleworth Moor, 20 miles away. When they arrived there, Hindley claims that Ian Brady led Pauline off, raped her and cut her throat.</p> <p>\"He led me to her body which I tried not to look at. I didn't know at the time he was testing me and there was no need for me to be there. He told me to look at her. I'll never be able to forget what I saw. I moved as far away from her as possible... I stood and looked at the dark outline of the rocks against the horizon of the dark sky and three people died that night: Pauline, my soul and God.\"</p> <p>MacCulloch says that her reaction to this, like her reaction to childhood beatings, explains why she was able to take part in the Moors Murders. She does not have a normal reaction to violence.</p> <p>\"She was there in the immediate aftermath and that is one of the most distressing things that can happen to anybody. People of a more nervous disposition become completely disintegrated; they deteriorate in terms of depression. They develop post traumatic stress disorder. There is no sign of any of this in these letters.</p> <p>\"I don't think that squares with somebody who is intimidated, and the earlier accounts of the relationship with her father suggest that she is not intimidated.\"</p> <p>Detective Chief Superintendent Knupfer agrees with Hindley that, whatever underlying personality traits made this possible, her obses sion for Brady explains why she went on to commit another four killings.</p> <p>\"Clearly, she was absolutely besotted by this man. I guess like many other women I've met in the course of my career, they do all sorts of things for the love and respect of their partner.\"</p> <p>While arguing that Brady coerced her, Hindley does concede that there must have been something in her that made her willing to be pushed down the road to murder.</p> <p>\"I knew then and still know that there must be a callous streak in my nature, a cruel streak even; there must have been... And I still don't know what it was rooted in, or where it came from. Sometimes I've thought I'd drive myself insane trying to discover what.\"</p> <p>The most significant omission in the letters is the murder of Lesley Ann Downey. The 10 year old was picked up from a fairground and taken back to a house in Hattersley. There, Brady made a tape recording of her pleas for mercy before raping and strangling her. It is the one piece of evidence which shows Hindley abusing a child after the point of abduction. Over a year I repeatedly raise with her her failure to address this point. She never does. One day, I pick up this answerphone message.</p> <p>\"I'm having a great deal of difficulty with the Lesley Ann Downey thing. I think I'll just have to keep it brief. I just find it hard to believe that I could have been such a cruel, cruel bastard.\"</p> <p>MacCulloch says that Hindley's personality is not unique: \"There are lots of people with very tough personality types who do great and brave things or who are extremely brave. Under other circumstances they might be labelled as abhorrent psychopaths and do dreadful things. It's really a question of whom you meet and what happens in the circumstances.\"</p> <p>What happened in the office of Millwards Merchandise in 1961 is that Myra Hindley met Ian Brady. She needed his love, he needed her because she was the kind of woman who is able to live with violence. The fact that in another place and time she might have been noted for her bravery does not in any way excuse what she did. It could, however, help explain why she did it.</p> <p>I am sitting opposite Myra Hindley. The small china bowl contains a pile of used teabags and her foil ashtray is full. I have told her MacCulloch's conclusions.</p> <p>\"Right,\" is all she says as she smiles, leans forward and stubs out her roll-up.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Modern Times: Myra Hindley is being shown on BBC2 at 9pm tomorrow night</p>",

Then there are the phonecalls, which become a part of my Sunday routine. The letters recall the events of over 30 years ago with a clarity only possible in someone who has been locked up since they took place. That sharpness does not extend to the order in which they are described, she chops and changes between different episodes. The effect is that of a bloody mosaic. After a while I find that carrying these fragmented, violent images around with me is interfering with daily life. I stop giving the letters more than a single reading before filing them to be assessed as a whole later on. When I return to examine the letters a few months later it is with the help of a forensic psychiatrist who knows more about the Moors Murders than any other. Professor Malcolm MacCulloch was responsible for Brady's transfer from prison to Ashworth secure psychiatric hospital, where he interviewed him over several years. He believes that understanding the events which lead up to crimes like the Moors Murders can help predict and prevent them. He does, however, sound a note of caution about taking them at face value. The letters are clearly only what Hindley wants to write. \"One has to look at what is there and what is missing.\" The letters are easier to judge as a whole. The fact that they do not pursue a tidy linear narrative makes them raw and immediate. It is the occasional use of dramatic devices such as cliff hangers which brings things sharply back into focus. Is she using them to stop the letters being boring or is she trying to construct events to show her in the best possible light? The streets where Hindley describes growing up have been demolished. The main landmarks of her childhood, however, remain: her primary school, the monastery church of St Francis and the pub where her father used to drink. \"I detested him because of the way he beat my mother, which was often - as soon as we heard the first raised voice and the inevitable sound of fighting, we used to rush in and my gran would hit him with a rolled-up newspaper and I'd cling on to his legs and try to get him off my mother. This always resulted in my being kicked out of the way or slapped and even punched.\" Professor MacCulloch believes that the description of her childhood and the way she stood up to her father demonstrate an ability to deal calmly with violent situations. \"I think there are clues here in that she describes her father as being tough and abusive towards her mother. She withstood what might be construed as abuse. I think on balance the evidence is that she is a tough-minded and independentminded woman, who later came not to be revolted by some of the things she was engaged in,\" he says. Hindley's teenage years were quite normal; she fell in love with a childhood sweetheart, got engaged and drifted in and out of secretarial jobs. The former head of Greater Manchester CID, Detective Chief Superintendent Geoff Knupfer, has little doubt about the future that awaited her. He took her confession in 1986 and has known her for longer than any other police officer. \"I think she was a perfectly normal girl prior to meeting Brady. Had she not met Ian Brady and fallen in love with him, she would have fallen in love and got married and had a family and been like any other member of the general public.\" But one day, the tide of chance washed her up on the doorstep of Millward's Merchandise, a chemical firm in Gorton, Manchester. She was given a dictation test by the boss, passed it and was taken round to meet her new colleagues. Among them was Brady. \"I'd always been a romantic dreamer falling in love with film stars - I was crazy about James Dean and Elvis - and had read and heard the phrase 'falling head over heels in love' but never thought it would happen to me. But as soon as Ian Brady looked at me and smiled shyly, that's exactly what happened.\" Brady was just 21 but had already done time in borstal and Strangeways prison. A photograph taken at the time shows him looking cocky, fit and smart in tweeds. A man who knows he is attractive to women. Although she was strongly drawn to him, Hindley says that she did not understand the way he behaved towards her. \"That first year of working in the same office as Ian was mental torture. Sometimes he would speak to me normally, other times he ignored me completely. I was far too proud to let him see the way I felt about him, and never showed how hurt I was when he'd been nasty to me. I wrote everything down in a diary which I kept locked in one of my desk drawers. Sometimes I would write that I hated him because he was cold and cruel; other times I would beg God to let him love me the same way as I loved him.\" Eventually, Brady did make a move on her. It was at the office Christmas party. \"Someone put the record player on. I was too drunk to remember what was playing, but to my utter amazement Ian suddenly pulled me up off my chair and began staggering around dancing with me. I thought I would die from being held in his arms; even though he was a lousy dancer and trampled all over my feet.\" As she swayed into the arms of Brady, Hindley was taking the first steps on the road to murder. The question is whether she went down it willingly or was pushed. In her letters, as she has written previously in the Guardian, she says that Brady began indoctrinating her, turning her against black people and Jews. Then he began working on her religion. Before she met him she worshipped in the same congregation as the first Moors Murder victim, Pauline Reade. \"He scorned me for believing all the crap in the Bible, for going to church, Mass, with its mumbo jumbo and incense and confession.\" Hindley says that Brady combined his indoctrination of her with sexual violence. Her description of the first time they had sex reads more like that of a rape than a loving encounter. The descriptions of sexual violence intensify over the next 18 months. Towards the end of this period Hindley claims that Brady was regularly raping, beating and sexually humiliating her. She says that was when Brady introduced her to the idea of killing. He gave her a book called Compulsion. In it a 12-year-old child is abducted and murdered. It even has a character called Myra. \"I told him it was a very disturbing book, but why exactly had he wanted me to read it? One night he asked me if I wanted to see anyone I didn't like dead. I said no, don't be silly. \"Then one evening - and he hadn't been drinking - he told me he wanted to do a perfect murder and I was going to help him.\" Professor MacCulloch says that the descriptions of sexual violence are important because they are more detailed and extreme than in the confession she made to the police. One explanation is that she did not consider these details relevant. Another is that she is exaggerating what happened in order to make it look as if Brady terrorised her into becoming his accomplice. \"The letters contain some interesting points of inconsistency in that they seem to be verbatim the accounts she gave to the police, but embellished to develop the theme of Brady terrorising and demeaning her,\" says MacCulloch. Hindley says that Brady also drugged her and threatened to kill her and her grandmother. When she tried to get away by joining the Naafi (which provided canteen services to the military) he beat and anally raped her. It was after this failed escape attempt that she agreed to go scouting for children in her van. She didn't pick any up. \"I just couldn't do what he wanted me to do.\" But on July 12 1963, she says she finally did give in. She left her house in the Gorton area of Manchester in her van. Brady was following on his motorbike. \"I saw a young girl walking down the street on her own with nobody else in sight. He flashed his light and I slowly drew up just behind the girl, opened the passenger door and called to her to ask if she could spare a minute. She turned round and to my horror it was Pauline Reade.\" Pauline Reade was a friend of her sisters and they had been members of the same congregation. She was on her way to a dance, yet Hindley says she agreed to help her to look for a glove she said she'd lost on Saddleworth Moor, 20 miles away. When they arrived there, Hindley claims that Ian Brady led Pauline off, raped her and cut her throat. \"He led me to her body which I tried not to look at. I didn't know at the time he was testing me and there was no need for me to be there. He told me to look at her. I'll never be able to forget what I saw. I moved as far away from her as possible... I stood and looked at the dark outline of the rocks against the horizon of the dark sky and three people died that night: Pauline, my soul and God.\" MacCulloch says that her reaction to this, like her reaction to childhood beatings, explains why she was able to take part in the Moors Murders. She does not have a normal reaction to violence. \"She was there in the immediate aftermath and that is one of the most distressing things that can happen to anybody. People of a more nervous disposition become completely disintegrated; they deteriorate in terms of depression. They develop post traumatic stress disorder. There is no sign of any of this in these letters. \"I don't think that squares with somebody who is intimidated, and the earlier accounts of the relationship with her father suggest that she is not intimidated.\" Detective Chief Superintendent Knupfer agrees with Hindley that, whatever underlying personality traits made this possible, her obses sion for Brady explains why she went on to commit another four killings. \"Clearly, she was absolutely besotted by this man. I guess like many other women I've met in the course of my career, they do all sorts of things for the love and respect of their partner.\" While arguing that Brady coerced her, Hindley does concede that there must have been something in her that made her willing to be pushed down the road to murder. \"I knew then and still know that there must be a callous streak in my nature, a cruel streak even; there must have been... And I still don't know what it was rooted in, or where it came from. Sometimes I've thought I'd drive myself insane trying to discover what.\" The most significant omission in the letters is the murder of Lesley Ann Downey. The 10 year old was picked up from a fairground and taken back to a house in Hattersley. There, Brady made a tape recording of her pleas for mercy before raping and strangling her. It is the one piece of evidence which shows Hindley abusing a child after the point of abduction. Over a year I repeatedly raise with her her failure to address this point. She never does. One day, I pick up this answerphone message. \"I'm having a great deal of difficulty with the Lesley Ann Downey thing. I think I'll just have to keep it brief. I just find it hard to believe that I could have been such a cruel, cruel bastard.\" MacCulloch says that Hindley's personality is not unique: \"There are lots of people with very tough personality types who do great and brave things or who are extremely brave. Under other circumstances they might be labelled as abhorrent psychopaths and do dreadful things. It's really a question of whom you meet and what happens in the circumstances.\" What happened in the office of Millwards Merchandise in 1961 is that Myra Hindley met Ian Brady. She needed his love, he needed her because she was the kind of woman who is able to live with violence. The fact that in another place and time she might have been noted for her bravery does not in any way excuse what she did. It could, however, help explain why she did it. I am sitting opposite Myra Hindley. The small china bowl contains a pile of used teabags and her foil ashtray is full. I have told her MacCulloch's conclusions. \"Right,\" is all she says as she smiles, leans forward and stubs out her roll-up. \u00b7 Modern Times: Myra Hindley is being shown on BBC2 at 9pm tomorrow night",

But those close to Mr Haider said his retreat to Carinthia, the province where he is governor, and the shift away from the public eye would give the populist more room for manoeuvre and the chance to achieve his life-long goal to become chancellor. The inclusion of the far right in the coalition government led by Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel caused the European Union to freeze bilateral political contacts with Austria. The US said on Monday that Mr Haider's resignation \"couldn't hurt\". But the state department spokesman James Rubin added: \"This doesn't change our concerns - the Freedom party itself is still part of the government.\" Politicians are hoping that Mr Haider's resignation will ease international pressure on Austria. But Freedom party members who have key roles in the cabinet, such as finance and social affairs, are expected to remain. Mr Haider's announcement came after hours of meetings over the weekend. Party members were said to be \"visibly irritated and shocked\" by the news. They said Mr Haider had announced he \"did not want to stand in the way of the working of the government\".

Despite the fact that almost a third of Austrians voted for Mr Haider's far-right party in October's election, most can see that he has inflicted more damage on the country's international standing than anything since the war. The European Union has frozen bilateral political contacts with Austria in protest at the inclusion of the Freedom party in government and at Mr Haider's past praise of Adolf Hitler's policies. The United States has not ruled out imposing sanctions. The foreign minister, Benita Ferrero Waldner, a People's party member, has denied that the country is isolated, but the events of recent months year have put the era of Kurt Waldheim in the mid-80s into the shade. But now the man who has headed the party since 1986, throwing out the liberal wing and bringing in image consultants to revamp an organisation which has its roots in an old fraternity of Nazi veterans - the Union of Independents - has made the surprise announcement that he is going to take a back seat and assume a \"supervisory role\". Mr Haider said his resignation was intended to help the coalition to function as smoothly as possible. \"We want to avoid the impression that members of the government are puppets being kept on a tight leash.\" Asked if he was stepping down in response to interna tional pressure over his party's presence in government, he replied in English: \"I don't accept. . .outside pressure.

But even his own party members did not believe that the man who has propelled the Freedom party to unprecedented success would do something so seemingly foolish. The Freedom party governor of the province of Lower Austria, Hans-J\u00f6rg Schimanek, said before the announcement was reported: \"At least 50% of the Freedom party is J\u00f6rg Haider. I don't need to say anything more than that.\" But the fact that party leaders refused to deny the rumours led to their escalation. At 10.30pm last night a party spokesman emerged from a leadership meeting in Vienna's Hotel Wimberger to tell journalists that Mr Haider, who is renowned for his obsession with fitness and his designer suits, was resigning. \"Dr Haider wants to reduce his function to that of a supervisory one,\" he said. Party members emerging from the meeting for a break l told journalists that Mr Haider had announced his resignation at the end of an hour-long speech in which he also denounced Brussels and spoke of the party as an up and coming force. The question is what now for a man who has dedicated more than a quarter of a century to politics. Many political commentators and opposition leaders see his move as a tactical retreat - a typical Haider trick. It is not the first time he has resigned to save his political skin. He did so most famously af ter he praised the employment policies of Adolf Hitler in the early 90s and was forced to step down, but he used his position away from the glare of publicity to make a striking comeback last year. Mr Haider has since apologised several times for such remarks. Handing the party leadership to his vice-chancellor and confidante, Susanne Riess-Passer, may appease European leaders, but political observers warn that Mr Haider will remain party leader in all but name. The US state department spokesman, James Rubin, warned yesterday that Mr Haider's departure as leader of the Freedom party would not stop close US monitoring of Austria's new coalition government. \"It would be a step in the right direction to ensure that Austria has the kind of government that ensures respect for human rights, tolerance and respect for minorities,\" Mr Rubin told reporters. \"But Mr. Haider is still part of the party.

The letter, published on his internet site, claims that while Eichmann, the architect of the extermination programme, makes reference to witnessing an \u201cexperimental\u201d truck gassing, he was never shown a gas chamber at Auschwitz. While the Eichmann memoir seeks to deny the Nazi officer\u2019s responsibility for mass murder, it does not disclaim the systematic murder of millions. \u201cThere is nothing there that would lead anyone to the conclusion that this did not happen,\u201d Mr Bach said. Eichmann begins his record in his childhood and writes about his entry into the SS and his oath of allegiance. \u201cHe wanted his family to see it, and to see his role. Maybe he wanted to convince his family he did not take a central part in the Final Solution,\u201d Mr Bach said. But after Eichmann was hanged in 1962 - the only time Israel has carried out the death penalty - and his ashes scattered over the Mediterranean, the manuscript lay forgotten in the Israeli national archives in Jerusalem. \u201cNobody was aware of this document,\u201d said Ido Baum, a spokesman for the justice ministry. No one was aware of the fact that the notes were in the archives until last August when Dieter Eichmann, Eichmann\u2019s son, approached the attorney general and requested the manuscript. According to Mr Bach, the prevailing sentiment in Israel at the time was against the immediate publication of the memoir, but there was never any intention to bury it in the archives indefinitely. \u201cWe always knew that sooner or later the diaries would be published,\u201d he said. Typewritten versions of the manuscript could be made available to scholars and journalists as early as tomorrow. Although Israel does not intend general publication of the manuscript, it is unclear what Eichmann\u2019s sons envisage. Mr Baum said last night that the copyright remained with the Eichmann family.",

Mais les jeunes fran\u00e7ais l'ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Voici les impressions et les critiques de Sara, 15 ans, Michel, 22 ans et Marianne, 18 ans.</p> <p><b> Quel est le passage du film qui t'a le plus frapp\u00e9 ? </b></p> <p><b>Michel: </b> J'ai trouv\u00e9 que les sc\u00e8nes o\u00f9 Besson essayait d'exprimer la foi religieuse de Jeanne d'Arc faisaient pub de mode ou de shampooing - des tr\u00e8s belles images sans profondeur ni spiritualit\u00e9 r\u00e9elles. C'est tr\u00e8s juv\u00e9nile dans le sens o\u00f9 c'est tr\u00e8s superficiel.</p> <p><b> Marianne: </b> Les sc\u00e8nes de combat \u00e9taient impressionnantes. De voir tous ces acteurs suivre cette chor\u00e9graphie en armure, incroyable ! \u00c7a a d\u00fb leur prendre des heures d'entranement.</p> <p><b> Qu'as-tu pens\u00e9 du film ? </b></p> <p><b>Sara: </b> Je l'ai bien aim\u00e9, mes copines aussi. J'aime bien l'actrice qui joue Jeanne d'Arc et j'ai trouv\u00e9 que tout le reste s'accordait bien aussi. Je ne connaissais pas du tout l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc et j'ai eu l'impression d'apprendre.</p> <p><b> Michel: </b> Je l'ai trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s mauvais. Les images sont tr\u00e8s belles mais il n'y a rien derri\u00e8re.</p> <p><b> Marianne: </b> J'ai ador\u00e9. Sauf que j'ai trouv\u00e9 \u00e7a dommage qu'il n'y ait pas d'histoire d'amour. \u00c0 mon avis, c'est le meilleur film de Besson depuis Le Grand Bleu .</p> <p><b> Qui sont les m\u00e9chants ? </b></p> <p><b>Sara: </b> On ne peut pas dire qu'il y ait des m\u00e9chants et des gentils, chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 est m\u00e9chant pour l'autre.</p> <p><b> Michel: </b> Les Anglais, mais aussi en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \"les grands\". Jeanne est tr\u00e8s pu\u00e9rile et innocente. En fait, tous les bons sont des jeunes, tous les m\u00e9chants sont des adultes.</p> <p><b> Marianne: </b> C'est pas vraiment \u00e7a l'histoire. En fait, ce qui est important, c'est Jeanne, son personnage. C'est tout de m\u00eame incroyable qu'une femme tellement courageuse et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ait exist\u00e9 au 15e si\u00e8cle.</p> <p><b> Le film se rapproche de l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc ? </b></p> <p><b>Sara: </b> Je ne sais pas, je ne suis pas trop au courant, sauf \u00e0 travers le film. Dans le film, elle a l'image d'une guerri\u00e8re. On peut bien y croire.</p> <p><b> Michel: </b> On conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s peu l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc. Ce que l'on sait est tellement un m\u00e9lange de mythe et de r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qu'on ne peut pas vraiment faire une reconstruction de sa vie. On ne sait pas si elle \u00e9tait vraiment quelqu'un d'extraordinaire ou non.</p> <p><b> Marianne: </b> Je pense que oui. Je sais que Besson a fait beaucoup de recherches sur l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc avant de r\u00e9aliser son film.</p> <p><b> Est-ce qu'un film bas\u00e9 sur l'histoire doit respecter les faits historiques ? </b></p> <p><b>Sara: </b> \u00c7a d\u00e9pend de ce que tu sais de l'histoire. Apr\u00e8s, il faut pr\u00e9ciser si c'est fictif ou r\u00e9el. Chez Walt Disney, ils font souvent \u00e7a - ils prennent une base et apr\u00e8s ils inventent pour que \u00e7a soit plus amusant pour les petits.</p> <p><b> Michel: </b> Non, pas du tout. Parce qu'un film, c'est artificiel. De toute fa\u00e7on, c'est tellement dur, il y a tellement de faits qui sont contest\u00e9s, il y en a tr\u00e8s peu qui sont tr\u00e8s nets ou clairs. </p> <p><b> Marianne: </b> Oui, c'est tr\u00e8s important. Sinon, \u00e0 quoi \u00e7a sert ? La seule question, c'est est-ce qu'on peut toujours faire confiance aux r\u00e9alisateurs ?</p> <p><b> Et le fait qu'un film fran\u00e7ais soit r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en anglais ? </b></p> <p>Sara: Je n'y ai m\u00eame pas pens\u00e9. \u00c7a ne m'a pas surprise car la plupart des films sont en anglais. En plus, Milla Jovovich (Jeanne), \u00e9tait la femme de Besson \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. En plus, elle joue souvent des r\u00f4les comme \u00e7a. Du coup, \u00e7a ne m'a pas trop choqu\u00e9e qu'il l'ait choisie et qu'il ait tourn\u00e9 le film en anglais. </p> <p><b> Michel: </b> Je trouve \u00e7a ironique parce que Jeanne d'Arc est le symbole du Front national en France. Je trouve que c'est une fa\u00e7on de faire un pied de nez aux nationalistes.</p> <p><b> Marianne: </b> C'est vrai que c'est toujours plus agr\u00e9able d'aller voir un film qu'on comprend tout de suite sans lire les sous-titres. Mais \u00e7a ne m'a pas vraiment d\u00e9rang\u00e9e.</p> <p><b>Glossaire/Glossary</b></p> <p><b> la guerri\u00e8re </b> warrior <br><b> le grand \u00e9cran </b> the big screen, cinema <br><b> la foi religieuse </b> religious faith <br><b> la pub </b> (coll.) advertisement <br><b> c'est dommage </b> it's a pity <br><b> les m\u00e9chants </b> the baddies <br><b> les grands </b> (coll.) adults <br><b> son personnage </b> his/her character <br><b> \u00eatre au courant </b> to know about <br><b> y croire </b> to believe in <br><b> faire un pied de nez </b> to cock a snook</p> <p>\u0095 Find out more on <a href=\"http://www.luc-besson.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Luc Besson's official internet site</a></p>",

Il pr\u00e9tend que 80 % des dialogues et des situations sont vraies, et que le reste est un m\u00e9lange de d\u00e9duction et d'imagination. \u00c0 partir du 10 mars, le film sera sur les grands \u00e9crans britanniques. Mais les jeunes fran\u00e7ais l'ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Voici les impressions et les critiques de Sara, 15 ans, Michel, 22 ans et Marianne, 18 ans. Quel est le passage du film qui t'a le plus frapp\u00e9 ? Michel: J'ai trouv\u00e9 que les sc\u00e8nes o\u00f9 Besson essayait d'exprimer la foi religieuse de Jeanne d'Arc faisaient pub de mode ou de shampooing - des tr\u00e8s belles images sans profondeur ni spiritualit\u00e9 r\u00e9elles. C'est tr\u00e8s juv\u00e9nile dans le sens o\u00f9 c'est tr\u00e8s superficiel. Marianne: Les sc\u00e8nes de combat \u00e9taient impressionnantes. De voir tous ces acteurs suivre cette chor\u00e9graphie en armure, incroyable ! \u00c7a a d\u00fb leur prendre des heures d'entranement. Qu'as-tu pens\u00e9 du film ? Sara: Je l'ai bien aim\u00e9, mes copines aussi. J'aime bien l'actrice qui joue Jeanne d'Arc et j'ai trouv\u00e9 que tout le reste s'accordait bien aussi. Je ne connaissais pas du tout l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc et j'ai eu l'impression d'apprendre. Michel: Je l'ai trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s mauvais. Les images sont tr\u00e8s belles mais il n'y a rien derri\u00e8re. Marianne: J'ai ador\u00e9. Sauf que j'ai trouv\u00e9 \u00e7a dommage qu'il n'y ait pas d'histoire d'amour. \u00c0 mon avis, c'est le meilleur film de Besson depuis Le Grand Bleu . Qui sont les m\u00e9chants ? Sara: On ne peut pas dire qu'il y ait des m\u00e9chants et des gentils, chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 est m\u00e9chant pour l'autre. Michel: Les Anglais, mais aussi en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \"les grands\". Jeanne est tr\u00e8s pu\u00e9rile et innocente. En fait, tous les bons sont des jeunes, tous les m\u00e9chants sont des adultes. Marianne: C'est pas vraiment \u00e7a l'histoire. En fait, ce qui est important, c'est Jeanne, son personnage. C'est tout de m\u00eame incroyable qu'une femme tellement courageuse et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e ait exist\u00e9 au 15e si\u00e8cle. Le film se rapproche de l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc ? Sara: Je ne sais pas, je ne suis pas trop au courant, sauf \u00e0 travers le film. Dans le film, elle a l'image d'une guerri\u00e8re. On peut bien y croire. Michel: On conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s peu l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc. Ce que l'on sait est tellement un m\u00e9lange de mythe et de r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qu'on ne peut pas vraiment faire une reconstruction de sa vie. On ne sait pas si elle \u00e9tait vraiment quelqu'un d'extraordinaire ou non. Marianne: Je pense que oui. Je sais que Besson a fait beaucoup de recherches sur l'histoire de Jeanne d'Arc avant de r\u00e9aliser son film. Est-ce qu'un film bas\u00e9 sur l'histoire doit respecter les faits historiques ? Sara: \u00c7a d\u00e9pend de ce que tu sais de l'histoire. Apr\u00e8s, il faut pr\u00e9ciser si c'est fictif ou r\u00e9el. Chez Walt Disney, ils font souvent \u00e7a - ils prennent une base et apr\u00e8s ils inventent pour que \u00e7a soit plus amusant pour les petits. Michel: Non, pas du tout. Parce qu'un film, c'est artificiel. De toute fa\u00e7on, c'est tellement dur, il y a tellement de faits qui sont contest\u00e9s, il y en a tr\u00e8s peu qui sont tr\u00e8s nets ou clairs. Marianne: Oui, c'est tr\u00e8s important. Sinon, \u00e0 quoi \u00e7a sert ? La seule question, c'est est-ce qu'on peut toujours faire confiance aux r\u00e9alisateurs ? Et le fait qu'un film fran\u00e7ais soit r\u00e9alis\u00e9 en anglais ? Sara: Je n'y ai m\u00eame pas pens\u00e9. \u00c7a ne m'a pas surprise car la plupart des films sont en anglais. En plus, Milla Jovovich (Jeanne), \u00e9tait la femme de Besson \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. En plus, elle joue souvent des r\u00f4les comme \u00e7a. Du coup, \u00e7a ne m'a pas trop choqu\u00e9e qu'il l'ait choisie et qu'il ait tourn\u00e9 le film en anglais. Michel: Je trouve \u00e7a ironique parce que Jeanne d'Arc est le symbole du Front national en France. Je trouve que c'est une fa\u00e7on de faire un pied de nez aux nationalistes. Marianne: C'est vrai que c'est toujours plus agr\u00e9able d'aller voir un film qu'on comprend tout de suite sans lire les sous-titres. Mais \u00e7a ne m'a pas vraiment d\u00e9rang\u00e9e.

      "trailText": "<p>            I am delighted to be here today to open formally this million pound upgrading of St Thomas' Accident              and Emergency facilities - completed on time and to budget. </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> I am delighted to be here today to open formally this million pound upgrading of St Thomas' Accident and Emergency facilities - completed on time and to budget. </p> <p> As a result of the modernisation, this hospital now has new areas for receiving and assessing patients and for treating minor conditions. It also has improved facilities for treatment, resuscitation, mental health assessment and - I am pleased to see - staff. It also has an impressive state of the art digital radiology system. And later this year a new medical assessment unit for GP admissions will be built. </p> <p> It will provide the people of this part of south London with the modern high class A&amp;E services they need and deserve. The facilities you have here rank alongside the best Emergency Rooms in the US.</p> <p> As important is the fact that what is happening here is happening elsewhere in the country. The \u00a3115 million modernisation programme which we announced last year is now producing results. Over a quarter of the 244 Accident and Emergency modernisation schemes in 182 hospitals are now complete. Half will be finished by the end of April and all bar a handful will be done and dusted by the end of the year. </p> <p> This is a huge achievement. Every casualty department that needed it - that's three-quarters of the total - modernised. NHS casualty departments in their history have never had the benefit of a programme on this scale. </p> <p> Like the scheme here the projects elsewhere include new special areas for children, better links between A&amp;E and primary care, improved safety and security for staff and patients, faster access to diagnostic facilities and more assessment and observation wards. </p> <p> This is real money spent on real projects to benefit real patients. You can touch it. You can see it. </p> <p> Don't believe all that you read in the papers or hear on the radio about health care. I know there is a long way to go - but there is a real change and improvement in many parts of the NHS. </p> <p> The NHS is building more new hospitals than it has ever done. 20 are under construction and 17 more are in the pipeline. The first ones open later this year. Another big achievement that will start to transform the face of the NHS. </p> <p> It's the same with cancer equipment. With money from the NHS and the National Lottery we are funding over the next three years nearly 500 items of the most modern equipment to diagnose and treat cancer - mammography and ultrasound machines, linear accelerators and scanners. </p> <p> And we are getting in more staff too. Yesterday Alan Milburn announced the results of the latest nurse census. There were 4,500 more qualified midwives and nurses in 1999 than there were in 1998 - equivalent to an extra 3,000 full-time nursing and midwifery staff. </p> <p> It is the second year running that the numbers have risen and it is the biggest recorded rise for seven years. And since we came into government the number of full-time nurses has increased by over 4,000. Nurses are returning to the NHS - some of them are here today. </p> <p> There are more nurse training places - over 4,000 of them. More doctors - over 2,000 of them. And there will be more medical students - 1,000 of them. </p> <p> I could go on. True figures. Not invented statistics. </p> <p> The extra money that we have put into the health service is beginning to make a difference. </p> <p> But extra investment and more staff are not by themselves enough. We need modernisation too. Money and modernisation are two sides of the same coin. In this government's reform of the public services you cannot separate them. Modernisation requires money. But money without modernisation is money not well spent. </p> <p> Take A&amp;E as an example. We are getting the modern facilities. Now we need the modern ways of working to go with the modernised departments. </p> <p> I was pleased to hear that as part of designing your new A&amp;E department you examined your working practices to see what changes were needed to make the most of the new investment and to improve things for patients. </p> <p> So now you are making more use of emergency nurse practitioners in the minor treatment areas. You have someone to oversee the way beds are allocated and managed so that patients get into the right bed more quickly. And you have improved your working arrangements with social services so that when patients who are ready to go home but need some support they can be discharged without delay. </p> <p> That is exactly what I mean by money for modernisation. </p> <p> We now need to go further. We have to address the frustration that people feel when they come and wait for hours to be seen in casualty in what, if we are honest, have all too often been crowded chaotic conditions. </p> <p> The Department of Health's A&amp;E Modernisation team will be reporting within the next couple of months. It will be recommending a big overhaul in how A&amp;E works. A revolution in casualty care. Their recommendations will be wide-ranging. </p> <p> For example, slashing waiting times by doing as you have done and separating the treatment of minor injuries and illnesses from major injuries and conditions. And using NHS Direct assessment procedures to help do this. </p> <p> Giving appropriately trained nurses greater powers to order x-rays, blood tests and other diagnostic procedures, to interpret the results, give medication and discharge patients. </p> <p> Fast-tracking of patients directly to the appropriate speciality - for example, to orthopaedics for patients with fractured hips direct to orthopaedics. </p> <p> Training and empowering physiotherapist, radiographer and paramedics to take on new and extended roles. </p> <p> Focusing experienced and skilled consultants on the most complex cases. </p> <p> I know that you have anticipated many of these changes. But one of the challenges we face is to make the good things happen not just in isolated hospitals but everywhere. </p> <p> We do not want a lottery of care depending on how efficient your local hospital is. All patients wherever they live are entitled to prompt, convenient quality when they need. </p> <p> So modernisation is not something you opt in or opt out of. Of course, it will take time. But modernisation is not an optional extra. It is a 'must do'. </p> <p> Those Trusts that embrace change and modernisation will increasingly find that we leave them to get on and provide local people with a good service. We will not only get off your back, we will reward your effort. But those few that cannot or will not change can expect support and intervention - and, where necessary, someone else running the show. </p> <p> So modernisation and investment go together. </p> <p> And this investment and modernisation is for a purpose. It is investment and modernisation to build a new NHS. A different sort of health service. The new buildings, the modernised facilities, the modern equipment, the extra staff and the new ways of working are part of a concerted plan to renew the NHS for a new century. </p> <p> The health service we are creating effectively has four stages of care. </p> <p> Easy access into the Health Service through NHS Direct, through walk-in centres and through more convenient opening times in doctors' surgeries, through modern well run A&amp;E departments. That is point number one. </p> <p> Point number two: the doctors and nurses locally grouped into Primary Care Groups that can drive forward innovation in health care in their areas - providing a wide range services on one site. Far better and more efficient than the two-tier system that we inherited. </p> <p> The third stage is then for social services and community hospitals to work together to provide community and what are sometimes called step-down or intermediate services. Particularly for elderly people, who may initially need hospital care but then require intensive rehabilitation and support in a more appropriate setting. Care which as Alan Milburn put it the other week is care that is a bridge between home and hospital. </p> <p> Fourthly, an acute hospital sector, where we have the doctors and nurses and specialists and the critical care beds that we need to care for people properly. And with proper inspection and accountability in the way those hospitals are run and managed. </p> <p> The four stages or levels of care working to provide the right and convenient care for each and every patient. Modern IT systems used to connect the various levels together. So appointments can be booked from the GP surgery. Test results sent and patients' records available quickly and instantly through the latest technology. </p> <p> So, our program for the Health Service requires extra investment, which we are getting. And it requires real reform and modernisation, which we are carrying out. </p> <p> And since the NHS means so much to Britain, and the people who work in it, I do think it important that the media give a sense of balance about this issue. To read and hear some of the coverage in the past few weeks you would think no-one is being cared for; that it's hopeless, beyond repair. This is alarmist nonsense. Ninety-nine per cent of people do not get their operations cancelled on the day they are due. The vast majority get good NHS treatment. There are real problems, some of a deep and long-term nature which will require time and money and change to put right. </p> <p> But there are millions of people every year in Britain getting superb healthcare from the NHS. They are the norm not the exception. We will put right what is wrong. But don't tell people it is all wrong. It isn't. The NHS is a brilliant conception and with that time and money and change, its reality will once again match the vision behind it. </p> <p> It will take time, however. I repeat this point constantly, because it is the truth. But let no-one say that the NHS can not be re-built. It can be re-built. It will be re-built. </p> <p> Yes, you will always get situations which should never happen. Yes, you will sometimes get people who are treated badly when they shouldn't be. </p> <p> But the NHS is a fine institution, that given the resources and the changes necessary will once again be the pride of Britain and the envy of the rest of the world. Taking time is obvious, but it is worth taking the time to get it right. And I am confident that we will get it right.</p>",

We need modernisation too. Money and modernisation are two sides of the same coin. In this government's reform of the public services you cannot separate them. Modernisation requires money. But money without modernisation is money not well spent. Take A&amp;E as an example. We are getting the modern facilities. Now we need the modern ways of working to go with the modernised departments. I was pleased to hear that as part of designing your new A&amp;E department you examined your working practices to see what changes were needed to make the most of the new investment and to improve things for patients. So now you are making more use of emergency nurse practitioners in the minor treatment areas. You have someone to oversee the way beds are allocated and managed so that patients get into the right bed more quickly. And you have improved your working arrangements with social services so that when patients who are ready to go home but need some support they can be discharged without delay. That is exactly what I mean by money for modernisation. We now need to go further. We have to address the frustration that people feel when they come and wait for hours to be seen in casualty in what, if we are honest, have all too often been crowded chaotic conditions. The Department of Health's A&amp;E Modernisation team will be reporting within the next couple of months. It will be recommending a big overhaul in how A&amp;E works. A revolution in casualty care. Their recommendations will be wide-ranging. For example, slashing waiting times by doing as you have done and separating the treatment of minor injuries and illnesses from major injuries and conditions. And using NHS Direct assessment procedures to help do this. Giving appropriately trained nurses greater powers to order x-rays, blood tests and other diagnostic procedures, to interpret the results, give medication and discharge patients. Fast-tracking of patients directly to the appropriate speciality - for example, to orthopaedics for patients with fractured hips direct to orthopaedics. Training and empowering physiotherapist, radiographer and paramedics to take on new and extended roles. Focusing experienced and skilled consultants on the most complex cases. I know that you have anticipated many of these changes. But one of the challenges we face is to make the good things happen not just in isolated hospitals but everywhere. We do not want a lottery of care depending on how efficient your local hospital is. All patients wherever they live are entitled to prompt, convenient quality when they need. So modernisation is not something you opt in or opt out of. Of course, it will take time. But modernisation is not an optional extra. It is a 'must do'. Those Trusts that embrace change and modernisation will increasingly find that we leave them to get on and provide local people with a good service. We will not only get off your back, we will reward your effort. But those few that cannot or will not change can expect support and intervention - and, where necessary, someone else running the show. So modernisation and investment go together. And this investment and modernisation is for a purpose. It is investment and modernisation to build a new NHS. A different sort of health service. The new buildings, the modernised facilities, the modern equipment, the extra staff and the new ways of working are part of a concerted plan to renew the NHS for a new century. The health service we are creating effectively has four stages of care. Easy access into the Health Service through NHS Direct, through walk-in centres and through more convenient opening times in doctors' surgeries, through modern well run A&amp;E departments. That is point number one. Point number two: the doctors and nurses locally grouped into Primary Care Groups that can drive forward innovation in health care in their areas - providing a wide range services on one site. Far better and more efficient than the two-tier system that we inherited. The third stage is then for social services and community hospitals to work together to provide community and what are sometimes called step-down or intermediate services. Particularly for elderly people, who may initially need hospital care but then require intensive rehabilitation and support in a more appropriate setting. Care which as Alan Milburn put it the other week is care that is a bridge between home and hospital. Fourthly, an acute hospital sector, where we have the doctors and nurses and specialists and the critical care beds that we need to care for people properly. And with proper inspection and accountability in the way those hospitals are run and managed. The four stages or levels of care working to provide the right and convenient care for each and every patient. Modern IT systems used to connect the various levels together. So appointments can be booked from the GP surgery. Test results sent and patients' records available quickly and instantly through the latest technology. So, our program for the Health Service requires extra investment, which we are getting. And it requires real reform and modernisation, which we are carrying out. And since the NHS means so much to Britain, and the people who work in it, I do think it important that the media give a sense of balance about this issue. To read and hear some of the coverage in the past few weeks you would think no-one is being cared for; that it's hopeless, beyond repair. This is alarmist nonsense. Ninety-nine per cent of people do not get their operations cancelled on the day they are due. The vast majority get good NHS treatment. There are real problems, some of a deep and long-term nature which will require time and money and change to put right. But there are millions of people every year in Britain getting superb healthcare from the NHS. They are the norm not the exception. We will put right what is wrong. But don't tell people it is all wrong. It isn't. The NHS is a brilliant conception and with that time and money and change, its reality will once again match the vision behind it. It will take time, however. I repeat this point constantly, because it is the truth. But let no-one say that the NHS can not be re-built. It can be re-built. It will be re-built. Yes, you will always get situations which should never happen. Yes, you will sometimes get people who are treated badly when they shouldn't be. But the NHS is a fine institution, that given the resources and the changes necessary will once again be the pride of Britain and the envy of the rest of the world. Taking time is obvious, but it is worth taking the time to get it right. And I am confident that we will get it right.",

Jamaica were indebted to their young opener Wavell Hinds, 23, who hit 127 in their first innings total of 333. It was enough to win the match as the Leewards then collapsed to 142 all out; Courtney Walsh took 3-37, and Laurie Williams 3-21. The Leewards fought back in Jamaica's second innings, with Curtly Ambrose returning figures of 16-9-18-4, but Jimmy Adams made 51 to help set an improbable victory target of 353.

Tonight, Chelsea play Marseille in Group W of Round 27 in the top half of the first sixteenth of the draw, but instead of looking forward to a great game, we have to report the latest bother involving English fans travelling abroad to \"support\" their team. Bah.</p> <p>French police have detained seven Chelsea supporters for questioning following an alleged racial assault in Lyon. It has been reported that the fans spent last night in the town before preparing to travel south to Marseille, whose residents are surely hoping for a re-run of those crazy japes some of the more excitable English fans got up to before the Tunisia game during the last World Cup.</p> <p>Reports suggest four people were first racially abused and then physically attacked in the Lyon metro station. A security person who tried to intervene was also attacked.</p> <p><strong>BIG CUP SPECIAL</strong></p> <p>Marseille v Chelsea. It's a European game full of European players. So why not follow a live minute-by-minute match report at that top European web site Football Unlimited? It'll be written entirely in a European language as well (probably English).</p> <p><strong>TAHAR VERY MUCH</strong></p> <p>He's only been back in a managerial position for two minutes but he's already decided he needs some more of them players. Yes, the man with the consistent transfer track record (Ruud Gullit, Paul Furlong) is at it again - Southampton boss Glenn Hoddle is about to spend \u00a3500,000 on Benfica centre-back Tahar El-Khalej.</p> <p>Hod has been trying to strengthen the Saints' defence - ie. get someone in who is not Claus Lundekvam - ever since he took over from Dave Jones, but his attempts to buy Colin Hendry, who signed for Coventry, and Alan Stubbs, who did not, ended in failure. As a result, he has turned his attentions to 31-year-old El-Khalej, who eagerly came over to the Dell to spend a week trying to look fancy.</p> <p>\"I expect to sign soon,\" said the physically imposing Moroccan international today, clearly impressed with his own week's work. \"English soccer demands more physical attributes but I do not have any problems in this area,\" Tahar continued, quietly but firmly, as the Fiver made a mental note not to mess him about in any way. </p> <p>It's a tactic we advise Saints' chairman Rupert Lowe to use as well. \"I do not know where this story came from,\" Lowe rashly denied. \"If the manager decides the player is worth pursuing, then we will take it on from there. However, that has not yet been established.\" So Rupert, are you going to tell him personally if it all falls through, then?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"In some of those penalty shoot-outs between England and Germany over the years it has been difficult to keep the score. I think Franz must have forgotten the World Cup score too. He must have forgotten that Germany last staged the World Cup eight years after England. If the World Cup comes to Europe in 2006, it's clearly England's turn.\" - Bobby Charlton misjudges the length of one of those new-fangled soundbites, bless him.</p> <p><strong>SLAP UNHAPPY</strong></p> <p>Tranmere's very own brawling-scouser-who-is-not-Clint-Hill - John Aldridge - has been charged with misconduct by the FA after another weekend of soccer shame (copyright: the nation's tabloids). Aldo is alleged to have slapped Leicester's Theo Zagorakis for applauding the referee's decision to red card Hill in the annual Leicester Challenge (sponsored by Worthington).</p> <p>But what other option was open to the manager of a team boasting the most red and yellow cards in the league? A polite \"Excuse me, Mr Zagorakis, but your applause is just not cricket\" is not really the sort of response we've come to expect from a man who would struggle to get his Mersey tonsils around \"calm down, calm down\" (or even \"keep it short this time, Challinor\" come to think of it...).</p> <p>Even after the match Aldo couldn't quite bring himself to attempt to pronounce Theo's surname. \"A certain player,\" he told the post-match press conference, \"was applauding as our player was sent off and that hurt me.\" Unfortunately for Aldo, a couple of FA jobsworths lurking nearby claim they got a grandstand view of him allegedly giving a hands-on demonstration of just how hurt he was. Wounded Aldo now has 14 days to respond to the charge and request a personal hearing.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Newcastle winger Nolberto Solano has agreed to join Real Madrid for \u00a35m at the end of the season.</p> <p>Everton are the latest club linked with \u00a33m Arsenal misfit Stephen Hughes.</p> <p>Benito Carbone will demand \u00a338,000 a week to stay at Aston Villa. Villa would also have to pay Sheffield Wednesday \u00a31m to sign the player permanently.</p> <p>Newcastle and West Ham are interested in Eintracht Frankfurt winger Marco Gebhardt. The 27-year-old would cost \u00a3500,000.</p> <p>Liverpool are interested in Queen of the South's Scotland under-21 keeper David Mathieson along with midfielder Denis Boyle.</p> <p>Wigan will sign Bradford midfielder Neil Redfearn on loan later this week.</p> <p>Jordi Cruyff is discussing a move to Espanyol in the summer.</p> <p>According to Teamtalk, ex-Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam has been approached by Swindon and asked to invest in the struggling First Division club.</p> <p>Leeds are among a host of clubs following the progress of Matlock Town defender James Lukic, the nephew of John.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Dwight Yorke is fit for Manchester United's Big Cup clash with Bordeaux tomorrow at Old Trafford. </p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>ITV: The Big Match (10pm, 2am)<br> Sideshow Bob presents some bits and bobs of Marseille v Chelsea, and later on he does it again, with extra time for more bits (but no extra time for more Bob).</p> <p>Football Extra (3.35am)<br> At least five goals missed by lazy/inept cameramen - and that's guaranteed!</p> <p>Channel 4: Football Italia (2am)<br> Italians quite like it.

      "bodyText": "BIG CUP, BAD BEHAVIOUR Not a very nice welcome back for the returning Big Cup. Tonight, Chelsea play Marseille in Group W of Round 27 in the top half of the first sixteenth of the draw, but instead of looking forward to a great game, we have to report the latest bother involving English fans travelling abroad to \"support\" their team. Bah. French police have detained seven Chelsea supporters for questioning following an alleged racial assault in Lyon. It has been reported that the fans spent last night in the town before preparing to travel south to Marseille, whose residents are surely hoping for a re-run of those crazy japes some of the more excitable English fans got up to before the Tunisia game during the last World Cup. Reports suggest four people were first racially abused and then physically attacked in the Lyon metro station. A security person who tried to intervene was also attacked. BIG CUP SPECIAL Marseille v Chelsea. It's a European game full of European players. So why not follow a live minute-by-minute match report at that top European web site Football Unlimited? It'll be written entirely in a European language as well (probably English). TAHAR VERY MUCH He's only been back in a managerial position for two minutes but he's already decided he needs some more of them players. Yes, the man with the consistent transfer track record (Ruud Gullit, Paul Furlong) is at it again - Southampton boss Glenn Hoddle is about to spend \u00a3500,000 on Benfica centre-back Tahar El-Khalej. Hod has been trying to strengthen the Saints' defence - ie. get someone in who is not Claus Lundekvam - ever since he took over from Dave Jones, but his attempts to buy Colin Hendry, who signed for Coventry, and Alan Stubbs, who did not, ended in failure. As a result, he has turned his attentions to 31-year-old El-Khalej, who eagerly came over to the Dell to spend a week trying to look fancy. \"I expect to sign soon,\" said the physically imposing Moroccan international today, clearly impressed with his own week's work. \"English soccer demands more physical attributes but I do not have any problems in this area,\" Tahar continued, quietly but firmly, as the Fiver made a mental note not to mess him about in any way. It's a tactic we advise Saints' chairman Rupert Lowe to use as well. \"I do not know where this story came from,\" Lowe rashly denied. \"If the manager decides the player is worth pursuing, then we will take it on from there. However, that has not yet been established.\" So Rupert, are you going to tell him personally if it all falls through, then? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"In some of those penalty shoot-outs between England and Germany over the years it has been difficult to keep the score. I think Franz must have forgotten the World Cup score too. He must have forgotten that Germany last staged the World Cup eight years after England. If the World Cup comes to Europe in 2006, it's clearly England's turn.\" - Bobby Charlton misjudges the length of one of those new-fangled soundbites, bless him. SLAP UNHAPPY Tranmere's very own brawling-scouser-who-is-not-Clint-Hill - John Aldridge - has been charged with misconduct by the FA after another weekend of soccer shame (copyright: the nation's tabloids). Aldo is alleged to have slapped Leicester's Theo Zagorakis for applauding the referee's decision to red card Hill in the annual Leicester Challenge (sponsored by Worthington). But what other option was open to the manager of a team boasting the most red and yellow cards in the league? A polite \"Excuse me, Mr Zagorakis, but your applause is just not cricket\" is not really the sort of response we've come to expect from a man who would struggle to get his Mersey tonsils around \"calm down, calm down\" (or even \"keep it short this time, Challinor\" come to think of it...). Even after the match Aldo couldn't quite bring himself to attempt to pronounce Theo's surname. \"A certain player,\" he told the post-match press conference, \"was applauding as our player was sent off and that hurt me.\" Unfortunately for Aldo, a couple of FA jobsworths lurking nearby claim they got a grandstand view of him allegedly giving a hands-on demonstration of just how hurt he was. Wounded Aldo now has 14 days to respond to the charge and request a personal hearing. THE RUMOUR MILL Newcastle winger Nolberto Solano has agreed to join Real Madrid for \u00a35m at the end of the season. Everton are the latest club linked with \u00a33m Arsenal misfit Stephen Hughes. Benito Carbone will demand \u00a338,000 a week to stay at Aston Villa. Villa would also have to pay Sheffield Wednesday \u00a31m to sign the player permanently. Newcastle and West Ham are interested in Eintracht Frankfurt winger Marco Gebhardt. The 27-year-old would cost \u00a3500,000. Liverpool are interested in Queen of the South's Scotland under-21 keeper David Mathieson along with midfielder Denis Boyle. Wigan will sign Bradford midfielder Neil Redfearn on loan later this week. Jordi Cruyff is discussing a move to Espanyol in the summer. According to Teamtalk, ex-Wimbledon chairman Sam Hammam has been approached by Swindon and asked to invest in the struggling First Division club. Leeds are among a host of clubs following the progress of Matlock Town defender James Lukic, the nephew of John.

      "bodyText": "At least 50 people were killed in riots in south-east Nigeria yesterday in a reaction to the deaths of hundreds of people in religious bloodshed in northern Nigeria last week, witnesses said. Residents of the southeastern city of Aba said the violence pitted local Christian Ibos against Hausa-speaking immigrants from Muslim northern Nigeria. \"In Aba itself I counted over 50 bodies. Many were burned in the street and angry youths were chanting war songs and dancing round the city,\" one witness said. The violence has uncomfortable parallels with the run up to civil war in 1967, when the killing of thousands of Ibos in northern Nigeria and the sub sequent flight of tens of thousands more helped trigger the south-east's bid to secede. An estimated 1m people died before the breakaway state of Biafra was defeated by forces from the rest of the diverse West African country. An upsurge of ethnic and religious conflict since President Olusegun Obasanjo took office last May to end 15 years of military rule has again thrown doubt over the future of the country, which, with a population of 108m, is Africa's most populous. Security forces have been hard pressed to deal with the killings. Residents said the riots were a direct response to the violence in the north, which erupted last Monday at a protest by Christians against Muslim demands for the introduction of Islamic sharia law in the state of Kaduna. \"There was a meeting last night among the traders and it was said that Ibo traders were killed in the Kaduna riots.

Certainly, in my corner of Cheshire, it is now a rare sight, so to have two in view at the same time was quite an event for the diary. I had chosen one of those days in the past fortnight when it wasn't raining, sleeting or snowing, to walk over the farmland outside the village in the hope of finding some elusive flocks of roosting lapwings or golden plovers, in an area where, in the past as many as 3,000 of these winter visitors would return each year to the same fields. Having walked alongside a mile or so of neatly clipped hawthorn hedgerows, many of which were already sprouting fresh green leaves of spring, and climbed over numerous farm gates, I found a field where a flock of disturbed birds flew up into a group of roadside oak trees. It was a mixed party of winter thrushes - redwings, and chaffinches who had left still more chaffinches feeding amongst the short turf along with some 15 or more meadow pipits. Up to that stage, I had taken what looked like two clumps of soil as part of the scenery, then I detected a slight movement and through the binoculars found a large, staring eye looking straight at me. It was a pair of brown hares hugging the ground with black tipped ears laid flat, and each darktopped tail pressed down into the grass. One stood up and loped unhurriedly to the far corner of the field, showing off the orange tinges of breast and flanks, leaving its mate still lying motionless on the ground. I stood watching them for a while longer, before moving on to continue my search for the lapwings, conscious of the fact that they lived their whole lives in a totally open habitat, where cold and wet weather must have been as much of a challenge to survival as avoiding predators.</p>",

I had chosen one of those days in the past fortnight when it wasn't raining, sleeting or snowing, to walk over the farmland outside the village in the hope of finding some elusive flocks of roosting lapwings or golden plovers, in an area where, in the past as many as 3,000 of these winter visitors would return each year to the same fields. Having walked alongside a mile or so of neatly clipped hawthorn hedgerows, many of which were already sprouting fresh green leaves of spring, and climbed over numerous farm gates, I found a field where a flock of disturbed birds flew up into a group of roadside oak trees. It was a mixed party of winter thrushes - redwings, and chaffinches who had left still more chaffinches feeding amongst the short turf along with some 15 or more meadow pipits. Up to that stage, I had taken what looked like two clumps of soil as part of the scenery, then I detected a slight movement and through the binoculars found a large, staring eye looking straight at me. It was a pair of brown hares hugging the ground with black tipped ears laid flat, and each darktopped tail pressed down into the grass. One stood up and loped unhurriedly to the far corner of the field, showing off the orange tinges of breast and flanks, leaving its mate still lying motionless on the ground. I stood watching them for a while longer, before moving on to continue my search for the lapwings, conscious of the fact that they lived their whole lives in a totally open habitat, where cold and wet weather must have been as much of a challenge to survival as avoiding predators.",

While peaceful thus far, the incidents follow speeches by President Robert Mugabe, key ministers, and articles in the state-controlled press that claimed the government would be justified in seizing white-owned land. Mr Mugabe's critics claim that the new wave of squatting is an orchestrated ploy to distract public attention from recent widespread flooding, fuel shortages, and general economic decline. The squatting began on Sunday in Norton on the outskirts of Harare, where a television crew from the state-run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, with prior notice of the squatters' plans, was able to film hundreds cheering and singing as they marched on to the farm. \"We fought for the land and would therefore like to warn those that might be thinking of fighting us off the land that we trained to be soldiers, and are still soldiers,\" said Joseph Chinotimba, a spokesman for the squatters who is also treasurer of the War Veterans Association. \"Our tractors are moving on to the farm to prepare land for our people and we will not like to hear that any of our comrades has been moved.\" He said the war veterans were angered by the recent rejection of a constitutional draft which would have authorised the government to seize white-owned farms without paying compensation. He warned white farmers to \"cooperate or risk losing all their land\". For 20 years, Mr Mugabe has promised to give poor black peasants the white-owned farms, but his government has not delivered. Instead, many farms purchased for resettlement were turned over to cabinet ministers, generals and others with connections to the ruling Zanu-PF party.

      "body": "<p>Ken Livingstone was last night preparing to take the greatest gamble of his career and announce, possibly on Thursday, that he will stand as an independent in London's mayoral elections.</p> <p>A Labour spokesman revealed before a meeting between Mr Livingstone and the deputy prime minister -expected to mark the final parting of the ways with the leadership - that the party hierarchy had now all but given up on a reconciliation with the former greater London council leader. The party \"assumes\" Mr Livingstone will declare his candidacy later this week.</p> <p>Both sides had manoeuvred throughout the day to avoid blame for the expected failure of the planned face-to-face encounter between John Prescott and the Brent East MP.</p> <p>Referring to Labour's controversial tube policy and mayoral selection fiasco, two statements from Mr Livingstone during the day emphasised his wish to use the meeting to \"do everything in my power to avoid my party finding itself in confrontation with the wishes of the great majority of Londoners\". With regard to his own opposition to plans for partly privatising the tube, he said he wanted to help the party resolve the crisis \"by allowing Londoners to vote for the candidate and the policy backed by the majority of Labour members\".</p> <p>However, Downing Street and Labour's Millbank headquarters made clear there would be no horse-trading with the man who won most Labour party and trade union members' votes, but who narrowly lost to Frank Dobson in the electoral college.</p> <p>\"Last week we were happy to be conciliatory, but now the mood has changed,\" Labour's spokesman said. \"There can be no question of asking Frank Dobson to stand down or ripping up plans for the tube. Nor is there any question of allowing him to use the meeting with Mr Prescott as an excuse to walk away from the party.</p> <p>\"If he does stand as an independent, we're going to hit him hard. His private life [is] out, but we will focus on what he has said and done - and the contradictions. We will also highlight the threat he poses to jobs, investment, taxation and debt to London and Londoners, and we'll see what happens to his opinion poll lead. The campaign will be tough and unrelenting\".</p> <p>The Labour machine's new stance, which amounts to a declaration of political war, follows days of communication between Millbank and Mr Livingstone's campaign office, much of it through an intermediary, Anne Harradine, a former Labour agent in Brent East. It is understood that Mr Livingstone and his advisers took the decision in principle yesterday to launch an independent campaign - which would only be reversed if the Labour leadership made a major concession on its plans for the tube.</p> <p>Despite misgivings from his family and friends about the potential dirtiness of the campaign - and the opposition to a break with the party from leftwing Labour allies - Mr Livingstone has been buoyed by poll findings showing him as the runaway favourite for mayor among Londoners.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Labour's Lord Whitty told the House of Lords yesterday that he believed there could be compromise over the deadlock on free-mail delivery for London's mayoral election, scheduled for 4 May. The issue, due to be debated tonight, has been a factor in Mr Livingstone's calculations, with fears that the government might use the row to postpone the election date.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone was last night preparing to take the greatest gamble of his career and announce, possibly on Thursday, that he will stand as an independent in London's mayoral elections. A Labour spokesman revealed before a meeting between Mr Livingstone and the deputy prime minister -expected to mark the final parting of the ways with the leadership - that the party hierarchy had now all but given up on a reconciliation with the former greater London council leader. The party \"assumes\" Mr Livingstone will declare his candidacy later this week. Both sides had manoeuvred throughout the day to avoid blame for the expected failure of the planned face-to-face encounter between John Prescott and the Brent East MP. Referring to Labour's controversial tube policy and mayoral selection fiasco, two statements from Mr Livingstone during the day emphasised his wish to use the meeting to \"do everything in my power to avoid my party finding itself in confrontation with the wishes of the great majority of Londoners\". With regard to his own opposition to plans for partly privatising the tube, he said he wanted to help the party resolve the crisis \"by allowing Londoners to vote for the candidate and the policy backed by the majority of Labour members\". However, Downing Street and Labour's Millbank headquarters made clear there would be no horse-trading with the man who won most Labour party and trade union members' votes, but who narrowly lost to Frank Dobson in the electoral college. \"Last week we were happy to be conciliatory, but now the mood has changed,\" Labour's spokesman said. \"There can be no question of asking Frank Dobson to stand down or ripping up plans for the tube. Nor is there any question of allowing him to use the meeting with Mr Prescott as an excuse to walk away from the party. \"If he does stand as an independent, we're going to hit him hard. His private life [is] out, but we will focus on what he has said and done - and the contradictions. We will also highlight the threat he poses to jobs, investment, taxation and debt to London and Londoners, and we'll see what happens to his opinion poll lead. The campaign will be tough and unrelenting\". The Labour machine's new stance, which amounts to a declaration of political war, follows days of communication between Millbank and Mr Livingstone's campaign office, much of it through an intermediary, Anne Harradine, a former Labour agent in Brent East. It is understood that Mr Livingstone and his advisers took the decision in principle yesterday to launch an independent campaign - which would only be reversed if the Labour leadership made a major concession on its plans for the tube. Despite misgivings from his family and friends about the potential dirtiness of the campaign - and the opposition to a break with the party from leftwing Labour allies - Mr Livingstone has been buoyed by poll findings showing him as the runaway favourite for mayor among Londoners. Meanwhile, Labour's Lord Whitty told the House of Lords yesterday that he believed there could be compromise over the deadlock on free-mail delivery for London's mayoral election, scheduled for 4 May. The issue, due to be debated tonight, has been a factor in Mr Livingstone's calculations, with fears that the government might use the row to postpone the election date.",

      "bodyText": "The Moors murderer Ian Brady arrived at court under armed police guard yesterday to plead with a high court judge for the right to starve himself to death. Brady, 62, who started a hunger strike five months ago, was taken from Ashworth hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, to the Queen Elizabeth II court complex in Liverpool city centre, where he entered a courtroom for the first time since his conviction for the sadistic murders of three children nearly 34 years ago. In a four-day hearing behind closed doors, his lawyers will argue that the hospital has no legal right to force feed him by tube. He began his hunger strike when he was transferred from a relatively relaxed ward to a more secure ward for patients with severe personality disorders. The thinking behind Brady's death wish emerged in a long letter he sent to the BBC. He expressed envy of his accomplice Myra Hindley, who is suffering from a life-threatening brain condition. \"Myra gets the potentially fatal brain condition, whilst I have to fight simply to die. I have had enough. I want nothing, my objective is to die and release myself from this once and for all,\" he wrote. \"So you see my death strike is rational and pragmatic. I'm only sorry I didn't do it decades ago, and I'm eager to leave this cesspit in a coffin.\" A leaked report of an independent investigation into Brady's complaints about his treatment by Professor David Sines of South Bank university in London, links his hunger strike with the way he was transferred to the new ward. Managers feared he might commit suicide on the more low security ward, and that he might become a target for a sniper because it was on the edge of the hospital. The report accuses the hospital authorities of mismanaging the transfer. He was marched without warning into the new ward by six members of the hospital's restraint and control team. Two were wearing shields, even though Brady has never been violent to staff. As a general rule, adults who are capable of taking their own decisions- even those who are mentally ill - cannot lawfully be fed against their will. In 1994 a high court judge ruled that prisoners who were mentally competent were free to starve themselves to death. But Brady is no longer in the prison system, having been transferred to Ashworth, a secure hospital, in 1985. The appeal court ruled in another case in 1994 case that an adult detained under the mental health act can be force-fed if self-starvation is a consequence or symptom of the mental disorder. A psychiatrist who was asked by Ashworth for a second opinion said this applied in Brady's case, according to the report, in which Brady is diagnosed as having a psychopathic personality disorder. But another psychiatrist who examined Brady at his lawyers' request says he is capable of deciding for himself and should be allowed to die. Brady was jailed for life at Chester Assizes in May 1966 for the murders of Lesley Ann Downey, 10, Edward Evans, 17, and John Kilbride, 12. He later admitted killing Pauline Reade, 16 and Keith Bennett, 12. His solicitor, Robin Makin, said Brady was very pleased to have reached a court hearing. Apart from arguing that Brady is capable of deciding for himself, his lawyers are expected to contend that force-feeding him is a breach of his right to a private life under the European convention on human rights. The judge, Mr Justice Maurice Kay, closed the court at Brady's lawyers' request and said his judgment, not expected this week, will be delivered in public. In his letter to the BBC, Brady said: \"My life is now over and the present hunger-thirst strike of four months duration is to the death. I have not the least interest in being kept artificially alive _ My main objective is to comprehensively expose this regime to public scrutiny and bring the force of law to bear on it.\"",

      "bodyText": "The bishops of the Church of England came under heavy pressure from lay members last night for their \"weakness\" in not firmly opposing the government's plan to repeal section 28, which forbids local authorities from promoting homosexuality in schools. A yawning gap appeared to be opening on the first day of the synod of the Church of England in London between senior clergy, anxious to influence the government's revised plans for sex education, and members, particularly from the church's evangelical wing which wants the section preserved. In increasingly heated exchanges, the Rt Rev Alan Chesters, Bishop of Blackburn, who chairs the church's board of education, came close to agreeing that the section should be abandoned. Asked by Archdeacon Peter Broadbent, a former Islington Labour councillor, why the \"very badly designed and drafted\" legislation should not be repealed, the bishop replied: \"I would not demur from that.\" Outside the synod, in Convocation Hall of Church House, under the stern gaze of a portrait of the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Gordon-Lang - now thought to have been gay - opponents of repealing the section mounted an exhibition of literature which they claim would flood schools if the legislation was changed. It included such famous works as the 1980s book Jenny Lives With Eric And Martin and more recent publications put out by health authorities. Opponents of repeal claimed that the bishops should have supported Scotland's Roman Catholic Cardinal Thomas Winning in vociferously supporting the retention of the section, which was originally enacted in 1988. Only four bishops voted at the end of the debate in the House of Lords earlier this month at which the repeal proposal was voted down. The bishops voted three to one against repeal. Philip Gore, a lay member of the board of social responsibility, said: \"Many members of the church are incensed. \"They feel let down by the perceived weakness of the bishops as opposed to the stronger stance of Cardinal Winning.\" The Bishop of Blackburn appeared increasingly exasperated by the questioning he was subjected to by some synod members, insisting that as sex education in schools is now determined by governing bodies there was no question of local authorities interfering. He and Bishop Vincent Nicols, the Roman Catholic Archbishop-elect of Birmingham, have met David Blunkett, the education secretary, to try to secure the assurance that marriage would take a central place in any legislative framework for sex education put forward by the government. Such moves have fuelled lay suspicions that a deal has been done privately. Mr Gore, a Manchester member of the synod, said after the debate: \"The church is going to betray countless thousands of young people and their parents. \"The vast majority of parents in this country are opposed to this sort of stuff being promoted in schools and they look to the established church to provide firm opposition. \"The bishop is in the pocket of the government.\"",

In what prosecutors described as the first case to deal directly with \"a system of concentration camps\", Miroslav Kvocka, Milojica Kos and Mlado Radic were charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity for presiding over the atrocities at Omarska and other sites. A fourth defendant, Zoran Zigic, a Bosnian Serb taxi driver, is accused of torturing and murdering prisoners. The Australian prosecutor, Grant Niemann, told the Hague trbunal judges that \"the images of skeletal malnutrition . . . sent shock waves around the world\", when they were first broadcast. Omarska was, he alleged, an integral part of the ethnic cleansing policy of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic: \"This is about a government policy of persecution and ethnic cleansing. It was a crime committed on a massive scale,\" he said. \"The evidence will prove that thousands of Muslim and Croat detainees suffered and died because of their ethnicity, either directly at the hands of these accused or people under their authority,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "The lunacy of London's indices was illustrated once again yesterday. In the morning, the telecoms sector went up, driving the FTSE 100 index to a high of 6,271 points; in the afternoon, the telecoms sector went into reverse, leaving the index a net 98.4 points adrift at 6,099.6. In fact, the decline in Vodafone - Britain's biggest company, which ended the day 19p lower at 343p - shaved 46 points off the Footsie. But there was plenty of news to keep investors busy. While in the background the debate over the so-called split market continued - with \"old\" economy stocks plummeting and tech issues soaring - there were some old-fashioned results statements to deal with. South African mining group Billiton produced profits in line with expectations, but watched its share price drop from 286p to 267p. Fellow sector member Rio Tinto met with the same market reaction when it issued its own results last week. In the banking sector, there was a wave of buying in the wake of the sector sector-wide sell-off. Royal Bank of Scotland , for example, ended the day 56p higher at 760p, NatWest (in the process of being bought by RBS) gained 59p to \u00a311.29 and Lloyds TSB firmed 21p to 540p. Analysts at Warburg Dillon Read joined the list of Baltimore Technology fans, adding the Irish software group to its 30-strong European Focus list. The shares, which were trading below 500p last year, surged 450p to \u00a3107. ITnet was another high-technology advancer. The outsourcing specialist climbed 152p to \u00a311.40 following Friday's news that it had agreed a joint venture with Infobank to build an online procurement service for local government. There was some profit-taking in internet investment specialist Durlacher , which lost 235p to \u00a333.25 despite confirmation that it is backing a new pop-on-the-web venture run by artist manager Simon Fuller. Other tech fallers included JSB Software , down 500p at \u00a329.75, London Bridge Software , losing 245p to \u00a361.50, BATM Advanced Communications , 220p lower at \u00a356.75, and Psion , which fell from \u00a354.95 to \u00a353.24. Yet there was still heavy demand for yesterday's crop of new issues on the Aim market. Griff-Tech.com , the unlikely internet acquisition vehicle spun off by Griffin Mining, jumped from an offer price of 3p to 16p. Stockbroker Peel Hunt also had an exceptional first day out. Although not quite in the dot.com arena, the stock jumped from a sale price of 300p to 520p.",

Like the Bank of England before it, the NHS needs to be severed from politics to a far greater extent than it ever has been. This is not a plea for privatisation: far from it. It is a plea for state-funded independence. </p> <p>Put simply, the NHS needs a clear identity of its own.

The NHS does not. </p> <p>In the NHS the medical establishment and its advisers still make all the key decisions. Patients' opinions hardly get a look in. Communication is a two-way process, and many hospitals, surgeries, doctors and nurses communicate with their local patients wonderfully. But the NHS doesn't communicate with its patients at all. Why not? There are a couple of plausible explanations. First, involving customers will cost money. In a cash-stretched NHS, surely every penny should go on medicine rather than communication? </p> <p>Second, and more fundamentally, the apportionment of medical resources within the NHS is fiendishly complicated. Results can take years to achieve, the cost-effectiveness benefits are usually unquantifiable, and they can be disputed ad infinitum. How could ignorant patients contribute to such sophisticated debates?

The unremitting popular belief that things are going from bad to worse staunches recruitment like a tourniquet. Public discontent demoralises all those working in the NHS - doctors, nurses, therapists, administrators, everyone. Governments respond in panic to media flak, which hinders objective analysis, long-term planning and wise investment. </p> <p>Governments, of all persuasions, lurch from side to side on a plethora of issues: the importance of hospital waiting lists, the primacy of life-threatening diseases, the price of drugs, the cost of treating the terminally ill, the acceptability of spending money on services - from cosmetic surgery to Viagra, from infertility to obesity, from pychoanalysis to regular screening - which maybe should not come within the NHS's bailiwick. What do the public think? Or don't their views matter? </p> <p>To provide the NHS with greater independence and more public involvement would call for strong political will, and considerable managerial reorganisation. And to make it work, three key areas would need to be explored. </p> <p>First, market research. Lacking a consumer market mechanism based on price, the NHS needs to develop its own research systems for investigating consumers' (the public's) views and opinions about needs and priorities. This will obviously not be easy. Respondents will need to have alternatives explained simply, the implications spelled out, and the issues brought out honestly. It will no doubt take time to develop researchers and techniques with the necessary diagnostic skills. There will doubtless be teething problems. But other industries have faced similar difficulties. They are not incurable. </p> <p> Nor should it be assumed that the findings of such research would need to be followed slavishly by the medical profession. Far from it. Contrary to conventional opinion, neither businessmen nor politicians invariably follow market research findings. But it must always be right to know the public's views about important issues, especially when it is necessary to override them. </p> <p>Second, identity. For the public to develop a greater trust in the NHS it is essential for it to have a clear and engaging identity. In crude terms this means a brand, a logo, a corporate design scheme. Without a clear visual identity the NHS will remain a nebulous entity. The NHS is a complicated concept with, as we have seen, fuzzy edges. It asks altogether too much of people to expect them to feel good about an abstract institution with no visible image, no public face. </p> <p>Third, communication. Once the first two steps have been taken, there will be a strong case for communicating the whys and wherefores of the NHS to the public, by way of informative advertising, which would aim to redress the constant flow of bad news in the media. This will raise hackles, but would bolster public understanding, and simultaneously boost staff morale and recruitment - a standard task for corporate advertising of this kind. The campaign could incorporate a hotline, to generate interactive response. (Naturally it would be essential to divert personal medical enquiries to NHS Direct, but that again would not be impossible.) </p> <p>The advertising (and other) communications should be both national and local. The aim would be to ensure the public appreciates and accepts the way its money is being spent on its health. And it would force the NHS to explain publicly what it was up to, which would be no bad thing. As medicine grows ever more intricate, and expensive, it will be increasingly vital for the medical profession to counter bad publicity and carry the public with them. </p> <p>As everyone knows, by international standards expenditure on health and medical services in Britain is appallingly low, and the poorer income groups within the population suffer disproportionately. Discovering what the public wants, packaging it identifiably, and communicating what is being offered will, together, give the NHS more independence than it has ever had before. By NHS standards the costs would be minimal.

The doctor later escapes from prison and dedicates his life to tracking down the murderer. That's the plot of The Fugitive, the 60s TV show, in which David Janssen starred as the ill-fated Dr Richard Kimble; the same premise was later recycled for a movie featuring Harrison Ford. All a little far-fetched, perhaps, but it pales in comparison with the real life events which inspired it, as detailed in The Fugitive: The Final Chapter (tonight, 9.30pm, BBC1). </p> <p>\"I didn't know The Fugitive was based on a true story,\" admits producer/director Mike Robinson. \"I had no idea.\" That changed, however, when \"the assistant producer Paul Dwyer saw a two-line story on the net about a new case involving Sam Sheppard, and it just went from there.\" </p> <p>In a tale with all the elements of a classic thriller, Dr Sam Sheppard was accused of murdering his wife, Marilyn, on Independence Day 1954.

      "bodyText": "A doctor accused of murdering his wife claims to be innocent, maintaining that a one-armed man he saw fleeing the crime scene is the real killer. The doctor later escapes from prison and dedicates his life to tracking down the murderer. That's the plot of The Fugitive, the 60s TV show, in which David Janssen starred as the ill-fated Dr Richard Kimble; the same premise was later recycled for a movie featuring Harrison Ford. All a little far-fetched, perhaps, but it pales in comparison with the real life events which inspired it, as detailed in The Fugitive: The Final Chapter (tonight, 9.30pm, BBC1). \"I didn't know The Fugitive was based on a true story,\" admits producer/director Mike Robinson. \"I had no idea.\" That changed, however, when \"the assistant producer Paul Dwyer saw a two-line story on the net about a new case involving Sam Sheppard, and it just went from there.\" In a tale with all the elements of a classic thriller, Dr Sam Sheppard was accused of murdering his wife, Marilyn, on Independence Day 1954. His subsequent trial and conviction included accusations of adultery, the discovery his wife had been pregnant at the time of her death, and the doctor's mother committing suicide. The current court case, as documented tonight, is being brought by Sam Reese Sheppard, the couple's son - seven years old at the time of his mother's murder - for damages against the state of Ohio for the wrongful incarceration of his father.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair came under renewed attack last night for alienating Labour's grassroots when a home office minister and the newly-elected leader of Britain's largest trade union waded into the row over the leadership's treatment of heartland supporters. Less than 24 hours after John Prescott admitted that the Labour leadership was failing to inspire its core voters, the home office minister, Charles Clarke, accused Downing Street of deliberately provoking rows with traditional supporters. His remarks came as Dave Prentis, the new leader of the public service union Unison, warned that voters would desert Labour because of the government's failure to improve services. Downing Street is likely to brush off the criticisms from Mr Prentis, who was yesterday elected as general secretary of Unison, as the usual trade union whingeing. But the concerns of Mr Clarke, who used to be one of Labour's most powerful figures when he served as Neil Kinnock's chief of staff, will be more difficult to dismiss. In an interview with BBC Online, Mr Clarke said that Downing Street appeared to take delight in distancing itself from the party's heartlands. \"I think sometimes there have been points at which the group around Tony, with or without his agreement I don't know, have sometimes sought to distinguish themselves from certain elements within Labour,\" he said. Mr Clarke said that figures in Downing Street - dismissed last year by Mr Prescott as the \"faceless wonders\" - appeared to go out of their way to provoke leftwingers such as the foreign office minister, Peter Hain, who claimed last year that New Labour was being \"gratuitously offensive\" to its own supporters. \"I think there were some people around Tony at some points who thought there was political advantage to be gained from sparking such a reaction,\" said Mr Clarke, who refuses to describe himself as \"New Labour\". His remarks were echoed by Mr Prentis who warned the prime minister of the dangers of failing to listen to public sector workers. Mr Prentis, who revealed that Unison planned to seek a judicial review of government proposals to give priority to private contractors in local government services, said: \"As far as public service workers are concerned, the government hasn't delivered on its promises. There is a serious danger of a substantial part of the electorate deserting Labour.\" Mr Prentis warned that Downing Street's failure to de liver on its commitments would not just dent Labour's support among core voters. \"It is not just about traditional voters - middle England wants its hospitals and its schools and if the government doesn't deal with the underfunding crisis, they will walk away,\" he said. Such criticism from an official who is regarded as middle-of the road reflects the fright Unison's leadership had last month, when early feedback from its leadership campaign pointed to a possible victory for Roger Bannister, Mr Prentis' main leftist opponent. In the event, Mr Prentis - who takes over from Rodney Bickerstaffe next January - won 125,584 votes, compared to 71,021 for Mr Bannister on a 17% turnout. Mr Prentis yesterday called for a more serious dialogue with the government, attacking the \"bias towards the private sector\" in the government's best value and private finance initiative policies. The criticisms from Mr Clarke and Mr Prentis came after the prime minister warned, in his Labour party anniversary speech on Sunday, that he would not bow to pressure from disillusioned activists.",

The closing line is, \"It could happen.\" This week came a more upbeat message - \"What makes Bill Bradley a winner?\" - showing him as a young Rhodes scholar and as a basketball star. This leads to the ad's conclusion: \"When Bill Bradley wins, you win. But first, you've got to give him the ball.\" Mr Bradley's team has also decided to try to undermine the Democrat frontrunner, Al Gore. A 60-second ad campaign on radio urges people to look at a website set up to pose questions about the vice-president - moreaboutgore.com - and deliver what are intended to be damning answers. In the website ad, a female voice says: \"As a conservative congressman from Tennessee, Al Gore voted against a woman's right to choose 84% of the time ... Al Gore voted against strengthening an assault weapons ban and against gun control so often that the National Rifle Association said 'We could have made Al Gore NRA man of the year'.\" The vice-president hits back with a commercial in which James Brady, the aide paralysed by a bullet aimed at President Reagan in 1981, praises Mr Gore: \"He's taken on the gun lobby.\" In another commercial, Mr Gore is shown as a mountaineer, the belief being that health-conscious Californians like an outdoor man. He is seen with his son climbing the 14,000ft Mt Rainier in Washington state. In the voice-over, the president of the American alpine club, Jim Frush, compliments Mr Gore for not turning back despite bad conditions. \"Strength of character, perseverance, grace under pressure - these are qualities you look for in a mountaineer; they're even better in a president.\"",

      "body": "<p>In 1963, Frederick Ashton turned Alexandre Dumas's play La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias into a ballet called Marguerite and Armand for Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. The buzz surrounding the ballet, which charted the affair between a fiery youth and a consumptive courtesan, was extraordinary. After Nureyev's defection in 1961, the world had become transfixed by the chemistry between him and Britain's greatest ballerina, a woman nearly twice his age. The public avidly speculated that their on-stage electricity was generated by a secret love affair. Given Nureyev's homosexuality and Fonteyn's saintly commitment to her husband this was unlikely. But it was a story everyone wanted to believe. </p> <p>Fifty photographers attended its dress rehearsal, and the first-night audience reacted so enthusiastically that the stars took 21 curtain calls. The ballet became known as Nureyev and Fonteyn's signature piece, and so infused was it with their personalities that no one else has ever performed it. After their deaths (hers in 1991, his, prematurely, in 1993), it was assumed the ballet had died also. Yet this season the Royal Ballet has, unexpectedly, brought Marguerite and Armand back to the stage. </p> <p>The woman chosen to dance the legendary Fonteyn role is Sylvie Guillem. It is easy to see why Anthony Dowell, the Royal's director, should turn to her. She's one of the few ballerinas who can match Fonteyn's starry eminence, and she has the artistic clout to perform the role. Yet when Dowell first approached her three years ago, she turned him down, feeling that it was too soon after the deaths of the original stars. </p> <p>When I asked her last week why she'd finally agreed to risk it, Guillem was lying on a couch with her left leg wired up by her physiotherapist to a pain-relieving Tens machine. She was trying to limit the damage from a kick inadvertently delivered by her partner, Johnny Cope, during rehearsal. The fact that she was captive for at least 30 minutes may have explained her unusually relaxed manner. When she talked about her readiness to dance Marguerite, there was a gleam of mischief in her grey-blue eyes. \"I said, why not? It's a ballet, I'm a ballerina - and it's a beautiful part. It's not going to please a lot of people but you know, this is not a ballet called Rudolf and Margot. It is called Marguerite and Armand.\" </p> <p>Guillem's English is good but she enunciates the ballet's title with a strong French accent and it's clear that she regards it as equal parts Dumas and Ashton, equal parts French and English. It's also clear, when I watch her rehearsing, that she intends to have her own way with the role. She's not portraying Marguerite as an older woman, as Fonteyn had to, but as the original 23-year-old heroine. Nor is she imitating Fonteyn's style. Guillem's extravagantly supple body and long, lean lines inevitably shape the steps differently from Fonteyn's decorously proportioned physique and she is able to match Armand's feral emotion with muscular attack. </p> <p>Cope, who is partnering her at some performances, enthusiastically approves of Guillem's approach. \"Sylvie does it very much in her own style. She is more worldly than Margot, much less proper. She comes across almost as herself. The role suits her character the way Manon does. I think she'll have a hit with this.\" </p> <p> Manon, ballet's other famous courtesan created by Kenneth MacMillan in 1974, is a role in which Guillem scintillates. Interestingly, Marguerite and Armand, in its visceral body language and the torrid dynamics of its pas de deux, resembles MacMillan's style more closely than anything else Ashton choreographed. Yet Guillem feels that the ballet retains the subtlety and compression for which Ashton was noted. \"It's really concentrated. The more I do the choreography the more I see all its nuances. In 30 minutes Marguerite goes through the whole of her life, so I have to understand all the musicality of the choreography, all the tiny bits that make everything clear.\" </p> <p>In 1963 some dissenters complained that the ballet was no more than a kitsch vehicle for its star personalities. Guillem, who has a fastidious nose for weak or illogical choreography, disagrees. \"It's a beautiful ballet, very well made, very refined. The more I work on it, the more I see in it.\" </p> <p>Certainly she's gone deep into the background of her role, studying both the play and the earlier novel from which Dumas adapted his work, and analysing the lovers' relationship with her guest partner Nicholas Le Riche. But the role needs charisma as well as intelligence - and this Guillem has in spades. </p> <p>Even in rehearsal, with her hair bundled into a straggling plait and her long, clever face looking pale with fatigue, she simply makes you stare. Her body can move with the singing precision of a fine blade, but it can also look frail. She will look gorgeous in Marguerite's finery. She will probably die with heroic piteousness. </p> <p>The fact that Guillem has been honoured with this precious scrap of the Royal Ballet's heritage perhaps signals that relations have grown warmer between the company and its starry guest. When Guillem first started dancing in London many thought she was arrogant. \"There is a false idea that I am stubborn and do only what I want, but really I am like a sponge. I have learned a lot from this company,\" she says, but admits that \"it is in my nature to be a little shy. It takes time for me to talk to people and trust them.\" </p> <p>She also says there is a world of difference between working freelance (as she does) and being a company member. \"I can't have friends in every port. I have to work very hard and be very clear about what I want to do. I cannot just swallow everything I am told. I have to decide what I want to become part of my lug gage, and what I don't.\" Guillem uses travel metaphors a lot (she performs extensively in London, Paris, Italy, Japan and the US) and while she cherishes her freedom she says it consumes much of her energy. \"Everything I do is my own choice. A performance is like a boat. You really want it to arrive at port. So when something goes wrong and it doesn't get there, that touches me a lot.\" She finds it bizarre that some dancers become so institutionalised they lose their urgency. \"You see a few like that in companies everywhere. They come to the theatre as if they were going to a market to buy leeks. They don't care if they perform or not. I find it strange not to be a little bit proud of what you do.\" </p> <p>Despite her nomadic spirit Guillem is pleased to be spending more time in London this year. She loves the new Royal Opera House and insists several times that she likes \"this company very much. I travel a lot, and it makes me appreciate the quality that is here.\" </p> <p>There was some speculation that she might even direct the Royal after Dowell leaves, particularly given her recent success in staging Giselle for Finnish National Ballet. But while she loved that experience it made her aware of how time-consuming running a company would be, given that at 35 she still has much dancing to do. \"One day, though,\" she muses, \"why not?\" She raises her hand to her eyes as if scanning this distant possibility, then shrugs. \"But I never make plans that far ahead.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Walking into <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/home/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Seeing Salvation</a>, the National Gallery exhibition devoted to the image of Christ, is a bit of a shock. We are taken from third- or fourth-century Roman tomb inscriptions to William Holman Hunt's 1904 painting The Light of the World within a couple of steps: from the tomb to the pits with a turn of the head. Hunt's painting, with its sickly, spooky light, was so popular he painted it three times. This largest version was sent on a world tour by its owner and drew crowds wherever it went. </p> <p>There were those who claimed to have been profoundly affected by it. This is difficult to imagine today, not simply because we live in a secular age but because it is impossible to empathise with this work as a painting, much less as an object of devotion. While it was attracting the crowds in Melbourne, I remind myself, Picasso was painting the Demoiselles d'Avignon. Somehow, those roughly engraved fish and good shepherds on the stones from the Roman catacombs seem more alive, have more urgency and vitality than the Light of the World. </p> <p>Recoiling from Hunt, you turn to face Francisco de Zurbaran's The Bound Lamb, painted in the 1630s. If the show continues like this, you think, Damien Hirst's lamb in formaldehyde will be around the next corner. Thankfully, Seeing Salvation isn't quite that corny. Nor is the National Gallery's director, Neil MacGregor, trying to do a hip vicar act. But the exhibition, and the TV series that accompanies it (to be broadcast on BBC2 in the run-up to Easter), as well as MacGregor's forthcoming lecture tour, must take into account that artists, and the church, have always tried to bring Christ up to date. </p> <p>MacGregor believes the works in the exhibition \"explore truths not just for Christians, but for everybody\". For a non-believer, or those who belong to other faiths, this may at times be hard to take. European, Christian art is filled with pain and death, as well as the miraculous and redemptive. Somehow, the pain is more believable. What is the truth of a wound? There are some grim and appalling things in the exhibition: a German devotional booklet from 1330-40, with its illustrations of pincers, scourges, the paraphernalia of torture and death, which look all the more chilling for their plain, coloured-in, picture-book drawing. A 17th-century German prayer sheet, replete with close-ups of weeping wounds and bloody nails rimed with flesh. A sculpted Florentine terracotta Christ, from the 15th century, holding open the gaping hole in his side, to show us all the better. Ribalta's painting of Saint Thomas, embracing Christ on the cross, about to lick the bloody spear-wound slit, with an almost erotic fervour. Green-pallored depositions, sallow entombments, roseated, whipped, blood-gushing and spurting Christs, cowed, miserable Men of Sorrows - if one had no inkling what all this was about, and its historical and religious context, one would find it all bizarre and terrible. </p> <p>And full of pathos. There is something piteous about a tiny cradle, made for a nun to keep in her cell as an object of devotion. Or the late- 15th-century papier-mache mask of Christ's face, crowned with thorns, a ruined little thing, to be hung from a thread. Its survival alone is miraculous. Dirk Bouts's Entombment, from the National Gallery, hangs near a sculpture, Christ on the Cold Stone, from a museum in Utrecht. This naked figure, hunched and thin, awaits his destiny. He is just a man on a rock, covering his genitals with one hand, supporting his head with the other. Behind him is his future, where he looks like any other dead man. Both the sculpture and the painted Christ look undernourished and vulnerable. For them, the miracle must wait. Often, it is the things that these artworks and artefacts leave out that gives them their continuing power. </p> <p>Zurbaran's lamb of God shows us nothing more or less than a lamb like any other, with its feet crossed and bound, laying on a simple slab, awaiting slaughter. It is a wonderful painting. All the light in the painting falls on to the docile creature, which is surrounded by darkness. The drama is so furtive, so dependent on what you know is going to happen to the sheep, but which the sheep doesn't. The light falling on the lamb is austere, common daylight. The light of nature which doesn't care what lives or dies. The painting says everything and nothing; it is its own mystery, its own ritual. It is as close to a universal image as one can find here. </p> <p>A late-15th-century Netherlandish Nativity at Night, by Geertgen, shows us the Virgin and attendant angels illuminated by the new-born Christ, who is himself luminous - a glow-in-the-dark baby Jesus, as impossible to take seriously as Hunt's Light of the World. Somehow, we know too much for such images to be believable except in the most symbolic way. </p> <p>Rutilio Manetti's The Stigmatisation of Saint Catherine of Siena, from about 1630, has red laser beams shooting across to the swooning Dominican nun from a medieval painted crucifix, zapping her with Christ's stigmata. This is indeed an extraordinary painting, both compositionally and in terms of the realisation of its subject, yet the illumination in the Zurbaran is so much more convincing, and more moving and miraculous, than all these made-up spiritual evanescences. We're neither astonished nor alarmed by weird auras, glowing halos, and painted otherworldly phenomena. They may speak of a spiritual, rather than an everyday reality, but the painted machinery gets in the way, and their capacity to astound has been lost. </p> <p>Similarly, Salvador Dali's spectacular painting in which we get a god's eye-view of the crucified Christ, reaching escape velocity over the coast of Catalonia, looks like a cheap trick.

      "bodyText": "Walking into Seeing Salvation, the National Gallery exhibition devoted to the image of Christ, is a bit of a shock. We are taken from third- or fourth-century Roman tomb inscriptions to William Holman Hunt's 1904 painting The Light of the World within a couple of steps: from the tomb to the pits with a turn of the head. Hunt's painting, with its sickly, spooky light, was so popular he painted it three times. This largest version was sent on a world tour by its owner and drew crowds wherever it went. There were those who claimed to have been profoundly affected by it. This is difficult to imagine today, not simply because we live in a secular age but because it is impossible to empathise with this work as a painting, much less as an object of devotion. While it was attracting the crowds in Melbourne, I remind myself, Picasso was painting the Demoiselles d'Avignon. Somehow, those roughly engraved fish and good shepherds on the stones from the Roman catacombs seem more alive, have more urgency and vitality than the Light of the World. Recoiling from Hunt, you turn to face Francisco de Zurbaran's The Bound Lamb, painted in the 1630s. If the show continues like this, you think, Damien Hirst's lamb in formaldehyde will be around the next corner. Thankfully, Seeing Salvation isn't quite that corny. Nor is the National Gallery's director, Neil MacGregor, trying to do a hip vicar act. But the exhibition, and the TV series that accompanies it (to be broadcast on BBC2 in the run-up to Easter), as well as MacGregor's forthcoming lecture tour, must take into account that artists, and the church, have always tried to bring Christ up to date. MacGregor believes the works in the exhibition \"explore truths not just for Christians, but for everybody\". For a non-believer, or those who belong to other faiths, this may at times be hard to take. European, Christian art is filled with pain and death, as well as the miraculous and redemptive. Somehow, the pain is more believable. What is the truth of a wound? There are some grim and appalling things in the exhibition: a German devotional booklet from 1330-40, with its illustrations of pincers, scourges, the paraphernalia of torture and death, which look all the more chilling for their plain, coloured-in, picture-book drawing. A 17th-century German prayer sheet, replete with close-ups of weeping wounds and bloody nails rimed with flesh. A sculpted Florentine terracotta Christ, from the 15th century, holding open the gaping hole in his side, to show us all the better. Ribalta's painting of Saint Thomas, embracing Christ on the cross, about to lick the bloody spear-wound slit, with an almost erotic fervour. Green-pallored depositions, sallow entombments, roseated, whipped, blood-gushing and spurting Christs, cowed, miserable Men of Sorrows - if one had no inkling what all this was about, and its historical and religious context, one would find it all bizarre and terrible. And full of pathos. There is something piteous about a tiny cradle, made for a nun to keep in her cell as an object of devotion. Or the late- 15th-century papier-mache mask of Christ's face, crowned with thorns, a ruined little thing, to be hung from a thread. Its survival alone is miraculous. Dirk Bouts's Entombment, from the National Gallery, hangs near a sculpture, Christ on the Cold Stone, from a museum in Utrecht. This naked figure, hunched and thin, awaits his destiny. He is just a man on a rock, covering his genitals with one hand, supporting his head with the other. Behind him is his future, where he looks like any other dead man. Both the sculpture and the painted Christ look undernourished and vulnerable. For them, the miracle must wait. Often, it is the things that these artworks and artefacts leave out that gives them their continuing power. Zurbaran's lamb of God shows us nothing more or less than a lamb like any other, with its feet crossed and bound, laying on a simple slab, awaiting slaughter. It is a wonderful painting. All the light in the painting falls on to the docile creature, which is surrounded by darkness. The drama is so furtive, so dependent on what you know is going to happen to the sheep, but which the sheep doesn't. The light falling on the lamb is austere, common daylight. The light of nature which doesn't care what lives or dies. The painting says everything and nothing; it is its own mystery, its own ritual. It is as close to a universal image as one can find here. A late-15th-century Netherlandish Nativity at Night, by Geertgen, shows us the Virgin and attendant angels illuminated by the new-born Christ, who is himself luminous - a glow-in-the-dark baby Jesus, as impossible to take seriously as Hunt's Light of the World. Somehow, we know too much for such images to be believable except in the most symbolic way. Rutilio Manetti's The Stigmatisation of Saint Catherine of Siena, from about 1630, has red laser beams shooting across to the swooning Dominican nun from a medieval painted crucifix, zapping her with Christ's stigmata. This is indeed an extraordinary painting, both compositionally and in terms of the realisation of its subject, yet the illumination in the Zurbaran is so much more convincing, and more moving and miraculous, than all these made-up spiritual evanescences. We're neither astonished nor alarmed by weird auras, glowing halos, and painted otherworldly phenomena. They may speak of a spiritual, rather than an everyday reality, but the painted machinery gets in the way, and their capacity to astound has been lost. Similarly, Salvador Dali's spectacular painting in which we get a god's eye-view of the crucified Christ, reaching escape velocity over the coast of Catalonia, looks like a cheap trick. The centrepiece of the final room in the show, Dali's painting does at least attempt a kind of cinematic contemporaneity. Stanley Spencer's Cookham Resurrection and his Christ heading for a home counties Calvary speak a language I for one am immune to, as does Graham Sutherland's twitchy, overworked cartoon for his tapestry in Coventry cathedral. It is simply second rate, however devout Sutherland may have been. Spencer's paintings may be authentically visionary (as were Samuel Palmer's or William Blake's) but I find myself unable to enter their worlds. The problem isn't the required leap of faith itself, so much as my doubts about them as art. The story of the life of Christ endures with far more power in contemporary literature and film. Nobel prize- winning Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago and Norman Mailer have both penned fictive gospels according to Jesus himself; Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to St Matthew, Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and Dennis Potter's 60s TV play, Son of Man, have more power than almost all contemporary Christian art.

But it sometimes seems as if August Strindberg's aristocratic, seductive heroine is never away.

One just wishes our theatre would range more widely over the work of this uncomfortable genius. </p> <p>Strindberg, who died in 1912, is the father of modern drama for many playwrights.

O'Casey said \"he shakes flame from the living planets: Ibsen can sit serenely in his Doll's House while Strindberg is battling with his heaven and his hell.\" You can see his fingerprint on many modern writers, from John Osborne and Harold Pinter to Tennessee Williams and Edward Albee. </p> <p>It is easy to see why Strindberg attracts such admiration. He writes about sex, in particular the indivisibility of love and loathing, with candour. He understands the inconsistencies of the human character - in his preface to Miss Julie, written in 1888, he talks of \"the multiplicity of motives which is typical of our times\". In his Chamber plays he cuts straight to the dramatic bone. And in those weird late works, such as Storm and The Ghost Sonata, he attempts to imitate the inconsequential logic of dreams. Above all, he accords with our appetite for the extreme. In the words of the novelist, Knut Hamsun, he flung himself at everything \"with a kind of jubilant rage\". </p> <p>But Strindberg presents problems. Having started out as a vehement socialist, republican and freethinker, he became increasingly anti-feminist, reactionary and pious. He seemed to embrace endless opposites: radical and fascistic, atheistic and religious, scientific and occultist, sane and insane. In his demented later phase, he could be found doing a dance of exorcism round restaurant pots and pans to chase away evil spirits. Yet he was also a shrewd theatrical pioneer who uncannily foresaw the possibilities of intimate theatres and fluid dramatic form. </p> <p>If we are to understand Strindberg properly, we have to understand that his neurosis and his genius were inextricably intertwined. Robert Brustein pointed out in Who Needs Theatre that in the US Strindberg's plays are rarely staged lest they arouse the ire of feminists. Thankfully we have not reached that degree of intellectual panic in this country. What I would like to see is more Strindberg staged in Britain. Not just the big three - The Father, Miss Julie and The Dance of Death - but some of the rarer works such as To Damascus, There Are Crimes and Crimes and The Pelican. But we also need to tackle Strindberg with a greater awareness of his essential impurity: of his ability to mix the tragic and the comic, the naturalistic and the symbolic with a furious disregard for academic categories. </p> <p>Looking back over the great Strindberg productions I have seen, I am struck by their tonic mixture of opposites. Of the Miss Julies, the one that sticks in my mind is Ingmar Bergman's Swedish version that came to the 1986 Edinburgh festival. Bergman showed that this is a three-character play rather than an erotic pas de deux: that the valet's fianc\u00e9e, Kristin, is a vibrant, sensual rival to Miss Julie. Bergman also endowed this supposedly naturalistic tragedy with a rich scenic symbolism, conjuring a Swedish summer night with a violent access of dawn sunlight finally exposing the characters in all their flaws. </p> <p>Giorgio Strehler's Piccolo Teatro production of Storm - translated in English by Eivor Martinus as Thunder in the Air - similarly turned this late chamber play into a vividly realistic theatrical dream with a complex design and soundtrack. As the aged hero sat awaiting death in a prickly heat we saw fragments of his past life in subliminal lightning flashes. And one of the landmark Strindberg productions remains the National's 1967 Dance of Death: Olivier and Geraldine McEwan showed that this portrait of a doomed, disastrous 25-year-long marriage was shot through with wild, sardonic comedy. </p> <p>By the time Miss Julie opens in London I shall be en route for Adelaide where The Dance of Death is among the works on offer. It will be fascinating to see whether Australians find Strindberg funny. I wish that we could all range over the Strindberg canon and embrace the febrile contradictions of his work. Just as he seems a prototype modern man, in that his instincts were constantly at war with themselves, so his plays speak to us precisely because they offer a fierce contest of opposites. </p> <p>\u0095 Miss Julie opens at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London SW1 (0171-930 8800), tonight.</p>",

Elbaz has completed only two seasons of his three year contract with YSL, but it is assumed that Ford will buy him out. For why purchase one of the world's most prestigious labels if you can't design it yourself?</p> <p>At 64, Yves Saint Laurent is in frail health, but he still designs his haute couture collections twice a year. He is regarded as one of the greats: his mannish tuxedos, safari suits and blazers redefined the modern woman's wardrobe. Yet Elbaz was often seen to get the balance wrong. Last season, he was criticised for not being true to the label's original spirit.</p> <p>For autumn/winter 2000, Elbaz responded with a collection that was vintage YSL, reworked in autumn's favourite fabric, leather. Calf-length leather coats with high collars came belted at the waist, while lean leather dresses had full blouson sleeves and drop-waists. Saint Laurent's trademark pinstripe trouser suits were here, as were his voluminous, high-necked chiffon blouses and tailored pencil skirts.</p> <p>This was an elegant, sensual and refined collection, in sophisticated colours such as cream, gold, russet and black. But it won't be enough to stop the onslaught of the Gucci machine. In the front row at the show was a relaxed Ford, tanned and in an expensive cashmere coat, waving to friends.</p> <p>The question is: will Ford continue to head Gucci as well as take over at YSL? With the twice-yearly fashion schedule becoming tighter, it is a tall order for anyone to design four collections a year. Designers including Stella McCartney, Jeremy Scott and Hedi Slimane have been in talks with Ford recently, but speculation surrounds the nature of their liaisons. The man who hasn't made a wrong move yet is making no rash decisions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A web of intrigue surrounded yesterday's Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche presentation at Paris fashion week, where the gossip was as compelling as the clothes. Since Tom Ford, the creative director of Gucci, took control of Saint Laurent on January 1, the fashion world has been placing bets on when YSL's head designer, Alber Elbaz, would be dethroned. Elbaz has completed only two seasons of his three year contract with YSL, but it is assumed that Ford will buy him out. For why purchase one of the world's most prestigious labels if you can't design it yourself? At 64, Yves Saint Laurent is in frail health, but he still designs his haute couture collections twice a year. He is regarded as one of the greats: his mannish tuxedos, safari suits and blazers redefined the modern woman's wardrobe. Yet Elbaz was often seen to get the balance wrong. Last season, he was criticised for not being true to the label's original spirit. For autumn/winter 2000, Elbaz responded with a collection that was vintage YSL, reworked in autumn's favourite fabric, leather. Calf-length leather coats with high collars came belted at the waist, while lean leather dresses had full blouson sleeves and drop-waists. Saint Laurent's trademark pinstripe trouser suits were here, as were his voluminous, high-necked chiffon blouses and tailored pencil skirts. This was an elegant, sensual and refined collection, in sophisticated colours such as cream, gold, russet and black. But it won't be enough to stop the onslaught of the Gucci machine. In the front row at the show was a relaxed Ford, tanned and in an expensive cashmere coat, waving to friends. The question is: will Ford continue to head Gucci as well as take over at YSL? With the twice-yearly fashion schedule becoming tighter, it is a tall order for anyone to design four collections a year. Designers including Stella McCartney, Jeremy Scott and Hedi Slimane have been in talks with Ford recently, but speculation surrounds the nature of their liaisons. The man who hasn't made a wrong move yet is making no rash decisions.",

His team first tried attacking tumours by injecting cancer antigens - which stimulate the production of antibodies - into mice and capturing the immune antibodies produced by the animals. However, mouse antibodies were not powerful enough, so Dr Tan decided to try sheep.

Analysts believe that by licensing these on to other drug development firms the company could be making profits of \u00a3100m within 10 years. </p> <p>Dr Tan says: \"It will be business to business. We've no ambition to be in drugs sales ourselves - there are plenty of good, good companies out there who can distribute our drugs to doctors.\" </p> <p>From the start KS had a frugal culture. Despite his paper wealth, Dr Tan is on a salary of \u00a370,000 and, like his fellow directors, has no company car or corporate pension scheme. </p> <p>He says: \"When we came to the market, the model for drug development companies really was British Biotech - expansive offices, expensive sales forces and all the rest of it. </p> <p>\"We set our stall out, saying we believe that when we raise funds we want to use the money to fund science rather than directors' lifestyles.\" </p> <p>His lifestyle is modest - he still drives an eight-year-old Volkswagen Golf. </p> <p>In its first five years on the market, KS raised just \u00a310m. Then yesterday the company placed another 2.27m shares to boost its bank balance by \u00a315.4m. </p> <p>The company employs just 20 people, with offices in Guildford and laboratories in Farnborough. Much of its development work is contracted out to third parties. </p> <p>Dr Tan has business in his blood - his father runs a food wholesale business distributing rice and sugar throughout Malaysia. </p> <p>\"My father came to Malaysia [from China] aged 18 with nothing.

The microfilmed document was then sent to Havana, to be published in July 1968 both locally and by Ramparts magazine in the United States.</p> <p>The publication was seen as a political coup for Fidel Castro, and a disaster for Barrientos, who declared a state of emergency and closed down the Bolivian Congress. Arguedas also ensured that Guevara's death mask and his severed hands, cut off by the Bolivian military for identification purposes, were dispatched to Havana in the same way.</p> <p>When it transpired that the published diary had a number of pages missing, Ricardo Aneiba told Arguedas: \"I think it was you who sent the diary to Cuba.

But there are three problems with this argument: his diagnosis as a psychopath, a disorder which half the psychiatric profession believe is untreatable; earlier rulings by the courts which have established that a mental illness does not automatically preclude a prisoner from taking his own decisions on medical treatment; and the sanity of his own plan.

Sarah Martin, who cleaned up at the ABI's oscars last year by winning the accolade of \"Investigator of the Year\", has completed both the NVQs and the IPI courses and freely admits she is something of a training junky. </p> <p>\"The work we do can be extremely stressful,\" she says. \"We deal with everything from debt to death, and the results of our investigations can send people to prison, make them divorce, bankrupt them, lose them their job and deprive them of custody of their children. We owe it to our clients to make sure that the job is done properly and that we don't make any errors which could jeopardise any court proceedings.\" </p> <p>Martin believes training should concentrate on an understanding of the legal processes in which the investigator is liable to be involved. She is big on continuity of evidence and often attends conferences to update herself on changes in the law. </p> <p>If this sounds fearfully dull for those who were looking for more cloak and dagger action, there is plenty of that to be had, too. Private investigators are often called upon to do surveillance work, though, as Martin will tell you, that can pall after eight hours hiding out in a bush waiting for a suspect to appear. </p> <p>If that doesn't excite you, try this.

It's the scientific manipulation of the soft tissues for a curative effect, one of the oldest forms of healing. Hippocrates... </p> <p> <strong> Ow!

Specialities include neuro, muscular, connective tissue, shiatsu, aromatherapy, Indian head, and facial. </p> <p> <strong> OK! What would I need to learn?</strong> Apart from being able to use your hands skilfully, a good knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Masseurs use their weight to knead and rub the body, and they need to be strong, physically. </p> <p>Any courses in massage will include biology and anatomy. You will also need a knowledge of hygiene, safety precautions, first aid and general health care. Only then can the therapist appreciate the value of massage on the body's systems in, for instance, aiding circulation, respiration and digestion. And only then will the therapist know the situations in which massage is definitely not advisable. </p> <p>Finally, you will need to understand, and conform to, a code of ethics. </p> <p> <strong> Count me in. Where do I get this? </strong> Courses are available for those wanting a general introduction and for those who want to reach a professional level. Massage can only be picked up by a training that offers meticulous instruction and individual guidance. </p> <p> <strong> Ay, there's the rub - Ouch!

Are there other varieties? Yes. Specialities include neuro, muscular, connective tissue, shiatsu, aromatherapy, Indian head, and facial. OK! What would I need to learn? Apart from being able to use your hands skilfully, a good knowledge of anatomy and physiology. Masseurs use their weight to knead and rub the body, and they need to be strong, physically. Any courses in massage will include biology and anatomy. You will also need a knowledge of hygiene, safety precautions, first aid and general health care. Only then can the therapist appreciate the value of massage on the body's systems in, for instance, aiding circulation, respiration and digestion. And only then will the therapist know the situations in which massage is definitely not advisable. Finally, you will need to understand, and conform to, a code of ethics. Count me in. Where do I get this? Courses are available for those wanting a general introduction and for those who want to reach a professional level. Massage can only be picked up by a training that offers meticulous instruction and individual guidance. Ay, there's the rub - Ouch! Are there letters to be had? Some diploma courses are approved, by the Institute of Complementary Medicine, for instance. Successful students who fulfil all ICM criteria can register with the British Register for Complementary Practitioners. The Association of Reflexology is another recognising body that accredits courses.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is a myth abroad that language graduates find it hard to get jobs. It is not only pervasive among the general public, but even among many in the language-teaching world. And it is driving potential students of languages away from A-level in the 6th form and away from degree courses in universities.</p> <p>In fact, however, it is simply untrue. Language graduates are not more likely to be unemployed than specialists in other subjects. Research I have done over recent years has established beyond doubt that, statistically, year after year, language graduates have lower rates of unemployment than graduates in the great majority of other subjects. </p> <p>Their rates, for example, are consistently lower than for engineering, business studies, psychology, even computing studies, much lower than for the humanities, and the biological and social sciences. Only graduates in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science, law and education have lower employment rates than those in, say, French and German. </p> <p>The Oxford linguist who complained to the Guardian that nobody on his course had found a job within six months deserves sympathy, but is certainly not typical. Linguists do very well in the competition for jobs in the graduate employment market. The figures (below) speak for themselves. </p> <p>A further myth, discouraging to many, says that the only jobs for language graduates are teaching and translating. Again, the facts prove this to be wrong - monumentally wrong.

      "bodyText": "There is a myth abroad that language graduates find it hard to get jobs. It is not only pervasive among the general public, but even among many in the language-teaching world. And it is driving potential students of languages away from A-level in the 6th form and away from degree courses in universities. In fact, however, it is simply untrue. Language graduates are not more likely to be unemployed than specialists in other subjects. Research I have done over recent years has established beyond doubt that, statistically, year after year, language graduates have lower rates of unemployment than graduates in the great majority of other subjects. Their rates, for example, are consistently lower than for engineering, business studies, psychology, even computing studies, much lower than for the humanities, and the biological and social sciences. Only graduates in medicine, dentistry, veterinary science, law and education have lower employment rates than those in, say, French and German. The Oxford linguist who complained to the Guardian that nobody on his course had found a job within six months deserves sympathy, but is certainly not typical. Linguists do very well in the competition for jobs in the graduate employment market. The figures (below) speak for themselves. A further myth, discouraging to many, says that the only jobs for language graduates are teaching and translating. Again, the facts prove this to be wrong - monumentally wrong. First-destination statistics from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) show that for those who go directly into employment, only a tiny proportion (about 1%) become translators and only 5% go into education - many teaching English as a foreign language. Many language graduates, like those in most university subjects, go on to further training, including a Postgraduate Certificate in Education.

The problem is that all those houses seem so much more expensive than the rest. </p> <p><strong> The expert view</strong></p> <p>\"One of the curious side effects of school league tables is their benefit to estate agents rather than to parents trying to educate their children. League tables of exam results were introduced by the Conservatives as a way of making schools more accountable. The idea was that parents would be able to see at a glance which were the good and bad schools in their area. </p> <p>In fact, they tell you far more about the quality of the intake. Research at King's College, London showed how certain parents played the education market far more effectively than others and schools began to polarise. More recent research at Exeter University has shown that a school's performance has more to do with the postcode of the children attending than almost any other factor. This also means that good results can disguise a school that is coasting. </p> <p>A better way of understanding the actual quality of education in the school is to find their value added rating. The fact that one school has 60% of pupils getting five A*-C grades doesn't make it better than one getting 39%. Research by the Institute of Education and Edinburgh University also shows the greater the mix of intake, the more all pupils benefit. </p> <p>Both these studies indicate that, provided around a third of the pupils are well motivated, all pupils will do well. </p> <p>The problem with value added tables is that they do little to help the schools that still have a very difficult intake, even if they are doing well by those pupils - parents are, understandably, reluctant to send their children there. Nor do they provide much incentive for high-flying schools to alter their entrance policy as exam results are still the main currency by which schools are judged. </p> <p>We do need a much broader measure of schools' performance if we are to stop the polarisation caused by league tables and to start to give all parents a genuine choice of good schools. </p> <p>In the meantime, what are parents to do? It is essential to visit schools and capture the atmosphere for yourself. Meeting the teachers and the head should give you a sense of a school's ethos and, if at all possible, go during the school day rather than just a parents' evening.\" </p> <p><strong>Bethan Marshall's tip</strong> </p> <p>\"Lesson breaks are especially revealing. Do pupils respond to their teachers with friendly formality as they come out of lessons and in the corridors? Noise and jostling are normal but worry if there are signs of aggression. And remember, although your child is now a sweet 11-year-old, he or she will soon turn into one of those huge, shambling adolescents who look so alarming en masse in corridors.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Bethan Marshall is a lecturer in education at King's College, London and a former classroom teacher.</p> <p><strong> Next week's query</strong> </p> <p>My seven-year-old is getting anxious about SATs. I have tried to reassure him that it is not the end of the world but he still seems to be feeling the pressure. What do I do?</p>",

      "bodyText": "This week's query I am about to move house and I have a child in year 6. Should I only be looking at places where the catchment area is good? The problem is that all those houses seem so much more expensive than the rest. The expert view \"One of the curious side effects of school league tables is their benefit to estate agents rather than to parents trying to educate their children. League tables of exam results were introduced by the Conservatives as a way of making schools more accountable. The idea was that parents would be able to see at a glance which were the good and bad schools in their area. In fact, they tell you far more about the quality of the intake. Research at King's College, London showed how certain parents played the education market far more effectively than others and schools began to polarise. More recent research at Exeter University has shown that a school's performance has more to do with the postcode of the children attending than almost any other factor. This also means that good results can disguise a school that is coasting. A better way of understanding the actual quality of education in the school is to find their value added rating. The fact that one school has 60% of pupils getting five A*-C grades doesn't make it better than one getting 39%. Research by the Institute of Education and Edinburgh University also shows the greater the mix of intake, the more all pupils benefit. Both these studies indicate that, provided around a third of the pupils are well motivated, all pupils will do well. The problem with value added tables is that they do little to help the schools that still have a very difficult intake, even if they are doing well by those pupils - parents are, understandably, reluctant to send their children there. Nor do they provide much incentive for high-flying schools to alter their entrance policy as exam results are still the main currency by which schools are judged. We do need a much broader measure of schools' performance if we are to stop the polarisation caused by league tables and to start to give all parents a genuine choice of good schools. In the meantime, what are parents to do? It is essential to visit schools and capture the atmosphere for yourself. Meeting the teachers and the head should give you a sense of a school's ethos and, if at all possible, go during the school day rather than just a parents' evening.\" Bethan Marshall's tip \"Lesson breaks are especially revealing. Do pupils respond to their teachers with friendly formality as they come out of lessons and in the corridors? Noise and jostling are normal but worry if there are signs of aggression. And remember, although your child is now a sweet 11-year-old, he or she will soon turn into one of those huge, shambling adolescents who look so alarming en masse in corridors.\" \u0095 Bethan Marshall is a lecturer in education at King's College, London and a former classroom teacher. Next week's query My seven-year-old is getting anxious about SATs. I have tried to reassure him that it is not the end of the world but he still seems to be feeling the pressure. What do I do?",

      "body": "<p>Liza Austin-Strange is hurriedly downing micro-waved curry, closely followed by yoghurt. Conventional teaching is over for the day, but she has a long evening ahead. Twice a week, she's here until 8pm to pass on expert instruction to the enthusiastic clog dancers of Banks Lane Juniors. </p> <p>We are in Stockport, which is part of Greater Manchester in modern, local government terms. In terms of folk tradition, it's very much part of Lancashire, once a hotbed of clog-dancing - its competitive, masculine traditions immortalised by Bill Tidy's late-lamented strip cartoon in Private Eye. Lancashire \"cloggies\" danced on everything from canal barges to the stages of music halls. Styles varied according to location. </p> <p>The children of Banks Lane can do any number of styles, plus a few more dances with less localised pedigree. Almost a quarter of the 400 pupils take part, giving up lunchtimes and evenings to hone their skills. They perform at folk festivals from Sidmouth to Whitby. They've given demonstrations in France and Sweden. They have been captured on video and CD, and they were recently visited by barefoot dancers from The Mighty Zulu Nation. \"The Zulus were fascinated by the clogs and surprised how skilled the children were,\" says Austin-Strange. </p> <p>Collectively, her troupe are known as Fosbrooks after one Jack Fosbrook, a fleet-footed stalwart of Stockport who, rather reluctantly, trained women dancers in the 1920s. The first world war had left the town somewhat short of men. Fosbrook might have been surprised to learn that the vast majority of those who have carried his name into the 21st century are female. \"My brother found it hard,\" confides Samantha Cheetham, 11, one of several girls who has moved on to the local comprehensive but still comes back to clatter her clogs in the Banks Lane gym on Monday and Thursday evenings. \"I don't think boys have the same co-ordination.\" </p> <p>Austin-Strange is more diplomatic. \"I could have as many boys as girls if I ran a separate, male-only class,\" she says. \"But there aren't enough hours in the week.\" </p> <p>As it is, there are three or four brave lads out there hammering the parquet floor with around 70 girls. The noise is deafening, but the discipline and co-ordination hugely impressive. Even more so when you consider that some of these youngsters are beginners. \"We usually start them at seven because it's quite rigorous for the little ones,\" says Austin-Strange, before clambering between the straps of an accordion. </p> <p>\"Not everybody has the capability,\" she goes on, \"but every child gets the chance to learn to read music at an early stage. Many of them can sight-read to sing in our community choir or to play the violin for the dancing. I never say to them 'you're no good; give it up'. Eventually, the strugglers tend to drop out. I've just had a letter written 'with great sorrow' from the mother of a year-five girl who's giving up after struggling for three years. Our parents are very supportive. They want their kids to be part of this.\" </p> <p>And many of the children take to it as though they've been born with clogs on. Take Nicola Lyons, 11, who started younger than most and can now perform the most extraordinary steps while playing the fiddle at the same time. It's almost as though she's suspended by strings. Her socks are a white blur and her heels click together six inches or so above the ground. Afterwards, she tells me: \"It's quite easy when you get used to it.\" And when I look sceptical, she admits that \"it does take a lot of practice\". She's had new clogs for Christmas. \"You have to wear them in,\" she says. \"The leather can be dead hard at first.\" </p> <p>While Nicola's performing, headteacher Jane Caygill points out the rapt expressions of the children watching. \"There's no jealousy or rancour there,\" she observes. She took over the school two years ago, by which time the clog-dancing tradition had been established for two decades. \"Wasn't I a lucky bunny,\" she says. How so? </p> <p>\"Well, the children are so confident. They have a responsible attitude and discipline, wonderful qualities that underline good education.\" </p> <p>Certainly, Austin-Strange doesn't allow any messing about. She tolerates a lot of clatter but little idle chatter. A teacher here for over 20 years, she was a pupil back in the 1950s. \"I loved the country dancing and the music and movement,\" she recalls. \"I have vivid memories of rushing in and out of circles one minute and pretending to be a tree the next.\" In later life, she acquired a morris-dancing brother-in-law who made clogs - stimulus enough for her to take up dancing herself and begin researching the area's clogging traditions. \"What I do here just evolved from that,\" she says. </p> <p>Fosbrooks' national reputation in the world of traditional dance seems likely to keep on evolving for another 10 years. But by that time, the woman whose dedication makes it happen will be approaching retirement age. \"Somewhere along the line it'll carry on,\" she says. \"They'll just have to advertise for a teacher and say 'a knowledge of clog-dancing would be an asset'. \"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Liza Austin-Strange is hurriedly downing micro-waved curry, closely followed by yoghurt. Conventional teaching is over for the day, but she has a long evening ahead. Twice a week, she's here until 8pm to pass on expert instruction to the enthusiastic clog dancers of Banks Lane Juniors. We are in Stockport, which is part of Greater Manchester in modern, local government terms. In terms of folk tradition, it's very much part of Lancashire, once a hotbed of clog-dancing - its competitive, masculine traditions immortalised by Bill Tidy's late-lamented strip cartoon in Private Eye. Lancashire \"cloggies\" danced on everything from canal barges to the stages of music halls. Styles varied according to location. The children of Banks Lane can do any number of styles, plus a few more dances with less localised pedigree. Almost a quarter of the 400 pupils take part, giving up lunchtimes and evenings to hone their skills. They perform at folk festivals from Sidmouth to Whitby. They've given demonstrations in France and Sweden. They have been captured on video and CD, and they were recently visited by barefoot dancers from The Mighty Zulu Nation. \"The Zulus were fascinated by the clogs and surprised how skilled the children were,\" says Austin-Strange. Collectively, her troupe are known as Fosbrooks after one Jack Fosbrook, a fleet-footed stalwart of Stockport who, rather reluctantly, trained women dancers in the 1920s. The first world war had left the town somewhat short of men. Fosbrook might have been surprised to learn that the vast majority of those who have carried his name into the 21st century are female. \"My brother found it hard,\" confides Samantha Cheetham, 11, one of several girls who has moved on to the local comprehensive but still comes back to clatter her clogs in the Banks Lane gym on Monday and Thursday evenings. \"I don't think boys have the same co-ordination.\" Austin-Strange is more diplomatic. \"I could have as many boys as girls if I ran a separate, male-only class,\" she says. \"But there aren't enough hours in the week.\" As it is, there are three or four brave lads out there hammering the parquet floor with around 70 girls. The noise is deafening, but the discipline and co-ordination hugely impressive. Even more so when you consider that some of these youngsters are beginners. \"We usually start them at seven because it's quite rigorous for the little ones,\" says Austin-Strange, before clambering between the straps of an accordion. \"Not everybody has the capability,\" she goes on, \"but every child gets the chance to learn to read music at an early stage. Many of them can sight-read to sing in our community choir or to play the violin for the dancing. I never say to them 'you're no good; give it up'. Eventually, the strugglers tend to drop out. I've just had a letter written 'with great sorrow' from the mother of a year-five girl who's giving up after struggling for three years. Our parents are very supportive. They want their kids to be part of this.\" And many of the children take to it as though they've been born with clogs on. Take Nicola Lyons, 11, who started younger than most and can now perform the most extraordinary steps while playing the fiddle at the same time. It's almost as though she's suspended by strings. Her socks are a white blur and her heels click together six inches or so above the ground. Afterwards, she tells me: \"It's quite easy when you get used to it.\" And when I look sceptical, she admits that \"it does take a lot of practice\". She's had new clogs for Christmas. \"You have to wear them in,\" she says. \"The leather can be dead hard at first.\" While Nicola's performing, headteacher Jane Caygill points out the rapt expressions of the children watching. \"There's no jealousy or rancour there,\" she observes. She took over the school two years ago, by which time the clog-dancing tradition had been established for two decades. \"Wasn't I a lucky bunny,\" she says. How so? \"Well, the children are so confident. They have a responsible attitude and discipline, wonderful qualities that underline good education.\" Certainly, Austin-Strange doesn't allow any messing about. She tolerates a lot of clatter but little idle chatter. A teacher here for over 20 years, she was a pupil back in the 1950s. \"I loved the country dancing and the music and movement,\" she recalls. \"I have vivid memories of rushing in and out of circles one minute and pretending to be a tree the next.\" In later life, she acquired a morris-dancing brother-in-law who made clogs - stimulus enough for her to take up dancing herself and begin researching the area's clogging traditions. \"What I do here just evolved from that,\" she says. Fosbrooks' national reputation in the world of traditional dance seems likely to keep on evolving for another 10 years. But by that time, the woman whose dedication makes it happen will be approaching retirement age. \"Somewhere along the line it'll carry on,\" she says. \"They'll just have to advertise for a teacher and say 'a knowledge of clog-dancing would be an asset'. \"",

      "body": "<p>At first, when seven-year-old pupil Stefanie Stewart came home from school saying another child had \"strangled\" her, her parents took it with a pinch of salt. \"I asked Stefanie to show me what had happened, and she put her hands round her neck and pressed on her Adam's apple,\" says her father, Des Stewart. \"Then I realised maybe she wasn't exaggerating.\"</p> <p>Stewart, a director of a golfing company, and his wife Lorna, an account manager for a high-street bank, telephoned the school, King's Lodge primary in Chippenham, Wiltshire, and arranged a meeting with the head, Jane Ratcliff, and Stefanie's class teacher. The Stewarts left happy that the matter would be resolved and that there would be no more incidents. </p> <p>That was several months, and many more alleged incidents and meetings, ago. At the beginning of this term, the school offered Stefanie a daily, 10-minute \"quiet time\" when she could talk to a teacher \"to build her confidence in dealing with any conflicts that arose\", Ratcliff says. The Stewarts considered this entirely inappropriate. They referred the case to the Secretary of State for Education, who failed to intervene by the deadline set by the lawyer. The Stewarts will now apply for a judicial review. </p> <p>Ratcliff says she has dealt with the matter in line with her school's behaviour policy. \"There have been lots of meetings, and I have offered Mr Stewart more since the beginning of January, but he has chosen not to take that up.\" Last summer, Ofsted inspectors rated relationships in the school as very good and behaviour as good. Improvements to the bullying policy were implemented in September, and published in January. </p> <p>Physical attacks on Stefanie have stopped, although Stewart claims she is still being verbally abused. Ten days ago, 13-year-old Amie Salmon was withdrawn from Glaisdale School in Nottingham because her mother believed it was failing to deal with bullies. Have the Stewarts thought of removing Stefanie? </p> <p>\"We did discuss that with her as a last resort,\" says Stewart, who has been happy with his daughter's educational progress at the King's Lodge. \"She said: 'Why should I leave when I haven't done anything wrong?' \" </p> <p>Disagreements between parents and schools over what used to be called discipline, and is now called \"behaviour management\", happen in all schools. But what can parents expect of schools, and vice-versa? These are questions the government is keen to address. Schools are required to draw up home-school agreements and publish their policies on bullying and behaviour management. Some \u00a3500m is being invested over three years in schemes to cut exclusion rates (12,300 permanent cases in 1998) and truancy. </p> <p>Many teachers have received little training in behaviour management, although a review of the curriculum is under way. </p> <p>It may comfort teachers that parents whose children are persistent truants will have to pay higher fines, up to \u00a32,500 per parent, and that \"reasonable force\" may now be used to restrain pupils. There are policies galore. They are worthless, however, if everyone doesn't benefit from them. Schools must have a clear idea of how to do this and, crucially, of how parents can cooperate. Many do, and old methods - parents notified that a child has spent playtime outside the head's office, or a simple system of \"black\" and \"merit\" marks\" - prevail. But schools at the cutting edge may use more sophisticated programmes, in which buzzwords raise self-esteem and help children help themselves. </p> <p>High exclusion rates, graffiti, stressed teachers are all signs of a school with behaviour problems. All are familiar to John Bayley, a former teacher who is now a trainer in assertive discipline, brainchild of the American psychologist Lee Kanter. For pupils and parents, it offers a system of progressive warnings, sanctions and rewards. Children know exactly where their bad behaviour is going to lead them, and can draw back. Letters may be sent home to parents, praising good behaviour as well as condemning bad. Schools adapt the framework - in some the children are involved, expressing views on which sanctions and rewards work. </p> <p>For teachers, it stresses positive thinking, says Bayley: \"Instead of telling them what not to do - 'Will you shut up' - you say: 'I'd like your mouths shut, I'd like your hands on your desk, I'd like you facing this way, thank you very much.' \" </p> <p>For the school as a whole, consistency is a key factor, from playground supervisors to the head. Basic training is one all-day session plus two twilight sessions, costing from \u00a32,800. \"But you have to leave a team behind to steer the programme and review it,\" says Bayley. \"It's not an instant solution, more like painting the Forth Bridge.\" </p> <p>It is Circle Time at Eagle House, an independent prep school in Berkshire. This is a far cry from the schools in which Bayley works, but its approach to behaviour management has common themes: accentuating the positive and involving parents. A group of 10- and 11-year-olds is sitting in a circle, discussing a class rule. \"Treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself.\" One girl expresses difficulty with that. \"What does it feel like if somebody is unkind to you? How does it feel inside?\" a classmate asks her. \"Well, it's horrible,\" the girl replies. \"What you are doing is inflicting that on somebody else. Have you thought about that?\" says another. </p> <p>\"What you need to do,\" someone else chips in, \"is count to 10 and walk away before you start to say something that you know is unpleasant.\" The girl agrees to try. </p> <p>Even four-year-olds have Circle Time every week, taking it in turns to speak up about anything bothering them. \"Younger children come to school more isolated than ever because they no longer play on the street in groups,\" says Diane Gardiner, head of pre-prep at Eagle House. \"They can be quite self-centred, so you have to help them learn to be part of a group. That is a new thing that schools are having to deal with. If a four-year-old is having difficulty sitting in a circle, you congratulate those sitting comfortably and the others will follow suit. We involve the parents in everything, and if issues arise out of Circle Time, such as bullying, we bring them in. If parents feel part of the process, they are less likely to be aggressive. We might get them involved by a system of stars and stickers for their child getting dressed in the morning, or being nice to other children.\" </p> <p>Jenny Mosley, founder of Circle Time, works with schools at all levels in the public and private sector. The mother of three teenagers, she advises against showing disloyalty to the teacher. \"If you immediately say, 'That bloody teacher', you are causing an emotional split for your child.\" So what is the right approach for parents of children in hot water? Dorit Braun of Parentline Plus, a charity that offers support to parents and which has produced a new leaflet, Families Working With Schools, says the important thing is to listen to your child without taking sides, discuss issues that arise with the teacher, and come up jointly with a solution. </p> <p>Most parents want to put things right. To do that they must work with the school, not against it, but they can only do this if they understand the school's approach. \"It is perfectly reasonable for schools to expect parents to support their work,\" says Braun. \"But unless the school communicates what it is trying to achieve, a partnership can't develop.\"</p> <p><strong>Tips for parents</strong></p> <p>\u0095 When visiting a prospective school, look out for simple class rules that emphasise do's rather than don'ts, and noticeboards that indicate how much communication is going on between home and school. </p> <p>\u0095 Ask to see the home-school agreement and behaviour policy, which should include a clear strategy on dealing with bullies. </p> <p>\u0095 Speak to other parents to see whether they are happy with the procedures for discussing problems. </p> <p>\u0095 Once your child is at school, try to attend some social events as well as parent evenings. Feeling part of the school will help if something goes wrong. </p> <p>\u0095 When a problem arises, listen to your child, but try to reserve judgment. If you are unhappy, ask to speak to the class teacher, or head of year at secondary level, and take someone along if you feel anxious. Stay calm. </p> <p>\u0095 Before the meeting, clarify your points and the outcome you would like. Use wording from the home-school agreement, such as: \"I feel Sam's self-esteem is suffering because of this.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Work out a strategy with the teacher for dealing with the problem, and back it up at home. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are not satisfied, ask to see the head.

He gets a glowing half-term report for improving standards, as promised by Tony Blair when he made education a priority in his election manifesto. </p> <p>Nine out of 10 parents with children at state schools say they are happy with the quality of education, and seven out of 10 think Blunkett is doing a good job. </p> <p>These ratings give the lie to suggestions that the middle classes are despairing of the standard of state education. Even much-maligned inner-city secondary schools get a satisfaction rating of 89%. </p> <p>But scratching below the surface, a series of focus groups run for us by ICM to supplement the poll finds parents are becoming nervous about the increasing pace and pressure of education, particularly at nursery and primary stages. </p> <p>Mothers and fathers were anxious that the regime of homework, testing and league tables was taking something precious away from their children, depriving them of the more relaxed childhood experience that they themselves had enjoyed. </p> <p>As Blunkett prepares the next stage of his standards crusade, he should pause to reflect that parental anxiety about childhood stress may be the backlash waiting to happen. </p> <p>The poll was based on interviews of 500 parents, 500 teachers and 100 university lecturers across England. Teachers and lecturers' views will be reported here next week. </p> <p>Blunkett will take comfort from his personal satisfaction rating, with 62% of parents saying he is doing a fairly good job and 7% saying very good, compared with 19% rating his performance as poor. </p> <p>This positive response stretched across every boundary of age, sex, gender, region and type of school. It is more pronounced in the inner cities, where parents might have been expected to be more anxious about reports of disadvantage. </p> <p>Some 91% said they were happy with the quality of their children's schooling. There was no difference in rating between primary and secondary education. In the inner cities the positive response was 96%. </p> <p>Blunkett will also celebrate results showing 96% of primary parents think he is right to give priority to literacy and numeracy, although 40% think the artistic and creative side is being neglected as a result. </p> <p>The majority of primary parents think their children's teachers are competent (54%) or highly competent (39%). Only 4% say the teachers are not very competent and 1% not at all competent - a more generous assessment than is usually given by Chris Woodhead, whose parental approval rating lags slightly behind Blunkett's. Asked about Woodhead's conduct of the inspection system, 12% of parents approve strongly and 45% slightly. </p> <p>These are strikingly good figures. Of course, parents tend to be more appreciative than voters in general when asked to rate their children's state schools, in the same way that patients comment more favourably about NHS hospitals when they have recently undergone treatment. But our sampling suggests the prime minister will continue to gain political mileage from beating his education drum. </p> <p>The poll gives ministers some areas for concern. Half the parents thought education standards had improved over the past 10 years, but only 38% saw improvement over the past two years, since Labour came to power. The implication is that standards rose under the Conservatives but stopped rising under Labour. </p> <p>When parents were asked about their own children's schools, 51% with children at the primary stage saw improvement over the past two years, compared with 40% at secondary. In both cases, only 7% thought standards had fallen, but the secondary parents were more likely to see no change. Blunkett's promise to give more attention to secondary education over the next few years may change this perception. </p> <p>He must also reflect on the policies he pinched from the Tories. His homework initiative is popular: a fifth of parents want it set for four-year-olds and a majority for six-year-olds. But there is scepticism about league tables and an even split of opinion on whether the government is too hard or too soft on teachers. </p> <p>League table results were a surprise. Although 58% of parents said they were helpful in understanding a school's performance, 39% said they were not. Four out of five parents (81%) said they had not used league tables to select their child's school, and 38% said they should be scrapped. The figures were almost identical for primary and secondary parents. Blunkett might regard these figures as a green light for change. </p> <p>Some 22% of parents said the government was too tough on teachers, 24% too soft and 38% about right. Middle-aged parents were more inclined to think ministers too soft, but the overall result suggests the government will not gain mileage from teacher-bashing. </p> <p>Concern about the harshness of the education system emerged more strongly from our focus groups, conducted on the fringes of Birmingham and London with a view to avoiding specifically inner-city or rural concerns. </p> <p>Primary parents were strongly motivated to do the best for their offspring, but worried about competitiveness among other parents. </p> <p>Ten years ago, \"children were still children. Now they grow up so quickly - they've got to,\" said a parent from Datchet, Berkshire. </p> <p>The group of six mothers and two fathers accepted the need for homework, but disliked it. One spoke of five-year-olds coming home with worksheets and three books a night. Others commented: \"Even the one in nursery comes back with homework on a Friday\", \"I don't want my five-year-old stressed out. School's a big enough step without pressure at an early age\", \"You don't expect little ones to dread going to school. It didn't occur to me to dread it.\" </p> <p>Home-school contracts were seen as ridiculous: \"How can you get a four-year-old to say: 'Yes I will go to school and I will not kick.' \" Punctuality rules were too strict: \"If the child's 30 seconds late through the door, they get a late slip. If they get seven late slips, the parent gets called in to see the head or social services.\" </p> <p>Asked about discipline problems in school, the parents did not mention indiscipline. Responses were: \"It's a bit strict\", \"My daughter thought I was going to prison because she was late for school.\" </p> <p>Despite these problems, the primary parents thought headteachers were more approachable than they used to be, and they were full of praise for teachers, speaking of them as committed, almost martyr-like figures who gave a lot. Teachers' pay was \"too low\". They got long holidays, \"but they earn it\". Teachers were more stressed and got less enjoyment from their jobs than previously. Asked to give a single word to describe the profession, the parents offered: \"brave\", \"impressive\", \"capable\", \"respect\", \"heroes\", \"underestimated\", \"martyrs\". </p> <p>Asked to describe the ideal primary school, they said it would be state-funded, with about 300 pupils in classes of 15. Each would have \"a teacher and a helper\", \"extra help for special needs children\", \"no SATs\" and \"all the equipment they needed\". Nobody thought that was likely to happen in 10 years, if ever. \"If anything, classes are going to get bigger and teachers' pay will get worse.\" </p> <p>Secondary parents were more positive about changes in the past 10 years. A group of four mothers and four fathers with children in Sutton Coldfield comprehensives said schools were \"more caring\" and pupils were \"treated as adults\", with more respect from teachers. </p> <p> They also talked about increased demands on children. \"There's more pressure on kids to deliver\", \"It's a bit of a shock to the system going into GCSEs and A levels.\" But the general view was that children had to cope with such pressures in the modern world. All said that they would rather be at school now than when they were teenagers. </p> <p>They were \"very pleased\" with the standard of teaching, but thought parents' evenings were a waste of time. \"You only get one or two minutes with each teacher in a large hall.\" </p> <p>Asked about the ideal secondary school, they said it should have smaller classes - 20 rather than 30. Some felt every child should be provided with a laptop computer. Others wanted better sports and technology facilities. Most said secondary schools needed to get better, but expectations of change by the government were minimal. </p> <p>Sutton Coldfield parents valued the information about local schools in Ofsted reports and thought that inspection was not disruptive. </p> <p>Most parents in the focus groups did not know who Blunkett was. Three of the eight secondary parents recalled that he was education secretary. The primary group did not recognise the name until one father recalled he was \"the MP who tried to get the manager of Sheffield Wednesday sacked\". That was a salutary reminder for Blunkett that he still needs to try harder.</p> <p>\u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 505 parents of primary and secondary schoolchildren, 501 primary and secondary schoolteachers and 101 university lecturers drawn from nationally representative samples.

Some 22% of parents said the government was too tough on teachers, 24% too soft and 38% about right. Middle-aged parents were more inclined to think ministers too soft, but the overall result suggests the government will not gain mileage from teacher-bashing. Concern about the harshness of the education system emerged more strongly from our focus groups, conducted on the fringes of Birmingham and London with a view to avoiding specifically inner-city or rural concerns. Primary parents were strongly motivated to do the best for their offspring, but worried about competitiveness among other parents. Ten years ago, \"children were still children. Now they grow up so quickly - they've got to,\" said a parent from Datchet, Berkshire. The group of six mothers and two fathers accepted the need for homework, but disliked it. One spoke of five-year-olds coming home with worksheets and three books a night. Others commented: \"Even the one in nursery comes back with homework on a Friday\", \"I don't want my five-year-old stressed out. School's a big enough step without pressure at an early age\", \"You don't expect little ones to dread going to school. It didn't occur to me to dread it.\" Home-school contracts were seen as ridiculous: \"How can you get a four-year-old to say: 'Yes I will go to school and I will not kick.' \" Punctuality rules were too strict: \"If the child's 30 seconds late through the door, they get a late slip. If they get seven late slips, the parent gets called in to see the head or social services.\" Asked about discipline problems in school, the parents did not mention indiscipline. Responses were: \"It's a bit strict\", \"My daughter thought I was going to prison because she was late for school.\" Despite these problems, the primary parents thought headteachers were more approachable than they used to be, and they were full of praise for teachers, speaking of them as committed, almost martyr-like figures who gave a lot. Teachers' pay was \"too low\". They got long holidays, \"but they earn it\". Teachers were more stressed and got less enjoyment from their jobs than previously. Asked to give a single word to describe the profession, the parents offered: \"brave\", \"impressive\", \"capable\", \"respect\", \"heroes\", \"underestimated\", \"martyrs\". Asked to describe the ideal primary school, they said it would be state-funded, with about 300 pupils in classes of 15. Each would have \"a teacher and a helper\", \"extra help for special needs children\", \"no SATs\" and \"all the equipment they needed\". Nobody thought that was likely to happen in 10 years, if ever. \"If anything, classes are going to get bigger and teachers' pay will get worse.\" Secondary parents were more positive about changes in the past 10 years. A group of four mothers and four fathers with children in Sutton Coldfield comprehensives said schools were \"more caring\" and pupils were \"treated as adults\", with more respect from teachers. They also talked about increased demands on children. \"There's more pressure on kids to deliver\", \"It's a bit of a shock to the system going into GCSEs and A levels.\" But the general view was that children had to cope with such pressures in the modern world. All said that they would rather be at school now than when they were teenagers. They were \"very pleased\" with the standard of teaching, but thought parents' evenings were a waste of time. \"You only get one or two minutes with each teacher in a large hall.\" Asked about the ideal secondary school, they said it should have smaller classes - 20 rather than 30. Some felt every child should be provided with a laptop computer. Others wanted better sports and technology facilities. Most said secondary schools needed to get better, but expectations of change by the government were minimal. Sutton Coldfield parents valued the information about local schools in Ofsted reports and thought that inspection was not disruptive. Most parents in the focus groups did not know who Blunkett was. Three of the eight secondary parents recalled that he was education secretary. The primary group did not recognise the name until one father recalled he was \"the MP who tried to get the manager of Sheffield Wednesday sacked\". That was a salutary reminder for Blunkett that he still needs to try harder. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 505 parents of primary and secondary schoolchildren, 501 primary and secondary schoolteachers and 101 university lecturers drawn from nationally representative samples. All interviewing was conducted by telephone from February 8-15 2000. Focus groups were conducted at Sunbury on Thames and Sutton Coldfield on February 15-16 2000. Next week: What the teachers think",

It creates a structure that's as quirkily original as it is satisfying. After his distinguished career as a conductor Eotvos's ear for what works in the orchestra is so instinctive - glinting toccatas for strings and percussion, an interlude with saxophones and bluesy muted trumpets, swirling tremolos right across the orchestra - that the images are totally compelling. </p> <p>There's no shortage of arresting material in Ligeti's violin concerto either. The five movements are concerned with musical uncertainty, whether of pitch (in the retuned strings that blur the solo violin's opening line, or the ocarinas and recorder that destabilise the wind tuning in the later movements) or of tempo, with fast music that sounds slow and vice versa. It's a violinistic piece, indebted to the great concerto literature, and as Christian Tetzlaff demonstrated, a showpiece for a player with the necessary technical equipment. </p> <p>The LSO made a brilliant showpiece out of Bartok's ballet too, though even Boulez could not disguise the fact that the later scenes are too protracted.

It does not make any difference whether the defendant is a pauper or a millionaire, whether it makes him bankrupt or puts him into liquidation.\" </p> <p>A claimant was entitled to have \"full compensation\" for losses caused by personal injury, Mr Purchas added. </p> <p>He said: \"We submit the reason why awards have fallen below the appropriate level is that no or insufficient allowances have been made for the change in economic circumstances and increases in living standards during the past 30 to 40 years.\" </p> <p>The other test case claimants include two children who suffer from cerebral palsy because their births were negligently managed, and Tracy Kent, who was left brain-damaged after an ambulance took too long to answer a 999 call.</p>",

Christopher Purchas QC, representing John Heil, one of the test case claimants, told the court at the start of the four-day hearing it was \"irrelevant\" that increases in damages would lead to much higher claims on insurance companies and the health service. Mr Heil, a former police officer, suffered from post traumatic stress disorder after an incident with an uninsured driver and is unemployed after taking medical retirement from the force. Mr Purchas said: \"The amount of compensation that a claimant is entitled to receive does not depend on the financial standing of the defendant. It does not make any difference whether the defendant is a pauper or a millionaire, whether it makes him bankrupt or puts him into liquidation.\" A claimant was entitled to have \"full compensation\" for losses caused by personal injury, Mr Purchas added. He said: \"We submit the reason why awards have fallen below the appropriate level is that no or insufficient allowances have been made for the change in economic circumstances and increases in living standards during the past 30 to 40 years.\" The other test case claimants include two children who suffer from cerebral palsy because their births were negligently managed, and Tracy Kent, who was left brain-damaged after an ambulance took too long to answer a 999 call.",

But this isn't, or shouldn't be, the major reason why they are to be avoided. The real reason is that the third way proposes a quite different approach to the achievement of social goals from the more tradi tional left. It is one no longer based on the splitting of social and economic policy into separate compartments. As Tony Blair has often pointed out, in the past the right has concerned itself with economic development, the left with social justice. But it won't do to consider either in separation from the other. </p> <p>Taxation is complex, especially in terms of its consequences for human behaviour. These consequences need to be weighed up when considering changes in tax politics. Such changes normally have effects upon economic activity and hence the overall health of the economy. They can sometimes lead to the opposite effects from those desired. One cannot assume, for example, that higher tax rates always result in higher tax revenues. </p> <p>It is a mistake for the left to concentrate too much upon high rates of income tax. Steeply graduated, income tax can act as a disincentive, penalising effort and hence job creation. It can also increase levels of tax evasion. Moreover research suggests that the overall level of the tax base, when combined with effective public spending, is more important for social justice than the progressiveness of tax. </p> <p> The Australian income tax system in the 1980's was very progressive, but the degree of economic inequality in the country was marked. The Swedish tax system, by contrast, had a lower degree of progressiveness, but generated higher relative tax revenue. The level of economic inequality in Sweden was well below that of Australia. </p> <p>The left must rid itself of the idea that social problems can be solved by increasing tax rates to the greatest extent possible. In some situations, tax cuts can make economic sense and contribute to social justice - as is true of the working families tax credit, introduced by the current government. According to studies done at the London School of Economics, combined with other measures the tax credit should lift 2m children out of poverty by the end of the first term of the Labour government. </p> <p>The left has traditionally assumed that if deficit spending is reduced public investment will have to decline, while poorer groups will be most adversely affected. Experience from the US in recent years shows that each of these assumptions, while seemingly obvious, is false. Combined with appropriate macroeconomic measures, deficit reduction can foster high labour market participation and economic expansion. Seeking to build up the tax base through fiscal policies that maximise employment possibilities is a fundamental emphasis of third way politics. </p> <p>It is one that has paid off. Political commentators seem amazed that the chancellor has at his disposal such a large public surplus. The critics seem wilfully to fail to see that this situation is the direct result of policies of fiscal discipline and capital investment, which have generated far more disposable income than would have been true if old left strategies had been adopted. It is not an accident that levels of payment of income tax, VAT and corporation tax are so high Economic progress and social justice can indeed go together. In preparing his budget for March 21, Mr Brown should not deviate from the path he has so ably charted in previous years. For instance, he should implement the planned reduction in the rate of income tax from 23% to 22%, not increase it. He should offer greater tax credits for small business start-ups, provide further incentives for the IT sector, and make further cuts in capital gains tax. Such innovations will help Tony Blair reach his stated objectives for health and education, not inhibit them. </p> <p> Anthony Giddens is director of the LSE.
